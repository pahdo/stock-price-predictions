Basis
 of presentation    

The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Royal Energy Resources, Inc. (the  Company 
or  Royal ) and its wholly owned subsidiaries Rhino GP LLC ( Rhino GP ), Blaze Minerals, LLC ( Blaze ),
a West Virginia limited liability company, and Blue Grove Coal, LLC ( Blue Grove ), a West Virginia limited liability
company, and its majority owned subsidiary Rhino Resource Partners, LP ( Rhino  or the  Partnership )(OTCQB:RHNO),
a Delaware limited partnership. Rhino GP is the general partner of Rhino. All significant intercompany balances and transactions
have been eliminated in consolidation.  

On
January 21, 2016, the board of directors of the Company elected to change the Company s fiscal year end to December 31,
from August 31. Accordingly, the Company filed a transition report on Form 10-Q containing unaudited financial statements for
the period from September 1, 2015 to December 31, 2015, together with comparative statements for the period from September 1,
2014 to December 31, 2014, in accordance with Rule 13a-10(c).  

Unaudited
Interim Financial Information   

The
accompanying unaudited interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
for interim financial information. The condensed consolidated statement of financial position as of September 30, 2016, condensed
consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015
and the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 include all adjustments
(consisting of normal recurring adjustments) which the Company considers necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position,
operating results and cash flows for the periods presented. The condensed consolidated statement of financial position as of December
31, 2015 was derived from unaudited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. ). These unaudited interim financial statements should be
read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report for
the year ended August 31, 2015 filed with the SEC on November 30, 2015.  

The
results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to
be expected for the entire year.  

Organization
and nature of business    

The
Company is a Delaware corporation which was incorporated on March 22, 1999, under the name Webmarketing, Inc. ( Webmarketing ).
On July 7, 2004, the Company revived its charter and changed its name from Webmarketing to World Marketing, Inc. In December 2007
the Company changed its name to Royal Energy Resources, Inc.  

From
2007 to 2015, the Company pursued gold, silver, copper and rare earth metal mining concessions in Romania and mining leases in
the United States. Commencing in January 2015, the Company began a series of transactions to sell all of its existing assets,
undergo a change in ownership control and management, and repurpose itself as a North American energy recovery company, planning
to purchase a group of synergistic, long-lived energy assets, by taking advantage of favorable valuations for mergers and acquisitions
in the current energy markets.  

In
April 2015, the Company executed an agreement for the first acquisition in furtherance of its change in principle operations,
under which it agreed to acquire Blaze for 2,803,621 shares of common stock. Blaze owns 40,976 net acres of coal and coalbed methane,
located across 22 counties in West Virginia. In June 2015, the Company completed the acquisition of Blue Grove.  

Blue
Grove is a licensed mine operator based in McDowell County, West Virginia and is currently under contract to operate a mine owned
by GS Energy, LLC.  

Rhino
was formed on April 19, 2010 to acquire Rhino Energy LLC (the  Operating Company ). The Operating Company and its
wholly owned subsidiaries produce and market coal from surface and underground mines in Illinois, Kentucky, Ohio, West Virginia,
and Utah. The majority of sales are made to domestic utilities and other coal-related organizations in the United States.  

On
April 18, 2016, the Partnership completed a 1-for-10 reverse split on its common units and subordinated units. Pursuant to the
reverse split, common unitholders received one common unit for every 10 common units owned on April 18, 2016 and subordinated
unitholders received one subordinated unit for every 10 subordinated units owned on April 18, 2016. Any fractional units resulting
from the reverse unit split were rounded to the nearest whole unit. The reverse unit split was intended to increase the market
price per unit of Rhino s common units in order to comply with the New York Stock Exchange s ( NYSE )
continued listing standards. All references to common or subordinated units of the Partnership herein are on a post-split basis.  

On
January 21, 2016, a definitive agreement ( Definitive Agreement ) was completed between Royal and Wexford Capital
LP and certain of its affiliates (collectively,  Wexford ) whereby Royal acquired 676,912 issued and outstanding common
units of the Partnership previously owned by Wexford for $3.5 million. The Definitive Agreement also included a commitment by
Royal to acquire within sixty days from the date of the Definitive Agreement all of the issued and outstanding membership interests
of Rhino GP, the general partner of the Partnership, as well as 945,526 issued and outstanding subordinated units of the Partnership
owned by Wexford for $1.0 million.  

On
March 17, 2016, Royal completed the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding membership interests of Rhino GP, as well
as 945,526 issued and outstanding subordinated units from Wexford. Royal obtained control of, and a majority limited partner interest,
in the Partnership with the completion of this transaction.  

On
March 21, 2016, Royal and Rhino entered into a securities purchase agreement (the  Securities Purchase Agreement )
pursuant to which Rhino issued 6,000,000 common units in the Partnership to Royal in a private placement at $1.50 per common unit
for an aggregate purchase price of $9.0 million. Royal paid Rhino $2.0 million in cash and delivered a promissory note payable
to Rhino in the amount of $7.0 million. The promissory note is payable in three installments: (i) $3.0 million on July 31, 2016;
(ii) $2.0 million on or before September 30, 2016 and (iii) $2.0 million on or before December 31, 2016. On May 13, 2016, the
Company paid the $3,000,000 installment which was due July 31, 2016. On September 30, 2016, the Company paid the $2.0 million
installment that was due September 30, 2016.  

In the event the disinterested
members of the board of directors of the General Partner determine that the Partnership does not need the capital that would be
provided by either or both installments set forth in (ii) and (iii) above, in each case, the Partnership has the option to rescind
Royal s purchase of 1,333,334 common units and the applicable installment will not be payable (each, a  Rescission
Right ). If the Partnership fails to exercise a Rescission Right, in each case, the Partnership has the option to repurchase
1,333,334 common units at $3.00 per common unit from Royal (each, a  Repurchase Option ). The Repurchase Options terminate
on December 31, 2017. Royal s obligation to pay any installment of the promissory note is subject to certain conditions,
including that the Operating Company has entered into an agreement to extend the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, as amended
(the  Credit Facility ), to a date no sooner than December 31, 2017. In the event such conditions are not satisfied
as of the date each installment is due, Royal has the right to cancel the remaining unpaid balance of the promissory note in exchange
for the surrender of such number of common units equal to the principal balance cancelled divided by $1.50. 

2       SUMMARY
OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND GENERAL   

Recently
Issued Accounting Standards.   In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting
Standards Update ( ASU ) 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers  ( ASU 2014-09 ).
ASU 2014-09 clarifies the principles for recognizing revenue and establishes a common revenue standard for U.S. financial reporting
purposes. The guidance in ASU 2014-09 affects any entity that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or
services or enters into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets unless those contracts are within the scope of other
standards (for example, insurance contracts or lease contracts). ASU 2014-09 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in
Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 605,  Revenue Recognition , and most industry-specific accounting guidance.
Additionally, ASU 2014-09 supersedes some cost guidance included in ASC 605-35,  Revenue Recognition Construction-Type
and Production-Type Contracts . In addition, the existing requirements for the recognition of a gain or loss on the transfer
of nonfinancial assets that are not in a contract with a customer (for example, assets within the scope of ASC 360,  Property,
Plant, and Equipment , and intangible assets within the scope of ASC 350,  Intangibles Goodwill and Other ) are
amended to be consistent with the guidance on recognition and measurement (including the constraint on revenue) in ASU 2014-09.
In July 2015, the FASB approved to defer the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year. Accordingly, ASU 2014-09 will be effective
for public entities for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods therein. The Company is
currently evaluating the requirements of this new accounting guidance.  

In
January 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-01,  Income Statement-Extraordinary and Unusual Items . ASC 225-20, Income
Statement Extraordinary and Unusual Items, required that an entity separately classify, present, and disclose extraordinary
events and transactions. ASU 2015-01 eliminates the concept of extraordinary items. The amendments in ASU 2015-01 are effective
for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. A reporting entity may apply
the amendments prospectively. A reporting entity also may apply the amendments retrospectively to all prior periods presented
in the financial statements. Early adoption is permitted provided that the guidance is applied from the beginning of the fiscal
year of adoption. The effective date is the same for both public business entities and all other entities. The adoption of ASU
2015-01 on January 1, 2016 did not have a material impact on the Company s financial statements.  

In
February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02,  Consolidation . ASU 2015-02 affects reporting entities that are required
to evaluate whether they should consolidate certain legal entities. All legal entities are subject to reevaluation under the revised
consolidation model. Specifically, the amendments of ASU 2015-02: a) modify the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and
similar legal entities are variable interest entities (VIEs) or voting interest entities, b) eliminate the presumption that a
general partner should consolidate a limited partnership, c) affect the consolidation analysis of reporting entities that are
involved with VIEs, particularly those that have fee arrangements and related party relationships and d) provide a scope exception
from consolidation guidance for reporting entities with interests in legal entities that are required to comply with or operate
in accordance with requirements that are similar to those in Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 for registered money
market funds. ASU 2015-02 is effective for public business entities for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal
years, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. If an entity early
adopts the amendments in an interim period, any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes
that interim period. A reporting entity may apply the amendments in this Update using a modified retrospective approach by recording
a cumulative-effect adjustment to equity as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. A reporting entity also may apply
the amendments retrospectively. The adoption of ASU 2015-02 on January 1, 2016 did not have a material impact on the Company s
financial statements.  

In
April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03,  Interest Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30)-Simplifying the Presentation
of Debt Issuance Costs . ASU 2015-03 requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented
in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. Prior
to ASU 2015-03, debt issuance costs have been presented in the balance sheet as a deferred charge, or asset. The recognition and
measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by the amendments in this ASU. For public business entities, ASU
2015-03 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within
those fiscal years. Early adoption of ASU 2105-03 is permitted for financial statements that have not been previously issued.
In addition, ASU 2015-03 requires entities to apply the new guidance on a retrospective basis, wherein the balance sheet of each
individual period presented should be adjusted to reflect the period-specific effects of applying the new guidance. The adoption
of ASU 2015-03 on January 1, 2016 did not have a material impact on the Company s financial statements.  

3       ACQUISITIONS   

Acquisition
of Blaze Minerals, LLC   

On
April 13, 2015 the Company entered into a Securities Exchange Agreement with Wastech, Inc. ( Wastech ), under which
the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding membership units of Blaze Minerals, LLC ( Blaze Minerals ).
Blaze Minerals owns 40,976 net acres of coal and coalbed methane mineral rights in 22 counties in West Virginia (the  Mineral
Rights ). The Company acquired Blaze Minerals by the issuance of 2,803,621 shares of common stock. The shares were valued
at $7 million based upon a per share value of $2.50 per share, which was the price at which the Company issued its common stock
in a private placement at the time. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed as part of the acquisition were recognized at
their fair values at the acquisition date as follows:  

Acquisition
of Blue Grove Coal, LLC   

On
June 10, 2015, the Company completed the acquisition of Blue Grove Coal, LLC ( Blue Grove ) in exchange for 350,000
shares of its common stock from Ian and Gary Ganzer (the  Members ). Simultaneous with the Company s acquisition
of Blue Grove, Blue Grove entered into an operator agreement with GS Energy, LLC, under which Blue Grove has an exclusive right
to mine the coal properties of GS Energy for a two year period. During the term of the Operator Agreement, Blue Grove is entitled
to all revenues from the sale of coal mined from GS Energy s properties, and is responsible for all costs associated with
the mining of the properties or the properties themselves, including operating costs, lease, rental or royalty payments, insurance
and bonding costs, property taxes, licensing costs, etc. Simultaneous with the acquisition of Blue Grove, Blue Grove also entered
into a Management Agreement with Black Oak Resources, LLC ( Black Oak ), a company owned by the Members. Under the
Management Agreement, Blue Grove subcontracted all of its responsibilities under the Operator Agreement with GS Energy to Black
Oak. In consideration, Black Oak is entitled to 75% of all net profits generated by the mining of the coal properties of GS Energy.
Subsequently, the agreement with Black Oak was amended to provide that Black Oak was entitled to 100% of the first $400,000 and
50% of the next $1,000,000, for a maximum of $900,000 of net profits generated by the mining of the coal properties of GS Energy.  

The
assets acquired as part of the acquisition were recognized at their fair values at the acquisition date as follows:  

On
December 23, 2015, the Company and the Members entered into an Amendment to Securities Exchange Agreement ( Amendment )
originally entered into on June 8, 2015 under which the Company acquired all of the membership interests of Blue Grove in exchange
for 350,000 shares of the Company s common stock. Pursuant to the Amendment, the consideration for the acquisition of Blue
Grove was reduced from 350,000 shares of the Company s common stock to 10,000 shares.  

The
adjustment to the purchase price was not considered a measurement period adjustment, since this was not facts and circumstances
that existed at the measurement date of June 10, 2015. In order to properly reflect the fair value of the adjusted consideration
transferred and previously recorded as an intangible asset (which is being amortized over the life of the operator agreement)
the Company recorded an impairment of $533,821 during the four months ended December 31, 2015.  

Acquisition
of Rhino GP, LLC and Rhino Resource Partners, LLC   

On
January 21, 2016 the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the  Purchase Agreement ) with Wexford,
under which the Company agreed to purchase, and Wexford agreed to sell, a controlling interest in Rhino in two separate transactions.
Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Company purchased 676,912 common units of Rhino from three holders for total consideration
of $3,500,000. The common units purchased by the Company represented approximately 40.0% of the issued and outstanding common
units of Rhino and 23.1% of the total outstanding common units and subordinated units. The subordinated units are convertible
into common units on a one for one basis upon the occurrence of certain conditions.  

At
a second closing held on March 17, 2016, the Company purchased all of the membership interest of Rhino GP, and 945,526 subordinated
units of Rhino from two holders thereof, for aggregate consideration of $1,000,000. The subordinated units purchased by the Company
represented approximately 76.5% of the issued and outstanding subordinated units of Rhino, and when combined with the common units
already owned by the Company, resulted in the Company owning approximately 55.4% of the outstanding Units of Rhino. Rhino GP is
the general partner of Rhino, and in that capacity controls Rhino.  

On
March 21, 2016, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the  SPA ) with Rhino, under which the Company
purchased 6,000,000 newly issued common units of Rhino for $1.50 per common unit, for a total investment in Rhino of $9,000,000.
Closing under the SPA occurred on March 22, 2016. The Company paid the purchase by making a cash payment of $2,000,000 and by
issuing a promissory note in the amount of $7,000,000 to Rhino, which is payable without interest on the following schedule: $3,000,000
on or before July 31, 2016; $2,000,000 on or before September 30, 2016; and $2,000,000 on or before December 31, 2016. On May
13, 2016 and September 30, 2016, Royal paid the Partnership $3.0 million and $2.0 million, respectively, for the promissory note
installments that were due July 31, 2016 and September 30, 2016, respectively.  

Rhino
has the right to rescind the note installments due on September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2016 before such installments are paid
in the event the disinterested members of Rhino s board conclude that Rhino does not need the capital that would be provided
by the installments. If Rhino elects to rescind either or both installments, the Company will be obligated to return for cancellation
1,333,334 common units for each installment. In the event Rhino fails to exercise its rescission rights as to the installments
due on September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2016, Rhino will have an option to repurchase the common units represented by those
installments at a price of $3.00 per common unit, which option may only be exercised in full and in cash as to each installment
on or before December 31, 2017.  

The
Company has the right to cancel any installment and return the common units represented by the installment to Rhino for cancellation
in the event certain conditions are not true as of the time any installment of the note is due. Such conditions are that all representations
and warranties in the SPA remain true and correct, Rhino has entered into an agreement to extend its Credit Facility to December
31, 2017, and that Rhino is not then in default under the Credit Facility.  

The
promissory note is secured by a first lien on 1,333,334 of the common units issued under the SPA. The installment due on July
31, 2016 is with full recourse to the Company. The installments due on September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2016 are nonrecourse

Company acquired 114,814 subordinated units for $115 of total cash paid for all units. After issuing other new units during
the period, the Company s ownership became 84.5% of the common units and 85.8% of the subordinated units for a combined
ownership of 84.6%. 

Rhino s
common units currently trade on the OTCQB Marketplace under the symbol  RHNO.  Rhino s common units previously
traded on the NYSE until December 17, 2015, when the NYSE suspended trading after Rhino failed to maintain an average global market
capitalization over a consecutive 30 trading-day period of at least $15 million for its common units.  

Rhino
is a diversified energy limited partnership formed in Delaware that is focused on coal and energy related assets and activities,
including energy infrastructure investments. Rhino produces, processes and sells high quality coal of various steam and metallurgical
grades. Rhino markets its steam coal primarily to electric utility companies as fuel for their steam powered generators. Customers
for its metallurgical coal are primarily steel and coke producers who use its coal to produce coke, which is used as a raw material
in the steel manufacturing process. Rhino s business includes investments in oilfield services for independent oil and natural
gas producers and land-based drilling contractors in North America. The investments provide completion and production services,
including pressure pumping, pressure control, flowback and equipment rental services, and also produce and sell natural sand for
hydraulic fracturing.  

Rhino
has a geographically diverse asset base with coal reserves located in Central Appalachia, Northern Appalachia, the Illinois Basin
and the Western Bituminous region. As of December 31, 2015, Rhino controlled an estimated 363.6 million tons of proven and probable
coal reserves, consisting of an estimated 310.1 million tons of steam coal and an estimated 53.5 million tons of metallurgical
coal. In addition, as of December 31, 2015, Rhino controlled an estimated 436.8 million tons of non-reserve coal deposits. In
August 2016, Rhino sold their Elk Horn coal leasing business, as described further below, which controlled, as of December 31,
2015, an estimated 100.1 million tons of proven and probable coal reserves and an estimated 197.5 million tons of non-reserve
coal deposits.  

At
September 30, 2016, the Company s investment in Rhino consists of $11,500,115 in cash and $2,000,000 in notes payable. The
acquisition was completed in three steps as described above. The Company will engage an appraiser to value the assets acquired
and the liabilities assumed that have not already been valued, at which time the value will be assigned to the specific assets
and liabilities. The appraisal will be completed within the one year measurement period.  

Rhino
is a public partnership and as such maintains a reporting obligation to the SEC. The following table summarizes the assets and
liabilities reported by Rhino, acquired by the Company on March 17, 2016 and included in the Company s consolidated financial
statements at September 30, 2016. The coal properties and the related asset retirement obligation have been determined by an appraiser.
Other assets and liabilities will be adjusted when the related appraisal is completed.

Rhino-Yorktown
Partners LLC Transaction   

On
September 30, 2016, the Company, Rhino and Rhino GP entered into an equity exchange agreement (the   Agreement  )
with Rhino Resources Partners Holdings, LLC (  Rhino Holdings  ), an entity wholly-owned by certain investment
partnerships managed by Yorktown Partners LLC (  Yorktown  ).  

Investment
partnerships managed by Yorktown own substantially all of the outstanding common stock of Armstrong Energy, Inc. (  Armstrong
Energy  ), a coal producing company with mines located in the Illinois Basin in western Kentucky. The Agreement contemplates
that prior to the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Agreement (the   Closing  ), Yorktown will

transfer a 50% ownership of Rhino GP to Rhino Holdings in connection with the issuance of the common units of Rhino for the common
stock of Armstrong Energy.  

The
Closing is conditioned upon (i) the current bondholders of Armstrong Energy agreeing to restructure their bonds and (ii) Rhino
refinancing its current revolving credit agreement with funds from an equity investment into Rhino to be arranged by Rhino Holdings.
The Agreement is also subject to other standard closing conditions and required approvals.

party s inability or failure to satisfy the conditions to the Closing or if the non-terminating party has filed an action
seeking specific performance); (ii) a law or order issued by a governmental authority prevents the Closing from occurring (unless
such law or order resulted from such party s failure to perform its obligations under the Agreement); (iii) the board of
directors of Rhino GP fails to approve the transactions or transaction documents contemplated by the Agreement; or (iv) the lenders
of Rhino s credit facility fail to approve the transactions and transaction documents contemplated by the Agreement.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS    

Elk
Horn Coal Leasing    

In
August 2016, the Partnership entered into an agreement to sell its Elk Horn coal leasing company ( Elk Horn ) to a
third party for total cash consideration of $12.0 million. The Partnership received $10.5 million in cash consideration upon the
closing of the Elk Horn transaction and the remaining $1.5 million of consideration will be paid in ten equal monthly installments
of $150,000 on the 20 th  of each calendar month beginning on September 20, 2016. Elk Horn is a coal leasing company
located in eastern Kentucky that has provided the Partnership with coal royalty revenues from coal properties owned by Elk Horn
and leased to third-party operators. As of December 31, 2015, Elk Horn controlled approximately 100 million tons of proven and
probable steam coal reserves. During the second quarter of 2016, the Partnership evaluated the Elk Horn assets for potential impairment
based upon the initial purchase price offered by the buyer and the continued deterioration of the Central Appalachia steam coal
markets that had adversely affected Elk Horn s financial results. The Partnership s impairment analysis determined
that a potential impairment existed since the carrying amount of the Elk Horn long-lived asset group exceeded the cash flows that
would be generated from the purchase price offered from the buyer. Based on a market approach used to estimate the fair value
of the Elk Horn long-lived asset group, the Partnership recorded total asset impairment charges of approximately $13.3 million
related to Coal properties as of June 30, 2016. The disposal of the Elk Horn assets and liabilities in August 2016 resulted in
an additional loss of $0.2 million. The total loss of $13.5 million from the Elk Horn disposal is recorded on the Loss on business
disposal line in the Partnership s unaudited condensed consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine months ended September
30, 2016. The total loss on the Elk Horn disposal as well as the previous operating results of Elk Horn have been reclassified
and reported on the (Loss)/gain from discontinued operations line on the Partnership s unaudited condensed consolidated
statements of operations and comprehensive income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.

GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS   

ASC
Topic 350 addresses financial accounting and reporting for goodwill and other intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition.
Under the provisions of ASC Topic 350, goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are no longer amortized
but instead tested for impairment at least annually.  

Goodwill
in the amount of $2,363,000 arose from the Company s purchase of Rhino and may be adjusted or re-allocated upon completion
of a final appraisal of the remaining assets and liabilities of Rhino.  

Intangible

8       INVESTMENTS
IN UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES   

Investments
in other entities are accounted for using the consolidation, equity method or cost basis depending upon the level of ownership,
the Company s ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee and whether
the Company is determined to be the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity. Equity investments are recorded at original
cost and adjusted periodically to recognize the Company s proportionate share of the investees  net income or losses
after the date of investment. Any losses from the Company s equity method investments are absorbed by the Company based
upon its proportionate ownership percentage. If losses are incurred that exceed the Company s investment in the equity method
entity, then the Company must continue to record its proportionate share of losses in excess of its investment. Investments are
written down only when there is clear evidence that a decline in value that is other than temporary has occurred.  

In
December 2012, Rhino made an initial investment of approximately $2.0 million in a new joint venture, Muskie Proppant LLC ( Muskie ),
with affiliates of Wexford Capital. Muskie was formed to provide sand for fracking operations to drillers in the Utica Shale region
and other oil and natural gas basins in the United States. Rhino accounted for the investment in the joint venture and results
of operations under the equity method. In November 2014, Rhino contributed its interest in Muskie to Mammoth Energy Partners LP
( Mammoth ), which is discussed below.  

In
November 2014, Rhino contributed its investment interest in Muskie to Mammoth in return for a limited partner interest in Mammoth.
Mammoth was formed to own various companies that provide services to companies, which engage in the exploration and development
of North American onshore unconventional oil and natural gas reserves. Mammoth s companies provide services that include
completion and production services, contract land and directional drilling services and remote accommodation services. The non-cash
transaction was a contribution of Rhino s investment interest in the Muskie entity for an investment interest in Mammoth.
Thus, Rhino determined that the non-cash exchange of Rhino s ownership interest in Muskie did not result in any gain or
loss. As of September 30, 2016 and 2015, Rhino has recorded its investment in Mammoth of $1.9 million as a long-term asset, which
Rhino records as a cost method investment based upon its ownership percentage. In October 2016, the Partnership contributed its
limited partner interests in Mammoth to Mammoth Energy Services, Inc. in exchange for 234,300 shares of common stock of Mammoth
Energy Services, Inc. See Subsequent Events Note 24 for further details. The Company has included its investment in Mammoth and
its prior investment in Muskie in its Other category for segment reporting purposes.  

In
September 2014, Rhino made an initial investment of $5.0 million in a new joint venture, Sturgeon Acquisitions LLC ( Sturgeon ),
with affiliates of Wexford Capital and Gulfport Energy ( Gulfport ), a publicly traded company. Sturgeon subsequently
acquired 100% of the outstanding equity interests of certain limited liability companies located in Wisconsin that provide frac
sand for oil and natural gas drillers in the United States. The Company accounts for the investment in the joint venture and results
of operations under the equity method. The Company recorded its proportionate share of the operating (loss) for Sturgeon for the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 of approximately ($27,000) and ($0.1) million, respectively. The Company has included
the operating activities of Sturgeon in its Other category for segment reporting purposes.

OTHER NON-CURRENT ASSETS   

Other
non-current assets as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 consisted of the following:  

Debt
issuance costs were included in Prepaid expenses and other current assets at the end of the prior quarter since the Company classified

$0.2 million of its remaining unamortized debt issuance costs since the third amendment reduced the borrowing commitment under
the Credit Facility.  

In
March 2016, the Company entered into a fourth amendment of its Credit Facility that reduced the borrowing commitment to $80 million.
As part of executing the fourth amendment to the Credit Facility, the Operating Company paid a fee of approximately $0.4 million
to the lenders in March 2016, which was recorded as an addition to Debt issuance costs. The Company wrote-off approximately $0.2
million of its remaining unamortized debt issuance costs since the fourth amendment reduced the borrowing commitment under the
Credit Facility.  

In
May 2016, the Company entered into a fifth amendment of its Credit Facility that reduced the borrowing commitment to $75 million.
As part of executing the fifth amendment to the Credit Facility, the Operating Company paid a fee of approximately $1.2 million
to the lenders in May 2016, which was recorded as an addition to Debt issuance costs. The Company wrote-off approximately $0.1
million of its remaining unamortized debt issuance costs since the fifth amendment reduced the borrowing commitment under the
Credit Facility. See Note 12 for further information on the amendments to the Credit Facility.  

The
non-current receivable balance of $23.9 million as of September 30, 2016 consisted of the amount due from the Company s
workers  compensation insurance providers for potential claims against the Company that are the primary responsibility of
the Company, which are covered under the Company s insurance policies. The $23.9 million is also included in the Company s
accrued workers  compensation benefits liability balance, which is included in the non-current liabilities section of the
Company s unaudited condensed consolidated statements of financial position. The Company presents this amount on a gross
asset and liability basis since a right of setoff does not exist per the accounting guidance in ASC Topic 210,  Balance Sheet .

that are the primary obligation of the Company. The amount accrued for litigation claims is also due from the Company s
insurance providers and is included in Accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts on the Company s unaudited
condensed consolidated statements of financial position. The Company presents this amount on a gross asset and liability basis
as a right of setoff does not exist per the accounting guidance in ASC Topic 210. This presentation has no impact on the Company s

DEBT   

Debt
as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 consisted of the following:  

Senior Secured Credit
Facility with PNC Bank, N.A.   On July 29, 2011, the Operating Company and the Partnership, as a guarantor, executed
an amended and restated senior secured credit facility ( Credit Facility ) with PNC Bank, N.A., as administrative agent,
and a group of lenders, which are parties thereto. The maximum availability under the Credit Facility was $300.0 million, with
a one-time option to increase the availability by an amount not to exceed $50.0 million. Of the $300.0 million, $75.0 million was
available for letters of credit. As described below, in April 2015, March 2016, May 2016 and July 2016, the Credit Facility was
amended and the borrowing commitment under the facility was reduced to $75 million, with the amount available for letters of credit
reduced to $30 million. Borrowings under the facility bear interest, which per the March 2016 amendment described further below,
is based upon the current PRIME rate plus an applicable margin of 3.50%. As part of the agreement, the Operating Company is required
to pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the borrowing availability. Borrowings on the Credit Facility are collateralized
by all of the unsecured assets of the Partnership. The Credit Facility requires the Partnership to maintain certain minimum financial
ratios and contains certain restrictive provisions, including among others, restrictions on making loans, investments and advances,
incurring additional indebtedness, guaranteeing indebtedness, creating liens and selling or assigning stock. The Partnership was
in compliance with all covenants contained in the Credit Facility as of and for the twelve-month period ended June 30, 2016. Per
the May 2016 amendment described further below, the Credit Facility is set to expire on July 31, 2017, with the possibility to
extend the facility to December 31, 2017 if certain conditions are met. 

In
April 2015, the Partnership entered into a third amendment of its Credit Facility. The third amendment reduced the borrowing commitment
under the Credit Facility to a maximum of $100 million and reduced the amount available for letters of credit to $50 million.
The third amendment also provides that the disposition of any assets by the Partnership consisting of net cash proceeds up to
an aggregate $35 million shall reduce the total commitment under the facility on a dollar-for-dollar basis by up to a total of
$10 million, and any dispositions of assets in excess of $35 million in the aggregate shall reduce the commitment under the facility
on a dollar-for-dollar basis. The third amendment limits the Partnership s quarterly distributions to a maximum of $0.035
per unit unless (i) the pro forma leverage ratio of the Partnership, immediately prior to and after giving effect to such distribution,
is less than or equal to 3.0 to 1.0 and (ii) the amount of borrowings available under the credit facility, immediately prior to
and after giving effect to such distribution, is at least $20 million. In addition, the third amendment removed the interest coverage
ratio covenant and replaced it with a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, which consists of the ratio of consolidated EBITDA
minus maintenance capital expenditures to fixed charges. Fixed charges are defined in the third amendment to include the sum of
cash interest expense, scheduled principal installments on indebtedness (as adjusted for prepayments), dividends and distributions.
Commencing with the quarter ended September 30, 2015, the fixed charge coverage ratio for the trailing four quarters must be a
minimum of 1.1 to 1.0. The third amendment also limits any investments made by the Partnership, including investments in hydrocarbons,
to $10 million provided that the leverage ratio is less than or equal to 3.0 to 1.0 and the borrowers  available liquidity
is at least $20 million. The third amendment does not permit the Partnership to issue any new equity of the Partnership unless
the proceeds of such equity issuance are used to reduce the outstanding borrowings under the facility. Issuances of equity under
the Partnership s long-term incentive plan are excluded from this requirement. The third amendment limits the amount of
the Partnership s capital expenditures to $20.0 million for fiscal year 2015 and limited capital expenditures to $27.5 million
for each fiscal year after 2015. However, to the extent that capital expenditures for any fiscal year are less than indicated
above, the Partnership may increase the following year s capital expenditures by the lesser of such unused amount or $5.0
million. As part of executing the third amendment to the Credit Facility, the Operating Company paid a fee of approximately $2.1
million to the lenders in April 2015, which was recorded in Debt issuance costs in Other non-current assets on the Company s
unaudited condensed consolidated statements of financial position. In addition, the Partnership recorded a non-cash charge of
approximately $0.2 million to write-off a portion of its unamortized debt issuance costs since the third amendment reduced the
borrowing commitment under the amended and restated senior secured credit facility, which was recorded in Interest expense on
the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.  

In
March 2016, the Partnership entered into a fourth amendment (the  Fourth Amendment ) of its Credit Facility. The Fourth
Amendment amended the definition of change of control in the Credit Facility to permit Royal to purchase the membership interests
of the General Partner and set the expiration of the facility to July 29, 2016. The Fourth Amendment reduced the borrowing capacity
under the credit facility to a maximum of $80 million and reduced the amount available for letters of credit to $30 million. The
Fourth Amendment eliminated the option to borrow funds utilizing the LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin and established the
borrowing rate for all borrowings under the facility to be based upon the current PRIME rate plus an applicable margin of 3.50%.
The Fourth Amendment eliminated the capability to make Swing Loans under the facility and eliminated the ability of the Partnership
to pay distributions to its common or subordinated unitholders. The Fourth Amendment altered the maximum leverage ratio, calculated
as of the end of the most recent month, on a trailing twelve-month basis, to 6.75 to 1.00. The leverage ratio shall be reduced
by 0.50 to 1.00 for every $10 million of net cash proceeds, in the aggregate, received by the Partnership after the date of the
Fourth Amendment from a liquidity event; provided, however, that in no event shall the maximum permitted leverage ratio be reduced
below 3.00 to 1.00. A liquidity event is defined in the Fourth Amendment as the issuance of any equity by the Partnership on or
after the Fourth Amendment effective date (other than the Royal equity contribution discussed above), or the disposition of any
assets by the Partnership. The Fourth Amendment requires the Partnership to maintain minimum liquidity of $5 million and minimum
EBITDA (as defined in the credit agreement), calculated as of the end of the most recent month, on a trailing twelve month basis,
of $8 million. The Fourth Amendment limits the amount of the Partnership s capital expenditures to $15 million, calculated
as of end of the most recent month, on a trailing twelve-month basis. The Fourth Amendment requires the Partnership to provide
monthly financial statements and a weekly rolling thirteen-week cash flow forecast to the administrative agent.  

On
May 13, 2016, the Partnership entered into a fifth amendment (the  Fifth Amendment ) of its Credit Facility that extends
the term of the Credit Facility to July 31, 2017. Per the Fifth Amendment, the credit facility will be automatically extended
to December 31, 2017 if revolving credit commitments are reduced to $55 million or less on or before July 31, 2017. The Fifth
Amendment immediately reduces the revolving credit commitments under the credit facility to a maximum of $75 million and maintains
the amount available for letters of credit at $30 million. The Fifth Amendment further reduces the revolving credit commitments
over time on a dollar-for-dollar basis in amounts equal to each of the following: (i) the face amount of any letter of credit
that expires or whose face amount is reduced by any such dollar amount, (ii) the net proceeds received from any asset sales, (iii)
the Royal scheduled capital contributions (as outline below), (iv) the net proceeds from the issuance of any equity by the Partnership
up to $20.0 million (other than equity issued in exchange for any Royal contribution as outlined in the Securities Purchase Agreement
or the Royal scheduled capital contributions to the Partnership as outlined below), and (v) the proceeds from the incurrence of
any subordinated debt. The first $11 million of proceeds received from any equity issued by the Partnership described in clause
(iv) above shall also satisfy the Royal scheduled capital contributions as outlined below. The Fifth Amendment requires Royal
to contribute $2 million each quarter beginning September 30, 2016 through September 30, 2017 and $1 million on December 1, 2017,
for a total of $11 million. The Fifth Amendment further reduces the revolving credit commitments as follows:

The
Fifth Amendment requires that on or before March 31, 2017, the Partnership shall have solicited bids for the potential sale of
certain non-core assets, satisfactory to the administrative agent, and provided the administrative agent, and any other lender
upon its request, with a description of the solicitation process, interested parties and any potential bids. The Fifth Amendment
limits any payments by the Partnership to the General Partner to: (i) the usual and customary payroll and benefits of the Partnership s
management team so long as the Partnership s management team remains employees of the General Partner, (2) the usual and
customary board fees of the General Partner, and (3) the usual and customary general and administrative costs and expenses of
the General Partner incurred in connection with the operation of its business in an amount not to exceed $0.3 million per fiscal
year. The Fifth Amendment limits asset sales to a maximum of $5 million unless the Partnership receives consent from the lenders.
The Fifth Amendment alters the maximum leverage ratio, calculated as of the end of the most recent month, on a trailing twelve-month
basis, as follows:  

The
leverage ratios above shall be reduced by 0.50 to 1.00 for every $10 million of aggregate proceeds received by the Partnership
from: (i) the issuance of equity by the Partnership (excluding any Royal capital contributions) and/or (ii) the proceeds received
from the sale of assets, provided that the leverage ratio shall not be reduced below 3.50 to 1.00. The Fifth Amendment removes
the $5.0 million minimum liquidity requirement and requires the Partnership to have any deposit, securities or investment accounts
with a member of the lending group.  

In
July 2016, the Partnership entered into a sixth amendment (the  Sixth Amendment ) of its amended and restated senior
secured credit facility that permitted the sale of Elk Horn that was discussed earlier. The Sixth Amendment reduced the maximum
commitment amount allowed under the credit facility based on the initial cash proceeds of $10.5 million that were received for
the Elk Horn sale. The Sixth Amendment further reduces the maximum commitment amount allowed under the credit facility for the
additional $1.5 million to be received from the Elk Horn sale by $375,000 each quarterly period beginning September 30, 2016 through
June 30, 2017. At September 30, 2016, the Operating Company had borrowings outstanding (excluding letters of credit) of $30.4
million at a variable interest rate of PRIME plus 3.50% (7.00% at September 30, 2016). In addition, the Operating Company had
outstanding letters of credit of approximately $27.8 million at a fixed interest rate of 5.00% at September 30, 2016. Based upon
a maximum borrowing capacity of 6.50 times a trailing twelve-month EBITDA calculation (as defined in the credit agreement), the
Operating Company had available borrowing capacity of approximately $4.0 million at September 30, 2016.  

Other
Notes Payable   On July 7, 2016, the Partnership executed an agreement with the third party that held the approximately
$2.8 million of other notes payable to settle the debt for $1.1 million of cash consideration. The Partnership paid the $1.1 million
in July 2016 and recognized an approximate $1.7 million gain from the extinguishment of this debt.  

Convertible
Promissory Notes -  The Convertible Promissory Notes payable are due November 1, 2016, bear interest at the rate of 10% per
annum and are convertible into the common stock of the Company at a $5.50 per share conversion price. The Convertible Promissory
Notes can be converted at the option of the holder at any time and can be converted by the Company on the maturity date.  

Promissory
Note  - On September 30, 2016, the Company entered into a promissory note with Weston Energy LLC, pursuant to which Royal borrowed
a total of $2,000,000 at an interest rate of 8%. The promissory note has a maturity date of December 31, 2016.  

The
note is payable, at the option of the Company, either in cash, or in common units of the partnership. In the event the Company
elects to pay the note in common units, the number of common units that will be conveyed to satisfy the note will be equal to
note balance divided by 80% of the average of the high and low price of the common units for the twenty trading days prior to
the date of payment.  

Alternatively,
the Company may elect to pay the note by the issuance to Weston of preferred equity units of the partnership. Preferred equity
units consist of potential preferred equity units that may be issued to Weston or an affiliate in connection with a possible preferred
equity investment of $28 million or more in the partnership, which would be effectuated in connection with a potential acquisition
by the partnership of Armstrong Energy, Inc. (  Armstrong Energy  ), a coal producer owned by affiliates of Weston.
There is no assurance that the Partnership s acquisition of Armstrong Energy will be completed or, if completed, that Weston
or its affiliates will make a preferred equity investment in the Partnership.

AGREEMENT   

Wellston
Coal, LLC   

On
May 14, 2015, the Company entered into an Option Agreement to acquire substantially all of the assets of Wellston by issuing 500,000
shares of the Company s common stock by September 1, 2015 (extended until December 31, 2016). Wellston owns approximately

EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION   

In
October 2010, the Rhino GP established the Rhino Long-Term Incentive Plan (the  Plan  or  LTIP ). The
Plan is intended to promote the interests of the Partnership by providing to the employees, consultants and directors of Rhino
GP, the Partnership or affiliates of either incentive compensation awards to encourage superior performance. The LTIP provides
for grants of restricted units, unit options, unit appreciation rights, phantom units, unit awards, and other unit-based awards.  

As
of September 30, 2016, Rhino GP had granted phantom units to certain employees and restricted units and unit awards to its directors.
These grants consisted of annual restricted unit awards to directors and phantom unit awards with tandem distribution equivalent
rights ( DERs ) granted in the first quarters from 2012 through 2015 to certain employees in connection with the prior
year s performance. The DERs consist of rights to accrue quarterly cash distributions in an amount equal to the cash distribution
the Partnership makes to unitholders during the vesting period. These awards are subject to service based vesting conditions and
any accrued distributions will be forfeited if the related awards fail to vest according to the relevant service based vesting
conditions.  

The
Partnership accounts for its unit-based awards as liabilities with applicable mark-to-market adjustments at each reporting period
because the Compensation Committee of the board of directors of Rhino GP has historically elected to pay some of the awards in
cash in lieu of issuing common units.  

As
discussed in Note 1, on March 17, 2016, Royal completed the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding membership interests
of Rhino GP as well as 9,455,252 issued and outstanding subordinated units from Wexford Capital. Royal obtained control of, and
a majority limited partner interest, in the Partnership with the completion of this transaction, which constituted a change in
control of the Partnership. The language in the Partnership s phantom unit and restricted unit grant agreements states that
all outstanding, unvested units will become immediately vested upon a change in control. The Company recognized approximately
$10,000 of expense from the changing control vesting of these units.  

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the General Partner granted fully vested units of the Partnership to its board of directors
as well as certain members of management. The Company recognized approximately $0.6 million of expense for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 in relation to the units granted.  

19       COMMITMENTS
AND CONTINGENCIES   

Coal
Sales Contracts and Contingencies   As of September 30, 2016, the Partnership had commitments under sales contracts
to deliver annually scheduled base quantities of coal as follows:  

Some
of the contracts have sales price adjustment provisions, subject to certain limitations and adjustments, based on a variety of
factors and indices.  

Leases   The
Partnership leases various mining, transportation and other equipment under operating leases. The Partnership also leases coal
reserves under agreements that call for royalties to be paid as the coal is mined. Lease and royalty expense for the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2016 are included in Cost of operations in the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of
operations for the period owned by the Company were as follows:  

Joint Ventures   The
Partnership may contribute additional capital to the Timber Wolf joint venture that was formed in the first quarter of 2012. The
Partnership did not make any capital contributions to the Timber Wolf joint venture during the nine months ended September 30,
2016. 

The
Partnership may contribute additional capital to the Sturgeon joint venture that was formed in the third quarter of 2014. The
Partnership made an initial capital contribution of $5.0 million during the third quarter ended September 30, 2014 based upon
its proportionate ownership interest.  

Blue
Grove Coal, LLC ( Blue Grove ).   On June 10, 2015, the Company acquired Blue Grove in exchange for 350,000
shares of its common stock. Blue Grove was owned 50% by Ian Ganzer, our chief operating officer, and 50% by Gary Ganzer, Ian Ganzer s
father (the  Members ). Simultaneous with the Company s acquisition of Blue Grove, Blue Grove entered into an
operator agreement with GS Energy, LLC, under which Blue Grove has an exclusive right to mine the coal properties of GS Energy
for a two year period. During the term of the Operator Agreement, Blue Grove is entitled to all revenues from the sale of coal
mined from GS Energy s properties, and is responsible for all costs associated with the mining of the properties or the
properties themselves, including operating costs, lease, rental or royalty payments, insurance and bonding costs, property taxes,
licensing costs, etc. Simultaneous with the acquisition of Blue Grove, Blue Grove also entered into a Management Agreement with
Black Oak Resources, LLC ( Black Oak ), a company owned by the Members. Under the Management Agreement, Blue Grove
subcontracted all of its responsibilities under the Management Agreement with GS Energy to Black Oak. In consideration, Black
Oak was entitled to 75% of all net profits generated by the mining of the coal properties of GS Energy. Subsequently, the agreement
with Black Oak was amended to provide that Black Oak was entitled to 100% of the first $400,000 and 50% of the next $1,000,000,
for a maximum of $900,000 of net profits generated by the mining of the coal properties of GS Energy.  

The
Members have an option to purchase the membership interests in Blue Grove from the Company. If exercised between ten and sixteen
months after closing, the exercise price of the option is $50,000 less any dividends received on the shares of common stock issued
in the acquisition, plus 90% of the shares issued to acquire Blue Grove. If exercised between sixteen and twenty-four months after
closing, the exercise price of the option is 80% of the shares issued to acquire Blue Grove. The call option will terminate when
(i) the parties agree it has terminated, (ii) when the Company pays the Members at least $1,900,000 to acquire their shares of
common stock, or (iii) when a comparable option granted to the Members with respect to common stock issued to them to acquire
GS Energy is terminated. The Company also has an option to sell the Blue Grove membership interests back to the Members. If exercised
between ten and sixteen months after closing, the exercise price of the Company s option is 90% of the common stock issued
to the Ganzers to acquire Blue Grove. If exercised between sixteen and twenty-four months after closing, the exercise price of
the Company s option is 80% of the common stock issued to the Members to acquire Blue Grove.  

On
December 23, 2015, the Company and the Members entered into an Amendment to Securities Exchange Agreement ( Amendment )
originally entered into on June 8, 2015. Pursuant to the Amendment, the consideration for the acquisition of Blue Grove was reduced
from 350,000 shares of the Company s common stock to 10,000 shares. See Note 3.  

On
June 10, 2015, the Company also entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement to acquire GS Energy for shares of common stock with
a market value of $9,600,000 provided that the Company issue a minimum of 1,250,000 shares of its common stock and a maximum of
1,750,000 shares. Closing under the Securities Exchange Agreement was subject to the successful completion of a financial audit
of GS Energy and due diligence. GS Energy owns and leases approximately 6,000 net acres of coal and coalbed methane mineral rights
and a surface coal mine in McDowell County, West Virginia. In December 2015, the Securities Exchange Agreement to acquire GS Energy
was voluntarily terminated by the parties. The Company is in further negotiations to acquire GS Energy.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS   

The
book values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable are considered to be representative of their

Credit Facility was based upon a Level 2 measurement utilizing a market approach, which incorporated market-based interest rate
information with credit risks similar to the Company. The fair value of the Company s Credit Facility approximates the carrying
value at September 30, 2016.

SEGMENT INFORMATION   

The

primarily to electric utilities in the United States. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company had
four reportable segments: Central Appalachia (comprised of both surface and underground mines located in Eastern Kentucky and
Southern West Virginia), Northern Appalachia (comprised of both surface and underground mines located in Ohio), Rhino Western
(comprised of an underground mine in Utah) and Illinois Basin (comprised of an underground mine in western Kentucky).  

The
Company s other category is comprised of the Company s ancillary businesses, its remaining oil and natural gas activities
and its corporate overhead. The Company has not provided disclosure of total expenditures by segment for long-lived assets, as
the Company does not maintain discrete financial information concerning segment expenditures for long lived assets, and accordingly
such information is not provided to the Company s chief operating decision maker. The information provided in the following
tables represents the primary measures used to assess segment performance by the Company s chief operating decision maker.  

Prior
to the acquisition of Rhino on March 17, 2016, the Company did not have reportable segments, accordingly, no disclosure is presented
for 2015.  

Reportable
segment results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016 are as follows (Note:  DD A  refers

          SUBSEQUENT EVENTS    

In
October 2016, the Partnership contributed its limited partner interests in Mammoth to Mammoth Energy Services, Inc. ( Mammoth
Inc. ) in exchange for 234,300 shares of common stock of Mammoth Inc. The common stock of Mammoth Inc. began trading on
the Nasdaq Exchange in October 2016 under the ticker symbol TUSK and the Partnership sold 1,953 shares during the initial public
offering of Mammoth Inc. and received proceeds of approximately $27,000. The Partnership s remaining shares of Mammoth Inc.
are subject to a 180 day lock-up period from the date of Mammoth Inc. s initial public offering.  

For
the quarter ended September 30, 2016, the Partnership continued the suspension of the cash distribution for its common units,
which was initially suspended for the quarter ended June 30, 2015. No distribution will be paid for common or subordinated units
for the quarter ended June 30, 2016. The Partnership s common units accrue arrearages every quarter when the distribution
level is below the minimum level of $0.445 per unit, as outlined in the Partnership s limited partnership agreement. The
Partnership initially lowered its quarterly common unit distribution below the minimum level of $0.445 per unit with the quarter
ended September 30, 2014. Thus, the Partnership s distributions for each of the quarters ended September 30, 2014 through
the quarter ended June 30, 2016 were below the minimum level and the current amount of accumulated arrearages as of September
30, 2016 related to the common unit distribution was approximately $149.7 million.  

On
October 7, 2016, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the   Purchase Agreement  ) with East
Hill Investments, Ltd. (the   Purchaser  ), pursuant to which the Company offered to the Purchaser, in a registered
direct offering, an aggregate of 1,000,000 shares (the   Shares  ) of its common stock at a negotiated purchase
price of $4.25 per share, for aggregate gross proceeds to the Company of $4,250,000, before other offering expenses payable by
the Company.  

Under
the Purchase Agreement, the Company agreed to issue 50,000 Shares immediately in consideration of a promissory note (a   Purchase
Note  ) of the Purchaser. The Purchase Note is payable fifteen calendar days after the date of issuance, and does not
bear interest prior to the maturity date. If the Purchase Note is not paid in full on the maturity date, the Purchase Note will
bear interest at 15% per annum. Until sixty days after the initial purchase, the Purchaser has the right to purchase additional
Shares under the Purchase Agreement, provided that: each purchase must be for no less than 20,000 Shares and no more than 50,000
Shares; and the Purchaser must not be obligated on a Purchase Note from a prior purchase. The Purchaser will purchase the balance
of any Shares which have not been purchased under the Purchase Agreement for cash sixty days after the initial purchase. On October
22, 2016, the Company and East Hill agreed to extend the payment date of the initial Purchase Note to November 30, 2016.  

Effective as of November
12, 2016, the Company exercised its option to convert $2,150,000 of convertible notes into shares of its common stock at $5.50
per share. The total principal and interest converted into common stock was $2,261,137, which resulted in the issuance of 411,116
shares of common stock.

Overview   

The
Company previously pursued gold, silver, copper and rare earth metals mining concessions in Romania and mining leases in the United
States. Commencing in January 2015, the Company began a series of transactions under which the Company would dispose of all of
its existing assets, undergo a change in ownership control and management, and repurpose itself as a North American energy recovery
company, with plans to purchase a group of synergistic, long-lived energy assets by taking advantage of favorable valuations for
mergers and acquisitions in the current energy markets. In April 2015, the Company completed its first acquisition in furtherance
of its change in principle operations, consisting of 40,976 net acres of coal and coalbed methane, located across 22 counties
in West Virginia. In June 2015, the Company completed the acquisition of Blue Grove Coal, LLC, a licensed operator of a coal mine
owned by GS Energy, LLC. See below regarding acquisition of majority control of Rhino Resource Partners, LP ( Rhino ).
See Notes 3, 16 and 18 to the consolidated financial statements for additional completed and planned acquisitions.  

Current
management of the Company acquired control of the Company in March 2015, with the goal of using the Company as a vehicle to acquire
undervalued natural resource assets. The Company has raised approximately $8.4 million through the sale of shares of common stock
in private placements, and is currently evaluating a number of possible acquisitions of operating coal mines and non-operating
coal assets. There are currently many coal assets for sale at attractive prices due to distress conditions in the coal industry.
The distressed conditions are mainly due to new environmental regulations, which have increased operating costs for coal operators,
and have encouraged coal buyers to switch to less costly energy sources, such as natural gas. The resulting drop in demand from
coal buyers has caused the price of coal to decline considerably, and caused bankruptcy filings by many of the major coal operators.
Despite the current distress in the industry, industry experts still predict that coal will supply a significant percentage of
the nation s energy needs for the foreseeable future, and thus overall demand for coal will remain significant. Management
believes there are a number of attractive acquisition candidates in the coal industry which can be operated profitably at current
prices and under the current regulatory environment.  

Royal
Energy Resources, Inc. Purchase of Majority Control of Rhino Resource Partners, LP    

On
January 21, 2016, Royal and Wexford Capital LP and certain of its affiliates (collectively,  Wexford ) entered into
a definitive agreement whereby Royal acquired 676,912 of Rhino s issued and outstanding common units from Wexford. The definitive
agreement also included a commitment by Royal to acquire within 60 days from the date of the definitive agreement, or March 21,
2016, of all of the issued and outstanding membership interests of Rhino GP LLC (Rhino GP ), Rhino s general partner,
as well as 945,526 of Rhino s issued and outstanding subordinated units from Wexford.  

On
March 17, 2016, Royal completed the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding membership interests of Rhino GP as well
as the 945,526 issued and outstanding subordinated units from Wexford. Royal obtained control of, and a majority limited partner
interest, in Rhino with the completion of this transaction. Immediately subsequent to the consummation of the transaction, the
following members of the board of directors of the Partnership s general partner tendered their resignations effective immediately:
Mark Zand, Philip Braunstein, Ken Rubin, Arthur Amron, Douglas Lambert and Mark Plaumann. As the owner of the Partnership s
general partner, Royal has the right to appoint the members of the board of directors of the Partnership s general partner
and so appointed the following individuals as new directors to fill the vacancies resulting from the resignations: William Tuorto,
Ronald Phillips, Michael Thompson, Douglas Holsted, Brian Hughs and David Hanig.  

On
March 21, 2016, Rhino and Royal entered into a securities purchase agreement (the  Securities Purchase Agreement )
pursuant to which Rhino issued 6,000,000 of its common units to Royal in a private placement at $1.50 per common unit for an aggregate
purchase price of $9.0 million. Royal paid Rhino $2.0 million in cash and delivered a promissory note payable to the Partnership
in the amount of $7.0 million. The promissory note is payable in three installments: (i) $3.0 million on July 31, 2016; (ii) $2.0
million on or before September 30, 2016 and (iii) $2.0 million on or before December 31, 2016. On May 13, 2016 and September 30,
2016, respectively, the Company paid Rhino $3,000,000 and $2,000,000, respectively, of the promissory note installments that were
due July 31,2016 and September 30, 2016, respectively.  

In the event the disinterested
members of the board of directors of Rhino s general partner determine that the Partnership does not need the capital that
would be provided by either or both installments set forth in (ii) and (iii) above, in each case, Rhino has the option to rescind
Royal s purchase of 1,333,334 common units and the applicable installment will not be payable (each, a  Rescission
Right ). If Rhino fails to exercise a Rescission Right, in each case, Rhino has the option to repurchase 1,333,334 of its
common units at $3.00 per common unit from Royal (each, a  Repurchase Option ). The Repurchase Options terminate on
December 31, 2017. Royal s obligation to pay any installment of the promissory note is subject to certain conditions, including
that Rhino has entered into an agreement to extend the Credit Facility, as amended, to a date no sooner than December 31, 2017.
In the event such conditions are not satisfied as of the date each installment is due, Royal has the right to cancel the remaining
unpaid balance of the promissory note in exchange for the surrender of such number of common units equal to the principal balance
cancelled divided by $1.50. 

Overview
after Rhino Acquisition   

We
are a diversified energy company that is focused on coal and energy related assets and activities, including energy infrastructure
investments. We produce, process and sell high quality coal of various steam and metallurgical grades. We market our steam coal
primarily to electric utility companies as fuel for their steam powered generators. Customers for our metallurgical coal are primarily
steel and coke producers who use our coal to produce coke, which is used as a raw material in the steel manufacturing process.
In addition, we have expanded our business to include infrastructure support services, as well as other joint venture investments
to provide for the transportation of hydrocarbons and drilling support services in the Utica Shale region. We have also invested
in joint ventures that provide sand for fracking operations to drillers in the Utica Shale region and other oil and natural gas
basins in the United States.  

We
have a geographically diverse asset base with coal reserves located in Central Appalachia, Northern Appalachia, the Illinois Basin
and the Western Bituminous region. As of December 31, 2015, Rhino controlled an estimated 363.6 million tons of proven and probable
coal reserves, consisting of an estimated 310.1 million tons of steam coal and an estimated 53.5 million tons of metallurgical
coal. In addition, as of December 31, 2015, Rhino controlled an estimated 436.8 million tons of non-reserve coal deposits. In
August 2016, Rhino sold its Elk Horn coal leasing business, as described further below, which controlled, as of December 31, 2015,
an estimated 100.1 million tons of proven and probable coal reserves and an estimated 197.5 million tons of non-reserve coal deposits.  

We
operate underground and surface mines located in Kentucky, Ohio, West Virginia and Utah. The number of mines that we operate may
vary from time to time depending on a number of factors, including the demand for and price of coal, depletion of economically
recoverable reserves and availability of experienced labor.  

Our
principal business strategy is to safely, efficiently and profitably produce, sell both steam and metallurgical coal from our
diverse asset base in order to enable Rhino to resume, and, over time, increase its quarterly cash distributions. In addition,
we intend to continue to expand and potentially diversify our operations through strategic acquisitions, including the acquisition
of long-term, cash generating natural resource assets. We believe that such assets will allow us to grow our cash available for
distribution and enhance stability of our cash flow.  

For
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, Rhino generated revenues of approximately $43.4 million and $124.4 million,
respectively, and it generated net losses of approximately $3.2 million and $9.0 million, respectively. For the three months ended
September 30, 2016, Rhino produced and sold approximately 0.8 million tons of coal, of which approximately 93% were sold pursuant
to supply contracts. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, Rhino produced and sold approximately 2.4 million tons of coal,
of which approximately 88% were sold pursuant to supply contracts. Rhino recorded a loss from the disposal of a business $119.2
million as of September 2016, as discussed below. Royal adjusted its basis in Rhino s assets upon the acquisition of Rhino
in March 2016 and as a result, Royal s loss on disposal of the business amounted to $13.5 million in the nine months ended
September 30, 2016.  

Current
Liquidity and Outlook   

As
of September 30, 2016, Rhino s available liquidity was $4.0 million, which consisted of the amount available under its Credit
Facility dated July 29, 2011 (as amended and restated, the  Credit Facility ). On May 13, 2016, Rhino entered into
a fifth amendment of the Credit Facility (the  Fifth Amendment ), which extends the term to July 31, 2017 (see   Liquidity
and Capital Resources Credit Facility  for further details of the Fifth Amendment).  

Prior
to Rhino s entry into the Fifth Amendment, it was unable to demonstrate that it had sufficient liquidity to operate its
business over the subsequent twelve months and thus, substantial doubt was raised about its ability to continue as a going concern.
Accordingly, its independent registered public accounting firm included an emphasis paragraph with respect to its ability to continue
as a going concern in its report on Rhino s consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015. The
presence of the going concern emphasis paragraph in its auditors  report may have an adverse impact on its relationship
with third parties with whom it does business, including its customers, vendors, lenders and employees, making it difficult to
raise additional debt or equity financing to the extent needed and conduct normal operations. As a result, its business, results
of operations, financial condition and prospects could be materially adversely affected.  

Given
the continued weak demand and low prices for met and steam coal, Rhino may not be able to continue to give the required representations
or meet all of the covenants and restrictions included in its Credit Facility. If Rhino violates any of the covenants or restrictions
in its Credit Facility, including the maximum leverage ratio and minimum EBITDA requirements, some or all of its indebtedness
may become immediately due and payable, and its lenders  commitment to make further loans to Rhino may terminate. If Rhino
is unable to give a required representation or it violates a covenant or restriction, then it will need a waiver from its lenders
in order to continue to borrow under its Credit Facility. Although we believe Rhino s lenders loans are well secured under
the terms of its Credit Facility, there is no assurance that the lenders would agree to any such waiver. Failure to obtain financing
or to generate sufficient cash flow from operations could cause Rhino to further curtail its operations and reduce its spending
and to alter its business plan. Rhino may also be required to consider other options, such as selling additional assets or merger
opportunities, and depending on the urgency of its liquidity constraints, it may be required to pursue such an option at an inopportune
time. If it is not able to fund its liquidity requirements for the next twelve months, it may not be able to continue as a going
concern. For more information about Rhino s liquidity and its credit facility, please read   Liquidity and Capital
Resources.   

Rhino
continues to take measures, including the suspension of cash distributions on its common and subordinated units and cost and productivity
improvements to enhance and preserve its liquidity so that it can fund its ongoing operations and necessary capital expenditures
and meet its financial commitments and debt service obligations.  

Recent
Developments   

Yorktown
Transaction    

On
September 30, 2016, Royal, Rhino, Rhino GP, Rhino Resource Partners Holdings, LLC ( Rhino Holdings ), an entity wholly-owned
by certain investment partnerships managed by Yorktown Partners LLC ( Yorktown ) entered into a definitive agreement
(the  Agreement ). Investment partnerships managed by Yorktown own substantially all of the outstanding common stock
of Armstrong Energy, Inc. ( Armstrong Energy ), a coal producing company with mines located in the Illinois Basin
in western Kentucky. The Agreement contemplates that prior to closing, Yorktown will contribute its shares of common stock of
Armstrong Energy to Rhino Holdings. At the closing, Rhino Holdings will contribute those shares to Rhino in exchange for 10 million
newly issued of our common units of Rhino. The Agreement also contemplates that Rhino GP, currently owned and controlled by Royal,
will issue a 50% ownership inherent in it to Rhino Holdings in connection with the issuance of Rhino s common units for
the common stock of Armstrong Energy. Closing of the Agreement is conditioned upon (i) the current bondholders of Armstrong Energy
agreeing to restructure their bonds and (ii) the refinancing of Rhino s Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with funds
from an equity investment into Rhino to be arranged by Rhino Holdings. The Agreement is also subject to other standard closing
conditions and required approvals. The Agreement contains customary covenants, representations and warranties and indemnification
obligations for breaches of, or the inaccuracy of representations or warranties or breaches of covenants contained in, the Agreement
and associated agreements. Rhino also agreed to enter into a registration rights agreement with Rhino Holdings that provides Rhino
Holdings with the right to demand two shelf registration statements and registration statements on Form S-1, as well as piggyback
registration rights. The Agreement may be terminated by the mutual written consent of the parties and Rhino Holdings or by either
Rhino or Rhino Holdings if: (i) the closing has not occurred on or before December 31, 2016 (unless the closing is as a result
of such terminating party s inability or failure to satisfy the conditions to the closing or if the non-terminating party
has filed an action seeking specific performance); (ii) a law or order issued by a governmental authority prevents the closing
from occurring (unless such law or order resulted from such party s failure to perform its obligations under the Agreement);
(iii) the board of directors of Rhino GP fails to approve the transactions or transaction documents contemplated by the Agreement;
or (iv) the lenders of Rhino s credit facility fail to approve the transactions and transaction documents contemplated by
the Agreement. The parties anticipate the Agreement will be consummated on or before December 31, 2016.  

Elk
Horn Coal Leasing Disposition    

In
August 2016, Rhino entered into an agreement to sell its Elk Horn coal leasing company to a third party for total cash consideration
of $12.0 million. Rhino received $10.5 million in cash consideration upon the closing of the Elk Horn transaction and the remaining
$1.5 million of consideration will be paid in ten equal monthly installments of $150,000 on the 20th of each calendar month beginning
on September 20, 2016. Elk Horn is a coal leasing company located in eastern Kentucky that has provided Rhino with coal royalty
revenues from coal properties owned by Elk Horn and leased to third-party operators. As of December 31, 2015, Elk Horn controlled
approximately 100 million tons of proven and probable steam coal reserves. During the second quarter of 2016, Rhino evaluated
the Elk Horn assets for potential impairment based upon the initial purchase price offered by the buyer and the continued deterioration
of the Central Appalachia steam coal markets that had adversely affected Elk Horn s financial results. Its impairment analysis
determined that a potential impairment existed since the carrying amount of the Elk Horn long-lived asset group exceeded the cash
flows that would be generated from the purchase price offered from the buyer. Based on a market approach used to estimate the
fair value of the Elk Horn long-lived asset group, Rhino recorded total asset impairment charges of approximately $13.3 million
related to Coal properties as of June 30, 2016. The disposal of the Elk Horn assets and liabilities in August 2016 resulted in
an additional loss of $0.2 million. The total loss of $13.5 million from the Elk Horn disposal is recorded as discontinued operations
along with the previous operating results of Elk Horn that have been reclassified for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015.  

Fourth,
Fifth and Six Amendments to Credit Facility    

On
March 17, 2016, the Operating Company, as borrower, and the Partnership and certain of its subsidiaries, as guarantors, entered
into an amendment (the  Fourth Amendment ) of our Credit Facility. The Fourth Amendment amended the definition of
change of control in our Credit Facility to permit Royal to purchase the membership interests of the Partnership s general
partner.  

On
May 13, 2016, the Operating Company, as borrower, and the Partnership and certain of its subsidiaries, as guarantors, entered
into the Fifth Amendment of the Credit Facility, which extended the term to July 31, 2017 (see   Liquidity and Capital
Resources  Credit Facility  for further details of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments).  

In
July 2016, the Partnership entered into a sixth amendment (the  Sixth Amendment ) of its amended and restated senior
secured credit facility that permitted the sale of Elk Horn that was discussed earlier. The Sixth Amendment reduced the maximum
commitment amount allowed under the credit facility based on the initial cash proceeds of $10.5 million that were received for
the Elk Horn sale. The Sixth Amendment further reduces the maximum commitment amount allowed under the credit facility for the
additional $1.5 million to be received from the Elk Horn sale by $375,000 each quarterly period beginning September 30, 2016 through
June 30, 2017.  

Suspension and Delisting of Common Units
from the New York Stock Exchange ( NYSE ) for Rhino Resource Partners, LP   

As
previously disclosed, on December 17, 2015, the NYSE notified Rhino that that the NYSE had determined to commence proceedings
to delist its common units from the NYSE as a result of its failure to comply with the continued listing standard set forth in
Section 802.01B of the NYSE Listed Company Manual to maintain an average global market capitalization over a consecutive 30 trading-day
period of at least $15 million for its common units. The NYSE also suspended the trading of its common units at the close of trading
on December 17, 2015.  

On
January 4, 2016, Rhino filed an appeal with the NYSE to review the suspension and delisting determination of its common units.
The NYSE held a hearing regarding Rhino s appeal on April 20, 2016 and affirmed its prior decision to delist Rhino s
common units.  

On
April 27, 2016, the NYSE filed with the SEC a notification of removal from listing and registration on Form 25 to delist Rhino s
common units and terminate the registration of its common units under Section 12(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The
delisting became effective on May 9, 2016. The Partnership s common units continued to trade on the OTCQB Marketplace under
the ticker symbol  RHNOD  until May 16, 2016, at which time the OTCQB ticker symbol reverted to  RHNO.   

Rhino
is exploring the possibility of listing its common units on the NASDAQ Stock Market ( NASDAQ ), pending its capability
to meet the NASDAQ initial listing standards.  

Reverse Unit Split for Rhino Resource
Partners, LP   

On
April 18, 2016, Rhino completed a 1-for-10 reverse split on its common units and subordinated units. Pursuant to the reverse split,
common unitholders received one common unit for every 10 common units owned on April 18, 2016 and subordinated unitholders received
one subordinated unit for every 10 subordinated units owned on April 18, 2016. Any fractional units resulting from the reverse
unit split were rounded to the nearest whole unit. The reverse unit split was intended to increase the market price per unit of
Rhino s common units in order to comply with the NYSE s continued listing standards. All references to units are on
a post-split basis.  

Distribution Suspension for Rhino
Resource Partners, LP   

Beginning
with the quarter ended June 30, 2015 and continuing through the current quarter ended September 30, 2016, Rhino has suspended
the cash distribution for its common units. For the quarters ended September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2014, Rhino announced cash
distributions of $0.05 per common unit, or $0.20 per unit on an annualized basis, and for the quarter ended March 31, 2015, Rhino
announced cash distributions of $0.02 per common unit, or $0.08 per unit on an annualized basis. Each of these quarters 
distribution levels were lower than the historical quarters  distribution amounts of $0.445 per common unit, or $1.78 per
unit on an annualized basis. The distribution suspension and prior reductions were the result of prolonged weakness in the coal
markets, which has continued to adversely affect Rhino s cash flow.  

Rhino s
common units accrue arrearages every quarter when the distribution level is below the minimum level of $0.445 per unit, as outlined
in its limited partnership agreement. Since the distributions for the quarters ended September 30, 2014, December 31, 2014 and
March 31, 2015 were below the minimum level and Rhino suspended the distribution for the quarters ended June 30, 2015 through
September 30, 2016, Rhino has accumulated arrearages at September 30, 2016 related to the common unit distribution of approximately
$149.7 million.  

Factors
That Impact Our Business   

Our
results of operations in the near term could be impacted by a number of factors, including (1) our ability to fund our ongoing
operations and necessary capital expenditures, (2) the availability of transportation for coal shipments, (3) poor mining conditions
resulting from geological conditions or the effects of prior mining, (4) equipment problems at mining locations, (5) adverse weather
conditions and natural disasters or (6) the availability and costs of key supplies and commodities such as steel, diesel fuel
and explosives.  

On
a long-term basis, our results of operations could be impacted by, among other factors, (1) our ability to fund our ongoing operations
and necessary capital expenditures, (2) changes in governmental regulation, (3) the availability and prices of competing electricity-generation
fuels, (4) the world-wide demand for steel, which utilizes metallurgical coal and can affect the demand and prices of metallurgical
coal that we produce, (5) our ability to secure or acquire high-quality coal reserves and (6) our ability to find buyers for coal
under favorable supply contracts.  

We
have historically sold a majority of our coal through supply contracts and anticipate that we will continue to do so. As of September
30, 2016, we had commitments under sales contracts to deliver annually scheduled base quantities of coal as follows:  

Some
of the contracts have sales price adjustment provisions, subject to certain limitations and adjustments, based on a variety of
factors and indices.  

Results
of Operations   

Consolidated
Information   

As
noted above, the Company completed the acquisition of a majority of Rhino on March 17, 2016. Accordingly, the Company began consolidating
the operations of Rhino on that date. The following summarizes the financial statements of Royal for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, which includes the results of operation of Rhino from the date that the Company
acquired majority control, as adjusted for changes in the fair value of certain Rhino assets as of the date of the transaction.
During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company s only operating activities consisted of Rhino.  

Our
revenues for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are summarized as follows:  

Our
costs and expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are summarized as follows:

Results
of Operations of Rhino    

The following information
shows the results of operation of Rhino for each period presented. The results have not been adjusted to give effect to the lower
depreciation, depletion and amortization which resulted when Royal revalued Rhino s property, plant and equipment. However,
for purposes of reflecting the loss on the disposal of Rhino s Elk Horn properties recorded as of September 30, 2016, the
information which follows has been adjusted to reflect the lower basis in the assets resulting in a $13.5 million loss. The Company
is working with a third-party specialist to evaluate the assets of Rhino to assign specific values at the appropriate
asset levels.  

In
this section   Results of Operations of Rhino  , the terms  Rhino,   we  and  our 
refer exclusively to Rhino unless specifically indicated otherwise.    

As
of September 30, 2016, we have four reportable business segments: Central Appalachia, Northern Appalachia, Rhino Western and Illinois
Basin. Additionally, we have an Other category that includes our ancillary businesses and our remaining oil and natural gas activities.
Our Central Appalachia segment consists of two mining complexes: Tug River and Rob Fork, which, as of September 30, 2016, together
included one underground mine, three surface mines and three preparation plants and loadout facilities in eastern Kentucky and
southern West Virginia. Our Northern Appalachia segment consists of the Hopedale mining complex, the Sands Hill mining complex,
and the Leesville field. The Hopedale mining complex, located in northern Ohio, included one underground mine and one preparation
plant and loadout facility as of September 30, 2016. Our Sands Hill mining complex, located in southern Ohio, included two surface
mines, a preparation plant and a river terminal as of September 30, 2016. Our Rhino Western segment includes our underground mine
in the Western Bituminous region at our Castle Valley mining complex in Utah. Our Illinois Basin segment includes one underground
mine, preparation plant and river loadout facility at our Pennyrile mining complex located in western Kentucky, as well as our
Taylorville field reserves located in central Illinois.  

Evaluating
Our Results of Operations    

Our
management uses a variety of financial measurements to analyze our performance, including (1) Adjusted EBITDA, (2) coal revenues
per ton and (3) cost of operations per ton.  

Adjusted
EBITDA.   The discussion of our results of operations below includes references to, and analysis of, our segments 
Adjusted EBITDA results. Adjusted EBITDA represents net income before deducting interest expense, income taxes and depreciation,
depletion and amortization, while also excluding certain non-cash and/or non-recurring items. Adjusted EBITDA is used by management
primarily as a measure of our segments  operating performance. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to
net income, income from operations, cash flows from operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity
presented in accordance with GAAP. Because not all companies calculate Adjusted EBITDA identically, our calculation may not be
comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Please read   Reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to Net
Income by Segment  for reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA to net income by segment for each of the periods indicated.  

Coal
Revenues Per Ton   .  Coal revenues per ton represents coal revenues divided by tons of coal sold. Coal revenues per
ton is a key indicator of our effectiveness in obtaining favorable prices for our product.  

Cost
of Operations Per Ton   .  Cost of operations per ton sold represents the cost of operations (exclusive of depreciation,
depletion and amortization) divided by tons of coal sold. Management uses this measurement as a key indicator of the efficiency
of operations.  

Summary    

The
following table sets forth certain information regarding our revenues, operating expenses, other income and expenses, and operational
data for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:  

Three
Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2015    

Summary.
  For the three months ended September 30, 2016, our total revenues decreased to $43.4 million from $51.9 million for the
three months ended September 30, 2015, which is a 16.3% decrease. We sold approximately 0.8 million tons of coal for the three
months ended September 30, 2016, which is a 12.9% decrease compared to the tons of coal sold for the three months ended September
30, 2015. The decrease in revenue and tons sold was primarily the result of continued weak demand and low prices in the met and
steam coal markets, particularly in Central Appalachia, partially offset by increased sales from our Pennyrile operation in the
Illinois Basin. We believe the weak demand in the steam coal markets was primarily driven by a continued over-supply of low-priced
natural gas, which electric utilities utilize as a source of electricity generation in lieu of steam coal. We believe the weak
demand in the met coal markets was primarily driven by a decrease in worldwide steel production due to ongoing global economic
weakness, particularly in China. While coal prices have increased recently, particularly met coal prices, we do not anticipate
the recent price increase will benefit our financial results until 2017.  

Net
loss from continuing operations improved for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September
30, 2015. We generated a net loss from continuing operations of approximately $3.2 million for the three months ended September
30, 2016 compared to a net loss from continuing operations of approximately $10.4 million for the three months ended September
30, 2015. For the three months ended September 30, 2015, our total net loss from continuing operations was impacted by an asset
impairment charge of $2.3 million related to our Deane mining complex discussed earlier.  

Adjusted
EBITDA from continuing operations increased to $5.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $1.2 million for
the three months ended September 30, 2015. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations increased period to period primarily due
to the lower net loss generated year-to-year.  

Including
the loss from discontinued operations of approximately $0.6 million, our total net loss and Adjusted EBITDA for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 were $3.8 million and $4.9 million, respectively. Including the income from discontinued operations of
approximately $1.0 million, our total net loss and Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended September 30, 2015 were $9.3 million
and $2.8 million, respectively.  

Tons
Sold.   The following table presents tons of coal sold by reportable segment for the three months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015:  

*  
      Calculated
    percentages and the rounded totals presented are based upon actual whole ton amounts and not the rounded amounts presented
    in this table.   

We
sold approximately 0.8 million tons of coal for the three months ended September 30  ,
2016, which was a 12.9% decrease compared to  the three months ended September 30 , 2015.
 The decrease in tons sold year-to-year was primarily due to lower sales from our Central Appalachia
segment due to weak demand for met and steam coal from this region. Tons of coal sold in our Central Appalachia segment decreased
by approximately 22.5% to approximately 0.2 million tons for the three months ended September 30 , 2016  compared
to the three months ended September 30 , 2015 , primarily due to a decrease in steam coal
tons sold in the three months ended September 30  ,  2016  compared to 2015 due to
ongoing weak market demand for coal from this region. For our Northern Appalachia segment, tons of coal sold decreased by approximately
43.6% for the three months ended September 30 , 2016  compared to the three months ended
September 30 , 2015 as we experienced a decrease in tons sold from our Hopedale complex due to weak demand for coal from
this region . Coal sales from our Rhino Western segment decreased by approximately 21.0% for
the three months ended September 30 , 2016  compared to the same period in 2015 due to
decreased customer demand from our Castle Valley operation. For our Illinois Basin segment, tons of coal sold increased by approximately
45.4% for the three months ended September 30 , 2016  compared to the three months ended
September 30 , 2015 as  we increased production and sales year-to-year from our Pennyrile
mine in western Kentucky to meet our contracted sales commitments.    

Revenues.
  The following table presents revenues and coal revenues per ton by reportable segment for the three months ended September
30 ,  2016 and 2015:  

*  
      Percentages
    and per ton amounts are calculated based on actual amounts and not the rounded amounts presented in this table.   

**  
      The
    Other category includes results for our ancillary businesses. The activities performed by these ancillary businesses also
    do not directly relate to coal production. As a result, coal revenues and coal revenues per ton are not presented for the
    Other category.   

Our
coal revenues for the three months ended  September 30 , 2016 decreased by approximately
$4.5 million, or 9.8%, to approximately $41.0 million from approximately $45.5 million for the three months ended  September
30  ,  2015. The decrease in coal revenues was primarily due to fewer steam coal tons sold in Northern Appalachia,
 partially offset by  increased sales from our Pennyrile mine in the Illinois Basin .
 Coal revenues per ton was $50.09 for the three months ended  September 30 , 2016, an
increase of $1.71, or 3.50%, from $48.38 per ton for the three months ended  September 30 ,
2015. This increase in coal revenues per ton was primarily the result of a higher mix of higher priced met coal tons sold in Central
Appalachia compared to the prior period.  

For
our Central Appalachia segment, coal revenues decreased by approximately $1.1 million, or 9.5%, to approximately $10.4 million
for the three months ended  September 30 , 2016 from approximately $11.5 million for the
three months ended  September 30 , 2015. This decrease was primarily due to fewer steam
coal tons sold, which reflects the weak coal market conditions for coal from this region. Coal revenues per ton for our Central
Appalachia segment increased by $8.32, or 16.8%, to $57.91 per ton for the three months ended  September
30 , 2016 as compared to $49.59 for the three months ended  September 30  , 
2015, primarily due to a higher mix of higher priced met coal tons sold as steam coal tons decreased year-to-year due to ongoing
weak demand for steam coal from this region.  

For
our Northern Appalachia segment, coal revenues were approximately $8.8 million for the three months ended  September
30  ,  2016, a decrease of approximately $6.9 million, or 43.9%, from approximately $15.7 million for the three months
ended  September 30 , 2015. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in tons sold
from our Hopedale complex in Northern Appalachia due to weak demand for coal from the Northern Appalachia region during the three
months ended  September 30 , 2016. Coal revenues per ton for our Northern Appalachia segment
was primarily flat at $58.75 per ton for the three months ended  September 30 , 2016 as
compared to $59.13 per ton for the three months ended  September 30 , 2015.  

For
our Rhino Western segment, coal revenues decreased by approximately $1.5 million, or 17.0%, to approximately $7.2 million for
the three months ended  September 30 , 2016 from approximately $8.7 million for the three
months ended  September 30 , 2015, primarily due to a decrease in tons sold due to decreased
customer demand at our Castle Valley operation. Coal revenues per ton for our Rhino Western segment was $39.00 for the three months
ended  September 30 , 2016, an increase of $1.87, or 5.0%, from $37.13 for the three months
ended  September 30  ,  2015. The increase in coal revenues per ton was due to an
increase in the contracted sales prices for steam coal sales from our Castle Valley mine for the three months ended  September
30 , 2016 compared to the same period in 2015.  

For
our Illinois Basin segment, coal revenues of approximately $14.6 million for the three months ended  September
30 , 2016 increased by approximately $5.0 million, or 51.4%, compared to $9.6 million for the three months ended  September
30 , 2015. The increase was due to increased sales from our Pennyrile mine in western Kentucky to fulfill our customer contracts.
Coal revenues per ton for our Illinois Basin segment was $47.97 for the three months ended  September
30 , 2016, an increase of $1.90, or 4.1%, from $46.07 for the three months ended  September
30 , 2015. The increase in coal revenues per ton was due to higher contracted prices for tons sold.  

Other
revenues for our Other category was relatively flat at approximately $0.2 million for the three months ended  September
30 , 2016.  

Central
Appalachia Overview of Results by Product.   Additional information for the Central Appalachia segment detailing the types

**
Cost of operations presented for our Other category includes costs incurred by our ancillary businesses and our oil and natural
gas investments. The activities performed by these ancillary businesses do not directly relate to coal production. As a result,
per ton measurements are not presented for this category.  

Cost
of Operations   .  Total cost of operations was $35.2 million for the three months ended  September
30  ,  2016 as compared to $47.7 million for the three months ended  September 30 ,
2015. Our cost of operations per ton was $43.07 for the three months ended  September 30 ,
2016, a decrease of $7.66, or 15.1%, from the three months ended  September 30 , 2015.
Total cost of operations decreased primarily due to lower costs in Central Appalachia and Northern Appalachia, partially offset
by increased costs from higher production at our Pennyrile mine in the Illinois Basin. The decrease in the cost of operations
on a per ton basis was primarily due to a decrease from our Central Appalachia segment as we idled a majority of operations beginning
in the third quarter of 2015 to reduce excess coal inventory, which resulted in lower production and higher cost of operations
per ton during this 2015 period.  

Our
cost of operations for the Central Appalachia segment decreased by $7.8 million, or 52.8%, to $6.9 million for the three months
ended  September 30 , 2016 from $14.7 million for the three months ended  September
30 , 2015. Total cost of operations decreased year-to-year since as we optimized production during the three months ended
 September 30 , 2016 compared to the prior period. Our cost of operations per ton of $38.51
for the three months ended  September 30 , 2016 was a reduction of 39.1% compared to $63.19
per ton for the three months ended  September 30 , 2015, as we idled a majority of operations
beginning in the third quarter of 2015 to reduce excess coal inventory, which resulted in lower production and higher cost of
operations per ton during this 2015 period.  

In
our Northern Appalachia segment, our cost of operations decreased by $5.3 million, or 40.8%, to $7.8 million for the three months
ended  September 30 , 2016 from $13.1 million for the three months ended  September
30 , 2015. The decrease in cost of operations was due to reduced production in this region in response to weak market demand.
Our cost of operations per ton was $52.13 for the three months ended  September 30 , 2016,
an increase of $2.45, or 4.9%, compared to $49.68 for the three months ended  September 30 ,
2015. Cost of operations per ton increased slightly primarily due to fixed operating costs being allocated to lower production
and sales tons for the three months ended  September 30 , 2016 compared to the prior period.  

Our
cost of operations for the Rhino Western segment decreased by $1.9 million, or 26.3%, to $5.3 million for the three months ended
 September 30 , 2016 from $7.2 million for the three months ended  September
30 , 2015. Total cost of operations decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period
in 2015 due to decreased tons produced and sold from our Castle Valley operation due to weak customer demand. Our cost of operations
per ton was $28.82 for the three months ended  September 30 , 2016, a decrease of $2.09,
or 6.8%, compared to $30.91 for the three months ended  September 30 , 2015. Cost of operations
per ton decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 due to lower maintenance and
other costs incurred at our Castle Valley operation.  

Cost
of operations in our Illinois Basin segment was $13.4 million while cost of operations per ton was $43.99 for the three months
ended  September 30 , 2016, both of which related to our Pennyrile mining complex in western
Kentucky. For the three months ended  September 30 , 2015, cost of operations in our Illinois
Basin segment was $10.5 million and cost of operations per ton was $49.86. The increase in cost of operations was primarily the
result of increased production year-to-year at the Pennyrile complex, while cost of operations per ton decreased as we continued
to optimize the cost structure at this mining complex.  

Cost
of operations in our Other category decreased to $1.8 million for the three months ended  September
30 , 2016 compared to $2.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Cost of operations decreased primarily
due to decreased activity in our ancillary businesses.  

Freight
and Handling.   Total freight and handling cost decreased to $0.4 million for the three months ended  September
30 , 2016 as compared to $0.7 million for the three months ended  September 30 ,
2015 as we sold fewer tons from our Sands Hill mining complex that requires trucking to customers.  

Depreciation,
Depletion and Amortization   .  Total depreciation, depletion and amortization ( DD A ) expense for
the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $6.5 million as compared to $7.8 million for the three months ended September 30,
2015.  

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016, our depreciation cost decreased to $5.6 million compared to $7.2 million for the three
months ended September 30, 2015. This decrease primarily resulted from lower depreciation costs in our Central Appalachia segment
in the current quarter compared to the prior year as we disposed of excess equipment in this region.  

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016, our depletion cost was relatively flat at $0.4 million compared to $0.3 million for
the three months ended September 30, 2015.  

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016, our amortization cost was relatively flat at $0.5 million compared to $0.3 million
for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  

Selling,
General and Administrative.   Selling, general and administrative ( SG A ) expense for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 increased to $4.3 million as compared to $2.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015.
This increase was primarily attributable to a $2.0 million charge incurred during the three months ended September 30, 2016 for
a reserve against a note receivable that was recorded in 2015 related to the sale of the Deane mining complex discussed earlier.  

Interest
Expense   .  Interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased to $1.9 million as compared to
$1.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. This increase was primarily due to higher interest rates on our senior
secured credit facility.  

Net
Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations.   The following table presents net income (loss) from continuing operations by
reportable segment for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:  

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016, total net loss from continuing operations was a loss of approximately $3.2 million
compared to net loss from continuing operations of approximately $10.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015.
For the three months ended September 30, 2016, our total net loss from continuing operations was impacted by a charge of $2.0
million related to the reserve taken against the note receivable from our Deane mining complex sale discussed earlier. For the
three months ended September 30, 2015, our total net loss from continuing operations was impacted by an asset impairment charge
of $2.3 million related to our Deane mining complex discussed earlier.  

For
our Central Appalachia segment, net loss from continuing operations was approximately $1.6 million for the three months ended
September 30, 2016, a $6.8 million smaller net loss as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015, which was primarily
related to the $2.3 million asset impairment charge incurred during the three months ended September 30, 2015 for the Deane mining
complex discussed earlier. Net income from continuing operations in our Northern Appalachia segment increased by $1.3 million
to $3.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $1.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015.
This increase was primarily due to reducing costs at our Northern Appalachia operations. Net income (loss) from continuing operations
in our Rhino Western segment was at a break-even level for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to a net loss from
continuing operations of $0.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. This decrease in net loss was primarily the
result of lower costs at our Castle Valley operation during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the prior year.
For our Illinois Basin segment, we generated a net loss from continuing operations of $2.8 million for the three months ended
September 30, 2016, which was an improvement of $0.3 million compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. This decrease
in net loss was primarily the result of increased coal sales at our Pennyrile mining complex as well as lower costs per ton as
we continued to optimize the operations at this mining facility. For the Other category, we had a net loss from continuing operations
of $2.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to net loss from continuing operations of $0.3 million
for the three months ended September 30, 2015. This increase in net loss year to year was primarily attributable to a $2.0 million
charge incurred during the three months ended September 30, 2016 for a reserve against a note receivable that was recorded in
2015 related to the sale of the Deane mining complex discussed earlier.  

Adjusted
EBITDA from Continuing Operations.   The following table presents Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations by reportable
segment for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:  

Adjusted
EBITDA from continuing operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $5.5 million, an increase of $4.3 million
from the three months ended September 30, 2015. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations increased period to period primarily
due to the lower net loss generated year-to-year discussed above. Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015 were $5.6 million and $2.8 million, respectively, once the results from discontinued operations were included. Please
read   Reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA  for reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations
to net income on a segment basis.  

Nine
Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015    

Summary.
  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, our total revenues decreased to $124.3 million from $158.3 million for the
nine months ended September 30, 2015, which is a 21.5% decrease. We sold approximately 2.4 million tons of coal for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, which is a 13.8% decrease compared to the tons of coal sold for the nine months ended September 30,
2015. The decrease in revenue and tons sold was primarily the result of continued weak demand and low prices in the met and steam
coal markets, particularly in Central Appalachia, partially offset by increased sales from our Pennyrile operation in the Illinois
Basin. We believe the weak demand in the steam and met coal markets for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was due to the
same factors discussed earlier.  

Net
loss from continuing operations decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September
30, 2015. We generated a net loss from continuing operations of approximately $9.0 million for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 compared to a net loss from continuing operations of approximately $27.0 million for the nine months ended September
30, 2015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, our total net loss from continuing operations was benefited from a prior
service cost benefit of approximately $3.9 million resulting from the cancellation of the postretirement benefit plan at our Hopedale
operation, partially offset by a charge of $2.0 million related to the reserve taken against the note receivable from our Deane
mining complex sale discussed earlier. Net loss from continuing operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was impacted
by the $2.2 million asset impairment charge incurred for our Cana Woodford oil and gas properties discussed above as well as the
asset impairment charge of $2.3 million related to our Deane mining complex discussed earlier.  

Adjusted
EBITDA from continuing operations increased to $14.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $5.7 million for
the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations increased period to period primarily due
to the $3.9 million prior service cost benefit discussed above.  

Including
the loss from discontinued operations of approximately $117.9 million, our total net loss and Adjusted EBITDA for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 were $126.9 million and $16.7 million, respectively. Including the income from discontinued operations
of approximately $5.6 million, our total net loss and Adjusted EBITDA for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 were $21.3
million and $13.1 million, respectively.  

Tons
Sold.   The following table presents tons of coal sold by reportable segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015:  

*       Calculated
percentages and the rounded totals presented are based upon on actual whole ton amounts and not the rounded amounts presented
in this table.  

We
sold approximately 2.4 million tons of coal for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, which was a 13.8% decrease compared
to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in tons sold year-to-year was primarily due to lower sales from our
Central Appalachia and Northern Appalachia segments due to weak demand for steam coal from this region. Tons of coal sold in our
Central Appalachia segment decreased by approximately 47.6% to approximately 0.4 million tons for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to a decrease in steam coal tons sold in the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 2015 due to ongoing weak market demand for coal from this region. For our Northern
Appalachia segment, tons of coal sold decreased by approximately 43.6% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to
the nine months ended September 30, 2015 as we experienced a decrease in tons sold from our Hopedale complex due to weak demand
for coal from this region. Coal sales from our Rhino Western segment decreased by approximately 10.9% for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 due to decreased customer demand from our Castle Valley operation. For
our Illinois Basin segment, tons of coal sold increased by approximately 61.6% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared
to the nine months ended September 30, 2015 as we increased production and sales year-to-year from our Pennyrile mine in western
Kentucky to meet our contracted sales commitments.

       The Other category includes results for our ancillary businesses. The activities performed
by these ancillary businesses also do not directly relate to coal production. As a result, coal revenues and coal revenues per
ton are not presented for the Other category.  

Our
coal revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased by approximately $22.8 million, or 16.3%, to approximately
$116.7 million from approximately $139.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in coal revenues was
primarily due to fewer steam coal tons sold in Northern Appalachia and Central Appalachia, partially offset by increased sales
from our Pennyrile mine in the Illinois Basin. Coal revenues per ton was $48.52 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
a decrease of $1.44, or 2.9%, from $49.96 per ton for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This decrease in coal revenues
per ton was primarily the result of a larger mix of lower priced tons sold from Pennyrile.  

For
our Central Appalachia segment, coal revenues decreased by approximately $18.8 million, or 46.6%, to approximately $21.6 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from approximately $40.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This
decrease was primarily due to fewer steam coal tons sold, which reflects the weak coal market conditions for coal from this region.
Coal revenues per ton for our Central Appalachia segment increased by $1.08, or 1.9%, to $58.62 per ton for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 as compared to $57.54 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, primarily due to a higher mix of higher
priced met coal tons sold compared to the prior year.  

For
our Northern Appalachia segment, coal revenues were approximately $24.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
a decrease of approximately $20.1 million, or 44.9%, from approximately $44.7 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2015. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in tons sold from our Hopedale complex in Northern Appalachia due to weak
demand for coal from this region. Coal revenues per ton for our Northern Appalachia segment decreased by $1.27, or 2.2%, to $56.91
per ton for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $58.18 per ton for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.
This decrease was primarily due to the larger mix of lower priced tons being sold from our Sands Hill complex compared to higher
priced tons sold from our Hopedale complex.  

For
our Rhino Western segment, coal revenues decreased by approximately $2.1 million, or 7.7%, to approximately $25.1 million for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from approximately $27.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, primarily
due to a decrease in tons sold due to decreased customer demand at our Castle Valley operation. Coal revenues per ton for our
Rhino Western segment was $38.55 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $1.32, or 3.5%, from $37.23 for
the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in coal revenues per ton was due to an increase in the contracted sales
prices for steam coal sales from our Castle Valley mine for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period
in 2015.  

For
our Illinois Basin segment, coal revenues of approximately $45.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased
by approximately $18.2 million, or 67.1%, compared to $27.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase
was due to increased sales from our Pennyrile mine in western Kentucky to fulfill our customer contracts. Coal revenues per ton
for our Illinois Basin segment was $47.65 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $1.59, or 3.4%, from $46.06
for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in coal revenues per ton was due to higher contracted prices for tons
sold.  

Other
revenues for our Other category decreased to approximately $0.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared
to approximately $1.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This decrease in revenue was primarily due to the
decreased business activity in our ancillary businesses and oil and natural gas investments.

Costs
and Expenses.   The following table presents costs and expenses (including the cost of purchased coal) and cost of operations
per ton by reportable segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:  

*
Percentages and per ton amounts are calculated based on actual amounts and not the rounded amounts presented in this table.  

**
Cost of operations presented for our Other category includes costs incurred by our ancillary businesses and our oil and natural
gas investments. The activities performed by these ancillary businesses do not directly relate to coal production. As a result,
per ton measurements are not presented for this category.  

Cost
of Operations.   Total cost of operations was $98.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to
$139.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Our cost of operations per ton was $40.77 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, a decrease of $9.28, or 18.6%, from the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Total cost of operations decreased
primarily due to lower costs in Central Appalachia and Northern Appalachia as we reduced production in these regions in response
to weak market demand, partially offset by increased costs from higher production at our Pennyrile mine in the Illinois Basin.
The decrease in the cost of operations on a per ton basis was primarily due to a decrease from our Pennyrile mine in the Illinois
Basin as we increased and optimized production during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in
2015, as well as the $3.9 million benefit in Northern Appalachia during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from the prior
service cost benefit resulting from the cancellation of the postretirement benefit plan at our Hopedale operation.  

Our
cost of operations for the Central Appalachia segment decreased by $26.4 million, or 68.0%, to $12.5 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 from $38.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Total cost of operations decreased year-to-year
since we decreased production during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 in response to weak market conditions. Our cost
of operations per ton of $33.86 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was a reduction of 38.9% compared to $55.41 per ton
for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, as we produced coal from lower cost operations during the nine months ended September
30, 2016.  

In
our Northern Appalachia segment, our cost of operations decreased by $19.3 million, or 51.2%, to $18.5 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 from $37.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Our cost of operations per ton was $42.67
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, a decrease of $6.60, or 13.4%, compared to $49.27 for the nine months ended September
30, 2015. The decrease in cost of operations and cost of operations per ton was primarily due to the $3.9 million prior service
cost benefit during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 resulting from the cancellation of the postretirement benefit plan
at our Hopedale operation.  

Our
cost of operations for the Rhino Western segment decreased by $4.2 million, or 17.6%, to $19.9 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 from $24.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Our cost of operations per ton was $30.47
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, a decrease of $2.51, or 7.6%, compared to $32.98 for the nine months ended September
30, 2015. Total cost of operations and cost of operations per ton decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared
to the same period in 2015 due to lower maintenance and other costs from our Castle Valley operation.  

Cost
of operations in our Illinois Basin segment was $39.9 million while cost of operations per ton was $41.81 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, both of which related to our Pennyrile mining complex in western Kentucky. For the nine months ended
September 30, 2015, cost of operations in our Illinois Basin segment was $31.3 million and cost of operations per ton was $52.95.
The increase in cost of operations was primarily the result of increased production year-to-year at the Pennyrile complex, while
cost of operations per ton decreased as we continued to optimize the cost structure at this mining complex.  

Cost
of operations in our Other category was relatively flat at $7.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared
to $7.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  

Freight
and Handling.   Total freight and handling cost decreased to $1.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as
compared to $1.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 as we sold fewer tons from our Sands Hill mining complex
that requires trucking to customers.  

Depreciation,
Depletion and Amortization.   Total depreciation, depletion and amortization ( DD A ) expense for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 was $18.3 million as compared to $24.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, our depreciation cost decreased to $15.9 million compared to $22.2 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2015. This decrease primarily resulted from lower depreciation costs in our Central Appalachia segment
compared to the prior year as we disposed of excess equipment in this region.  

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, our depletion cost was relatively flat at $1.2 million compared to $1.1 million for
the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, our amortization cost was relatively flat at $1.2 million compared to the nine months
ended September 30, 2015.  

Selling,
General and Administrative.   Selling, general and administrative ( SG A ) expense for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 increased to $12.2 million as compared to $11.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This
increase was primarily attributable to a $2.0 million charge incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 for a reserve
against a note receivable that was recorded in 2015 related to the sale of the Deane mining complex discussed earlier.  

Interest
Expense   .  Interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased to $5.2 million as compared to
$3.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This increase was primarily due to higher interest rates on our senior
secured credit facility along with the write-off of approximately $0.3 million of our unamortized debt issuance costs during the
nine months ended September 30, 2016. This write-off was due to the fourth and fifth amendments of our credit facility during
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 that reduced the borrowing capacity from $100 million to $75 million. See the discussion
on our credit agreement in  Liquidity and Capital Resources - Amended and Restated Credit Agreement  for more information
on these amendments.  

Net
Income (Loss) from Continuing Operations.   The following table presents net income (loss) from continuing operations by
reportable segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:  

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, total net loss from continuing operations was a loss of approximately $9.0 million compared
to net loss from continuing operations of approximately $26.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. For the nine
months ended September 30, 2016, our total net loss from continuing operations was benefited from a prior service cost benefit
of approximately $3.9 million resulting from the cancellation of the postretirement benefit plan at our Hopedale operation. Net
loss from continuing operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was impacted by the $2.2 million asset impairment
charge incurred for our Cana Woodford oil and gas properties discussed above as well as the asset impairment charge of $2.3 million
related to our Deane mining complex discussed earlier. Including the loss from discontinued operations of approximately $117.9
million, our total net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $126.9 million. Including the income from discontinued
operations of approximately $5.6 million, our total net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was $21.3 million.  

For
our Central Appalachia segment, net loss from continuing operations was approximately $10.1 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, a $6.2 million smaller net loss as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015, which was primarily
related to the $2.3 million asset impairment charge incurred during the three months ended September 30, 2015 for the Deane mining
complex discussed earlier. Net income from continuing operations in our Northern Appalachia segment increased by $4.4 million
to $9.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $4.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This
increase was primarily due the prior service cost benefit of approximately $3.9 million resulting from the cancellation of the
postretirement benefit plan at our Hopedale operation. Net loss from continuing operations in our Rhino Western segment was a
loss of $0.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to a net loss from continuing operations of $3.0 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This decrease in net loss was primarily the result of lower costs at our Castle
Valley operation during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the prior year. For our Illinois Basin segment, we
generated a net loss from continuing operations of $4.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, which was an improvement
of $6.1 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This decrease in net loss was primarily the result of increased
coal sales at our Pennyrile mining complex as well as lower costs per ton as we continued to optimize the operations at this mining
facility. For the Other category, we had a net loss from continuing operations of $3.1 million for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 as compared to a net loss from continuing operations of $1.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This
increase in net loss year to year was primarily attributable to a $2.0 million charge incurred during the three months ended September
30, 2016 for a reserve against a note receivable that was recorded in 2015 related to the sale of the Deane mining complex discussed
earlier.  

Adjusted
EBITDA from Continuing Operations.   The following table presents Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations by reportable
segment for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015:  

Adjusted
EBITDA from continuing operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $14.9 million, an increase of $9.2 million
from the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations increased period to period due to the
improvement year-to-year in our loss from continuing operations as well as the prior service cost benefit of approximately $3.9
million resulting from the cancellation of the postretirement benefit plan at our Hopedale operation. Adjusted EBITDA for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $16.7 million and $13.1 million, respectively, once the results from discontinued
operations were included. Please read   Reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA  for reconciliations of Adjusted
EBITDA from continuing operations to net income on a segment basis.

                                         the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded a $2.0 million reserve
                                         against a note receivable that was recorded in 2015 related to the sale of the Deane
                                         mining complex discussed earlier. We believe that the isolation and presentation of this
                                         specific item to arrive at Adjusted EBITDA is useful because it enhances investors

                                         the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded a gain of approximately
                                         $1.7 million for the extinguishment of debt. We executed an agreement with the third
                                         party that held approximately $2.8 million of other notes payable to settle the debt
                                         for $1.1 million of cash consideration, which resulted in an approximate $1.7 million
                                         gain from the extinguishment of this debt. We believe that the isolation and presentation

(3)    During
                                         the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, we recorded asset impairment losses
                                         of approximately $2.3 million and $4.5 million, respectively. For the three months ended
                                         September 30, 2015, we recorded an asset impairment loss of approximately $2.3 million
                                         for our Deane mining complex since this asset is classified as held for sale and was
                                         written down to its estimated fair value less costs to sell as of September 30, 2015.
                                         For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we recorded an additional asset impairment
                                         loss of approximately $2.2 million for our Cana Woodford mineral rights since this asset
                                         was classified as held for sale and was written down to its estimated fair value less

                                         the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded losses of $0.5 million
                                         and $119.2 million related to the sale of our Elk Horn coal leasing company that was
                                         discussed earlier. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, we recorded

(2)    For
                                         the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded a $2.0 million reserve
                                         against a note receivable that was recorded in 2015 related to the sale of the Deane
                                         mining complex discussed earlier. During the three and nine months ended September 30,
                                         2015, we recorded provisions for doubtful accounts of approximately $0.1 million and

                                         Appalachia that were in bankruptcy proceedings. We believe that the isolation and presentation

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

Liquidity    

The
principal indicators of our liquidity are its cash on hand and availability under Rhino s Credit Facility. As of September
30, 2016, Rhino s available liquidity was $4.0 million, which was comprised of the availability under its Credit Facility.  

Our
business is capital intensive and requires substantial capital expenditures for purchasing, upgrading and maintaining equipment
used in developing and mining our reserves, as well as complying with applicable environmental and mine safety laws and regulations.
Our principal liquidity requirements are to finance current operations, fund capital expenditures, including acquisitions from
time to time, and service our debt. Historically, our sources of liquidity included cash generated by our operations, borrowings
under our credit agreement and issuances of equity securities. Our ability to access the capital markets on economic terms in
the future will be affected by general economic conditions, the domestic and global financial markets, our operational and financial
performance, the value and performance of our equity securities, prevailing commodity prices and other macroeconomic factors outside
of our control. Failure to obtain financing or to generate sufficient cash flow from operations could cause us to significantly
reduce our spending and to alter our short- or long-term business plan. We may also be required to consider other options, such
as selling assets or merger opportunities, and depending on the urgency of our liquidity constraints, we may be required to pursue
such an option at an inopportune time.  

Prior
to Rhino s entry into the Fifth Amendment, Rhino was unable to demonstrate that it had sufficient liquidity to operate its
business over the subsequent twelve months and thus, substantial doubt was raised about its ability to continue as a going concern.
Accordingly, its independent registered public accounting firm included an emphasis paragraph with respect to its ability to continue
as a going concern in its report on Rhino s consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015. The
presence of the going concern emphasis paragraph in its auditors  report may have an adverse impact on its relationship
with third parties with whom it does business, including its customers, vendors, lenders and employees, making it difficult to
raise additional debt or equity financing to the extent needed and conduct normal operations. As a result, its business, results
of operations, financial condition and prospects could be materially adversely affected.  

On
March 17, 2016, the Operating Company, as borrower, and Rhino and certain of its subsidiaries, as guarantors, entered into a fourth
amendment (the  Fourth Amendment ) of the Credit Facility. The Fourth Amendment amended the definition of change of
control in the Credit Facility to permit the Company to purchase the membership interests of the General Partner.  

On
May 13, 2016, the Operating Company, as borrower, and Rhino and certain of its subsidiaries, as guarantors, entered into the Fifth
Amendment of the Credit Facility, which extended the term to July 31, 2017 (see   Liquidity and Capital Resources 
Credit Facility  for further details of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments).  

In
order to borrow under the Credit Facility, Rhino must make certain representations and warranties to its lenders at the time of
each borrowing. If it is unable to make these representations and warranties, it would be unable to borrow under its Credit Facility,
absent a waiver. Furthermore, if it violates any of the covenants or restrictions in its Credit Facility, including the maximum
leverage ratio and minimum EBITDA requirement, some or all of its indebtedness may become immediately due and payable, and its
lenders  commitment to make further loans to it may terminate. Given the continued weak demand and low prices for met and
steam coal, Rhino may not be able to continue to give the required representations or meet all of the covenants and restrictions
included in the Credit Facility. If it is unable to give a required representation or it violates a covenant or restriction, then
it will need a waiver from its lenders in order to continue to borrow under our Credit Facility. Although Rhino believes our lenders
loans are well secured under the terms of the Credit Facility, there is no assurance that the lenders would agree to any such
waiver.  

Rhino
continues to take measures, including the suspension of cash distributions on its common and subordinated units and cost and productivity
improvements, to enhance and preserve its liquidity so that it can fund its ongoing operations and necessary capital expenditures
and meet its financial commitments and debt service obligations. For the quarter ended June 30, 2016, Rhino continued the suspension
of the cash distribution for its common units, which was initially suspended beginning with the quarter ended June 30, 2015. For
the quarters ended September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2014, Rhino announced cash distributions of $0.05 per common unit, or $0.20
per unit on an annualized basis, and for the quarter ended March 31, 2015, it announced cash distributions of $0.02 per common
unit, or $0.08 per unit on an annualized basis. Each of these quarters  distribution levels were lower than the previous
quarters  distribution amounts of $0.445 per common unit, or $1.78 per unit on an annualized basis. Rhino has not paid any
distribution on its subordinated units for any quarter after the quarter ended March 31, 2012. The distribution suspension and
prior reductions were the result of prolonged weakness in the coal markets, which has continued to adversely affect its cash flow.  

Cash
Flows    

Net
cash provided by operating activities was $3.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to net cash used
by operating activities of $.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This increase in cash provided by operating
activities was primarily the result of cash provided by operations by Rhino, which the Company acquired majority control of on
March 17, 2016. However, cash flow from operations at Rhino was reduced from historical levels as a result of ongoing weak coal
market conditions discussed above for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to 2015.  

Net
cash provided by investing activities was $3.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to cash used for
investing activities of $.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Net cash provided by investing activities is
primarily related to proceeds from the sale of the Elk Horn coal leasing operation.  

Net
cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $13.7 million, which was primarily attributable
to net repayments on our revolving credit facility with proceeds from the sale of our Elk Horn coal leasing operation as well
as contributions from royal s acquisition of common units, offset by $2.2 from the issuance of convertible notes in a private
placement. Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was $5.2 million, which was
primarily attributable to proceeds from related party loans and proceeds from the issuance of common stock in a private placement.  

Capital
Expenditures    

Our
mining operations require investments to expand, upgrade or enhance existing operations and to meet environmental and safety regulations.
Maintenance capital expenditures are those capital expenditures required to maintain our long term operating capacity. Examples
of maintenance capital expenditures include expenditures associated with the replacement of equipment and coal reserves, whether
through the expansion of an existing mine or the acquisition or development of new reserves to the extent such expenditures are
made to maintain our long term operating capacity. Expansion capital expenditures are those capital expenditures that we expect
will increase our operating capacity over the long term. Examples of expansion capital expenditures include the acquisition of
reserves, equipment for a new mine or the expansion of an existing mine to the extent such expenditures are expected to expand
our long-term operating capacity.  

Actual
maintenance capital expenditures for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were approximately $1.1 million. These amounts were
primarily used to rebuild, repair or replace older mining equipment. Expansion capital expenditures for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 were approximately $4.8 million, which were primarily related to the payments for the final development of
Rhino s new Riveredge mine on its Pennyrile property in western Kentucky.  

Credit
Facility    

On
July 29, 2011, Rhino and its subsidiaries executed the Credit Facility agreement. The maximum availability under the Credit Facility
was $300.0 million, with a one-time option to increase the availability by an amount not to exceed $50.0 million. Of the $300.0
million, $75.0 million was available for letters of credit. In April 2015, the Credit Facility was amended and the borrowing commitment
under the facility was reduced to $100.0 million and the amount available for letters of credit was reduced to $50.0 million.
As described below, in March 2016 and May 2016, the borrowing commitment under the facility was further reduced to $80.0 million
and $75.0 million, respectively, and the amount available for letters of credit was reduced to $30.0 million.  

Loans
under the Credit Facility currently bear interest at a base rate equaling the prime rate plus an applicable margin of 3.50%. The
Credit Facility also contains letter of credit fees equal to an applicable margin of 5.00% multiplied by the aggregate amount
available to be drawn on the letters of credit, and a 0.15% fronting fee payable to the administrative agent. In addition, Rhino
incurs a commitment fee on the unused portion of the Credit Facility at a rate of 1.00% per annum. Borrowings on the Credit Facility
are collateralized by all of Rhino s unsecured assets.  

The
Credit Facility requires Rhino to maintain certain minimum financial ratios and contains certain restrictive provisions, including
among others, restrictions on making loans, investments and advances, incurring additional indebtedness, guaranteeing indebtedness,
creating liens, and selling or assigning stock. As of and for the twelve months ended September 30, 2016, Rhino was in compliance
with respect to all covenants contained in the credit agreement.  

On
March 17, 2016, Rhino entered into the Fourth Amendment of the Credit Facility. The Fourth Amendment amended the definition of
change of control in the Credit Facility to permit the Company to purchase the membership interests of the general partner. The
Fourth Amendment reduced the borrowing capacity under the credit facility to a maximum of $80 million and reduced the amount available
for letters of credit to $30 million. The Fourth Amendment eliminated the option to borrow funds utilizing the LIBOR rate plus
an applicable margin and established the borrowing rate for all borrowings under the facility to be based upon the current PRIME
rate plus an applicable margin of 3.50%. The Fourth Amendment eliminated the capability to make Swing Loans under the facility
and eliminated Rhino s ability to pay distributions to its common or subordinated unitholders. The Fourth Amendment altered
the maximum leverage ratio, calculated as of the end of the most recent month, on a trailing twelve-month basis, to 6.75 to 1.00.
The leverage ratio shall be reduced by 0.50 to 1.00 for every $10 million of net cash proceeds, in the aggregate, received by
us after the date of the Fourth Amendment from a liquidity event; provided, however, that in no event shall the maximum permitted
leverage ratio be reduced below 3.00 to 1.00. A liquidity event is defined in the Fourth Amendment as the issuance of any equity
by us on or after the Fourth Amendment effective date (other than the Royal equity contribution discussed above), or the disposition
of any assets by us. The Fourth Amendment required us to maintain minimum liquidity of $5 million and minimum EBITDA (as defined
in the credit agreement), calculated as of the end of the most recent month, on a trailing twelve month basis, of $8 million.
The Fourth Amendment limited the amount of Rhino s capital expenditures to $15 million, calculated as of end of the most
recent month, on a trailing twelve-month basis. The Fourth Amendment required that Rhino provide monthly financial statements
and a weekly rolling thirteen-week cash flow forecast to the Administrative Agent.  

On
May 13, 2016, Rhino entered into the Fifth Amendment of the Credit Facility that extended the term to July 31, 2017. Per the Fifth
Amendment, the Credit Facility will be automatically extended to December 31, 2017 if revolving credit commitments are reduced
to $55 million or less on or before July 31, 2017. The Fifth Amendment immediately reduced the revolving credit commitments under
the Credit Facility to a maximum of $75 million and maintained the amount available for letters of credit at $30 million. The
Fifth Amendment further reduced the revolving credit commitments over time on a dollar-for-dollar basis in amounts equal to each
of the following: (i) the face amount of any letter of credit that expires or whose face amount is reduced by any such dollar
amount, (ii) the net proceeds received from any asset sales, (iii) the Royal scheduled capital contributions (as outline below),
(iv) the net proceeds from the issuance of any equity by Rhino up to $20.0 million (other than equity issued in exchange for any
Royal contribution as outlined in the Securities Purchase Agreement or the Royal scheduled capital contributions to us as outlined
below), and (v) the proceeds from the incurrence of any subordinated debt. The first $11 million of proceeds received from any
equity issued by Rhino described in clause (iv) above shall also satisfy the Royal scheduled capital contributions as outlined
below. The Fifth Amendment requires Royal to contribute $2 million each quarter beginning September 30, 2016 through September
30, 2017 and $1 million on December 1, 2017, for a total of $11 million. The Fifth Amendment further reduces the revolving credit
commitments as described in Note 11 to the condensed consolidated financial statements.  

In
July 2016, the Rhino entered into a sixth amendment (the  Sixth Amendment ) of its amended and restated senior secured
credit facility that permitted the sale of Elk Horn that was discussed earlier. The Sixth Amendment reduced the maximum commitment
amount allowed under the credit facility based on the initial cash proceeds of $10.5 million that were received for the Elk Horn
sale. The Sixth Amendment further reduces the maximum commitment amount allowed under the credit facility for the additional $1.5
million to be received from the Elk Horn sale by $375,000 each quarterly period beginning September 30, 2016 through June 30,
2017.  

At
September 30, 2016, the Operating Company had borrowings outstanding (excluding letters of credit) of $30.4 million at a variable
interest rate of PRIME plus 3.50% (7.00% at September 30, 2016). In addition, the Operating Company had outstanding letters of
credit of approximately $27.8 million at a fixed interest rate of 5.00% at September 30, 2016. Based upon a maximum borrowing
capacity of 6.50 times a trailing twelve-month EBITDA calculation (as defined in the credit agreement), the Operating Company
had available borrowing capacity of approximately $4.0 million at September 30, 2016. During the three month period ended September
30, 2016, Rhino had average borrowings outstanding of approximately $37.7 million under the Credit Facility.  

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements   

In
the normal course of business, we are a party to certain off-balance sheet arrangements. These arrangements include guarantees
and financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk, such as bank letters of credit and surety bonds. No liabilities related
to these arrangements are reflected in our consolidated balance sheet, and we do not expect any material adverse effects on our
financial condition, results of operations or cash flows to result from these off-balance sheet arrangements.  

Federal
and state laws require us to secure certain long-term obligations related to mine closure and reclamation costs. We typically
secure these obligations by using surety bonds, an off-balance sheet instrument. The use of surety bonds is less expensive for
us than the alternative of posting a 100% cash bond or a bank letter of credit, either of which would require a greater use of
our amended and restated credit agreement. We then use bank letters of credit to secure our surety bonding obligations as a lower
cost alternative than securing those bonds with a committed bonding facility pursuant to which we are required to provide bank
letters of credit in an amount of up to 25% of the aggregate bond liability. To the extent that surety bonds become unavailable,
we would seek to secure our reclamation obligations with letters of credit, cash deposits or other suitable forms of collateral.  

As
of September 30, 2016, Rhino had $27.8 million in letters of credit outstanding, of which $22.4 million served as collateral for
surety bonds.  

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates   

Our
financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles that are generally accepted in the United States. The
preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount
of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management evaluates
its estimates and judgments on an on-going basis. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and other
factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Nevertheless, actual results may differ from the estimates
used and judgments made.  

The
accounting policies and estimates that we have adopted and followed in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements
are fully described in Rhino s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and Royal s Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2015. There have been no significant changes in these policies and estimates
as of September 30, 2016.  

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements   

Refer
to Item 1. Note 2 of the notes to the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting
pronouncements, which is incorporated herein by reference. There are no known future impacts or material changes or trends of
new accounting guidance beyond the disclosures provided in Note 2.

ITEM
4: Controls and Procedures   

(a)
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  

Under
the PCAOB standards, a control deficiency exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees,
in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A significant
deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting that is less severe
than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit the attention by those responsible for oversight of the company s
financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting,
such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company s annual or interim financial statements
will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.  

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial
officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) and
Rule 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act), as of September 30, 2016. Based
on that evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of the evaluation date, such controls
and procedures were not effective.  

(b)
Changes in Internal Controls  

In
the Company s Form 10-K for the year ended August 31, 2015, the Company disclosed that its disclosure controls and procedures
were not effective due to lack of segregation of duties. The Company has begun the process of establishing the necessary controls
and procedures, however, these changes have not yet been implemented.

Exhibit
95   

Federal
Mine Safety and Health Act Information    

The
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the  Dodd-Frank Act ) requires issuers to include in periodic
reports filed with the SEC certain information relating to citations or orders for violations of standards under the Federal Mine
Safety and Health Act of 1977 (the  Mine Act ). The following disclosures respond to that legislation.  

Whenever
MSHA believes that a violation of the Mine Act, any health or safety standard, or any regulation has occurred, it may issue a
citation that describes the violation and fixes a time within which the operator must abate the violation. In these situations,
MSHA typically proposes a civil penalty, or fine, as a result of the violation, that the operator is ordered to pay. In evaluating
the information below regarding mine safety and health, investors should take into account factors such as: (a) the number of
citations and orders will vary depending on the size of a coal mine, (b) the number of citations issued will vary from inspector
to inspector and mine to mine, and (c) citations and orders can be contested and appealed, and during that process are often reduced
in severity and amount, and are sometimes dismissed.  

Responding
to the Dodd-Frank Act legislation, we report that, for the three months ended September 30, 2016, none of our subsidiaries received
written notice from MSHA of (a) a violation under section 110(b)(2) of the Mine Act for failure to make reasonable efforts to
eliminate a known violation of a mandatory safety or health standard that substantially proximately caused, or reasonably could
have been expected to cause, death or serious bodily injury, (b) a pattern of violations of mandatory health or safety standards
under section 104(e) of the Mine Act, or (c) a violation under section 107(a) of the Mine Act for alleged conditions or practices
that could reasonably be expected to cause death or serious physical harm. In addition, none of our subsidiaries suffered any
mining related fatalities during the three months ended September 30, 2016.  

The
following table sets out information required by the Dodd-Frank Act for the three months ended September 30, 2016. The mine data
retrieval system maintained by MSHA may show information that is different than what is provided herein. Any such difference may
be attributed to the need to update that information on MSHA s system and/or other factors. The table also displays pending
legal actions before the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission (the  Commission ) that were initiated during
the three months ended September 30, 2016 as well as total pending legal actions that were pending before the Commission as of
September 30, 2016, which includes the legal proceedings before the Commission as well as all contests of citations and penalty
assessments which are not before an administrative law judge. All of these pending legal actions constitute challenges by us of
citations issued by MSHA. Since none of our subsidiaries received notice from MSHA of a pattern of violations of mandatory health
or safety standards under section 104(e) of the Mine Act, the column that would normally display this information in the table
below has been omitted for ease of presentation.  

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016    

1
 The foregoing table does not include the following: (i) facilities which have been idle or closed unless they received a
citation or order issued by MSHA; and (ii) permitted mining sites where we have not begun operations and therefore have not received
any citations.  

2
 Mine Act section 104(a) citations shown above are for alleged violations of health or safety standards that could significantly
and substantially contribute to a serious injury if left unabated.  

3
 Mine Act section 104(b) orders are for alleged failures to totally abate a citation within the period of time specified
in the citation. These orders result in an order of immediate withdrawal from the area of the mine affected by the condition until
MSHA determines that the violation has been abated.  

4
 Mine Act section 104(d) citations and orders are for an alleged unwarrantable failure (i.e. aggravated conduct constituting
more than ordinary negligence) to comply with a mandatory mining health or safety standard or regulation. These types of violations
could significantly and substantially contribute to a serious injury; however, the conditions do not cause imminent danger.  

5
 Mine Act section 107(a) orders are for alleged conditions or practices which could reasonably be expected to cause death
or serious physical harm before such condition or practice can be abated and result in orders of immediate withdrawal from the
area of the mine affected by the condition.  

6
 The total number of flagrant violations issued under section 110(b)(2) of the Mine Act.  

7
 Total dollar value of MSHA assessments proposed during the three months ended June 30, 2016.  

8
 Any pending legal action before the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission (the  Commission ) involving
a coal mine owned and operated by us. The number of legal actions pending as of June 30, 2016 that fall into each of the following
categories is as follows:  

(a)
Contests of citations and orders: 3  

  (b)
Contests of proposed penalties: 5  

  (c)
Complaints for compensation under Section 111 of the Mine Act: 0  

  (d)
Complaints of discharge, discrimination or interference under Section 105 of the Mine Act: 0  

  (e)
Applications for temporary relief under Section 105(b)(2) of the Mine Act: 0  

  (f)
Appeals of judges  decisions or orders to the Commission: 0
