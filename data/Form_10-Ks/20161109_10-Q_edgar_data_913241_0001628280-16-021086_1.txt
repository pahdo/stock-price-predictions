Note A   Basis of Reporting 
    
  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of Steven Madden, Ltd. and subsidiaries (the  Company ) have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ). Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, such statements include all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring items) which are considered necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position of the Company and the results of its operations and cash flows for the periods presented. Certain adjustments were made to prior years' amounts to conform to the   2016   presentation. The results of operations for the   three and nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full year. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related disclosures for the year ended   December 31, 2015   included in the Annual Report of Steven Madden, Ltd. on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 26, 2016.   
   
  Note B   Use of Estimates 
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
  Significant areas involving management estimates include allowances for bad debts, returns and customer chargebacks, inventory  valuation, valuation of intangible assets, litigation reserves and contingent payment liabilities. The Company provides reserves on trade accounts receivables and factor receivables for future customer chargebacks and markdown allowances, discounts, returns and other miscellaneous compliance-related deductions that relate to the current period sales. The Company evaluates anticipated chargebacks by reviewing several performance indicators of its major customers. These performance indicators, which include retailers  inventory levels, sell-through rates and gross margin levels, are analyzed by management to estimate the amount of the anticipated customer allowance. 

Note C   Factor Receivable 
  The Company has a collection agency agreement with Rosenthal   Rosenthal, Inc. ( Rosenthal ). The agreement can be terminated by the Company or Rosenthal at any time upon 60 days prior written notice. Under the agreement, the Company can request advances from Rosenthal of up to   85%   of aggregate receivables submitted to Rosenthal. The agreement provides the Company with a   $30,000   credit facility with a   $15,000   sub-limit for letters of credit at an interest rate based, at the Company s election, upon a calculation that utilizes either the prime rate minus   0.5%   or LIBOR plus   2.5%  . As of   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , no borrowings were outstanding.  Further as of   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , there were open letters of credit of   $0   and   $337  , respectively. The Company also pays Rosenthal a fee based on a percentage of the gross invoice amount submitted to Rosenthal.  With respect to receivables related to our private label business, the fee is   0.14%   of the gross invoice amount. With respect to all other receivables, the fee is   0.20%   of the gross invoice amount.  Rosenthal assumes the credit risk on a substantial portion of the receivables that the Company submits to it and, to the extent of any loans made to the Company, Rosenthal maintains a lien on the Company s receivables to secure the Company s obligations.   
   
  Note D   Notes Receivable 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , Notes Receivable were comprised of the following:  

In connection with the Company's February 21, 2012 acquisition of all of the assets comprising the footwear, handbags and accessories wholesale and retail businesses of Steve Madden Canada Inc., Steve Madden Retail Canada Inc., Pasa Agency Inc.

Note D   Notes Receivable (continued) 
    
  and Gelati Imports Inc. (collectively, "SM Canada"), which had been the Company's sole distributor in Canada since 1994, the Company provided an interest-free loan to the seller of SM Canada in the principal amount of $  3,107   Canadian dollars (which converted to approximately $  3,085   in U.S. dollars at the time of the acquisition). The note was recorded net of the imputed interest, which is being amortized to income over the term of the note. The loan is payable in five annual installments due on dates that correspond with the five annual earn-out payment dates under the acquisition agreement (to the extent such contingent consideration is earned as a result of SM Canada's financial performance in the earn-out periods; see Note F). 
    
  Any earn-out payment not achieved with respect to an earn-out period may result in less than the entire principal amount of the loan being repaid. In such event the unpaid annual installment of the principal amount of the loan will be forgiven. 
   
  Note E   Marketable Securities 
  Marketable securities consist primarily of certificates of deposit and corporate bonds with maturities greater than three months and up to ten years at the time of purchase as well as marketable equity securities. These securities, which are classified as available-for-sale, are carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of any tax effect, reported in stockholders  equity as accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).  These securities are classified as current and non-current marketable securities based upon their maturities. Amortization of premiums and discounts is included in interest income. For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the amortization of bond premiums totaled $  307   and   $925   compared to   $347   and   $1,040   for the comparable period in   2015  .  The values of these securities may fluctuate as a result of changes in equity values, market interest rates and credit risk. The schedule of maturities at   September 30, 2016   and December 31,   2015   are as follows: 

For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , gains of   $3   and losses of   $776   were reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income and recognized in the income statement in other income compared to losses of   $14   and gains of   $82   for the comparable periods in   2015  .  For the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2016  , current marketable securities included unrealized losses of   $350   and long-term marketable securities included unrealized gains of   $939   and unrealized losses of   $35  .  For the comparable period in 2015, current marketable securities included unrealized losses of   $640   while long-term marketable securities included unrealized gains of   $151   and unrealized losses of   $962  . 
   
  Note F   Fair Value Measurement 
  The accounting guidance under Accounting Standards Codification  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures  ( ASC 820-10 ) requires the Company to make disclosures about the fair value of certain of its assets and liabilities. ASC 820-10 clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions. ASC 820-10 utilizes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. A brief description of those three levels is as follows: 

Level 1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
                
    Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. 
                
    Level 3: Significant unobservable inputs.

Note F   Fair Value Measurement (continued) 
  The majority of our level 3 balances consist of contingent consideration related to various acquisitions and certain notes receivable.  The changes in our level 3 assets and liabilities for the periods ended September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are as follows: 

Forward contracts are entered into to manage the risk associated with the volatility of future cash flows (see Note O).  Fair value of these instruments is based on observable market transactions of spot and forward rates. 
  For the note receivable due from related party (see Note I) and due from the sellers of SM Canada (see Note D), the carrying value was determined to be the fair value, based upon their actual and imputed interest rates, which approximate current market interest rates.  
    
  The Company has recorded a liability for potential contingent consideration in connection with the December 30, 2014 acquisition of all of the outstanding capital stock of Trendy Imports S.A. de C.V., Comercial Diecisiette S.A. de C.V. and Maximus Designer Shoes S.A. de C.V. (together, "SM Mexico"). Pursuant to the terms of an earn-out agreement between the Company and the seller of SM Mexico, earn-out payments, if achieved, are due annually to the seller of SM Mexico based on the financial performance of SM Mexico for each of the twelve-month periods ending on December 31, 2015 and 2016, inclusive. The fair value of the contingent payments was estimated using the present value of management s projections of the financial results of SM Mexico during the earn-out period. The current portion of the earn-out due, based on the twelve-month period ending December 31, 2015, approximates the recorded value. An earn-out payment of   $3,483   for the period ended December 31, 2015 was paid to the seller of SM Mexico in the first quarter of this year. 
    
  The Company has recorded a liability for potential contingent consideration in connection with the August 13, 2014 acquisition of all of the outstanding capital stock of Dolce Vita Holdings, Inc. ("Dolce Vita"). Pursuant to the terms of an earn-out agreement between the Company and the seller of Dolce Vita, earn-out payments are due annually to the seller of Dolce Vita based on the financial performance of Dolce Vita for each of the twelve-month periods ending on September 30, 2015 and 2016, inclusive, provided that the aggregate minimum earn-out payment shall be no less than   $5,000  . The fair value of the contingent payments was estimated using the present value of management s projections of the financial results of Dolce Vita during the earn-out period.

Note F   Fair Value Measurement (continued) 
    
  The first earn-out payment of   $1,019   was made to the sellers of Dolce Vita in the fourth quarter of 2015 and the second payment will be payable in the last quarter of 2016. 
    
  The Company has recorded a liability for potential contingent consideration in connection with the February 21, 2012 acquisition of SM Canada. Pursuant to the terms of an earn-out agreement between the Company and the seller of SM Canada, earn-out payments, if achieved, are due annually to the seller of SM Canada based on the financial performance of SM Canada for each of the 12-month periods ending on March 31, 2013 through 2017, inclusive. The fair value of the contingent payments was estimated using the present value of management s projections of the financial results of SM Canada during the earn-out period.  An earn-out payment of   $2,798   for the period ended March 31, 2016 was paid to the seller of SM Canada in the second quarter of this year. 
    
  The Company has recorded a liability for potential contingent consideration in connection with the May 25, 2011 acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Cejon, Inc. and Cejon Accessories, Inc. and all of the outstanding membership interests in New East Designs, LLC (collectively, "Cejon"). Pursuant to the terms of an earn-out agreement between the Company and the sellers of Cejon, earn-out payments, if achieved, are made annually to the sellers of Cejon, based on the financial performance of Cejon for each of the twelve-month periods ending on June 30, 2012 through 2016, inclusive. The fair value of the contingent payments was estimated using the present value of management s projections of the financial results of Cejon during the earn-out period. A final earn-out payment of   $1,767   for the period ended June 30, 2016 was paid to the seller of Cejon, Inc. in the third quarter of this year. 
    
  The carrying value of certain financial instruments such as accounts receivable, factor accounts receivable and accounts payable approximates their fair values due to the short-term nature of their underlying terms. The fair values of investment in marketable securities available for sale are determined by reference to publicly quoted prices in an active market. Fair value of the notes receivable held by the Company approximates their carrying value based upon their imputed or actual interest rate, which approximates applicable current market interest rates. 
   
  Note G   Revenue Recognition 
    
  The Company recognizes revenue on wholesale sales when (i) products are shipped pursuant to its standard terms, which are freight on board Company warehouse, or when products are delivered to the consolidators, or any other destination, as per the terms of the customers  purchase order, (ii) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (iii) the price is fixed and determinable and (iv) collection is reasonably assured. Sales reductions on wholesale sales for anticipated discounts, allowances and other deductions are recognized during the period when sales are recorded. With the exception of our cold weather accessories and Blondo businesses, normally we do not accept returns from our wholesale customers unless there are product quality issues, which we charge back to the vendors at cost. Sales of cold weather accessories and Blondo products to wholesale customers are recorded net of returns, which are estimated based on historical experience. Such amounts have historically not been material.  
    
  Retail sales are recognized when the payment is received from customers and are recorded net of estimated returns. The Company generates commission income acting as a buying agent by arranging to manufacture private label shoes to the specifications of its customers. The Company s commission revenue also includes fees charged for its design, product and development services provided to certain suppliers in connection with the Company s private label business. Commission revenue and product and development fees are recognized as earned when title to the product transfers from the manufacturer to the customer and collections are reasonably assured and are reported on a net basis after deducting related operating expenses. 
    
  The Company licenses its Steve Madden , Steven by Steve Madden , Madden Girl  and Stevies  trademarks for use in connection with the manufacture, marketing and sale of outerwear, hosiery, activewear, sleepwear, jewelry, watches, hair accessories, umbrellas, bedding, luggage, and men s leather accessories.  In addition, the Company licenses the Betsey Johnson  trademark for use in connection with the manufacture, marketing and sale of hosiery, swimwear, outerwear, sleepwear, activewear, jewelry, watches, bedding, luggage, stationery, umbrellas, and household goods; and furthermore, licenses the Dolce Vita  trademark for use in connection with the manufacture, marketing and sale of women's and children s apparel.   The license agreements require the licensee to pay the Company a royalty and, in substantially all of the agreements, an advertising fee, both of which are based on the higher of a minimum or a net sales percentage as defined in the various agreements. In addition, under

  ($ in thousands except share and per share data) 

Note G   Revenue Recognition (continued) 
    
  the terms of retail selling agreements, most of the Company s international distributors are required to pay the Company a royalty based on a percentage of net retail sales, in addition to a commission and a design fee on the purchases of the Company s products. Licensing revenue is recognized on the basis of net sales reported by the licensees, or the minimum guaranteed royalties, if higher.  
  In substantially all of the Company s license agreements, the minimum guaranteed royalty is earned and receivable on a quarterly basis. 
   
  Note H   Sales Deductions 
    
  The Company supports retailers  initiatives to maximize sales of the Company s products on the retail floor by subsidizing the co-op advertising programs of such retailers, providing them with inventory markdown allowances and participating in various other marketing initiatives of its major customers. In addition, the Company accepts returns for damaged products for which the Company s costs are normally charged back to the responsible third-party factory. Such expenses are reflected in the condensed consolidated financial statements as deductions from gross sales to arrive at net sales. 
   
  Note I   Note Receivable   Related Party 
  On June 25, 2007, the Company made a loan to Steve Madden, its Creative and Design Chief and a principal stockholder of the Company, in the amount of   $3,000   in order for Mr. Madden to satisfy a personal tax obligation resulting from the exercise of stock options that were due to expire and to retain the underlying Company common stock. Mr. Madden executed a secured promissory note in favor of the Company, for which a securities brokerage account maintained by Mr. Madden with his broker serves as collateral security. None of the securities held in the securities brokerage account are shares of the Company's common stock. There have been successive amendments of the secured promissory note, the most recent of which occurred on April 8, 2016, at which time the secured promissory note was amended to substitute the collateral securing the secured promissory note from shares of the Company's common stock to the security interest in Mr. Madden's securities brokerage account. Previously, on January 3, 2012, in connection with an amendment of Mr. Madden s employment contract, the secured promissory note was amended and restated to extend the maturity date of the obligation to December 31, 2023 and to eliminate the accrual of interest after December 31, 2011. Prior to its January 3, 2012 amendment and restatement, the secured promissory note was accruing interest at the rate of   6%   per annum. In addition, the secured promissory note, as amended, provides that, commencing on December 31, 2014, and annually on each December 31 thereafter through the maturity date, one-tenth of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued interest, will be cancelled by the Company, provided that Mr. Madden continues to be employed by the Company on each such December 31. Contemporaneously, the Company will release its security interest in a portion of the securities held in Mr. Madden's securities brokerage account generally correlating to the amount of indebtedness cancelled on such date. As of December 31, 2011,   $1,090   of interest has accrued on the principal amount of the loan evidenced by the secured promissory note related to the period prior to the elimination of the accrual of interest and has been reflected on the Company s Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. Pursuant to the elimination of further interest accumulation under the secured promissory note, the outstanding principal amount of the loan and the accrued interest as of September 30, 2016 has been discounted to reflect imputed interest, which will be amortized over the remaining life of the loan. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company also recorded a charge in the amount of   $409   to write-off the required one-tenth of the principal amount of the secured promissory note, which was partially offset by accrued imputed interest of   $71  . 
   
  Note J   Share Repurchase Program 
    
  The Company's Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program (the  Share Repurchase Program ), effective as of January 1, 2004. The Share Repurchase Program does not have a fixed expiration or termination date and may be modified or terminated by the Board of Directors at any time.  On several occasions the Board of Directors has increased the amount authorized for repurchase.  The Share Repurchase Program permits the Company to effect repurchases from time to time through a combination of open market repurchases or in privately negotiated transactions at such prices and times as are determined to be in the best interest of the Company.  On February 22, 2016, the Board of Directors approved the extension of the Share Repurchase Program

  average price per share of   $34.38  , for an aggregate purchase price of approximately   $58,445  .  As of   September 30, 2016  , approximately   $134,126   remained available for future repurchases under the Share Repurchase Program.   

Note K   Net Income Per Share of Common Stock 
    
  Basic net income per share is based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period, which does not include unvested restricted common stock subject to forfeiture of   4,235,000   and   4,186,000   shares for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to   4,037,000   and   4,058,000   shares for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . Diluted net income per share reflects: (a) the potential dilution assuming shares of common stock were issued upon the exercise of outstanding in-the-money options and the proceeds thereof were used to purchase shares of the Company s common stock at the average market price during the period, and (b) the vesting of granted non-vested restricted stock awards for which the assumed proceeds upon vesting are deemed to be the amount of compensation cost not yet recognized attributable to future services using the treasury stock method, to the extent dilutive. During the third quarter of 2016, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update 2016-09 - Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting,     which provides updated guidance relating to the treasury stock calculation of diluted shares. (See Note R for further details.) For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , options to purchase approximately   383,000   and   375,000   shares of common stock, respectively, have been excluded in the calculation of diluted net income per share as compared to   6,000   and   15,000   shares that were excluded for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , as the result would have been antidilutive. For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , all unvested restricted stock awards were dilutive. 
   
  Note L   Equity-Based Compensation 
    
  In March 2006, the Company's Board of Directors approved the Steven Madden, Ltd. 2006 Stock Incentive Plan (the  Plan ) under which nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, performance shares, restricted stock, other stock-based awards and performance-based cash awards may be granted to employees, consultants and non-employee directors.  The stockholders approved the Plan on May 26, 2006. On May 25, 2007, the stockholders approved an amendment to the Plan to increase the maximum number of shares that may be issued under the Plan from   4,050,000   to   5,231,250  . On May 22, 2009, the stockholders approved an amendment and restatement of the Plan that, among other things, increased the maximum number of shares that may be issued under the Plan to   13,716,000  .  On May 25, 2012, the stockholders approved an amendment to the Plan that increased the maximum number of shares that may be issued under the Plan to   23,466,000  .  The following table summarizes the number of shares of common stock authorized for use under the Plan, the number of stock-based awards granted (net of expired or cancelled awards) under the Plan and the number of shares of common stock available for the grant of stock-based awards under the Plan:

Note L   Equity-Based Compensation (continued) 
    
  Total equity-based compensation for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   is as follows: 

Equity-based compensation is included in operating expenses on the Company s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. 
    
  Stock Options 
    
  Cash proceeds and intrinsic values related to total stock options exercised during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   are as follows: 

During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , options to purchase approximately   21,006   shares of common stock with a weighted average exercise price of   $32.72   and options to purchase approximately   261,715   shares of common stock with a weighted average exercise price of   $31.92   vested, respectively.  During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , options to purchase approximately   23,074   shares of common stock with a weighted average exercise price of   $31.02   and options to purchase approximately   416,275   shares of common stock with a weighted average exercise price of   $26.94   vested, respectively.  As of   September 30, 2016  , there were unvested options relating to   645,372   shares of common stock outstanding with a total of   $4,024     of unrecognized compensation cost and an average vesting period of   1.60   years.   
    
  The Company uses the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of options granted, which requires several assumptions. The expected term of the options represents the estimated period of time until exercise and is based on the historical experience of similar awards. Expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company s common stock. The risk 
  free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant. With the exception of special dividends paid in November of 2005 and 2006, the Company historically has not paid regular cash dividends and thus the expected dividend rate is assumed to be zero. The following weighted average assumptions were used for stock options granted during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  :

Note L   Equity-Based Compensation (continued) 
    
  Activity relating to stock options granted under the Company s plans and outside the plans during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   is as follows:   

Restricted Stock 
    
  The following table summarizes restricted stock activity during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   $70,980   of total unrecognized compensation cost related to restricted stock awards granted under the Plan. This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average of   6.10   years. The Company determines the fair value of its restricted stock awards based on the market price of its common stock on the date of grant. 
    
  On January 3, 2012, the Company and its Creative and Design Chief, Steven Madden, entered into an amendment of Mr. Madden s existing employment agreement, pursuant to which, on February 8, 2012, Mr. Madden was granted   1,463,057   restricted shares of the Company s common stock at the then market price of   $27.34  , which will vest in equal annual installments over a seven-year period commencing on December 31, 2017 and, thereafter, on each December 31 through December 31, 2023, subject to Mr. Madden s continued employment on each such vesting date.  On June 30, 2012, Mr. Madden exercised his right under his employment agreement to receive an additional restricted stock award, and, on July 3, 2012, he was granted   1,893,342   restricted shares of the Company's common stock at the then market price of   $21.13  , which will vest in the same manner as the aforementioned grant. On August 8, 2016, pursuant to the employment agreement, Mr. Madden was granted an option to purchase   150,000   shares of the Company's common stock at an exercise price of   $34.42   per share, which option is exercisable in equal quarterly installments commencing on November 8, 2016.

Note O   Derivative Instruments 
    
  The Company uses derivative instruments, specifically, forward foreign exchange contracts, to manage the risk associated with the volatility of future cash flows.  The foreign exchange contracts are used to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on certain forecasted purchases of inventory and are designated as cash flow hedging instruments.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the fair value of the Company's foreign currency derivatives, which is included on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets in accrued expenses, is   $160  .  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   $123   of gains related to cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of taxes and are expected to be recognized in earnings at the same time the hedged items affect earnings.  As of   September 30, 2015  ,   $1,307   of losses related to cash flow hedges were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of taxes.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company's hedging activities were considered effective and, thus, no ineffectiveness from hedging activities were recognized in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , losses of   $68   and   $428   were reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income and recognized in the income statement in cost of sales, as compared to losses of   $671   and   $1,396   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .

  Revenues by geographic area for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   are as follows: 

Note R   Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the "FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-15, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. Accounting Standards Update 2016-15 clarifies how certain cash receipts and payments should be presented in the statement of cash flows. The guidance is effective in 2018 with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the timing of adoption of this guidance. 
    
  In June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. Accounting Standards Update 2016-13 replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology in current GAAP with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. The new guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that the new guidance will have on its financial statements and related disclosures. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09 ("ASU 2016-09"), Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which changes the accounting for certain aspects of share-based payments to employees. The guidance requires the recognition in the income statement of the income tax effects of vested or settled awards. Further, the guidance requires that the recognition of anticipated tax windfalls/shortfalls be excluded in the calculation of assumed proceeds when applying the treasury stock method. The guidance also allows for the employer to repurchase more of an employee s shares for tax withholding purposes and not classify the award as a liability that requires valuation on a mark-to-market basis. In addition, the guidance allows for a policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur rather than on an estimated basis. The guidance is effective in 2017 with early adoption permitted. The Company elected to adopt the provisions of ASU 2016-09 in the third quarter of 2016. According to the provisions of ASU 2016-09, if an entity adopts the provisions early, all adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. As a result of the early adoption, the impact to the financial statements is as follows:

Note R   Recent Accounting Pronouncements (continued) 

Lastly, the Company elected to not change its accounting policy to account for forfeitures as they occur and, as a result, the Company will continue to estimate forfeitures. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases, which is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018 with early adoption permitted. Under Accounting Standards Update 2016-02, lessees will be required to recognize for all leases, at the commencement date of the lease, a lease liability, which is a lessee s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease measured on a discounted basis, and a right-to-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee s right to use or control the use of a specified asset for the lease term.  The Company is currently evaluating the effect that the new guidance will have on its financial statements and related disclosures and, while we have not completed the analysis, we expect it will have a material impact on our consolidated balance sheets. 
    
  In January 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.  Accounting Standards Update 2016-01 generally  
  requires companies to measure investments in equity securities, except those accounted for under the equity method, at fair value and recognize any changes in fair value in net income. The new guidance must be applied using a modified-retrospective approach and is effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and early adoption is not permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effect that the new guidance will have on its financial statements and related disclosures. 
   In November 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes. Accounting Standards Update 2015-17 simplifies current guidance and requires companies to classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent on the balance sheet. Accounting Standards Update 2015-17 can be applied either prospectively or retrospectively and is effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption  
  permitted.  The Company is currently evaluating the effect that the new guidance will have on its financial statements and related disclosures.

  In July 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory which changes the measurement principle for inventory from the lower of cost or market to the lower of cost and net realizable value.  Accounting Standards Update 2015-11 defines net realizable value as estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation.  The new guidance must be applied on a prospective basis and is effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted.  The Company is currently evaluating the timing of adoption of this guidance; however, the guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements. 
    
  In May 2014, the FASB issued new accounting guidance, Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, on revenue recognition. The new standard provides for a single five-step model to be applied to all revenue contracts with customers as well as requires additional financial statement disclosures that will enable users to understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows relating to customer contracts. Companies have an option to use either a retrospective approach or cumulative effect adjustment approach to implement the standard. Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted, but not before the original effective date of the standard. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

   Key Performance Indicators and Statistics  
    
  The following measurements are among the key business indicators reviewed by various members of management to measure consolidated and segment results of the Company: 

net sales 
                
    gross profit margin 
                
    operating expenses

    accounts receivable average collection days 
                
    cash flow and liquidity determined by the Company s working capital and free cash flow 
                
    store metrics such as sales per square foot, average unit retail, conversion, average units per transaction, and contribution margin.  
          
  While not all of these metrics are disclosed due to the proprietary nature of the information, many of these metrics are disclosed and discussed in this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
    
  Non-GAAP Measures  
    
  The Company s reported results are presented in accordance with GAAP.  The Company uses adjusted earnings before interest and taxes ("Adjusted EBIT") and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("Adjusted EBITDA"), as calculated in the table below, as non-GAAP measures, in internal management reporting and planning processes as well as in evaluating the performance of the Company.  Management believes these measures are useful to investors in evaluating the Company s ongoing operating and financial results.  By providing these non-GAAP measures, as a supplement to GAAP information, we believe we are enhancing investors  understanding of our business and our results of operations.  The non-GAAP financial measures are limited in their usefulness and should be considered in addition to, and not in lieu of, U.S. GAAP financial measures. Further, these non-GAAP measures may be unique to the Company, as they may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.

The table below reconciles these metrics to net income as presented in the condensed consolidated statements of income.

  Consolidated  :   
  Net sales for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   decreased   1.2%   to   $408,384   compared to   $413,462   in the same period of last year.  Gross margin increased to   37.8%   from   36.0%   due primarily to improvement in the Wholesale Footwear segment. Operating expenses increased in the   third quarter   of this year to   $96,100   from   $89,130   in the   third quarter   of last year. Operating expenses as a percentage of sales were   23.5%   for the   third quarter of 2016   compared to   21.6%   in the   third quarter   of   2015   primarily due to the impact of changes in the Wholesale and Retail segments sales mix and increases in operating expenses due to the impact of new retail store locations, advertising and promotions, bonus accruals and costs associated with our new joint venture in Europe.  Commission and licensing fee income for the   third quarter of 2016   decreased to   $5,358   compared to   $6,643   achieved in the   third quarter   of   2015  .  The effective tax rate for the   third quarter of 2016   decreased to   32.3%   compared to   34.1%   in the   third quarter   of last year due primarily to planned permanent investment of foreign earnings in foreign locations.  Net income attributable to Steven Madden, Ltd. for the   third quarter of 2016   increased to   $43,767   compared to net income for the   third quarter   of   2015   of   $42,885  .  
    
  Wholesale Footwear Segment  :  
    
  Net sales from the Wholesale Footwear segment accounted for   $268,159  , or   65.7%  , and   $276,446  , or   66.9%  , of our total net sales for the   third quarter of 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  The decrease in net sales is primarily related to decreases in our Madden Girl brand due to the impact of not repeating a one-time cold-weather capsule collection, in addition to decreases in our private label businesses, partially offset by increases in Steve Madden Women's and Dolce Vita brands.  
    
  Gross profit margin in the Wholesale Footwear segment was   33.8%   for the   third quarter of 2016   compared to   31.4%   for the   third quarter   of   2015  . The increase in gross profit margin resulted from higher initial mark-ups driven by fashion trends and decreased markdown allowances and close-outs.  Operating expenses increased to   $52,355   in the   third quarter of 2016   from   $44,654   in the same period of last year.  As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses increased to   19.5%   in the   third quarter of 2016   compared to   16.2%   in the same period of   2015   due primarily to increases in advertising and promotions, bonus accruals and costs associated with our new joint venture in Europe coupled with an unfavorable impact from charges related to an increase in contingent liabilities related to the Dolce Vita acquisition. 
    
  Wholesale Accessories Segment  : 
    
  Net sales generated by the Wholesale Accessories segment remained relatively flat compared to the prior year quarter, and accounted for $  78,448  , or   19.2%  , and   $80,594  , or   19.5%  , of total net sales for the Company in the   third   quarter of   2016   and   2015  , respectively.  The decrease in net sales is attributable to the Madden Girl brand due to the impact of not repeating a one-time cold-weather capsule collection.    
    
  Gross profit margin in the Wholesale Accessories segment decreased slightly to   34.3%   in the   third quarter   of this year from   34.6%   in the same period in   2015  , primarily due to lower margins in our cold weather accessories business and an increase in sales mix to lower margin private label customers.  In the   third quarter of 2016  , operating expenses decreased to   $9,006   compared to   $12,179   in the same period of last year.  As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses were   11.5%   in the   third quarter of 2016   compared to   15.1%   in the same period of   2015  . The decrease is primarily related to the impact of the quarter-over-quarter benefit received for the reversal of contingent liabilities in the   third quarter of 2016   and 2015. Income from operations for the Wholesale Accessories segment increased   14.0%   to   $17,931   for the   third quarter of 2016   compared to   $15,730   for the same period of last year.  
    
  Retail Segment  : 
  In the   third quarter of 2016  , net sales from the Retail segment accounted for   $61,777  , or   15.1%  , of our total net sales compared to   $56,422  , or   13.6%  , of our total net sales in the same period last year, which represents a   $5,355  , or   9.5%  , increase.  The increase in net sales reflects the net addition of   21   retail stores since the third quarter of 2015, as well as a   1.3%   increase in comparable store sales. We added   23   new stores and closed   two   stores during the twelve months ended   September 30, 2016  .  As a result, we had   186   retail stores as of   September 30, 2016   compared to   165   stores as of   September 30, 2015  .  The   186   stores currently in operation include   127   Steve Madden  stores,   51   Steve Madden  outlet stores,   two   Steven  stores,   one   Superga  store,   one   multi-branded SHOO store and   four   e-commerce websites.      Comparable store sales (sales of those stores, including the e-commerce websites, that were open throughout the   third quarter of 2016   and   2015  ) increased   1.3%   on a constant currency basis when compared  
  
    25    

to the prior year period. The Company excludes new locations from the comparable store base for the first twelve months of operations.  Stores that are closed for renovations are removed from the comparable store base.  In the   third quarter of 2016  , gross margin decreased to   59.9%   from   60.4%   in the same period of   2015     primarily due to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our international operations.  In the   third quarter of 2016  , operating expenses increased to   $34,739  , or   56.2%   of net sales, compared to   $32,422  , or   57.5%   of net sales, in the   third quarter   of last year primarily due to the net increase of new store openings. The decrease as a percentage of net sales reflects leverage on increased sales. Income from operations for the Retail segment increased to   $2,282   in the   third quarter   of this year compared to income of   $1,666   in the same period of last year.  
    
  First Cost Segment  : 
  The First Cost segment, which includes net commission income and fees, decreased to   $2,424   for the   third quarter of 2016   compared to   $3,479   for the comparable period of   2015   due to a reduction in business with certain private label footwear customers. 
    
  Licensing Segment  : 
  Net licensing income slightly decreased to   $2,934   for the   third quarter of 2016   compared to   $3,164   for the comparable period of   2015  .    
    
  Nine Months Ended September 30,     2016   Compared to   Nine Months Ended September 30,     2015    
    
  Consolidated  :   
  Net sales for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   increased   0.2%   to   $1,063,143   compared to   $1,060,989   in the same period of last year.  Gross margin increased to   36.8%   from   35.5%   due to a sales mix shift between the branded and private label businesses and decreased markdown allowance and closeout activity in the Wholesale Footwear segment. Operating expenses increased for the first   nine   months of 2016 to   $272,574   from   $253,991   for the first   nine   months of 2015.  Operating expense in the   nine   months ended September 30, 2015 included a benefit of   $3,048   related to income arising from the early termination of our lease for our 5th Avenue, New York store, which was closed during the first quarter of 2015.  Excluding this benefit, operating expenses for the first   nine   months of 2015 were $257,039.  Excluding the aforementioned benefit, the increase in operating expenses versus the prior year period is due to the impact of new retail store locations, advertising and promotions, employee-related expenses and legal items.  Operating expenses as a percentage of sales were   25.6%   for the first   nine   months of 2016 compared to   23.9%   for the first   nine   months of   2015   due to the impact of changes in the Wholesale and Retail segments sales mix and increases in operating expenses due to the impact of new retail store locations, advertising and promotions, bonus accruals and costs associated with our new joint venture in Europe.

Additionally, net income attributable to Steven Madden, Ltd. for the first   nine   months of 2016 included a tax benefit of   $3,846   related to the adoption of ASU 2016-09 (see Note R to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Quarterly Report). 
    
  Wholesale Footwear Segment  :  
    
  Net sales from the Wholesale Footwear segment accounted for   $692,505  , or   65.1%  , and   $698,380  , or   65.8%  , of our total net sales for the first   nine   months of 2016 and   2015  , respectively. The decrease was driven by decreases in the Madden Girl brand, and our international distributors and private label businesses, partially offset by increases in our Dolce Vita and Steve Madden Women's brands. 
    
  Gross profit margin in the Wholesale Footwear segment was   32.0%   for the first   nine   months of 2016 compared to   30.2%   for the first   nine   months of   2015  , the increase primarily resulting from decreased markdown allowance and closeout activity.

As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses increased to   20.0%   in the first   nine   months of 2016 compared to   18.1%   in the same period of   2015   primarily due to increases in advertising and promotions, bonus accruals and costs associated with our new joint venture in Europe coupled with an unfavorable impact from charges related to an increase in contingent liabilities related to the Dolce Vita acquisition. 
  
    26    

Wholesale Accessories Segment  : 
    
  Net sales generated by the Wholesale Accessories segment accounted for $  192,769  , or   18.1%  , and   $201,558  , or   19.0%  , of total net sales for the Company for the first   nine   months of   2016   and   2015  , respectively.  The decrease in net sales is attributable to a decline in our branded handbag business.    
    
  Gross profit margin in the Wholesale Accessories segment decreased to   33.2%   in the first   nine   months of 2016 from   34.0%   in the same period in   2015  , primarily due to softness in the branded handbag category and an increase in sales mix to lower margin private label customers.  In the first   nine   months of 2016, operating expenses decreased to   $32,319   compared to   $36,622   in the same period of last year.  As a percentage of net sales, operating expenses decreased to   16.8%   in the first   nine   months of 2016 compared to   18.2%   in the same period of   2015   primarily due to the impact of the quarter-over-quarter benefit received for the reversal of contingent liabilities in the   third quarter of 2016   and 2015. Income from operations for the Wholesale Accessories segment slightly decreased   0.2%   to   $31,745   for the first   nine   months of 2016 compared to   $31,814   for the same period of last year.  
    
  Retail Segment  : 
  In the first   nine   months of 2016, net sales from the Retail segment accounted for   $177,869  , or   16.7%  , of our total net sales compared to   $161,051  , or   15.2%  , of our total net sales in the same period last year, which represents a   $16,818  , or   10.4%  , increase.  The increase in net sales reflects the net addition of   21   retail stores since the   third   quarter of 2015, as well as a   5.5%   increase in comparable store sales,   which was driven by strong fashion footwear trends, stronger product assortment and improvement in conversion rate.    We added   23   new stores and closed   two   stores during the twelve months ended   September 30, 2016  .  As a result, we had   186   retail stores as of   September 30, 2016   compared to   165   stores as of   September 30, 2015  .  The   186   stores currently in operation include   127   Steve Madden  stores,   51   Steve Madden  outlet stores,   two   Steven  stores,   one   Superga  store,   one   multi-branded SHOO store and   four   e-commerce websites.      Comparable store sales (sales of those stores, including the e-commerce websites, that were open throughout the first   nine   months of 2016 and   2015  ) increased   5.5%   on a constant currency basis when compared to the prior year period. The Company excludes new locations from the comparable store base for the first twelve months of operations.  Stores that are closed for renovations are removed from the comparable store base.  In the first   nine   months of 2016, gross margin decreased slightly to   59.8%   from   60.2%   in the same period of   2015  .

Operating expenses in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   included a benefit of   $3,048   related to income arising from the early termination of our lease for our 5th Avenue, New York store, which was closed during the first quarter of 2015.  Excluding this benefit, operating expenses in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   were   $93,757  , or 58.2% of net sales.  Excluding the aforementioned benefit, the increase in operating expenses in the first   nine   months of 2016 versus the prior year period is the result of the impact of new retail store locations and the decrease in operating expenses as a percentage of net sales reflects leverage on sales driven by same store sales growth.  Income from operations for the Retail segment was   $4,304   in the first   nine   months of 2016 compared to   $6,242   in the same period of last year.

  Licensing Segment  : 
  Net licensing income decreased to   $6,426   for the first   nine   months of 2016 compared to   $7,497   for the comparable period of   2015   primarily driven by the discontinuation of the Steve Madden eyewear licenses.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
  ($ in thousands) 
  Our primary source of liquidity is cash flows generated from our operations.  Our primary use of this liquidity is to fund our ongoing cash requirements, including working capital requirements, share repurchases, acquisitions, system enhancements and retail store expansion and remodeling.   
  Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments totaled   $93,024   and   $104,838   at   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, respectively.  Of the total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at   September 30, 2016  , $68,977, or approximately 74%, was held in our foreign subsidiaries and of the total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments at December 31, 2015, $73,640, or approximately 70%, was held in our foreign subsidiaries. To date, deferred taxes have been estimated and accrued for  foreign subsidiary earnings that have not been determined to be indefinitely reinvested.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the cumulative total amount of earnings considered to be indefinitely reinvested of our foreign subsidiaries was $85,147.  If such amounts were not indefinitely reinvested, the Company would incur approximately $17,531 in cumulative taxes that were not previously provided for. Management believes that our existing domestic and international cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and cash flows from operations, which are not considered to be indefinitely reinvested, continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities.  Therefore, we do not intend, nor do we foresee a need, to repatriate foreign earnings of $85,147 as of   September 30, 2016  , that were considered to be indefinitely reinvested and we do not believe there are any material implications or restrictions on our liquidity as a result of having a significant portion of our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments held by our foreign subsidiaries.   
  The Company has a collection agency agreement with Rosenthal   Rosenthal, Inc. ( Rosenthal ) that became effective on September 15, 2009. The agreement can be terminated by the Company or Rosenthal at any time upon 60 days' prior written notice. Under the agreement, the Company can request advances from Rosenthal of up to   85%   of the aggregate receivables submitted to Rosenthal. The agreement provides the Company with a $30,000 credit facility with a $15,000 sub-limit for letters of credit at an interest rate based, at the Company s election, upon a calculation that utilizes either the prime rate or LIBOR. The Company also pays Rosenthal a fee based on a percentage of the gross invoice amount submitted to Rosenthal.  With respect to receivables related to our First Cost segment and private label business, the fee is 0.14% of the gross invoice amount. For all other receivables, the fee is 0.20% of the gross invoice amount.  Rosenthal assumes the credit risk on a substantial portion of the receivables that the Company submits to it. To the extent of any loans made to the Company, Rosenthal maintains a lien on the Company s receivables to secure the Company s obligations.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had working capital of   $322,484  , cash and cash equivalents of   $62,723   and investments in marketable securities of   $120,737  . 
  We believe that based upon our current financial position and available cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, the Company will meet all of its financial commitments and operating needs for at least the next twelve months. 
   
  OPERATING ACTIVITIES

  Cash provided by operations was   $73,470   for the   nine   months of   2016   compared to cash provided by operations of   $50,148   in the same period of last year. The primary sources of cash were net income of   $92,441  , as well as an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and decreases in prepaid expenses, prepaid taxes, deposits and other assets.  These cash sources were partially offset by uses of cash related to increases in factor accounts receivable and inventories.

  On January 3, 2012, the Company and its Creative and Design Chief, Steven Madden, entered into an amendment, dated as of December 31, 2011, to Mr. Madden s then existing employment agreement with the Company.  The amended agreement, which extends the term of Mr. Madden's employment through December 31, 2023, provides for a base salary of approximately $7,417 in 2013, approximately $9,667 in 2014, approximately $11,917 in 2015 and approximately $10,698 per annum for the period between January 1, 2016 through the expiration of the term of employment.  Accordingly, Mr. Madden's annual base salary was reduced as of January 1, 2016. The employment agreement provided Mr. Madden with the right, exercisable on certain specified dates in fiscal year 2012 only, to elect to receive a grant of restricted stock for a number of shares of the Company s common stock valued at $40,000 in consideration for a reduction in his annual base salary in years subsequent to 2012 as follows: $4,000 in 2013, approximately $6,125 in 2014, approximately $8,250 in 2015 and approximately $7,026 per annum for the period between January 1, 2016 through the expiration of the employment agreement on December 31, 2023. On June 30, 2012, Mr. Madden exercised this right and on July 3, 2012 he was granted 1,893,342 restricted shares of the Company's common stock at the then market price of $21.13, which will vest in the same manner as the February 8, 2012 restricted stock grant received by Mr. Madden pursuant to the amended agreement.  (See Note L to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.)  In addition to the opportunity for cash bonuses at the sole discretion of the Board of Directors, Mr. Madden s employment agreement entitles him to an annual life insurance premium payment as well as an annual stock option grant and the potential for an additional one-time stock option grant based on achievement of certain financial performance criteria. The employment agreement also provides for the elimination of interest accrued after December 31, 2011 on an outstanding loan in the original principal amount of $3,000 made by the Company to Mr. Madden, the extension of the maturity date of such loan until December 31, 2023, and the forgiveness of 1/10  th   of the principal amount of the loan, together with accrued interest, annually over a ten-year period commencing on December 31, 2014 for so long as Mr. Madden continues to be employed by the Company on each such December 31. As a result of the elimination of further interest accumulation, the outstanding principal and the accrued interest as of December 31, 2011 has been discounted to reflect imputed interest, which will be amortized over the remaining life of the loan. 
  The Company has employment agreements with certain executive officers, which provide for the payment of compensation aggregating approximately $771 in the remainder of 2016, $1,506 in 2017 and $900 in 2018.  In addition, some of these employment agreements provide for discretionary bonuses and some provide for incentive compensation based on various performance criteria as well as other benefits including stock options.   
    
  In connection with our acquisition of Steve Madden Canada Inc., Steve Madden Retail Canada Inc., Pasa Agency Inc. and Gelati Imports Inc. (collectively, "SM Canada") on February 21, 2012, we are subject to potential earn-out payments to the seller of SM Canada based on the annual performance of SM Canada for each of the twelve-month periods ending on March 31, 2013 through 2017, inclusive. We made the fourth earn-out payment of $2,798, based on the performance of SM Canada during the twelve-month period ended on March 31, 2016, to the seller of SM Canada during the second quarter of 2016.  In connection with our acquisition of Cejon Inc, Cejon Accessories, Inc. and New East Designs, LLC (collectively "Cejon") on May 25, 2011, we are subject to potential earn-out payments to the seller of Cejon based on the annual performance of Cejon for each of the twelve-month periods ending on June 30, 2012 through 2016, inclusive. The final earn-out payment of $1,767 was made to the seller of Cejon in the third quarter of 2016. In connection with our acquisition of Dolce Vita Holdings, Inc. ("Dolce Vita") on August 13, 2014, we are subject to potential earn-out payments to the sellers of Dolce Vita based on the performance of Dolce Vita in each of the twelve month periods ending on September 30, 2015 and 2016 equal to 50% of Dolce Vita s EBITDA in each such year;  
  
    30    

provided that the aggregate minimum earn-out payments for the entire two-year earn-out period shall be no less than $5,000. The first earn-out payment of $1,019 was made to the sellers of Dolce Vita in the fourth quarter of 2015 and the second payment will be payable in the last quarter of this year. In connection with our acquisition of all of the outstanding capital stock of Trendy Imports S.A. de C.V., Comercial Diecisiette S.A. de C.V. and Maximus Designer Shoes S.A. de C.V. (together, "SM Mexico") on December 30, 2014, we are subject to potential earn-out payments to the seller of SM Mexico based on the annual performance of SM Mexico for each of the twelve-month periods ending on December 31, 2015 and 2016. The first earn-out payment of $3,483 was made in the first quarter of 2016 and the second earn-out payment, if achieved, will be payable in the first quarter of 2017. 
  Virtually all of our products are manufactured at overseas locations, the majority of which are located in China, with a small but growing percentage located in Mexico in addition to smaller amounts produced in Brazil, Italy and India. We have not entered into any long-term manufacturing or supply contracts with any of these foreign manufacturers. We believe that a sufficient number of alternative sources exist outside of the United States for the manufacture of our products. Purchases are made primarily in United States dollars. 
   
  INFLATION 
    
  We do not believe that inflation had a significant effect on our sales or profitability in the three months ended   September 30, 2016  .  Historically, we have minimized the impact of product cost increases by increasing prices, changing suppliers and by improving operating efficiencies.  However, no assurance can be given that we will be able to offset any such inflationary cost increases in the future. 
   
  OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 
    
  The Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements. 
   
  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND THE USE OF ESTIMATES  
  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based upon our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates by their nature are based on judgments and available information. Our estimates are made based upon historical factors, current circumstances and the experience and judgment of management. Assumptions and estimates are evaluated on an ongoing basis and we may employ outside experts to assist in evaluations. Therefore, actual results could materially differ from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions. Management believes the following critical accounting estimates are more significantly affected by judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements: allowance for bad debts, returns, and customer chargebacks; inventory valuation; valuation of intangible assets; litigation reserves; and contingent payment liabilities. Further, the policies currently utilized are constantly applied with prior periods. 
  Allowances for bad debts, returns and customer chargebacks  . We provide reserves against our trade accounts receivables for future customer chargebacks, co-op advertising allowances, discounts, returns and other miscellaneous deductions that relate to the current period. The reserve against our non-factored trade receivables also includes estimated losses that may result from customers' inability to pay. The amount of the reserve for bad debts, returns, discounts and compliance chargebacks are determined by analyzing aged receivables, current economic conditions, the prevailing retail environment and historical dilution levels for customers. We evaluate anticipated customer markdowns and advertising chargebacks by reviewing several performance indicators for our major customers. These performance indicators (which include inventory levels at the retail floors, sell through rates and gross margin levels) are analyzed by management to estimate the amount of the anticipated customer allowance. Failure to correctly estimate the amount of the reserve could materially impact our results of operations and financial position. 
  Inventory valuation  . Inventories are stated at lower-of-cost or market, on a first-in, first-out basis. We review inventory on a regular basis for excess and slow moving inventory. The review is based on an analysis of inventory on hand, prior sales, and expected net realizable value through future sales. The analysis includes a review of inventory quantities on hand at period-end in relation to year-to-date sales and projections for sales in the foreseeable future as well as subsequent sales. We consider quantities on hand in excess of estimated future sales to be at risk for market impairment. The net realizable value, or market value, is determined based on the estimate of sales prices of such inventory through off-price or discount store channels. The likelihood of any material inventory write-down is dependent primarily on the expectation of future consumer demand for our product. A misinterpretation or misunderstanding of future consumer demand for our product, the economic conditions, or other failure to estimate correctly,  
  
    31    

in addition to abnormal weather patterns, could result in inventory valuation changes, compared to the valuation determined to be appropriate as of the balance sheet date. 
  Valuation of intangible assets and goodwill  . Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 350,  Intangible   Goodwill and Other , requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives not be amortized, but rather be tested for impairment at least annually. This pronouncement also requires that intangible assets with finite lives be amortized over their respective lives to their estimated residual values, and reviewed for impairment in accordance with ASC Topic 360,  Property, Plant and Equipment  ( ASC Topic 360 ).  
  Indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are assessed for impairment using either a qualitative or quantitative approach. We perform this annual assessment during our third quarter. Where we use the qualitative assessment, first we determine if, based on qualitative factors, it is more likely than not that an impairment exists. Factors considered include historical financial performance, macroeconomic and industry conditions and legal and regulatory environment.  If the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that an impairment exists, then a quantitative assessment is performed.  The quantitative assessment requires an analysis of several estimates including future cash flows or income consistent with management s strategic business plans, annual sales growth rates and the selection of assumptions underlying a discount rate (weighted average cost of capital) based on market data available at the time.  
  In accordance with ASC Topic 360, long-lived assets, such as property, equipment, leasehold improvements and intangible assets subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. 
  Litigation reserves  . Estimated amounts for litigation claims that are probable and can be reasonably estimated are recorded as liabilities in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The likelihood of a material change in these estimated reserves would be dependent on new claims as they may arise and the favorable or unfavorable events of a particular litigation. As additional information becomes available, management will assess the potential liability related to the pending litigation and revise its estimates. Such revisions in management's estimates of a contingent liability could materially impact our results of operation and financial position.  
  Contingent payment liabilities.    Since February 2012, the Company has completed five acquisitions, three of which continue to require the Company to potentially make earn-out payments to the sellers of the acquired businesses based on the future financial performance of the acquired businesses over a period of one or two years, as applicable.  The fair value of the contingent payments was estimated using the present value of management's projections of the financial results of the acquired businesses.  Failure to correctly project the financial results of the acquired businesses could materially impact our results of operations and financial position.

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
  ($ in thousands) 
  We do not engage in the trading of market risk sensitive instruments in the normal course of business. Our financing arrangements are subject to variable interest rates, primarily based on the prime rate and LIBOR. The terms of our collection agency agreements with Rosenthal   Rosenthal, Inc. can be found in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section of Item 2 and in Note C to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Quarterly Report.    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we held marketable securities valued at   $120,737  , which consist primarily of certificates of deposit and corporate bonds. The values of these securities may fluctuate as a result of changes in equity values, market interest rates and credit risk.  We have the ability to hold these investments until maturity. In addition, any decline in interest rates would be expected to reduce our interest income. 
   
  ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
  As required by Rule 13a-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act ), our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the fiscal quarter covered by this Quarterly Report. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were, as of the end of the fiscal quarter covered by this Quarterly Report, effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
  As required by Rule 13a-15(d) under the Exchange Act, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated our internal controls over financial reporting to determine whether any changes occurred during the quarter covered by this Quarterly Report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Based on that evaluation, there has been no such change during the quarter covered by this Quarterly Report. 
   
  PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
   
  ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
    
  Information regarding certain specific legal proceedings in which the Company is involved is contained in Part 1, Item 3, and in Note O to the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. Unless otherwise indicated in this report, all proceedings discussed in the earlier report which are not indicated therein as having been concluded, remain outstanding as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  The Company has been named as a defendant in certain other lawsuits in the normal course of business. In the opinion of management, after consulting with legal counsel, the liabilities, if any, resulting from these matters should not have a material effect on the Company's financial position or results of operations. It is the policy of management to disclose the amount or range of reasonably possible losses in excess of recorded amounts. 
  
    33
