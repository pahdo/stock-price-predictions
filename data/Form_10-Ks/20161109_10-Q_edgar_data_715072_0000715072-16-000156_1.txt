Note A   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
  Nature of Operations  : Renasant Corporation (referred to herein as the  Company ) owns and operates Renasant Bank ( Renasant Bank  or the  Bank ) and Renasant Insurance, Inc. The Company offers a diversified range of financial, fiduciary and insurance services to its retail and commercial customers through its subsidiaries and full service offices located throughout north and central Mississippi, Tennessee, Georgia, north and central Alabama and north Florida. 
  Basis of Presentation  : The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.  For further information regarding the Company s significant accounting policies, refer to the audited consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 29, 2016. 
  Business Combinations  :  The Company completed its acquisitions of Heritage Financial Group, Inc. ( Heritage ) and KeyWorth Bank ("KeyWorth") on July 1, 2015 and April 1, 2016, respectively.  The acquired institutions' financial condition and results of operations are included in the Company's financial condition and results of operations as of the respective acquisition dates. 
  Use of Estimates  : The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
  Subsequent Events:   The Company has evaluated, for consideration of recognition or disclosure, subsequent events that have occurred through the date of issuance of its financial statements. The Company has determined that no significant events occurred after   September 30, 2016   but prior to the issuance of these financial statements that would have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
  Impact of Recently-Issued Accounting Standards and Pronouncements: 
    
  In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU )  No. 2016-15,    Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments   ("ASU 2016-15").  ASU 2016-15 is intended to reduce the diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the Statement of Cash Flows, including (1) debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs, (2) settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments or other debt instruments with coupon interest rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest rate of the borrowing, (3) contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, (4) proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims, (5) proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies, including bank-owned life insurance policies, (6) distributions received from equity method investees, (7) beneficial interests in securitization transactions and (8) separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle.  For public companies, this amendment becomes effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017.  The ASU only impacts the presentation of specific items within the Statement of Cash Flows and is not expected to have a material impact to the Company.  
    
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,   Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments   ( ASU 2016-13 ). The update will significantly change the way entities recognize impairment on many financial assets by requiring immediate recognition of estimated credit losses expected to occur over the asset's remaining life.  The FASB describes this impairment recognition model as the current expected credit loss ( CECL ) model and believes the CECL model will result in more timely recognition of credit losses since the CECL model incorporates expected credit losses versus incurred credit losses. The scope of FASB s CECL model would include loans, held-to-maturity debt instruments, lease receivables, loan commitments and financial guarantees that are not accounted for at fair value. For public companies, this update becomes effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019.  Management is currently evaluating the impact this ASU will have on the Company s consolidated financial statements and will continue to monitor FASB s progress on this topic. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,   Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718):  Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting   ( ASU 2016-09 ).  ASU 2016-09 is intended to reduce complexity in accounting standards by  
  
   5 

     Table of Contents  

simplifying several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including (1) accounting for income taxes; (2) classification of excess tax benefits on the statement of cash flows; (3) forfeitures; (4) minimum statutory tax withholding requirements; and (5) classification of employee taxes paid on the statement of cash flows when an employer withholds shares for tax withholding purposes.  The amendments of ASU 2016-09 are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016.  Management is currently evaluating the impact this ASU will have on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 
     
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-07,   Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting   ( ASU 2016-07 ).  ASU 2016-07 requires an investor to initially apply the equity method of accounting from the date it qualifies for that method, i.e., the date the investor obtains significant influence over the operating and financial policies of an investee. The ASU eliminates the previous requirement to retroactively adjust the investment and record a cumulative catch up for the periods that the investment had been held but did not qualify for the equity method of accounting. For public companies, the amendments in ASU 2016-07 are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The amendments should be applied prospectively upon their effective date to increases in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence that result in the adoption of the equity method.  Management is currently evaluating the provisions of ASU 2016-07 to determine the potential impact the new standard will have on the Company s consolidated financial statements.  
     
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842)   ( ASU 2016-02 ).  ASU 2016-02 amends the accounting model and disclosure requirements for leases.  The current accounting model for leases distinguishes between capital leases, which are recognized on-balance sheet, and operating leases, which are not.  Under the new standard, the lease classifications are defined as finance leases, which are similar to capital leases under current GAAP, and operating leases.  Further, a lessee will recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset for all leases with a term greater than 12 months on its balance sheet regardless of the lease s classification, which may significantly increase reported assets and liabilities.  The accounting model and disclosure requirements for lessors remains substantially unchanged from current GAAP.  ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018.   Management is currently evaluating the impact ASU 2016-02 will have on the Company's financial position and results of operations. 
     
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01,   Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10); Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities   ( ASU 2016-01 ).  ASU 2016-01 revises the accounting for the classification and measurement of investments in equity securities and revises the presentation of certain fair value changes for financial liabilities measured at fair value.  For equity securities, the guidance in ASU 2016-01 requires equity investments to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income.  For financial liabilities that are measured at fair value in accordance with the fair value option, the guidance requires presenting, in other comprehensive income, the change in fair value that relates to a change in instrument-specific credit risk. ASU 2016-01 also eliminates the disclosure assumptions used to estimate fair value for financial instruments measured at amortized cost and requires disclosure of an exit price notion in determining the fair value of financial instruments measured at amortized cost.  ASU 2016-01 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017.  Management is currently evaluating the impact ASU 2016-01 will have on the Company's financial position and results of operations.

Gross realized gains on sales of securities available for sale for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   were as follows: 

At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , securities with a carrying value of   $654,409   and   $679,492  , respectively, were pledged to secure government, public and trust deposits. Securities with a carrying value of   $27,090   and   $39,275   were pledged as collateral for short-term borrowings and derivative instruments at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.

  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 

The Company evaluates its investment portfolio for other-than-temporary-impairment ( OTTI ) on a quarterly basis. Impairment is assessed at the individual security level. The Company considers an investment security impaired if the fair value of the security is less than its cost or amortized cost basis. Impairment is considered to be other-than-temporary if the Company intends to sell the investment security or if the Company does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security before the Company is required to sell the security or before the security s maturity. 
    
  The Company does not intend to sell any of the securities in an unrealized loss position, and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell any such security prior to the recovery of its amortized cost basis, which may be at maturity. Furthermore, even though a number of these securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for a period greater than twelve months, the Company has experienced an overall improvement in the fair value of its investment portfolio and, with the exception of   one   of its pooled trust preferred securities (discussed below), is collecting principal and interest payments from the respective issuers as scheduled. As such, the Company did not record any OTTI for the three or   nine months ended September 30, 2016   or   2015  .  
  The Company holds investments in pooled trust preferred securities that had an amortized cost basis of   $24,628   and   $24,770   and a fair value of   $18,092   and   $19,469   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. At September 30, 2016, the investments in pooled trust preferred securities consisted of   three   securities representing interests in various tranches of trusts collateralized by debt issued by over   250   financial institutions. Management s determination of the fair value of each of its holdings in pooled trust preferred securities is based on the current credit ratings, the known deferrals and defaults by the underlying issuing financial institutions and the degree to which future deferrals and defaults would be required to occur before the cash flow for the Company s tranches is negatively impacted. In addition, management continually monitors key credit quality and capital ratios of the issuing institutions. This determination is further supported by quarterly valuations, which are performed by third parties, of each security obtained by the Company. The Company does not intend to sell the investments before recovery of the investments' amortized cost, and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the investments before recovery of the investments  amortized cost, which may be at maturity. At   September 30, 2016  , management did not, and does not currently, believe such securities will be settled at a price less than the amortized cost of the investment, but the Company previously concluded that it was probable that there had been an adverse change in estimated cash flows for all   three   trust preferred securities and recognized credit related impairment losses on these securities in 2010 and 2011.   No   additional impairment was recognized during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . 
  The Company's analysis of the pooled trust preferred securities during the second quarter of 2015 supported a return to accrual status for   one   of the   three   securities (XXVI). During the second quarter of 2014, the Company's analysis supported a return to accrual status for   one   of the other securities (XXIII). An observed history of principal and interest payments combined with improved qualitative and quantitative factors described above justified the accrual of interest on these securities.  However, the remaining security (XXIV) is still in "payment in kind" status where interest payments are not expected until a future date and, therefore, the qualitative and quantitative factors described above do not justify a return to accrual status at this time.  As a result, pooled trust preferred security XXIV remains classified as a nonaccruing asset at   September 30, 2016  , and investment interest is recorded on the cash-basis method until qualifying for return to accrual status. 
  The following table provides information regarding the Company s investments in pooled trust preferred securities at   September 30, 2016  :

Note C   Loans and the Allowance for Loan Losses 
  (In Thousands, Except Number of Loans) 
  The following is a summary of loans as of the dates presented: 

Past Due and Nonaccrual Loans 
  Loans are considered past due if the required principal and interest payments have not been received as of the date such payments were due. Generally, the recognition of interest on mortgage and commercial loans is discontinued at the time the loan is   90 days   past due unless the credit is well-secured and in process of collection. Consumer and other retail loans are typically charged-off no later than the time the loan is   120 days   past due. In all cases, loans are placed on nonaccrual status or charged-off at an earlier date if collection of principal or interest is considered doubtful. Loans may be placed on nonaccrual regardless of whether or not such loans are considered past due. All interest accrued for the current year, but not collected, for loans that are placed on nonaccrual status or charged-off is reversed against interest income. The interest on these loans is accounted for on the cash-basis or cost-recovery method, until qualifying for return to accrual status. Loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured.

The following table provides an aging of past due and nonaccrual loans, segregated by class, as of the dates presented: 

Impaired Loans 
  A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Impairment is measured on a loan-by-loan basis for commercial, consumer and construction loans above a minimum dollar amount threshold by either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate, the loan s obtainable market price or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. Large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans are evaluated collectively for impairment. When the ultimate collectability of an impaired loan s principal is in doubt, wholly or partially, all cash receipts are applied to principal. Once the recorded balance has been reduced to zero, future cash receipts are applied to interest income, to the extent any interest has been foregone, and then they are recorded as recoveries of any amounts previously charged-off. For impaired loans, a specific reserve is established to adjust the carrying value of the loan to its estimated net realizable value.

Restructured Loans 
  Restructured loans are those for which concessions have been granted to the borrower due to a deterioration of the borrower s financial condition and which are performing in accordance with the new terms. Such concessions may include reduction in interest rates or deferral of interest or principal payments. In evaluating whether to restructure a loan, management analyzes the long-term financial condition of the borrower, including guarantor and collateral support, to determine whether the proposed concessions will increase the likelihood of repayment of principal and interest.  
  The following tables illustrate the impact of modifications classified as restructured loans and are segregated by class for the periods presented:

Restructured loans not performing in accordance with their restructured terms that are either contractually   90 days   or more past due or placed on nonaccrual status are reported as nonperforming loans.  There were   no   restructured loans contractually   90 days   past due or more and still accruing at   September 30, 2016   and   one   restructured loan in the amount of   $35   contractually   90 days   past due or more and still accruing at   September 30, 2015  . The outstanding balance of restructured loans on nonaccrual status was   $9,764   and   $13,956   at   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively.

The allocated allowance for loan losses attributable to restructured loans was   $321   and   $1,343   at   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively. The Company had   $11   in remaining availability under commitments to lend additional funds on these restructured loans at   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  . 
  Credit Quality 
  For loans originated for commercial purposes, internal risk-rating grades are assigned by lending, credit administration or loan review personnel, based on an analysis of the financial and collateral strength and other credit attributes underlying each loan. Management analyzes the resulting ratings, as well as other external statistics and factors such as delinquency, to track the migration performance of the portfolio balances of these loans. Loan grades range between   1   and   9  , with 1 being loans with the least credit risk. Loans that migrate toward the  Pass  grade (those with a risk rating between   1   and   4  ) or within the  Pass  grade generally have a lower risk of loss and therefore a lower risk factor applied to the loan balances. The  Watch  grade (those with a risk rating of   5  ) is utilized on a temporary basis for  Pass  grade loans where a significant adverse risk-modifying action is anticipated in the near term. Loans that migrate toward the  Substandard  grade (those with a risk rating between   6   and   9  ) generally have a higher risk of loss and therefore a higher risk factor applied to the related loan balances. The following table presents the Company s loan portfolio by risk-rating grades as of the dates presented:

For portfolio balances of consumer, small balance consumer mortgage loans, such as 1-4 family mortgage loans and certain other loans originated for other than commercial purposes, allowance factors are determined based on historical loss ratios by portfolio for the preceding eight quarters and may be adjusted by other qualitative criteria. The following table presents the performing status of the Company s loan portfolio not subject to risk rating as of the dates presented:

The following table presents the fair value of loans acquired from KeyWorth as of the April 1, 2016 acquisition date.   

Allowance for Loan Losses 
  The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level believed adequate by management based on its ongoing analysis of the loan portfolio to absorb probable credit losses inherent in the entire loan portfolio, including collective impairment as recognized under ASC 450,  Contingencies . Collective impairment is calculated based on loans grouped by grade. Another component of the allowance is losses on loans assessed as impaired under ASC 310. The balance of these loans and their related allowance is included in management s estimation and analysis of the allowance for loan losses. Management and the internal loan review staff evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses quarterly. The allowance for loan losses is evaluated based on a continuing assessment of problem loans, the types of loans, historical loss experience, new lending products, emerging credit trends, changes in the size and character of loan categories and other factors, including its risk rating system, regulatory guidance and economic conditions. This evaluation is inherently subjective, as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information

becomes available. The allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses charged to earnings resulting from measurements of inherent credit risk in the loan portfolio and estimates of probable losses or impairments of individual loans. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectability of a loan balance is confirmed. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance.

Note E   FDIC Loss-Share Indemnification Asset 
  (In Thousands) 
  As part of the loan portfolio and OREO fair value estimation in connection with FDIC-assisted acquisitions, a FDIC loss-share indemnification asset is established, which represents the present value as of the acquisition date of the estimated losses on covered assets to be reimbursed by the FDIC.  Pursuant to the terms of our loss-share agreements (including those assumed in connection with the Heritage acquisition), the FDIC is obligated to reimburse the Bank for   80%   of all eligible losses with respect to covered assets, beginning with the first dollar of loss incurred.  The Bank has a corresponding obligation to reimburse the FDIC for   80%   of eligible recoveries with respect to covered assets.  The estimated losses are based on the same cash flow estimates used in determining the fair value of the covered assets. The FDIC loss-share indemnification asset is reduced as losses are recognized on covered assets and loss-share payments are received from the FDIC. Realized losses in excess of estimates as of the date of the acquisition increase the FDIC loss-share indemnification asset. Conversely, when realized losses are less than these estimates, the portion of the FDIC loss-share indemnification asset no longer expected to result in a payment from the FDIC is amortized into interest income using the effective interest method. 
    
  Changes in the FDIC loss-share indemnification asset were as follows:

Note F   Mortgage Servicing Rights 
  (In Thousands) 
  The Company retains the right to service certain mortgage loans that it sells to secondary market investors. These mortgage servicing rights ( MSRs ), included in  Other assets  on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, are recognized as a separate asset on the date the corresponding mortgage loan is sold. MSRs are amortized in proportion to and over the period of estimated net servicing income. These servicing rights are carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair market value. Fair market value is determined using an income approach with various assumptions including expected cash flows, prepayment speeds, market discount rates, servicing costs, and other factors. Impairment losses on MSRs are recognized to the extent by which the unamortized cost exceeds fair value. There were   $40   of impairment losses on MSRs during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   no   impairment losses recognized during the nine months ended September 30,   2015  .   
  During the first quarter of 2016, the Company sold MSRs relating to mortgage loans having an aggregate unpaid principal balance totaling   $1,830,444   to a third party for net proceeds of   $18,508  .  There were   no   other sales of MSRs in 2016 and   no   sales in 2015. 
  Changes in the Company s MSRs were as follows:

Also as part of Mortgage banking income, the Company recorded servicing fees of   $595   and   $1,045   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively. The Company recorded servicing fees of   $2,212   and   $2,163   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively.  

Note G - Employee Benefit and Deferred Compensation Plans 
  (In Thousands, Except Share Data) 
  The Company sponsors a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan, under which participation and future benefit accruals ceased as of December 31, 1996.  In connection with the acquisition of Heritage, the Company assumed the noncontributory defined benefit pension plan maintained by HeritageBank of the South, Heritage's wholly-owned banking subsidiary ( HeritageBank ), under which accruals had ceased and the plan had been terminated by HeritageBank immediately prior to the acquisition date.  Final distribution of all benefits under the plan was completed in August 2016.

The Company also provides retiree health benefits for certain employees who were employed by the Company and enrolled in the Company's health plan as of December 31, 2004. To receive benefits, an eligible employee must retire from service with the Company and its affiliates between age   55   and   65   and be credited with at least   15 years   of service or with   70   points, determined as the sum of age and service at retirement. The Company periodically determines the portion of the premium to be paid by each eligible retiree and the portion to be paid by the Company. Coverage ceases when an employee attains age   65   and is eligible for Medicare. The Company also provides life insurance coverage for each retiree in the face amount of   $5   until age   70  . Retirees can purchase additional insurance or continue coverage beyond age   70   at their sole expense. 
    
  The plan expense for the legacy Renasant defined benefit pension plan ( Pension Benefits - Renasant ), the assumed HeritageBank defined pension plan ( Pension Benefits - HeritageBank ) and post-retirement health and life plans ( Other Benefits ) for the periods presented was as follows:

In March 2011, the Company adopted a long-term equity incentive plan, which provides for the grant of stock options and the award of restricted stock. The plan replaced the long-term incentive plan adopted in 2001, which expired in October 2011. The Company issues shares of treasury stock to satisfy stock options exercised or restricted stock granted under the plan. Options granted under the plan allow participants to acquire shares of the Company's common stock at a fixed exercise price and expire   ten years   after the grant date. Options vest and become exercisable in installments over a   three  -year period measured from the grant date. Options that have not vested are forfeited and canceled upon the termination of a participant's employment. There were   no   stock options granted during the three or   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
    
  The following table summarizes the changes in stock options as of and for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  : 

The Company awards performance-based restricted stock to executives and other officers and employees and time-based restricted stock to directors, executives and other officers and employees under the long-term equity incentive plan.  The performance-based restricted stock vests upon completion of a   one  -year service period and the attainment of certain performance goals.  Performance-based restricted stock is issued at the target level; the number of shares ultimately awarded is determined at the end of each year and may be increased or decreased depending on the Company falling short of, meeting or exceeding financial performance

measures defined by the Board of Directors.  Time-based restricted stock vests at the end of the service period defined in the respective grant.  The fair value of each restricted stock award is the closing price of the Company's common stock on the day immediately preceding the award date.  The following table summarizes the changes in restricted stock as of and for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  : 

During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company reissued   128,912   shares from treasury in connection with the exercise of stock options and awards of restricted stock. The Company recorded total stock-based compensation expense of   $848   and   $1,019   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $2,563   and   $2,739   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 

Note H   Segment Reporting 
  (In Thousands) 
  The operations of the Company s reportable segments are described as follows: 
             
    The Community Banks segment delivers a complete range of banking and financial services to individuals and small to medium-sized businesses including checking and savings accounts, business and personal loans, asset-based lending and equipment leasing, as well as safe deposit and night depository facilities. 
                
    The Insurance segment includes a full service insurance agency offering all major lines of commercial and personal insurance through major carriers. 
                
    The Wealth Management segment offers a broad range of fiduciary services which includes the administration and management of trust accounts including personal and corporate benefit accounts, self-directed IRAs, and custodial accounts. In addition, the Wealth Management segment offers annuities, mutual funds and other investment services through a third party broker-dealer. 
     In order to give the Company s divisional management a more precise indication of the income and expenses they can control, the results of operations for the Community Banks, the Insurance and the Wealth Management segments reflect the direct revenues and expenses of each respective segment. Indirect revenues and expenses, including but not limited to income from the Company s investment portfolio, as well as certain costs associated with data processing and back office functions, primarily support the operations of the community banks and, therefore, are included in the results of the Community Banks segment. Included in  Other  are the operations of the holding company and other eliminations which are necessary for purposes of reconciling to the consolidated amounts.

Fair Value Measurements and the Fair Level Hierarchy 
  ASC 820,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,  provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities and also establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to a valuation based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities (Level 1), moderate priority to a valuation based on quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities and/or based on assumptions that are observable in the market (Level 2), and the lowest priority to a valuation based on assumptions that are not observable in the market (Level 3). 
  Recurring Fair Value Measurements 
  The Company carries certain assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis in accordance with applicable standards. The Company s recurring fair value measurements are based on the requirement to carry such assets and liabilities at fair value or the Company s election to carry certain eligible assets and liabilities at fair value. Assets and liabilities that are required to be carried at fair value on a recurring basis include securities available for sale and derivative instruments. The Company has elected to carry mortgage loans held for sale at fair value on a recurring basis as permitted under the guidance in ASC 825,  Financial Instruments  ( ASC 825 ). 
  The following methods and assumptions are used by the Company to estimate the fair values of the Company s financial assets and liabilities that are measured on a recurring basis: 
  Securities available for sale  : Securities available for sale consist primarily of debt securities, such as obligations of U.S. Government agencies and corporations, mortgage-backed securities, trust preferred securities, and other debt and equity securities. Where quoted market prices in active markets are available, securities are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. If quoted prices from active markets are not available, fair values are based on quoted market prices for similar instruments traded in active markets, quoted market prices for identical or similar instruments traded in markets that are not active, or model-based valuation techniques where all significant assumptions are observable in the market. Such instruments are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. When assumptions used in model-based valuation techniques are not observable in the market, the assumptions used by management reflect estimates of assumptions used by other market participants in determining fair value. When there is limited transparency around the inputs to the valuation, the instruments are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. 
  Derivative instruments  : The Company uses derivatives to manage various financial risks. Most of the Company s derivative contracts are extensively traded in over-the-counter markets and are valued using discounted cash flow models which incorporate observable market based inputs including current market interest rates, credit spreads, and other factors. Such instruments are categorized within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy and include interest rate swaps and other interest rate contracts such as interest rate caps and/or floors. The Company s interest rate lock commitments are valued using current market prices for mortgage-backed securities with similar characteristics, adjusted for certain factors including servicing and risk. The value of the Company s forward commitments is based on current prices for securities backed by similar types of loans. Because these assumptions are observable in active markets, the Company s interest rate lock commitments and forward commitments are categorized within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 
  Mortgage loans held for sale  : Mortgage loans held for sale are primarily agency loans which trade in active secondary markets. The fair value of these instruments is derived from current market pricing for similar loans, adjusted for differences in loan characteristics, including servicing and risk. Because the valuation is based on external pricing of similar instruments, mortgage loans held for sale are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

The Company reviews fair value hierarchy classifications on a quarterly basis. Changes in the Company s ability to observe inputs to the valuation may cause reclassification of certain assets or liabilities within the fair value hierarchy. Transfers between levels of the hierarchy are deemed to have occurred at the end of period. There were no such transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  .

Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements 
  Certain assets may be recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These nonrecurring fair value adjustments typically are a result of the application of the lower of cost or market accounting or a write-down occurring during the period. The following table provides the fair value measurement for assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis that were still held on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of the dates presented and the level within the fair value hierarchy each is classified: 

The following methods and assumptions are used by the Company to estimate the fair values of the Company s financial assets and liabilities measured on a nonrecurring basis: 
    
  Impaired loans:   Loans considered impaired are reserved for at the time the loan is identified as impaired taking into account the fair value of the collateral less estimated selling costs. Collateral may be real estate and/or business assets including but not limited to equipment, inventory and accounts receivable. The fair value of real estate is determined based on appraisals by qualified licensed appraisers. The fair value of the business assets is generally based on amounts reported on the business s financial statements. Appraised and reported values may be adjusted based on changes in market conditions from the time of valuation and management s knowledge of the client and the client s business. Since not all valuation inputs are observable, these nonrecurring fair value  
  
   34 

     Table of Contents  
  Renasant Corporation and Subsidiaries 
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 

determinations are classified as Level 3. Impaired loans are reviewed and evaluated on at least a quarterly basis for additional impairment and adjusted accordingly, based on the same factors previously identified. Impaired loans covered under loss-share agreements were recorded at their fair value upon the acquisition date, and no fair value adjustments were necessary for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   or   2015  . Impaired loans not covered under loss-share agreements that were measured or re-measured at fair value had a carrying value of   $9,908   and   $7,191   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, and a specific reserve for these loans of   $2,721   and   $683   was included in the allowance for loan losses as of such dates. 
  Other real estate owned  : OREO is comprised of commercial and residential real estate obtained in partial or total satisfaction of loan obligations. OREO covered under loss-share agreements is recorded at its fair value on its acquisition date. OREO not covered under loss-share agreements acquired in settlement of indebtedness is recorded at the fair value of the real estate less estimated costs to sell. Subsequently, it may be necessary to record nonrecurring fair value adjustments for declines in fair value. Fair value, when recorded, is determined based on appraisals by qualified licensed appraisers and adjusted for management s estimates of costs to sell. Accordingly, values for OREO are classified as Level 3. 
  The following table presents OREO measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis that was still held in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of the dates presented: 

Mortgage servicing rights  : Mortgage servicing rights are carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value. Fair value is determined using an income approach with various assumptions including expected cash flows, market discount rates, prepayment speeds, servicing costs, and other factors. Because these factors are not all observable and include management s assumptions, mortgage servicing rights are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Mortgage servicing rights were carried at amortized cost at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , and   $40   in impairment charges were recognized in earnings for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . There were   no   impairment charges recognized in earnings for the same time period in   2015  . 
  The following table presents information as of   September 30, 2016   about significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) used in the valuation of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis:

Fair Value Option 
  The Company elected to measure all mortgage loans originated for sale on or after July 1, 2012 at fair value under the fair value option as permitted under ASC 825. Electing to measure these assets at fair value reduces certain timing differences and better matches the changes in fair value of the loans with changes in the fair value of derivative instruments used to economically hedge them.

Net losses of   $145   and net gains of   $1,023   resulting from fair value changes of these mortgage loans were recorded in income during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively. The amount does not reflect changes in fair values of related derivative instruments used to hedge exposure to market-related risks associated with these mortgage loans. The change in fair value of both mortgage loans held for sale and the related derivative instruments are recorded in  Mortgage banking income  in the Consolidated Statements of Income. 
  The Company s valuation of mortgage loans held for sale incorporates an assumption for credit risk; however, given the short-term period that the Company holds these loans, valuation adjustments attributable to instrument-specific credit risk is nominal. Interest income on mortgage loans held for sale measured at fair value is accrued as it is earned based on contractual rates and is reflected in loan interest income on the Consolidated Statements of Income. 
  The following table summarizes the differences between the fair value and the principal balance for mortgage loans held for sale measured at fair value as of: 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
  The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of the Company s financial instruments, including those assets and liabilities that are not measured and reported at fair value on a recurring basis or nonrecurring basis, were as follows as of the dates presented:

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that value. The methodologies for estimating the fair value of financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring or nonrecurring basis were discussed previously. 
  Cash and cash equivalents  : Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and due from banks and interest-bearing balances with banks. The carrying amount reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value based on the short-term nature of these assets. 
  Securities held to maturity  : Securities held to maturity consist of debt securities such as obligations of U.S. Government agencies, states, and other political subdivisions. Where quoted market prices in active markets are available, securities are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. If quoted prices in active markets are not available, fair values are based on quoted market prices for similar instruments traded in active markets, quoted market prices for identical or similar instruments traded in markets that are not active, or model-based valuation techniques where all significant assumptions are observable in the market. Such instruments are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. When assumptions used in model-based valuation techniques are not observable in the market, the assumptions used by management reflect estimates of assumptions used by other market participants in determining fair value. When there is limited transparency around the inputs to the valuation, the instruments are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. 
  Loans covered under loss-share agreements  : The fair value of loans covered under loss-share agreements is based on the net present value of future cash proceeds expected to be received using discount rates that are derived from current market rates and reflect the level of interest risk in the covered loans. 
  Loans not covered under loss-share agreements  : For variable-rate loans not covered under loss-share agreements that reprice frequently and with no significant change in credit risk, fair values are based on carrying values. Fair values of fixed-rate loans not covered under loss-share agreements, including mortgages and commercial, agricultural and consumer loans, are estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis based on interest rates currently being offered for loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit quality. 
  FDIC loss-share indemnification asset  : The fair value of the FDIC loss-share indemnification asset is based on the net present value of future cash flows expected to be received from the FDIC under the provisions of the loss-share agreements using a discount rate that is based on current market rates for the underlying covered loans. Current market rates are used in light of the uncertainty of the timing and receipt of the loss-share reimbursement from the FDIC. 
  Deposits  : The fair values disclosed for demand deposits, both interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing, are, by definition, equal to the amount payable on demand at the reporting date. Such deposits are classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. The  
  
   37 

     Table of Contents  
  Renasant Corporation and Subsidiaries 
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 

fair values of certificates of deposit and individual retirement accounts are estimated using a discounted cash flow based on currently effective interest rates for similar types of deposits. These deposits are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 
  Short-term borrowings  : Short-term borrowings consist of securities sold under agreements to repurchase and short-term FHLB advances. The fair value of these borrowings approximates the carrying value of the amounts reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for each respective account given the short-term nature of the liabilities. 
  Federal Home Loan Bank advances  : The fair value for Federal Home Loan Bank ( FHLB ) advances is determined by discounting the expected future cash outflows using current market rates for similar borrowings, or Level 2 inputs. 
  Junior subordinated debentures and subordinated notes  : The fair value for the Company s junior subordinated debentures and subordinated notes is determined using quoted market prices for similar instruments traded in active markets. 

Note J   Derivative Instruments 
  (In Thousands) 
  The Company utilizes derivative financial instruments, including interest rate contracts such as swaps, caps and/or floors, as part of its ongoing efforts to mitigate its interest rate risk exposure and to facilitate the needs of its customers. The Company also from time to time enters into derivative instruments that are not designated as hedging instruments to help its commercial customers manage their exposure to interest rate fluctuations. To mitigate the interest rate risk associated with these customer contracts, the Company enters into an offsetting derivative contract position. The Company manages its credit risk, or potential risk of default by its commercial customers, through credit limit approval and monitoring procedures. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had notional amounts of   $80,065   on interest rate contracts with corporate customers and   $80,065   in offsetting interest rate contracts with other financial institutions to mitigate the Company s rate exposure on its corporate customers  contracts and certain fixed-rate loans. 
    
  In June 2014, the Company entered into   two   forward interest rate swap contracts on floating rate liabilities at the Bank level with notional amounts of   $15,000   each. The interest rate swap contracts are each accounted for as a cash flow hedge with the objective of protecting against any interest rate volatility on future FHLB borrowings for a   four  -year and   five  -year period beginning June 1, 2018 and December 3, 2018 and ending June 2022 and June 2023, respectively.  Under these contracts, Renasant Bank will pay a fixed interest rate and will receive a variable interest rate based on the three-month LIBOR plus a pre-determined spread, with quarterly net settlements  . 
  In March and April 2012, the Company entered into   two   interest rate swap agreements effective March 30, 2014 and March 17, 2014, respectively. Under these swap agreements, the Company receives a variable rate of interest based on   the three-month LIBOR plus a pre-determined spread   and pays a fixed rate of interest. The agreements, which both terminate in March 2022, are accounted for as cash flow hedges to reduce the variability in cash flows resulting from changes in interest rates on   $32,000   of the Company s junior subordinated debentures.  
  In connection with its merger with First M F Corporation ( First M F ), the Company assumed an interest rate swap designed to convert floating rate interest payments into fixed rate payments.  Based on the terms of the agreement, which terminates in March 2018, the Company receives a variable rate of interest based on the three-month LIBOR plus a pre-determined spread and pays a fixed rate of interest.  The interest rate swap is accounted for as a cash flow hedge to reduce the variability in cash flows resulting from changes in interest rates on   $30,000   of the junior subordinated debentures assumed in the merger with First M F.

The Company enters into interest rate lock commitments with its customers to mitigate the interest rate risk associated with the commitments to fund fixed-rate residential mortgage loans. The notional amount of commitments to fund fixed-rate mortgage loans was   $265,911   and   $251,676   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The Company also enters into forward commitments to sell residential mortgage loans to secondary market investors. The notional amount of commitments to sell residential mortgage loans to secondary market investors was   $353,000   and   $293,500   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.

Gains (losses) included in the Consolidated Statements of Income related to the Company s derivative financial instruments were as follows as of the periods presented: 

For the Company's derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, changes in fair value of the cash flow hedges are, to the extent that the hedging relationship is effective, recorded as other comprehensive income and are subsequently recognized in earnings at the same time that the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The ineffective portions of the changes in fair value of the hedging instruments are immediately recognized in earnings. The assessment of the effectiveness of the hedging relationship is evaluated under the hypothetical derivative method. There were no ineffective portions for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  . The impact on other comprehensive income for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , can be seen at Note K, "Other Comprehensive Income."

Offsetting 
    
  Certain financial instruments, including derivatives, may be eligible for offset in the consolidated balance sheet when the "right of setoff" exists or when the instruments are subject to an enforceable master netting agreement, which includes the right of the non-defaulting party or non-affected party to offset recognized amounts, including collateral posted with the counterparty, to determine a net receivable or net payable upon early termination of the agreement.  Certain of the Company's derivative instruments are subject to master netting agreements; however, the Company has not elected to offset such financial instruments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The following table presents the Company's gross derivative positions as recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as well as the net derivative positions, including collateral pledged to the extent the application of such collateral did not reduce the net derivative liability position below zero, had the Company elected to offset those instruments subject to an enforceable master netting agreement:

Note N   Regulatory Matters 
  (In Thousands) 
  Renasant Bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory, and possibly additional discretionary, actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on Renasant Bank s financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, Renasant Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of Renasant Bank s assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. Renasant Bank s capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors. 
    
  The Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency have issued guidelines governing the levels of capital that banks must maintain. Those guidelines specify capital tiers, which include the following classifications:

The following table provides the capital and risk-based capital and leverage ratios for the Company and for Renasant Bank as of   September 30, 

In July 2013, the Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency approved the implementation of the Basel III regulatory capital reforms and issued rules effecting certain changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act (the  Basel III Rules ) that call for broad and comprehensive revision of regulatory capital standards for U.S. banking organizations.  Generally, the new Basel III Rules became effective on January 1, 2015, although parts of the Basel III Rules will be phased in through 2019.  The Basel III Rules implemented a new common equity Tier 1 minimum capital requirement ( CET1 ), and a higher minimum Tier 1 capital requirement, as reflected in the table above, and adjusted other items affecting the calculation of the numerator of a banking organization s risk-based capital ratios.  The new CET1 capital ratio includes common equity as defined under GAAP and does not include any other type of non-common equity under  GAAP.  Additionally, the Basel III Rules apply limits to a banking organization s capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments if the banking organization does not hold a specified amount of CET1 capital in addition to the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. 
    
  Further, the Basel III Rules changed the agencies  general risk-based capital requirements for determining risk-weighted assets, which affect the calculation of the denominator of a banking organization s risk-based capital ratios. The Basel III Rules have  
  
   48 

     Table of Contents  
  Renasant Corporation and Subsidiaries 
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 

revised the agencies  rules for calculating risk-weighted assets to enhance risk sensitivity and to incorporate certain international capital standards of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision set forth in the standardized approach of the  International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards: A Revised Framework . 
    
  The calculation of risk-weighted assets in the denominator of the Basel III capital ratios has been adjusted to reflect the higher risk nature of certain types of loans. Specifically, as applicable to the Company and Renasant Bank: 
    
    Residential mortgages: Replaced the former   50%   risk weight for performing residential first-lien mortgages and a   100%   risk-weight for all other mortgages with a risk weight of between   35%   and   200%   determined by the mortgage s loan-to-value ratio and whether the mortgage falls into one of two categories based on eight criteria that include the term, use of negative amortization and balloon payments, certain rate increases and documented and verified borrower income. 
    
    Commercial mortgages: Replaced the former   100%   risk weight with a   150%   risk weight for certain high volatility commercial real estate acquisition, development and construction loans. 
    
     Nonperforming loans: Replaced the former   100%   risk weight with a   150%   risk weight for loans, other than residential mortgages, that are   90 days   past due or on nonaccrual status.  
  The Final Rules also introduce a new capital conservation buffer designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. The capital conservation buffer is composed entirely of CET1, on top of these minimum risk-weighted asset ratios. In addition, the Final Rules provide for a countercyclical capital buffer applicable only to certain covered institutions. It is not expected that the countercyclical capital buffer will be applicable to the Company or Renasant Bank. Banking institutions with a ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the capital conservation buffer (or below the combined capital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer, when the latter is applied) will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall. The implementation of the capital conservation buffer began on January 1, 2016 at the   0.625%   level and be phased in over a   4  -year period (increasing by that amount on each subsequent January 1, until it reaches   2.5%   on January 1, 2019).

The Company acquired federal and state net operating losses as part of the Heritage acquisition. The federal net operating loss acquired totaled   $18,321  , of which   $7,124    remained to be utilized as of   September 30, 2016  , while state net operating losses totaled   $17,168  , of which   $15,062   remained to be utilized as of   September 30, 2016  .  Both the federal and state net operating losses will expire at various dates beginning in 2024. 
    
  The Company expects to utilize the federal and state net operating losses prior to expiration.  Because the benefits are expected to be fully realized, the Company recorded   no   valuation allowance against the net operating losses for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   or the year ended   December 31, 2015  .

The Company is finalizing the fair values of taxes and property and equipment related to the KeyWorth acquisition; as such, the recorded balance of goodwill is subject to change. The adjustment to previously recorded goodwill is due to valuation adjustments on property and equipment as well as certain loans acquired from Heritage. There were   no   adjustments to goodwill during the three months ended September 30, 2016.

  On August 22, 2016, the Company issued and sold in an underwritten public offering   $60,000   aggregate principal amount of its   5.00%   Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due 2026 (the  2026 Notes ) and   $40,000   aggregate principal amount of its   5.50%   Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due 2031 (the  2031 Notes  the 2026 Notes and the 2031 Notes are referred to collectively as the  Notes ), at a public offering price equal to   100%   of the aggregate principal amounts of the Notes.  The net proceeds from the sale of the Notes to the Company were approximately   $98,167  , after giving effect to the underwriting discount of   1.50%   and expenses of the offering of the Notes.  
    
  The 2026 Notes will mature on September 1, 2026. Until but excluding September 1, 2021, the Company will pay interest on the 2026 Notes semi-annually in arrears on each March 1 and September 1, commencing March 1, 2017, at a fixed annual interest rate equal to   5.00%  . From and including September 1, 2021 to but excluding the maturity date or the date of earlier redemption, the interest rate will reset quarterly to an annual interest rate equal to the then-current three-month LIBOR rate plus a spread of 384 basis points, payable quarterly in arrears on each March 1, June 1, September 1 and December 1. Notwithstanding the foregoing,

  Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
  In addition to results presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ("GAAP"), this document contains certain non-GAAP financial measures.  These non-GAAP financial measures adjust GAAP financial measures to exclude purchase accounting adjustments from loan interest income and net interest income when calculating the Company's taxable equivalent loan yields and net interest margin, respectively, which the Company's management uses when evaluating core operating results and assessing ongoing profitability.  In addition, the Company  believes that these non-GAAP  
  
   53 

     Table of Contents  

financial measures facilitate the making of period-to-period comparisons and provide useful information to investors, analysts, regulators and other users of the financial statements by excluding certain items specific to our mergers and acquisition activities and allow these readers to more easily compare the Company's results to the results of other companies without similar mergers and acquisitions activities.   
    
  The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for any measure prepared in accordance with GAAP.  Readers of this Form 10-Q should note that, because there are no standard definitions for the calculations as well as the results, the Company's calculations may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures presented by other companies.  Also there may be limits in the usefulness of these measures to readers of this document.  As a result, the Company encourages readers to consider its consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. 

Financial Condition 
  The following discussion provides details regarding the changes in significant balance sheet accounts at   September 30, 2016   compared to   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Mergers and Acquisitions  
    
  On April 1, 2016, the Company completed its acquisition of KeyWorth Bank ( KeyWorth ), a bank headquartered in Johns Creek, Georgia.  At closing, KeyWorth merged with and into Renasant Bank.  As of the acquisition date, KeyWorth operated   six   banking locations in the Atlanta metropolitan area and had, prior to any purchase accounting adjustments, approximately $399,252 in assets, $284,410 in loans and $346,988 in deposits.  The Company is finalizing the fair value of certain taxes and property and equipment related to the KeyWorth acquisition. 
    
  On July 1, 2015, the Company completed its acquisition of Heritage Financial Group, Inc. ( Heritage ), a bank holding company headquartered in Albany, Georgia, and the parent of HeritageBank of the South. On the same date, HeritageBank of the South was merged into Renasant Bank.  As of the acquisition date, Heritage operated 48 banking, mortgage and investment offices in Alabama, Georgia and Florida and had, prior to any purchase accounting adjustments, approximately $1,869,514 in assets, $1,137,774 in loans, and $1,373,777 in deposits. 
    
  The discussion of the impact of the KeyWorth and Heritage acquisitions on the specific components of the Company's financial condition and results of operations below reflects the effect of purchase accounting adjustments, when applicable. See Note M,  Mergers and Acquisitions,  in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1,  Financial Statements,  for details regarding the Company s recent mergers and acquisitions.  The Company's financial condition and results of operations include the impact of KeyWorth's and Heritage's operations since the respective acquisition dates. 
  Assets 
  Total assets were   $8,542,471   at   September 30, 2016   compared to   $7,926,496   at   December 31, 2015  .  The acquisition of KeyWorth increased total assets approximately   $415,232   at April 1, 2016. 
  Investments 
  The securities portfolio is used to provide a source for meeting liquidity needs and to supply securities to be used in collateralizing certain deposits and other types of borrowings. The following table shows the carrying value of our securities portfolio by investment type and the percentage of such investment type relative to the entire securities portfolio as of the dates presented: 

54 

     Table of Contents  

The balance of our securities portfolio at   September 30, 2016   decreased   $65,248   to   $1,039,957   from   $1,105,205   at   December 31, 2015  .  The KeyWorth acquisition increased the securities portfolio approximately $69,395 at the acquisition date.  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we purchased   $92,887   in investment securities. Mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations ( CMOs ), in the aggregate, comprised 88.17% of the purchases during the   first nine months of      2016  . CMOs are included in the  Mortgage-backed securities  line item in the above table. The mortgage-backed securities and CMOs held in our investment portfolio are primarily issued by government sponsored entities. Government agency and municipal securities accounted for the remainder of the securities purchased in the   first nine months of      2016  . Proceeds from maturities, calls, sales and principal payments on securities during the   first nine months of   2016   totaled   $230,565  .   
  The Company holds investments in pooled trust preferred securities. This portfolio had a cost basis of   $24,628   and   $24,770   and a fair value of   $18,092   and   $19,469   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. At   September 30, 2016  , the investment in pooled trust preferred securities consisted of three securities representing interests in various tranches of trusts collateralized by debt issued by over   250   financial institutions. Management s determination of the fair value of each of its holdings is based on the current credit ratings, the known deferrals and defaults by the underlying issuing financial institutions and the degree to which future deferrals and defaults would be required to occur before the cash flow for our tranches is negatively impacted. The Company s quarterly evaluation of these investments for other-than-temporary-impairment resulted in no additional write-downs during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   or   2015  . Furthermore, the Company's analysis of the pooled trust preferred securities during the second quarter of 2015 supported a return to accrual status for one of the three securities (XXVI). During the second quarter of 2014, the Company's analysis supported a return to accrual status for one of the other securities (XXIII). An observed history of principal and interest payments combined with improved qualitative and quantitative factors described above justified the accrual of interest on these securities.  However, the remaining security (XXIV) is still in  payment in kind  status where interest payments are not expected until a future date and, therefore, the qualitative and quantitative factors described above do not justify a return to accrual status at this time.  As a result, pooled trust preferred security XXIV remains classified as a nonaccruing asset at   September 30, 2016  ,  and investment interest is recorded on the cash-basis method until qualifying for return to accrual status.  For more information about the Company s trust preferred securities, see Note B,  Securities,  in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company in Item 1,  Financial Statements,  in this report. 
    
  Over recent periods, pricing on the Company's pooled trust preferred securities has improved such that the amortized cost on one of its pooled trust preferred securities (XIII) had been fully recovered as of March 31, 2015. During the second quarter of 2015, the Company sold this security, having a carrying value of $1,117 at the time of sale, for net proceeds of $1,213, resulting in a gain of $96.   
  Loans 
  The table below sets forth the balance of loans, net of unearned income, outstanding by loan type and the percentage of each loan type to total loans as of the dates presented: 

Loan concentrations are considered to exist when there are amounts loaned to a number of borrowers engaged in similar activities which would cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions. At   September 30, 2016  , there were no concentrations of loans exceeding 10% of total loans which are not disclosed as a category of loans separate from the categories listed above. 
  Total loans at   September 30, 2016   were   $6,105,233  , an increase of   $691,771   from   $5,413,462   at   December 31, 2015  . The KeyWorth acquisition increased the loan portfolio $272,330 at the acquisition date.   
  Loans covered under loss-share agreements with the FDIC (referred to as  covered loans ), including the two loss-share agreements assumed in connection with the Heritage acquisition, were   $30,533   at   September 30, 2016  , a decrease of   $62,609  , or   67.22%  , compared to   $93,142   at   December 31, 2015  .  This decrease is primarily a result of the expiration of loss-share coverage on certain loans as discussed below. For covered loans, the FDIC will reimburse Renasant Bank 80% of the losses incurred on these loans.   
  
   55 

     Table of Contents  

Renasant Bank has a corresponding obligation to reimburse the FDIC for 80% of eligible recoveries with respect to these loans.  The loss-share agreements applicable to this portfolio provide reimbursement for qualifying losses on single-family residential loans for ten years, which ends on July 31, 2020 for loans acquired from Crescent Bank   Trust Company ( Crescent ), February 28, 2021 for loans acquired from each of American Trust Bank ( American Trust ) and Citizens Bank of Effingham ( Citizens Effingham ) and August 31, 2021 for loans acquired from First Southern National Bank ( First Southern ).  For qualifying losses on commercial loans, reimbursement ran for five years, which ended July 25, 2015 for Crescent loans, February 5, 2016 for American Trust loans, February 18, 2016 for Citizens Effingham loans and August 19, 2016 for First Southern loans.  As a result of the expiration of these loss-share agreements, the Company reclassified loans from acquired covered loans to acquired non-covered loans totaling $54,495 during the third quarter of 2015, $42,637 during the first quarter of 2016 and $9,893 during the third quarter of 2016. 
  Loans not covered under loss-share agreements with the FDIC at   September 30, 2016   were   $6,074,700  , compared to   $5,320,320   at   December 31, 2015  .  Loans acquired and not covered under loss-share agreements totaled   $1,548,674   at   September 30, 2016   compared to   $1,489,886   at   December 31, 2015  .   
  Excluding the loans acquired from previous acquisitions or in FDIC-assisted transactions (collectively referred to as "acquired loans"), loans increased   $695,592   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . The Company experienced loan growth across all categories of loans with loans from our new commercial business lines, which consist of asset-based lending, equipment leasing and healthcare banking groups, contributing $36,492 of the total increase in loans from   December 31, 2015  .  
  Looking at the change in loans geographically, non-acquired loans in our Mississippi, Tennessee and Georgia markets increased $107,571, $96,601 and $291,642, respectively, while loans in our Alabama and Florida markets (collectively referred to as our  Central Division ) increased by $199,778 when compared to   December 31, 2015  . 
  The following tables provide a breakdown of non-acquired loans, loans acquired and covered under loss-share agreements, and loans acquired and not covered under loss-share agreements as of the dates presented:

     Table of Contents  

Mortgage loans held for sale were   $189,965   at   September 30, 2016   compared to   $225,254   at   December 31, 2015  .  Originations of mortgage loans to be sold totaled   $1,516,650   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $992,555   for the same period in   2015  .  The increase in mortgage loan originations is due to an increase in mortgage activity driven by historically low mortgage rates and the addition of Heritage's mortgage operations in the third quarter of 2015.  
    
  Mortgage loans to be sold are sold either on a  best efforts  basis or under a mandatory delivery sales agreement. Under a  best 
  efforts  sales agreement, residential real estate originations are locked in at a contractual rate with third party private investors or directly with government sponsored agencies, and the Company is obligated to sell the mortgages to such investors only if the mortgages are closed and funded. The risk we assume is conditioned upon loan underwriting and market conditions in the national mortgage market. Under a mandatory delivery sales agreement, the Company commits to deliver a certain principal amount of mortgage loans to an investor at a specified price and delivery date. Penalties are paid to the investor if we fail to satisfy the contract. Gains and losses are realized at the time consideration is received and all other criteria for sales treatment have been met.  These loans are typically sold within thirty days after the loan is funded; however, in recent quarters, the Company has elected to hold these loans longer than thirty days to collect additional interest payments without negatively impacting the income generated from the sale of these loans. Although loan fees and some interest income are derived from mortgage loans held for sale, the main source of income is gains from the sale of these loans in the secondary market. 
  Deposits 
    
  The Company relies on deposits as its major source of funds. Total deposits were   $6,817,798   and   $6,218,602   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. Noninterest-bearing deposits were   $1,514,820   and   $1,278,337   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, while interest-bearing deposits were   $5,302,978   and   $4,940,265   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  The acquisition of KeyWorth increased total deposits by $348,961 at the acquisition date. This consisted of noninterest-bearing deposits of $73,077 and interest-bearing deposits of $275,884.  Management continues to focus on growing and maintaining a stable source of funding, specifically core deposits.  Under certain circumstances, however, management may elect to acquire non-core deposits in the form of public fund deposits or time deposits.  The source of funds that we select depends on the terms and how those terms assist us in mitigating interest rate risk, maintaining our liquidity position and managing our net interest margin.  Accordingly, funds are only acquired when needed and at a rate that is prudent under the circumstances.  

57 

     Table of Contents  

Public fund deposits are those of counties, municipalities or other political subdivisions and may be readily obtained based on the Company s pricing bid in comparison with competitors. Since public fund deposits are obtained through a bid process, these deposit balances may fluctuate as competitive and market forces change. The Company has focused on growing stable sources of deposits to reduce reliance on public fund deposits. However, the Company continues to participate in the bidding process for public fund deposits when it is reasonable under the circumstances. Our public fund transaction accounts are principally obtained from municipalities including school boards and utilities. Public fund deposits were $804,839 and $775,385 at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  
    
  Looking at the change in deposits geographically, deposits in our Mississippi and Tennessee markets increased $200,953 and $45,250, respectively, from   December 31, 2015  , while deposits in our Central Division markets decreased $35,364 from   December 31, 2015  .  Excluding the contribution from KeyWorth, deposits in our Georgia markets increased $70,550 from   December 31, 2015  . 
  Borrowed Funds 
    
  Total borrowings include securities sold under agreements to repurchase, short-term borrowings, advances from the FHLB, subordinated notes and junior subordinated debentures and are classified on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as either short-term borrowings or long-term debt. Short-term borrowings have original maturities less than one year and typically include securities sold under agreements to repurchase, federal funds purchased and short-term FHLB advances. There were   $266,943   of short-term borrowings, consisting of security repurchase agreements of   $9,943   and short-term borrowings from the FHLB of   $257,000  , at   September 30, 2016   compared to security repurchase agreements of   $22,279   and short-term borrowings from the FHLB of    $400,000   at   December 31, 2015  .  
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , long-term debt totaled   $202,637   compared to   $148,217   at   December 31, 2015  . Funds are borrowed from the FHLB primarily to match-fund against certain loans, negating interest rate exposure when rates rise. Such match-funded loans are typically large, fixed rate commercial or real estate loans with long-term maturities. Long-term FHLB advances were   $8,806   and   $52,930   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  During the third quarter of 2016, the Company prepaid $38,886 in long-term FHLB advances and incurred prepayment penalties of $2,210.  At   September 30, 2016  , $9 of the total FHLB advances outstanding were scheduled to mature within twelve months or less.  The Company had $1,964,477 of availability on unused lines of credit with the FHLB at   September 30, 2016   compared to $1,659,779 at   December 31, 2015  . The cost of our long-term FHLB advances was   4.05%   and   4.16%   for the   first nine months of   2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  The Company owns the outstanding common securities of business trusts that issued corporation-obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred capital securities to third-party investors.  The trusts used the proceeds from the issuance of their preferred capital securities and common securities (collectively referred to as  capital securities ) to buy floating rate junior subordinated debentures issued by the Company (or by companies that the Company subsequently acquired.)  The debentures are the trusts' only assets and interest payments from the debentures finance the distributions paid on the capital securities.  The Company's junior subordinated debentures totaled   $95,506   at   September 30, 2016   compared to   $95,095   at   December 31, 2015  .  
    
  On August 22, 2016, the Company completed an underwritten public offering and sale of $60,000 of its 5.00% fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes due September 1, 2026, and $40,000 of its 5.50% fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes due September 1, 2031 (collectively, the "Notes").  The Notes were sold at par, resulting in net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts and expenses, of $98,167.  The Company has used, and intends to continue to use, the net proceeds from the Notes offerings for general corporate purposes, which may include providing capital to support the Company's growth organically or through strategic acquisitions, repaying indebtedness and financing investments and capital expenditures, and for investments in the Bank as regulatory capital.   The Notes are included in Tier 2 capital under the current regulatory guidelines. For more information about the terms and conditions of the Notes, see Note R,  Subordinated Notes,  in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company in Item 1,   Financial Statements,  in this report.

The Company did not incur any FHLB prepayment penalties in the third quarter of 2015. 
    
  Net Interest Income 
    
  Net interest income, the difference between interest earned on assets and the cost of interest-bearing liabilities, is the largest component of our net income, comprising   66.94%   of total net revenue for the   third quarter of 2016  . Total net revenue consists of net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis and noninterest income. The primary concerns in managing net interest income are the volume, mix and repricing of assets and liabilities. 
    
  Net interest income increased to   $75,731   for the   third quarter of 2016   compared to   $68,612   for the same period in   2015  . On a tax equivalent basis, net interest income was   $77,483   for the   third quarter of 2016   as compared to   $70,553   for the   third quarter of 2015  .  Net interest margin, the tax equivalent net yield on earning assets, increased to   4.15%   during the   third quarter of 2016   compared to   4.09%   for the   third quarter of 2015  .  Net interest margin excluding the impact from purchase accounting adjustments on loans was 3.77% and 3.82% for the   third quarter of 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  The table below presents the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to reported net interest margin.   

(1)   
    Includes additional interest income recognized in connection with the acceleration of paydowns and payoffs from acquired loans of $3,426 and $804 for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, which increased net interest margin by 18 basis points and 5 basis points for the same periods, respectively. 
       
  Net interest margin and net interest income are influenced by internal and external factors.  Internal factors include balance sheet changes in volume, mix and pricing decisions. External factors include changes in market interest rates, competition and the shape of the interest rate yield curve.

  Interest income, on a tax equivalent basis, was   $84,784   for the   third quarter of 2016   compared to   $76,241   for the same period in   2015  . This increase in interest income, on a tax equivalent basis, is due primarily to the additional earning assets from the KeyWorth acquisition and loan growth in the Company's non-acquired loan portfolio as well as an increase in loan yields due to higher levels of accretable yield from the acquired loan portfolios.  Overall, after excluding the impact from purchase accounting adjustments, the Company continues to experience downward pressure on earning asset yields as a result of replacing higher rate maturing assets with new or renewed assets at current market rates which are generally lower due to the current interest rate environment.  
    
  The following table presents the percentage of total average earning assets, by type and yield, for the periods presented: 

For the   third quarter of 2016  , loan income, on a tax equivalent basis,   increased     $9,301   to   $77,154   from   $67,853   compared to the same period in   2015  . The average balance of loans increased   $667,578   from the   third quarter of 2016   compared to the   third quarter of 2015   due primarily to the loans acquired in connection with the KeyWorth acquisition as well as loan growth in the Company's non-acquired loan portfolio.  The tax equivalent yield on loans was   4.88%  , a   nine   basis point   increase   from the   third quarter of 2015  . Excluding the impact from purchase accounting adjustments, the tax equivalent yield on loans was 4.44% and 4.45% for the   third quarter of 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  The table below presents the reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures to reported taxable equivalent yield on loans.

(1)   
    Includes additional interest income recognized in connection with the acceleration of paydowns and payoffs from acquired loans of $3,426 and $804 for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, which increased our taxable equivalent loan yield by 22 basis points and 6 basis points for the same periods, respectively. 
       
  Investment income, on a tax equivalent basis,   decreased     $838   to   $7,499   for the   third quarter of 2016   from   $8,337   for the   third quarter of 2015  . The average balance in the investment portfolio for the   third quarter of 2016   was   $1,045,905   compared to   $1,143,577   for the same period in   2015  . The tax equivalent yield on the investment portfolio for the   third quarter of 2016   was   2.85%  , down   4   basis points from the same period in   2015  .   Proceeds from sales, maturities and calls of higher yielding securities were either redeployed to fund loan growth or reinvested in lower earning securities accounting for both the decrease in the average balance of investments and tax equivalent yield thereon when compared to the same period in the prior year.  The reinvestment rates on securities were lower due to the generally lower interest rate environment. 
    
  Interest expense was   $7,301   for the   third quarter of 2016   as compared to   $5,688   for the same period in   2015  .  The cost of interest-bearing liabilities was   0.50%   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to   0.41%   at   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  The following table presents, by type, the Company s funding sources, which consist of total average deposits and borrowed funds, and the total cost of each funding source for the periods presented: 

Interest expense on deposits was   $4,638   and   $3,615   for the   third quarter of 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The cost of interest-bearing deposits was   0.35%   and   0.29%   for the same periods.  Although the Company continues to seek changes in the mix of our deposits from higher costing time deposits to lower costing interest-bearing deposits and non-interest bearing deposits, rates offered on the Company's interest-bearing deposit accounts, including time deposits, have increased to match competitive market interest rates in order to maintain stable sources of funding.  
    
  Interest expense on total borrowings was   $2,663   and   $2,073   for the   third quarter of 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  The cost of total borrowed funds was   1.93%   and   1.48%   for the same periods.  The impact on the average balance of borrowings from the aforementioned Notes offering was nearly offset by the prepayment of long-term FHLB advances also mentioned previously.  The increase in the cost of the Company's borrowed funds is primarily driven by the higher interest rate on the Notes when compared  
  
   62 

     Table of Contents  

to the interest rate on the prepaid FHLB advances, coupled with increased market interest rates on the Company's short-term borrowings.   
    
  A more detailed discussion of the cost of our funding sources is set forth below under the heading  Liquidity and Capital Resources  in this item. 
    
  Noninterest Income 

Total noninterest income includes fees generated from deposit services, originations and sales of mortgage loans, insurance products, trust and other wealth management products and services, security gains and all other noninterest income. Our focus is to develop and enhance our products that generate noninterest income in order to diversify our revenue sources. Noninterest income was   $38,272   for the   third quarter of 2016   as compared to   $32,079   for the same period in   2015  .  The increase in noninterest income and its related components is primarily attributable to the KeyWorth acquisition and a significant increase in mortgage banking income. 
    
  Service charges on deposit accounts include maintenance fees on accounts, per item charges, account enhancement charges for additional packaged benefits and overdraft fees. Service charges on deposit accounts were   $8,200   and   $8,151   for the   third quarter of 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Overdraft fees, the largest component of service charges on deposits, were   $5,947   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $5,896   for the same period in   2015  . 
    
  Fees and commissions increased to   $4,921   during the   third quarter of 2016   as compared to   $4,271   for the same period in   2015  . Fees and commissions include fees related to deposit services, such as interchange fees on debit card transactions, as well as fees charged on mortgage loans originated to be sold, such as origination, underwriting, documentation and other administrative fees. For the   third quarter of 2016  , fees associated with debit card usage were   $4,023   as compared to   $3,934   for the same period in   2015  . 
    
  Through Renasant Insurance, we offer a range of commercial and personal insurance products through major insurance carriers. 
  Income earned on insurance products was   $2,420   and   $2,381   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  Contingency income, which is included in "Other noninterest income" in the Consolidated Statements of Income, is a bonus received from the insurance underwriters and is based both on commission income and claims experience on our clients' policies during the previous year. Increases and decreases in contingency income are reflective of corresponding increases and decreases in the amount of claims paid by insurance carriers. Contingency income was $25 and $50 for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  The Trust division within the Wealth Management segment operates on a custodial basis which includes administration of benefit plans, as well as accounting and money management for trust accounts. The division manages a number of trust accounts inclusive of personal and corporate benefit accounts, self-directed IRAs, and custodial accounts. Fees for managing these accounts are based on changes in market values of the assets under management in the account, with the amount of the fee depending on the type of account. Additionally, the Financial Services division within the Wealth Management segment provides specialized investment products and services to our customers, which include fixed and variable annuities, mutual funds, and stocks offered through a third party provider. Wealth Management revenue was   $3,040   for the   third quarter of 2016   compared to   $2,833   for the same period in   2015  .   The market value of trust assets under management was $3,091,815 and $3,003,550 at   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively.   
    
  Mortgage banking income is derived from the origination and sale of mortgage loans and the servicing of mortgage loans that the Company has sold but retained the right to service.  Mortgage banking income was   $15,846   and   $11,893   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Originations of mortgage loans to be sold totaled   $510,143   in the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $584,662   for the same period in   2015  . The increase in mortgage banking income is primarily driven by an increase in margins realized from the sales of loans.  The following table presents the components of mortgage banking income included in noninterest income for the three months ending   September 30  :

Other noninterest income includes contingency income from our insurance underwriters, income from our SBA banking division, and other miscellaneous income.  Other noninterest income was   $2,866   and   $1,440   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  The increase from   2015   is primarily attributable to income from our SBA banking division and the gains we realized on the sale of the guaranteed portion of loans originated by this division.  SBA banking income was $1,782 and $493 for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  Noninterest Expense 

Noninterest expense was   $76,468   and   $75,979   for the   third quarter of 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The Company recorded merger and conversion expenses of   $268   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to   $7,746   for the same period in   2015  .  During the   third quarter of 2016  , the Company recognized a penalty charge of   $2,210   in connection with the prepayment of $38,886 in borrowings from the FHLB.  No such charge was incurred during the comparable quarter in   2015  .  After considering these expenses, which are typically nonrecurring, the overall increase in noninterest expenses and its related components is primarily attributable to the addition of KeyWorth operations.  
    
  Salaries and employee benefits increased   $1,654   to   $44,702   for the   third quarter of 2016   as compared to   $43,048   for the same period in   2015  .   The increase in salary and employee benefits was primarily attributable to the KeyWorth acquisition along with higher levels of commissions and incentives paid in our commercial lending and mortgage banking divisions. 
    
  Data processing costs increased to   $4,560   in the   third quarter of 2016   from   $3,819   for the same period in   2015  . The increase for the   third quarter of 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015   was primarily attributable to the acquisition of KeyWorth as well as increased volume in mobile banking and increased volume on our small business internet banking platform.  
    
  Net occupancy and equipment expense for the   third quarter of 2016   was   $8,830  , up from   $7,733   for the same period in   2015  .  The increase is primarily attributable to the KeyWorth acquisition coupled with enhancements to our IT infrastructure in response to banking and governmental regulation and increased global risk from cyber security breaches. 
    
  Expenses related to other real estate owned for the   third quarter of 2016   were   $1,540   compared to   $861   for the same period in   2015  . Expenses on other real estate owned for the   third quarter of 2016   included write downs of   $1,048   of the carrying value to fair value on certain pieces of property held in other real estate owned. Other real estate owned with a cost basis of   $3,287   was sold during the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , resulting in a net loss of   $204  . Expenses on other real estate owned for the   three months ended September 30, 2015   included a   $527   write down of the carrying value to fair value on certain pieces of property held in other real estate owned. Other real estate owned with a cost basis of $5,406 was sold during the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , resulting in a net gain of   $16  . 
    
  Professional fees include fees for legal and accounting services. Professional fees were   $1,313   for the   third quarter of 2016   as compared to   $1,242   for the same period in   2015  .  Professional fees remain elevated in large part due to additional legal, accounting and consulting fees associated with compliance costs of newly enacted as well as existing banking and governmental regulation. Professional fees attributable to legal fees associated with loan workouts and foreclosure proceedings remain at higher levels in correlation with the credit deterioration identified in our loan portfolio and the Company s efforts to bring these credits to resolution.  
    
  Advertising and public relations expense was   $1,661   for the   third quarter of 2016   compared to   $1,567   for the same period in   2015  .

Amortization of intangible assets totaled   $1,684   and   $1,803   for the   third quarter of 2016   and   2015  , respectively. This amortization relates to finite-lived intangible assets which are being amortized over the useful lives as determined at acquisition. These finite-lived intangible assets have remaining estimated useful lives ranging from 9 months to 10 years.  
    
  Communication expenses, those expenses incurred for communication to clients and between employees, were   $2,097   for the   third quarter of 2016   as compared to   $2,339   for the same period in   2015  .  

The efficiency ratio is one measure of productivity in the banking industry. This ratio is calculated to measure the cost of generating one dollar of revenue. That is, the ratio is designed to reflect the percentage of one dollar which must be expended to generate that dollar of revenue. The Company calculates this ratio by dividing noninterest expense by the sum of net interest income on a fully tax equivalent basis and noninterest income. Merger and conversion expenses and debt prepayment penalties contributed approximately   23   basis points and   191   basis points, respectively, to the efficiency ratio for the   third quarter of 2016  .  Merger and conversion expenses contributed approximately   755   basis points to the efficiency ratio for the   third quarter of 2015  .  We remain committed to aggressively managing our costs within the framework of our business model. We expect the efficiency ratio to improve from currently reported levels from revenue growth while at the same time controlling noninterest expenses. 
    
  Income Taxes 
    
  Income tax expense for the   third quarter of 2016   and   2015   was   $11,706   and   $7,742  , respectively. The effective tax rates for those periods were   33.56%   and   32.31%  , respectively. The increased effective tax rate for the   third quarter of 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015   is the result of the Company experiencing improvements in its financial results, including the contribution from acquisitions, resulting in higher levels of taxable income.

The tax equivalent yield on the investment portfolio for the   first nine months of   2016   was   2.99%  , down   10   basis points from   3.09%   in the same period in   2015  . Proceeds from sales, maturities and calls of higher yielding securities were either redeployed to fund loan growth or reinvested in lower earning securities accounting for both the decrease in the average balance of investments, excluding the contribution from Heritage and KeyWorth, and tax equivalent yield thereon when compared to the same period in the prior year.  The reinvestment rates on securities were lower due to the generally lower interest rate environment. 
    
  Interest expense for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   $20,357   as compared to   $16,228   for the same period in   2015    The cost of interest-bearing liabilities was   0.48%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to   0.47%   for the same period in   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  The following table presents, by type, the Company s funding sources, which consist of total average deposits and borrowed funds, and the total cost of each funding source for the periods presented: 

Interest expense on deposits was   $13,018   and   $10,340   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The cost of interest bearing deposits was   0.34%   and   0.32%   for the same periods. The increase is primarily attributable to the increase in the average balance of interest bearing deposits from the KeyWorth and Heritage acquisitions.  Furthermore, although the Company continues to seek changes in the mix of our deposits from higher costing time deposits to lower costing interest-bearing deposits and non-interest bearing deposits, rates offered on the Company's interest-bearing deposit accounts, including time deposits, have increased to match competitive market interest rates in order to maintain stable sources of funding.

Interest expense on total borrowings was   $7,339   and   $5,888   for the   first nine months of   2016   and   2015  , respectively.  The average balance of borrowings increased   $249,904    to   $561,294   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to   $311,390   for the same period in   2015  .  The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in short-term borrowings due to the increased production in the Company's mortgage operations as overnight and other short-term borrowings are often used to fund these short-term assets.  The impact to the average balance of borrowings from the aforementioned Notes offerings was nearly offset by the prepayment of long-term FHLB advances also previously mentioned.  The cost of total borrowed funds was   1.75%   and   2.53%   for the   first nine months of   2016   and   2015  , respectively.  The decrease in the cost of the Company's borrowed funds is primarily attributable to the shift in mix driven by the increase in lower costing overnight and short-term borrowings.    
    
  A more detailed discussion of the cost of our funding sources is set forth below under the heading  Liquidity and Capital Resources  in this item. 
    
  Noninterest Income 

Noninterest income was   $107,160   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to   $76,828   for the same period in   2015  . The increase in noninterest income and its related components is primarily attributable to the Heritage and KeyWorth acquisitions, Heritage's mortgage operations and a significant increase in mortgage revenue from the Company's existing mortgage operations due to increased production as a result of continued decreases in interest rates and recent mortgage originator hires. 
    
  Service charges on deposit accounts include maintenance fees on accounts, per item charges, account enhancement charges for additional packaged benefits and overdraft fees. Service charges on deposit accounts were   $23,712   and   $21,008   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Overdraft fees, the largest component of service charges on deposits, were   $17,013   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $14,915   for the same period in   2015  . 
    
  Fees and commissions increased to   $14,042   for the   first nine months of   September 30, 2016   as compared to   $11,408   for the same period in   2015  . Fees and commissions include fees related to deposit services, such as ATM fees and interchange fees on debit card transactions, as well as servicing income from non-mortgage loans serviced by the Company.  Fees associated with debit card usage were   $12,178   for the   nine months ending September 30, 2016   as compared to   $10,290   for the same period in   2015  . 
    
  Through Renasant Insurance, we offer a range of commercial and personal insurance products through major insurance carriers.  Income earned on insurance products was   $6,557   and   $6,467   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Contingency income is a bonus received from the insurance underwriters and is based both on commission income and claims experience on our clients' policies during the previous year. Increases and decreases in contingency income are reflective of corresponding increases and decreases in the amount of claims paid by insurance carriers. Contingency income, which is included in  Other noninterest income  in the Consolidated Statements of Income, was $1,154 and $539 for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  
    
  The Trust division within the Wealth Management segment operates on a custodial basis which includes administration of benefit plans, as well as accounting and money management for trust accounts. The division manages a number of trust accounts inclusive of personal and corporate benefit accounts, self-directed IRAs, and custodial accounts. Fees for managing these accounts are based on changes in market values of the assets under management in the account, with the amount of the fee depending on the type of account. Additionally, the Financial Services division within the Wealth Management segment provides specialized products and services to our customers, which include fixed and variable annuities, mutual funds, and stocks offered through a third party provider. Wealth Management revenue was   $8,803   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $7,199   for the same period in   2015  .  This increase is primarily attributable to an increase in assets under management through the Heritage acquisition. The market value of trust assets under management was $3,091,815 and $3,003,550 at   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively. 
    
  Mortgage banking income is derived from the origination and sale of mortgage loans and the servicing of mortgage loans that the Company has sold but retained the right to service.  Mortgage banking income was   $41,181   and   $24,113   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Originations of mortgage loans to be sold totaled   $1,516,650   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $992,555   for the same period in   2015  .  The increase in mortgage loan originations is due to an increase in mortgage activity driven by historically low mortgage rates and the addition of Heritage's mortgage operations

during the third quarter of 2015. The following table presents the components of mortgage banking income included in noninterest income for the   nine months ending     September 30  : 

Other noninterest income includes contingency income from our insurance underwriters, income from our SBA banking division, and other miscellaneous income.  Other noninterest income was   $8,750   and   $3,869   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  The increase from   2015   is primarily attributable to contingency income from our insurance underwriters as well as income from our SBA banking division and the gains we realized on the sale of the guaranteed portion of loans originated by this division.  SBA banking income was $4,068 and $1,006 for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  Noninterest Expense 

Noninterest expense was   $223,541   and   $174,380   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.   Merger and conversion expense was   $4,023   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to   $9,691   for the same period in   2015  .  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recognized a penalty charge of   $2,539   in connection with the prepayment of $42,369 in borrowings from the FHLB.  No such charge was incurred during the comparable period in   2015  . After considering these expenses, which are typically nonrecurring, the overall increase in noninterest expenses and its related components is primarily attributable to the addition of Heritage and KeyWorth operations.  
    
  Salaries and employee benefits increased   $30,780   to   $132,482   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to   $101,702   for the same period in   2015  .  The increase in salaries and employee benefits is attributable to the addition of the Heritage and KeyWorth operations and higher levels of commissions paid in our commercial lending and mortgage banking divisions. 
    
  Data processing costs increased to   $13,220   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from   $10,248   for the same period in   2015  . The increase for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015   was primarily attributable to the Heritage and KeyWorth acquisitions and the addition of enhancements to our products and services, including mobile banking and small business internet banking platform. 
    
  Net occupancy and equipment expense for the   first nine months of   2016   was   $25,585  , up from   $18,816   for the same period in   2015  .  The increase in occupancy and equipment expense is primarily attributable to the Heritage and KeyWorth acquisitions coupled with enhancements to our IT infrastructure in response to banking and governmental regulation and increased global risk from cyber security breaches. 
    
  Expenses related to other real estate owned for the   first nine months of   2016   were   $4,111   compared to   $2,347   for the same period in   2015  . Expenses on other real estate owned for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   included write downs of   $2,330   of the carrying value to fair value on certain pieces of property held in other real estate owned. Other real estate owned with a cost basis of   $11,475   was sold during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , resulting in a net loss of   $435  . Expenses on other real estate owned for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   included a   $1,922   write down of the carrying value to fair value on certain pieces of property held in other real estate owned. Other real estate owned with a cost basis of $18,062 was sold during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , resulting in a net gain of   $499  . 
    
  Professional fees include fees for legal and accounting services. Professional fees were   $3,789   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to   $3,238   for the same period in   2015  .  Professional fees remain elevated in large part due to additional legal, accounting and consulting fees associated with compliance costs of newly enacted as well as existing banking and governmental regulation. Professional fees attributable to legal fees associated with loan workouts and foreclosure proceedings

remain at higher levels in correlation with the overall economic downturn and credit deterioration identified in our loan portfolio and the Company s efforts to bring these credits to resolution.  
    
  Advertising and public relations expense was   $5,040   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $4,351   for the same period in   2015  . 
    
  Amortization of intangible assets totaled   $5,123   and   $4,317   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. This amortization relates to finite-lived intangible assets which are being amortized over the useful lives as determined at acquisition. These finite-lived intangible assets have remaining estimated useful lives ranging from 9 months to 10 years.  The increase in amortization expense for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015   is attributable to the amortization of the core deposit intangibles recognized in connection with the KeyWorth and Heritage acquisitions. 
    
  Communication expenses, those expenses incurred for communication to clients and between employees, were   $6,308   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to   $5,263   for the same period in   2015  .  The increase can be attributed to the Heritage and KeyWorth acquisitions as well as expenses incurred to increase the bandwidth of data lines throughout our footprint. 

The efficiency ratio is one measure of productivity in the banking industry. This ratio is calculated to measure the cost of generating one dollar of revenue. That is, the ratio is designed to reflect the percentage of one dollar which must be expended to generate that dollar of revenue. The Company calculates this ratio by dividing noninterest expense by the sum of net interest income on a fully tax equivalent basis and noninterest income. Merger and conversion expenses and debt prepayment penalties contributed approximately   120   basis points and   76   basis points, respectively, to the efficiency ratio for the   first nine months of      2016  .  Merger and conversion expenses contributed approximately   386   basis points to the efficiency ratio for   first nine months of      2015  .We remain committed to aggressively managing our costs within the framework of our business model. We expect the efficiency ratio to continue to improve from currently reported levels as a result of revenue growth while at the same time controlling noninterest expenses. 
    
  Income Taxes 
    
  Income tax expense for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $33,386   and   $21,601  , respectively. The effective tax rates for those periods were   33.16%   and   31.56%  , respectively. The increased effective tax rate for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in   2015   is the result of the Company experiencing improvements in its financial results throughout   2015   and into the   first nine months of      2016  , including the contributions from Heritage and KeyWorth, resulting in higher levels of taxable income. 

Risk Management 
    
  The management of risk is an on-going process. Primary risks that are associated with the Company include credit, interest rate and liquidity risk. Credit risk and interest rate risk are discussed below, while liquidity risk is discussed in the next subsection under the heading  Liquidity and Capital Resources.  
  Credit Risk and Allowance for Loan Losses 
    
  Inherent in any lending activity is credit risk, that is, the risk of loss should a borrower default. Credit risk is monitored and managed on an ongoing basis by a credit administration department, senior loan committee, a loss management committee and the Board of Directors loan committee. Credit quality, adherence to policies and loss mitigation are major concerns of credit administration and these committees. The Company s central appraisal review department reviews and approves third-party appraisals obtained by the Company on real estate collateral and monitors loan maturities to ensure updated appraisals are obtained. This department is managed by a State Certified General Real Estate Appraiser and employs an additional State Certified General Real Estate appraiser, Appraisal Intern and four evaluators. 
    
  We have a number of documented loan policies and procedures that set forth the approval and monitoring process of the lending function. Adherence to these policies and procedures is monitored by management and the Board of Directors. A number of  
  
   72 

     Table of Contents  

committees and an underwriting staff oversee the lending operations of the Company. These include in-house loan and loss management committees and the Board of Directors loan committee and problem loan review committee. In addition, we maintain a loan review staff to independently monitor loan quality and lending practices. Loan review personnel monitor and, if necessary, adjust the grades assigned to loans through periodic examination, focusing their review on commercial and real estate loans rather than consumer and small balance consumer mortgage loans, such as 1-4 family mortgage loans. 
    
  In compliance with loan policy, the lending staff is given lending limits based on their knowledge and experience. In addition, each lending officer s prior performance is evaluated for credit quality and compliance as a tool for establishing and enhancing lending limits. Before funds are advanced on consumer and commercial loans below certain dollar thresholds, loans are reviewed and scored using centralized underwriting methodologies. Loan quality, or  risk-rating,  grades are assigned based upon certain factors, which include the scoring of the loans. This information is used to assist management in monitoring credit quality.  Loan requests of amounts greater than an officer s lending limits are reviewed by senior credit officers, in-house loan committees or the Board of Directors. 
    
  For commercial and commercial real estate secured loans, risk-rating grades are assigned by lending, credit administration or loan review personnel, based on an analysis of the financial and collateral strength and other credit attributes underlying each loan.  Loan grades range from 1 to 9, with 1 being loans with the least credit risk. Allowance factors established by management are applied to the total balance of loans in each grade to determine the amount needed in the allowance for loan losses. The allowance factors are established based on historical loss ratios experienced by the Company for these loan types, as well as the credit quality criteria underlying each grade, adjusted for trends and expectations about losses inherent in our existing portfolios. In making these adjustments to the allowance factors, management takes into consideration factors which it believes are causing, or are likely in the future to cause, losses within our loan portfolio but which may not be fully reflected in our historical loss ratios. For portfolio balances of consumer, small balance consumer mortgage loans, such as 1-4 family mortgage loans and certain other similar loan types, allowance factors are determined based on historical loss ratios by portfolio for the preceding eight quarters and may be adjusted by other qualitative criteria. 
    
  The loss management committee and the Board of Directors  problem loan review committee monitor loans that are past due or those that have been downgraded and placed on the Company s internal watch list due to a decline in the collateral value or cash flow of the debtor; the committees then adjust loan grades accordingly. This information is used to assist management in monitoring credit quality. In addition, the Company s portfolio management committee monitors and identifies risks within the Company s loan portfolio by focusing its efforts on reviewing and analyzing loans which are not on the Company s internal watch list. The portfolio management committee monitors loans in portfolios or regions which management believes could be stressed or experiencing credit deterioration. 
    
  A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal and interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Impairment is measured on a loan-by-loan basis for problem loans of $500 or greater by either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate, the loan s obtainable market price or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. For real estate collateral, the fair market value of the collateral is based upon a recent appraisal by a qualified and licensed appraiser of the underlying collateral. When the ultimate collectability of a loan s principal is in doubt, wholly or partially, the loan is placed on nonaccrual. 
    
  After all collection efforts have failed, collateral securing loans may be repossessed and sold or, for loans secured by real estate, foreclosure proceedings initiated. The collateral is sold at public auction for fair market value (based upon recent appraisals described in the above paragraph), with fees associated with the foreclosure being deducted from the sales price. The purchase price is applied to the outstanding loan balance. If the loan balance is greater than the sales proceeds, the deficient balance is sent to the Board of Directors  loan committee for charge-off approval. These charge-offs reduce the allowance for loan losses. Charge-offs reflect the realization of losses in the portfolio that were recognized previously through the provision for loan losses. 
    
  Net charge-offs for the   third quarter   of   2016   were   $824  , or 0.05% of average loans, compared to net charge-offs of   $587  , or 0.04% of average loans, for the same period in   2015  .  The levels of net charge-offs relative to the size of our loan portfolio reflect the improved credit quality measures and the Company's continued efforts to bring these problem credits to resolution.  
    
  The allowance for loan losses is available to absorb probable credit losses inherent in the entire loan portfolio. The appropriate level of the allowance is based on an ongoing analysis of the loan portfolio and represents an amount that management deems adequate to provide for inherent losses, including collective impairment as recognized under the Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic ( ASC ) 450,  Contingencies.  Collective impairment is calculated based on loans grouped by grade. Another component of the allowance is losses on loans assessed as impaired under ASC 310,  Receivables.   The balance of these loans and their related allowance is included in management s estimation and analysis of the allowance for  
  
   73 

     Table of Contents  

loan losses. Other considerations in establishing the allowance for loan losses include economic conditions reflected within industry segments, the unemployment rate in our markets, loan segmentation and historical losses that are inherent in the loan portfolio.  The allowance for loan losses is established after input from management, loan review and the loss management committee. An evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance is calculated quarterly based on the types of loans, an analysis of credit losses and risk in the portfolio, economic conditions and trends within each of these factors. In addition, on a regular basis, management and the Board of Directors review loan ratios. These ratios include the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans, net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans, the provision for loan losses as a percentage of average loans, nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans and the allowance coverage on nonperforming loans. Also, management reviews past due ratios by officer, community bank and the Company as a whole. 
    
  The following table presents the allocation of the allowance for loan losses by loan category as of the dates presented: 

For impaired loans, specific reserves are established to adjust the carrying value of the loan to its estimated net realizable value.  The following table quantifies the amount of the specific reserves component of the allowance for loan losses and the amount of the allowance determined by applying allowance factors to graded loans as of the dates presented: 

The provision for loan losses charged to operating expense is an amount which, in the judgment of management, is necessary to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level that is believed to be adequate to meet the inherent risks of losses in our loan portfolio. Factors considered by management in determining the amount of the provision for loan losses include the internal risk rating of individual credits, historical and current trends in net charge-offs, trends in nonperforming loans, trends in past due loans, trends in the market values of underlying collateral securing loans and the current economic conditions in the markets in which we operate.  The provision for loan losses was   $5,880   and   $3,000   for the   nine months ended September 30,     2016   and   2015  , respectively, which reflects the aforementioned improving credit quality trends coupled with providing for significant loan growth during each respective period. 
    
  A majority of the loans acquired in the Company s FDIC-assisted acquisitions and certain loans acquired and not covered under  the Company's FDIC loss-share agreements are accounted for under ASC 310-30,  Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality  ( ASC 310-30 ), and are carried at values which, in management s opinion, reflect the estimated future cash flows, based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each respective loan at the date of acquisition. As of   September 30, 2016  , the fair value of loans accounted for in accordance with ASC 310-30 was   $297,609  .  The Company continually monitors these loans as part of our normal credit review and monitoring procedures for changes in the estimated future cash flows; to the extent future cash flows deteriorate below initial projections, the Company may be required to reserve for these loans in the allowance for loan losses through future provision for loan losses. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company has increased the allowance for loan losses by   $3,418   for loans accounted for under ASC 310-30.  As of   September 30, 2015  , the Company increased the allowance for loan losses by   $1,950   for loans accounted for under ASC 310-30.  The Company increased the allowance for loan losses in the third quarter of 2016 due to the loans acquired in the Heritage acquisition that are accounted for under ASC 310-30.

The following table provides further details of the Company s net charge-offs (recoveries) of loans secured by real estate for the periods presented: 

Nonperforming Assets 
    
  Nonperforming assets consist of nonperforming loans, other real estate owned and nonaccruing securities available-for-sale. Nonperforming loans are those on which the accrual of interest has stopped or loans which are contractually 90 days past due on which interest continues to accrue. Generally, the accrual of interest is discontinued when the full collection of principal or interest is in doubt or when the payment of principal or interest has been contractually 90 days past due, unless the obligation is both well secured and in the process of collection. Management, the loss management committee and our loan review staff closely monitor loans that are considered to be nonperforming. 
    
  Debt securities may be transferred to nonaccrual status where the recognition of investment interest is discontinued. A number of qualitative factors, including but not limited to the financial condition of the underlying issuer and current and projected deferrals or defaults, are considered by management in the determination of whether a debt security should be transferred to nonaccrual status. The interest on these nonaccrual investment securities is accounted for on the cash-basis method until qualifying for return to accrual status. Nonaccruing securities available-for-sale consist of one of the Company s three investments in pooled trust preferred securities issued by financial institutions, which are discussed earlier in this section under the heading "Investments".

The following table provides details of the Company s nonperforming assets that are not acquired and not covered by FDIC loss-share agreements  ( Not Acquired ), nonperforming assets that have been acquired and are covered by loss-share agreements with the FDIC ( Acquired Covered Assets ), and nonperforming assets acquired and not covered by loss-share agreements with the FDIC ( Acquired Not Covered ) as of the dates presented: 

Overall, the Company experienced lower levels of classified loans and nonperforming loans resulting in improving credit quality measures in   2015   and through the   first nine months of   2016  .  At   September 30, 2016  , not acquired, nonperforming loans decreased   $202    from   $14,971   at   December 31, 2015  .  Total acquired nonperforming loans, which consist of acquired covered and acquired not covered, decreased   $3,318   for the   first nine months of   2016  .  The decrease in total acquired, nonperforming loans reflects the improved credit quality in the Company's acquired loan portfolio and the Company's continued efforts to bring these problem credits to resolution.  At   September 30, 2016  , the acquisition of Heritage added $11,103 acquired, nonperforming loans compared to $11,462 at   December 31, 2015  .  At September 30, 2016, the Company added $223 of nonperforming loans as a result of the KeyWorth acquisition. 
    
  Due to the significant difference in the accounting for the loans and other real estate owned covered by loss-share agreements and loss mitigation offered under the loss-share agreements with the FDIC, the Company believes that excluding the covered assets from its asset quality measures provides a more meaningful presentation of the Company s asset quality. The asset quality measures surrounding the Company s nonperforming assets discussed in the remainder of this section exclude covered assets relating to the Company s FDIC-assisted acquisitions. 
    
  Another category of assets which contribute to our credit risk is restructured loans. Restructured loans are those for which concessions have been granted to the borrower due to a deterioration of the borrower s financial condition and are performing in accordance with the new terms. Such concessions may include reduction in interest rates or deferral of interest or principal payments.  In evaluating whether to restructure a loan, management analyzes the long-term financial condition of the borrower, including guarantor and collateral support, to determine whether the proposed concessions will increase the likelihood of repayment of principal and interest. Restructured loans that are not performing in accordance with their restructured terms that are either contractually 90 days past due or placed on nonaccrual status are reported as nonperforming loans.

The following table shows the principal amounts of nonperforming and restructured loans as of the dates presented. All loans where information exists about possible credit problems that would cause us to have serious doubts about the borrower s ability to comply with the current repayment terms of the loan have been reflected in the table below. 

Acquired nonperforming loans that are not covered by FDIC loss-share agreements totaled   $24,724   at   September 30, 2016   which consisted of   $12,105   in loans on nonaccrual status and   $12,619   in accruing loans past due 90 days or more. The recent acquisition of Heritage added $10,527 acquired, non-covered, nonperforming loans, the First M F merger contributed $5,566 and the KeyWorth merger added $223 of such loans at   September 30, 2016  .  At December 31, 2015 nonperforming loans from the acquired non-covered portfolio were   $23,528  .  Excluding the nonperforming loans from acquisitions, nonperforming loans were   $14,769   at   September 30, 2016   and   $14,971   at   December 31, 2015  .  The following table presents nonperforming loans, not subject to a loss-share agreement, by loan category as of the dates presented: 

Our level of nonperforming loans, not subject to a loss-share agreement, increased from the fourth quarter of 2015, due primarily to our acquisition of Heritage as well as loss-share loans acquired in the Crescent and Heritage acquisitions being transferred to the acquired not covered loan category. However, the Company is continuing its efforts to bring problem credits to resolution.  Total nonperforming loans as a percentage of total loans were   0.65%   as of   September 30, 2016   compared to   0.72%   as of   December 31, 2015   and   0.77%   as of   September 30, 2015  . The Company s coverage ratio, or its allowance for loan losses as a percentage of nonperforming loans, was 116.28% as of   September 30, 2016   as compared to 110.23% as of   December 31, 2015   and 105.68% as of   September 30, 2015  .  Management has evaluated the aforementioned loans and other loans classified as nonperforming and believes that all nonperforming loans have been adequately reserved for in the allowance for loan losses at   September 30, 2016  .

Management also continually monitors past due loans for potential credit quality deterioration. Total loans 30-89 days past due increased to $21,554 at   September 30, 2016   as compared to $14,412 at   December 31, 2015   and $15,964 at   September 30, 2015  . The acquisition of First M F contributed $3,731 of acquired, not covered loans 30-89 days past due, while the Heritage acquisition contributed $6,856 of acquired, not covered loans 30-89 days past due at   September 30, 2016  .  The acquisition of Heritage contributed $4,920 of acquired, not covered loans 30-89 days past due, while the First M F merger contributed $2,177 of acquired, not covered loans 30-89 days past due at December 31, 2015.  The acquisition of First M F contributed $3,431 of acquired, not covered loans 30-89 days past due at September 30, 2015. 
    
  As shown below, restructured loans totaled   $10,720   at   September 30, 2016   compared to   $13,453   at   December 31, 2015   and   $18,881   at   September 30, 2015  .  At   September 30, 2016  , loans restructured through interest rate concessions represented 45% of total restructured loans, while loans restructured by a concession in payment terms represented the remainder. The following table provides further details of the Company s restructured loans in compliance with their modified terms as of the dates presented:

Other real estate owned consists of properties acquired through foreclosure or acceptance of a deed in lieu of foreclosure. These properties are carried at the lower of cost or fair market value based on appraised value less estimated selling costs. Losses arising at the time of foreclosure of properties are charged against the allowance for loan losses. Reductions in the carrying value subsequent to acquisition are charged to earnings and are included in  Other real estate owned  in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

  Interest Rate Risk 
    
  Market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates. The majority of assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature and therefore differ greatly from most commercial and industrial companies that have significant investments in fixed assets and inventories. Our market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in lending and deposit-taking activities. Management believes a significant impact on the Company s financial results stems from our ability to react to changes in interest rates. To that end, management actively monitors and manages our interest rate risk exposure. 
  We have an Asset/Liability Committee ( ALCO ) which is authorized by the Board of Directors to monitor our interest rate sensitivity and to make decisions relating to that process. The ALCO s goal is to structure our asset/liability composition to maximize net interest income while managing interest rate risk so as to minimize the adverse impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income and capital. Profitability is affected by fluctuations in interest rates. A sudden and substantial change in interest rates may adversely impact our earnings because the interest rates borne by assets and liabilities do not change at the same speed, to the same extent or on the same basis. 
  We utilize an asset/liability model as the primary quantitative tool in measuring the amount of interest rate risk associated with changing market rates.  The model is used to perform both net interest income forecast simulations for multiple year horizons, and economic value of equity ( EVE ) analyses, under various interest rate scenarios. 
  Net interest income simulations measure the short and medium-term earnings exposure from changes in market interest rates in a rigorous and explicit fashion. Our current financial position is combined with assumptions regarding future business to calculate net interest income under varying hypothetical rate scenarios. EVE measures our long-term earnings exposure from changes in market rates of interest. EVE is defined as the present value of assets minus the present value of liabilities at a point in time for a given set of market rate assumptions.  An increase in EVE due to a specified rate change indicates an improvement in the long-term earnings capacity of the balance sheet assuming that the rate change remains in effect over the life of the current balance sheet.

     Table of Contents  

The following table presents the projected impact of a change in interest rates on (1) static EVE and (2) earnings at risk (that is, net interest income) for the 1-12 and 13-24 month periods commencing October 1, 2016, in each case as compared to the result under rates present in the market on September 30, 2016.  The changes in interest rates assume an instantaneous and parallel shift in the yield curve and does not take into account changes in the slope of the yield curve.  On account of the present position of the target federal funds rate, the Company did not present an analysis assuming a downward movement in rates. 

The rate shock results for the net interest income simulations for the next twenty-four months produce a slightly asset sensitive position at   September 30, 2016  .  The Company s interest rate risk strategy is to remain in a slightly asset sensitive position with a focus on balance sheet strategies that will result in a more asset sensitive position over time.  To accomplish this strategy, the Company has focused on increasing variable rate loan production and generating deposits that are less sensitive to increases in interest rates.   
  The preceding measures assume no change in the size or asset/liability compositions of the balance sheet. Thus, the measures do not reflect actions the ALCO may undertake in response to such changes in interest rates. The above results of the interest rate shock analysis are within the parameters set by the Board of Directors. The scenarios assume instantaneous movements in interest rates in increments of 100, 200, 300 and 400 basis points.  As interest rates are adjusted over a period of time, it is our strategy to proactively change the volume and mix of our balance sheet in order to mitigate our interest rate risk. The computation of the prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes requires numerous assumptions regarding characteristics of new business and the behavior of existing positions. These business assumptions are based upon our experience, business plans and published industry experience. Key assumptions employed in the model include asset prepayment speeds, competitive factors, the relative price sensitivity of certain assets and liabilities and the expected life of non-maturity deposits. Because these assumptions are inherently uncertain, actual results will differ from simulated results. 
  The Company utilizes derivative financial instruments, including interest rate contracts such as swaps, caps and/or floors, as part of its ongoing efforts to mitigate its interest rate risk exposure and to facilitate the needs of its customers. The Company also enters into derivative instruments that are not designated as hedging instruments to help its commercial customers manage their exposure to interest rate fluctuations. To mitigate the interest rate risk associated with these customer contracts, the Company enters into an offsetting derivative contract position. The Company manages its credit risk, or potential risk of default by its commercial customers, through credit limit approval and monitoring procedures. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had notional amounts of   $80,065   on interest rate contracts with corporate customers and   $80,065   in offsetting interest rate contracts with other financial institutions to mitigate the Company s rate exposure on its corporate customers  contracts and certain fixed-rate loans. 
    
  In March and April 2012, the Company entered into two interest rate swap agreements effective in March 2014.  Under these agreements, the Company receives a variable rate of interest based on the three-month LIBOR plus a pre-determined spread and pays a fixed rate of interest. The agreements, which both terminate in March 2022, are accounted for as cash flow hedges to reduce the variability in cash flows resulting from changes in interest rates on   $32,000   of the Company s junior subordinated debentures. In connection with its acquisition of First M F, the Company assumed an interest rate swap designed to convert floating rate interest payments into fixed rate payments. Based on the terms of the agreement, which terminates in March 2018, the Company receives a variable rate of interest based on the three-month LIBOR plus a pre-determined spread and pays a fixed rate of interest. The interest rate swap is accounted for as a cash flow hedge to reduce the variability in cash flows resulting from changes in interest rates on   $30,000   of the junior subordinated debentures assumed in the merger with First M F.  
    
  On June 5, 2014, the Company entered into two forward interest rate swap contracts on floating rate liabilities at the Bank level with notional amounts of $15,000 each. The interest rate swap contracts are each accounted for as a cash flow hedge with the objective of protecting against any interest rate volatility on future FHLB borrowings for a four-year and five-year period beginning June 1, 2018 and December 3, 2018 and ending June 2022 and June 2023, respectively.  Under these contracts, Renasant Bank will pay a fixed interest rate and will receive a variable interest rate based on the three-month LIBOR plus a pre-determined spread, with quarterly net settlements.

The Company also enters into interest rate lock commitments with its customers to mitigate the Company s interest rate risk associated with its commitments to fund fixed-rate residential mortgage loans. Under the interest rate lock commitments, interest rates for mortgage loans are locked in with the customer for a period of time, typically thirty days. Once an interest rate lock commitment is entered into with a customer, the Company also enters into a forward commitment to sell the residential mortgage loan to secondary market investors. Accordingly, the Company does not incur risk if the interest rate lock commitment in the pipeline fails to close.

  to Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company in Item 1,  Financial Statements,  in this report. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  Liquidity management is the ability to meet the cash flow requirements of customers who may be either depositors wishing to withdraw funds or borrowers needing assurance that sufficient funds will be available to meet their credit needs.  Management continually monitors the Bank's liquidity through review of a variety of reports. 
    
  Core deposits, which are deposits excluding time deposits and public fund deposits, are a major source of funds used by Renasant Bank to meet cash flow needs. Maintaining the ability to acquire these funds as needed in a variety of markets is the key to assuring Renasant Bank s liquidity. 
    
  Our investment portfolio is another alternative for meeting liquidity needs. These assets generally have readily available markets that offer conversions to cash as needed. Within the next twelve months the securities portfolio is forecasted to generate cash flow through principal payments and maturities equal to 17.75% of the carrying value of the total securities portfolio. Securities within our investment portfolio are also used to secure certain deposit types and short-term borrowings. At   September 30, 2016  , securities with a carrying value of $681,499 were pledged to secure public fund deposits and as collateral for short-term borrowings and derivative instruments as compared to securities with a carrying value of $718,767 similarly pledged at   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Other sources available for meeting liquidity needs include federal funds purchased and short-term and long-term advances from the FHLB. Interest is charged at the prevailing market rate on federal funds purchased and FHLB advances.  There were $257,000 in overnight borrowings from the FHLB at   September 30, 2016     compared to $400,000 at     December 31, 2015  . Long-term funds obtained from the FHLB are used primarily to match-fund fixed rate loans in order to minimize interest rate risk and also are used to meet day to day liquidity needs, particularly when the cost of such borrowing compares favorably to the rates that we would be required to pay to attract deposits. At   September 30, 2016  , the balance of our outstanding long-term advances with the FHLB was $8,807.  The total amount of the remaining credit available to us from the FHLB at   September 30, 2016   was $1,964,477. We also maintain lines of credit with other commercial banks totaling $75,000. These are unsecured lines of credit maturing at various times within the next twelve months. There were no amounts outstanding under these lines of credit at   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  As discussed above under the heading  Financial Condition  under  Borrowings  in August 2016,  the Company issued and sold $60,000 aggregate principal amount of its 5.00% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due 2026 and $40,000 aggregate principal amount of its 5.50% Fixed-to-Floating Rate Subordinated Notes due 2031.  The carrying value of the Notes was $98,167 at   September 30, 2016  .  
    
  The following table presents, by type, the Company s funding sources, which consist of total average deposits and borrowed funds, and the total cost of each funding source for the periods presented:

Our strategy in choosing funds is focused on minimizing cost along with considering our balance sheet composition and interest rate risk position. Accordingly, management targets growth of non-interest bearing deposits. While we do not control the types of deposit instruments our clients choose, we do influence those choices with the rates and the deposit specials we offer. We constantly monitor our funds position and evaluate the effect that various funding sources have on our financial position.  
    
  Cash and cash equivalents were   $217,391   at   September 30, 2016   compared to   $203,849   at   September 30, 2015  . Cash used in investing activities for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   $240,085   compared to cash used in investing activities of   $139,531   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . Proceeds from the sale, maturity or call of securities within our investment portfolio were   $230,565   for the   nine months ended     2016  . These proceeds from the investment portfolio were primarily used to fund loan growth or reinvested back into the security portfolio. Proceeds from the sale, maturity or call of securities within our investment portfolio during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   were   $213,370  . These proceeds were primarily reinvested in the investment portfolio. Purchases of investment securities were   $92,887   for the   first nine months of   2016   compared to   $192,032   for the same period in   2015  .  
    
  Cash provided by financing activities for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and 2015 was   $121,167   and   $52,627  , respectively. Deposits increased   $248,411   and   $22,035   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  Cash provided through deposit growth was partially used to fund loan growth. 
    
  Restrictions on Bank Dividends, Loans and Advances 
    
  The Company s liquidity and capital resources, as well as its ability to pay dividends to its shareholders, are substantially dependent on the ability of the Bank to transfer funds to the Company in the form of dividends, loans and advances. Under Mississippi law, a Mississippi bank may not pay dividends unless its earned surplus is in excess of three times capital stock. A Mississippi bank with earned surplus in excess of three times capital stock may pay a dividend, subject to the approval of the Mississippi Department of Banking and Consumer Finance. Accordingly, the approval of this supervisory authority is required prior to Renasant Bank paying dividends to the Company. 
    
  Federal Reserve regulations also limit the amount Renasant Bank may loan to the Company unless such loans are collateralized by specific obligations. At   September 30, 2016  , the maximum amount available for transfer from Renasant Bank to the Company in the form of loans was $73,112. The Company maintains a line of credit collateralized by cash with Renasant Bank totaling $3,030.  There were no amounts outstanding under this line of credit at   September 30, 2016  . These restrictions did not have any impact on the Company s ability to meet its cash obligations in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , nor does management expect such restrictions to materially impact the Company s ability to meet its currently-anticipated cash obligations. 

Off-Balance Sheet Transactions 
  The Company enters into loan commitments and standby letters of credit in the normal course of its business. Loan commitments are made to accommodate the financial needs of the Company s customers. Standby letters of credit commit the Company to make payments on behalf of customers when certain specified future events occur. Both arrangements have credit risk essentially the same as that involved in extending loans to customers and are subject to the Company s normal credit policies. Collateral (e.g., securities, receivables, inventory, equipment, etc.) is obtained based on management s credit assessment of the customer. 
  
   83 

     Table of Contents  

Loan commitments and standby letters of credit do not necessarily represent future cash requirements of the Company in that while the borrower has the ability to draw upon these commitments at any time, these commitments often expire without being drawn upon. The Company s unfunded loan commitments and standby letters of credit outstanding were as follows as of the dates presented: 

The Company closely monitors the amount of remaining future commitments to borrowers in light of prevailing economic conditions and adjusts these commitments as necessary. The Company will continue this process as new commitments are entered into or existing commitments are renewed. 

Shareholders  Equity and Regulatory Matters 
    
  Total shareholders  equity of the Company was   $1,142,247   at   September 30, 2016   compared to   $1,036,818   at   December 31, 2015  . Book value per share was $27.13 and $25.73 at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The growth in shareholders  equity was primarily attributable to earnings retention and changes in accumulated other comprehensive income offset by dividends declared. 
    
  On September 15, 2015, the Company filed a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ).  The shelf registration statement, which was automatically effective upon filing, allows the Company to raise capital from time to time through the sale of common stock, preferred stock, depository shares, debt securities, rights, warrants and units, or a combination thereof, subject to market conditions. Specific terms and prices will be determined at the time of any offering under a separate prospectus supplement that the Company will be required to file with the SEC at the time of the specific offering. The proceeds of the sale of securities, if and when offered, will be used for general corporate purposes or as otherwise described in the prospectus supplement applicable to the offering and could include the expansion of the Company s banking, insurance and wealth management operations as well as other business opportunities. The Notes were offered and sold pursuant to this shelf registration statement and prospectus supplements filed with respect thereto. 
    
  The Company has junior subordinated debentures with a carrying value of $95,506 at   September 30, 2016  , of which $92,318 are included in the Company s Tier 1 capital. The Federal Reserve Board issued guidance in March 2005 providing more strict quantitative limits on the amount of securities that, similar to our junior subordinated debentures, are includable in Tier 1 capital.  The new guidance, which became effective in March 2009, did not impact the amount of debentures we include in Tier 1 capital.  In addition, although our existing junior subordinated debentures are unaffected, on account of changes enacted as part of the Dodd-Frank Act, any trust preferred securities issued after May 19, 2010 may not be included in Tier 1 capital. 
    
  The Notes have a carrying value of $98,167 at   September 30, 2016  . In accordance with the above-referenced Federal Reserve Board guidance, the Notes are included in the Company's Tier 2 capital. 
    
  The Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency have issued guidelines governing the levels of capital that banks must maintain. Those guidelines specify capital tiers, which include the following classifications:

The following table provides the capital and risk-based capital and leverage ratios for the Company and for Renasant Bank as of the dates presented: 

In July 2013, the Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency approved the implementation of the Basel III regulatory capital reforms and issued rules effecting certain changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act (the  Basel III Rules ) that call for broad and comprehensive revision of regulatory capital standards for U.S. banking organizations.  Generally, the new Basel III Rules became effective on January 1, 2015, although parts of the Basel III Rules will be phased in through 2019.   
    
  The Basel III Rules implemented a new common equity Tier 1 minimum capital requirement ( CET1 ) and a higher minimum Tier 1 capital requirement, as reflected in the table above, and adjusted other items affecting the calculation of the numerator of a banking organization s risk-based capital ratios. The new CET1 capital ratio includes common equity as defined under GAAP and does not include any other type of non-common equity under GAAP.  Additionally, the Basel III Rules apply limits to a banking  
  
   85 

     Table of Contents  

organization s capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments if the banking organization does not hold a specified amount of CET1 capital in addition to the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. 
    
  Further, the Basel III Rules changed the agencies  general risk-based capital requirements for determining risk-weighted assets, which affect the calculation of the denominator of a banking organization s risk-based capital ratios. The Basel III Rules have revised the agencies  rules for calculating risk-weighted assets to enhance risk sensitivity and to incorporate certain international capital standards of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision set forth in the standardized approach of the  International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards: A Revised Framework . 
    
  The calculation of risk-weighted assets in the denominator of the Basel III capital ratios has been adjusted to reflect the higher risk nature of certain types of loans. Specifically, as applicable to the Company and Renasant Bank: 
    
    Residential mortgages: Replaced the former 50% risk weight for performing residential first-lien mortgages and a 100% risk-weight for all other mortgages with a risk weight of between 35% and 200% determined by the mortgage s loan-to-value ratio and whether the mortgage falls into one of two categories based on eight criteria that include the term, use of negative amortization and balloon payments, certain rate increases and documented and verified borrower income. 
    
    Commercial mortgages: Replaced the former 100% risk weight with a 150% risk weight for certain high volatility commercial real estate acquisition, development and construction loans. 
    
     Nonperforming loans: Replaced the former 100% risk weight with a 150% risk weight for loans, other than residential mortgages, that are 90 days past due or on nonaccrual status.  
    
  The Final Rules also introduce a new capital conservation buffer designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. The capital conservation buffer is composed entirely of CET1, on top of these minimum risk-weighted asset ratios. In addition, the Final Rules provide for a countercyclical capital buffer applicable only to certain covered institutions. It is not expected that the countercyclical capital buffer will be applicable to the Company or Renasant Bank. Banking institutions with a ratio of CET1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the capital conservation buffer (or below the combined capital conservation buffer and countercyclical capital buffer, when the latter is applied) will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall. The implementation of the capital conservation buffer began on January 1, 2016 at the 0.625% level and be phased in over a 4-year period (increasing by that amount on each subsequent January 1, until it reaches 2.5% on January 1, 2019). 

Item 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
  There have been no material changes in our market risk since   December 31, 2015  . For additional information regarding our market risk, see our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 

Item 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
  Based on their evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) are effective for ensuring that information the Company is required to disclose in reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter covered by this quarterly report that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

Exhibit 12(i) 
  Renasant Corporation and Subsidiaries 
  Calculation of Ratio of Earnings to Fixed Charges 
  (In Thousands) 
    
  The following table sets forth the consolidated ratios of earnings to fixed charges of Renasant Corporation (the  Company ) for the periods shown below. No shares of the Company's preferred stock were outstanding, and the Company did not pay dividends on preferred stock, during these periods. No shares of the Company's preferred stock are currently outstanding. As a result, the ratios of earnings to fixed charges and preferred stock dividends are the same as the ratios of earnings to fixed charges for these periods.  

The ratios of earnings to fixed charges are computed by dividing (1) income (loss) before income taxes and fixed charges by (2) total fixed charges. For purposes of computing these ratios: 
             
    fixed charges, including interest on deposits, includes all interest expense, amortized premiums and discounts related to deposits and other indebtedness, and the estimated portion of rental expense attributable to interest, net of income from subleases; and 
                
    fixed charges, excluding interest on deposits, includes interest expense (other than on deposits), amortized premiums and discounts related to indebtedness (but not deposits), and the estimated portion of rental expense attributable to interest, net of income from subleases.
