Note 1. Organization 
    
  OFS Capital Corporation (the  Company ), a Delaware corporation, is as an externally managed, closed-end, non-diversified management investment company. The Company has elected to be treated as a business development company ( BDC ) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the  1940 Act ). In addition, for income tax purposes, the Company has elected to be treated as a regulated investment company ( RIC ) under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the  Code ). 
    
  The Company s strategic investment focus is primarily on debt investments and, to a lesser extent, equity investments primarily in middle-market companies in the United States. OFS Capital Management, LLC ( OFS Advisor ) manages the day-to-day operations of, and provides investment advisory services to, the Company.   
    
  In addition, OFS Advisor also serves as the investment adviser for Hancock Park Corporate Income, Inc. ( Hancock Park ), a corporation formed under the laws of the State of Maryland in December 2015, and that has elected to be treated as a BDC in July 2016.  Hancock Park s investment objective is similar to that of the Company, which is to provide shareholders with current income and capital appreciation primarily through debt investments and, to a lesser extent, equity investments.  
    
  The Company may make investments directly or through OFS SBIC I, LP ( SBIC I LP ), its investment company subsidiary licensed under the Small Business Administration s ( SBA ) Small Business Investment Company program (the  SBIC Program ). The SBIC Program is designed to stimulate the flow of capital into eligible businesses. SBIC I LP is subject to SBA regulatory requirements, including limitations on the businesses and industries in which it can invest, requirements to invest at least 25% of its regulatory capital in eligible smaller businesses, as defined under the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 ( SBIC Act ), limitations on the financing terms of investments, and capitalization thresholds that may limit distributions to the Company; and is subject to periodic audits and examinations of its financial statements. 

Note 2. Correction of Error 
    
  In the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company discovered and corrected errors impacting the classification of certain components of consolidated net assets as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, and distributions reported on the consolidated statement of changes in net assets for the year ended December 31, 2014. These reclassifications had no effect on total net assets or net asset value per share. The purpose of the reclassifications was to properly report the tax character of, and basis differences between tax and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) in (i) accumulated shareholder distributions, (ii) accumulated undistributed net investment income, (iii) accumulated net realized gains/losses, and (iv) net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments. Accordingly, the Company has revised its December 31, 2014, consolidated balance sheet and statement of changes in net assets for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, and for each interim period within the year ended December 31, 2015. The effect of the reclassifications on the consolidated statement of net assets as of  September 30, 2015, the consolidated statement of changes in net assets for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, and the consolidated statement of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 were as follows:

Note 3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
    
  Basis of presentation:   The Company prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP, including Accounting Standards Codification Topic 946,   Financial Services Investment Companies  , and the requirements for reporting on Form 10-Q, the 1940 Act, and Articles 6 or 10 of Regulation S-X. In the opinion of management, the consolidated financial statements include all adjustments, consisting only of normal and recurring accruals and adjustments, necessary for fair presentation in accordance with GAAP. Certain amounts in the prior period financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. 
    
  Principles of consolidation:   The Company consolidates majority-owned investment company subsidiaries. The Company does not own any controlled operating company whose business consists of providing services to the Company, which would also require consolidation. All intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated upon consolidation. 
    
  Fair value of financial instruments:   The Company applies fair value to substantially all of its financial instruments. Accounting Standards Codification Topic 820,   Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures   ( ASC Topic 820 ) defines fair value, establishes a framework to measure fair value, and requires disclosures regarding fair value measurements. Fair value is defined as the price to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value is determined through the use of models and other valuation techniques, valuation inputs, and assumptions market participants would use to value the investment. Highest priority is given to prices for identical assets quoted in active markets (Level 1) and the lowest priority is given to unobservable valuation inputs (Level 3). The availability of observable inputs can vary significantly and is affected by many factors, including the type of product, whether the product is new to the market, whether the product is traded on an active exchange or in the secondary market, and the current market conditions. To the extent that the valuation is based on less observable or unobservable inputs, the determination of fair value requires more judgment. Accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised by the Company in determining fair value is greatest for financial instruments classified as Level 3 (i.e., those instruments valued using non-observable inputs), which comprise the entirety of the Company s investments. 
    
  Changes to the valuation policy are reviewed by management and the Company s board of directors (the  Board ). As the Company s investments change, markets change, new products develop, and valuation inputs become more or less observable, the Company will continue to refine its valuation methodologies. 
    
  See Note 7 for more detailed disclosures of the Company s fair value measurements of its financial instruments. 
    
  Investment classification:    The Company classifies its investments in accordance with the 1940 Act. The 1940 Act defines  Control Investments  as investments in those companies in which the Company owns more than 25% of the voting securities or has rights to maintain greater than 50% of board representation,  Affiliate Investments  as investments in those companies in which the Company owns between 5% and 25% of the voting securities, and  Non-Control/Non-Affiliate Investments  as those that neither qualify as Control Investments nor Affiliate Investments.

  (Dollar amounts in thousands, except per share data) 

Additionally, the Company adopted the North American Industry Classification System in the first quarter of 2016 for the purpose of industry classification of the Company's investments on the accompanying schedule of investments. The December 31, 2015 schedule of investments has been conformed to the September 30, 2016 presentation. 
    
  Investment risks:    The Company s investments are subject to a variety of risks. These risks may include, but are not limited to the following: 
    
  Market risk -   Market risk represents the potential loss that can be caused by a change in the fair value of the financial instrument due to market changes. 
    
  Credit risk -   Credit risk represents the risk that the Company would incur if the counterparties failed to perform pursuant to the terms of their agreements with the Company. 
    
  Liquidity risk -   Liquidity risk represents the possibility that the Company may not maintain sufficient cash balances or access to cash to meet loan and other commitments as they become due. See Note 8 for further details. 
    
  Interest rate risk -   Interest rate risk represents the likelihood that a change in interest rates could have an adverse impact on the fair value of an interest-bearing financial instrument. 
    
  Prepayment risk -   Certain of the Company s debt investments allow for prepayment of principal without penalty. Downward changes in interest rates may cause prepayments to occur at a faster than expected rate, thereby effectively shortening the maturity of the debt investments and making the instrument less likely to be an income producing instrument. 
    
  Off-Balance sheet risk -   Some of the Company s financial instruments contain off-balance sheet risk. Generally, these financial instruments represent future commitments to purchase other financial instruments at specific terms at specific future dates. See Note 8 for further details. 
    
  Use of estimates  : The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. 
    
  Reportable segments  : The Company has a single reportable segment and single operating segment structure. 
    
  Cash and cash equivalents  : Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and highly liquid investments not held for resale with original maturities of three months or less. The Company s cash and cash equivalents are maintained with a member bank of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) and at times, such balances may be in excess of the FDIC insurance limits. Included in cash and cash equivalents was   $27,570   and   $32,612   held in a US Bank Money Market Deposit Account as of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
    
  Revenue recognition: 
    
  Interest Income:   Interest income is recorded on an accrual basis. Recognized interest income, if payable monthly or quarterly, is reported as interest receivable until collected. Recognized interest income due at maturity or at another stipulated date ( PIK interest ) is recorded as an adjustment to the amortized cost basis of the investment. The Company accrues interest income until events occur that place a loan into a non-accrual status (see below). Loan origination fees, original issue discount ( OID ), market discount or premium, and loan amendment fees (collectively,  Net Loan Fees ) are capitalized, and the Company accretes or amortizes such amounts as an adjustment to interest income over the life of the respective debt investment using a method that approximates the effective interest method. Unamortized Net Loan Fees are recorded as an adjustment to the amortized cost of the investment. When the Company receives a loan principal payment, the unamortized Net Loan Fees related to the paid principal is accelerated and recognized in interest income. All other interest income is recognized as contractually earned. Further, the Company may acquire or receive warrants or similar equity securities ( Warrants ) in connection with the Company s acquisition of, or subsequent amendment to, debt investments. The Company determines the cost basis of Warrants based on their fair value, and the fair value of debt investments and other instruments or consideration received. Any resulting difference between the face amount of the debt and its recorded cost resulting from the assignment of value to the Warrants is treated as OID, and accreted into interest income as described above.

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) 
  (Dollar amounts in thousands, except per share data) 

Unamortized Net Loan Fees on debt investments were   $2,468   and   $1,885   as of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The following table summarizes interest income recognized during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

Dividend Income and Distributions from Portfolio Companies:   Dividend income on common stock, generally payable in cash, is recorded at the time dividends are declared. Dividend income on preferred equity securities is accrued as earned. Dividends on preferred equity securities may be payable in cash or in additional preferred securities, and are generally not payable unless declared or upon liquidation. Declared dividends payable in cash are reported as dividend receivables until collected. Dividends payable in the form of additional preferred securities or contractually earned but not declared ( PIK dividends ) are recorded as an adjustment to the cost basis of the investment. The Company discontinues accrual of dividends on preferred equity securities when it determines that the dividend may not be collectible. The Company assesses the collectability of the preferred dividends based on many factors including the fair value of the preferred equity security, the valuation of the portfolio company s enterprise value, and proceeds expected to be received over the life of the investment. The Company may also receive cash distributions from portfolio companies that are taxed as flow-through entities. Each distribution is evaluated to determine whether it should be recorded as income or as a return of capital. Distributions classified as a return of capital are recorded as reductions in the cost basis of the investments. The following table summarizes dividend income recognized during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  :

Fee Income:   The Company generates revenue in the form of management, valuation, and other contractual fees, which is recognized as the related services are rendered. In the general course of its business, the Company receives certain fees from portfolio companies which are non-recurring in nature. Such fees include prepayment fees on certain loans repaid prior to their scheduled due date, which are recognized as earned when received, and fees for capital structuring services from certain portfolio companies, which are recognized as earned upon closing of the investment. The following table summarizes fee income recognized during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

Net Realized and Unrealized Gain or Loss on Investments:   Investment transactions are reported on a trade-date basis. Unsettled trades as of the balance sheet date are included in payable for investments purchased on the consolidated balance sheets. Realized gains or losses on investments are measured by the difference between the net proceeds from the disposition and the amortized cost basis of the investment. Investments are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by Company management under the supervision and review of the Board. After recording all appropriate interest, dividend, and other income, some of which is recorded as an adjustment to the cost basis of the investment as described above, the Company reports changes in the fair value of investments as net changes in unrealized appreciation/depreciation on investments in the consolidated statements of operations. 
    
  Non-accrual loans:   Loans on which the accrual of interest income has been discontinued are designated as non-accrual loans and accounted for on a non-accrual cash method. Loans are generally placed on non-accrual status when a loan either: (i) is delinquent for 90 days or more on principal or interest according to the contractual terms of the loan (unless well secured and in the process of collection), or (ii) in the opinion of management, there is reasonable doubt about its collectability. When loans are placed on non-accrual status, all interest previously accrued but not collected, other than PIK interest that has been contractually added to the principal balance prior to the designation date, is reversed against current period interest income. Interest payments subsequently received on non-accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management s judgment. Interest accruals are resumed on non-accrual loans only when they are brought current with respect to interest and principal and when, in the judgment of management, the loans are estimated to be fully collectible as to all principal and interest. At   September 30, 2016  ,   one   investment with an amortized cost and fair value of   $6,664   and   $5,433  , respectively, was carried as a non-accrual cash method loan. At   December 31, 2015  ,   one   investment with an amortized cost and fair value of   $937   and   $798  , respectively, was carried as a non-accrual cash method loan. 
    
  Income taxes:   The Company has elected to be treated, and intends to qualify annually, as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. To qualify as a RIC, the Company must, among other things, meet certain source of income and asset diversification requirements, and timely distribute at least 90% of its investment company taxable income ("ICTI") to its shareholders. The Company has made, and intends to continue to make, the requisite distributions to its shareholders, which generally relieves the Company from U.S. federal income taxes. 
    
  Depending on the level of ICTI earned in a tax year, the Company may choose to retain ICTI in an amount less than that which would trigger federal income tax liability under Subchapter M of the Code. However, the Company would be liable for a 4% excise tax on such income. Excise tax liability is recognized when the Company determines its estimated current year annual ICTI exceeds estimated current year distributions. 
    
  The Company may utilize wholly-owned holding companies taxed under Subchapter C of the Code when making equity investments in portfolio companies taxed as pass-through entities to meet its source-of-income requirements as a BDC. These  tax blocker  entities are consolidated in the Company s GAAP financial statements and may result in federal income tax expense with respect to income derived from those investments. Such income, net of applicable federal income tax, is not included in the Company s tax-basis net investment income until distributed by the holding-company subsidiary, which may result in temporary differences and character differences between the Company s GAAP and tax-basis net investment income

and realized gains and losses. Federal income tax expense from such holding-company subsidiaries is included in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. 
    
  The Company evaluates tax positions taken in the course of preparing its tax returns to determine whether they are  more-likely-than-not  to be sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax benefits of positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold could result in greater and undistributed ICTI, income and excise tax expense, and, if involving multiple years, a re-assessment of the Company s RIC status. GAAP requires recognition of accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax benefits as income tax expense. There were no uncertain income tax positions at   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  . The current and prior three tax years remain subject to examination by U.S. federal and most state tax authorities. 
    
  Distributions:   Distributions to common shareholders are recorded on the declaration date. The timing of distributions as well as the amount to be paid out as a distribution is determined by the Board each quarter. Distributions from net investment income and net realized gains are determined in accordance with the Code. Net realized capital gains, if any, are distributed at least annually, although the Company may decide to retain such capital gains for investment. Distributions paid in excess of taxable net investment income and net realized gains are considered returns of capital to shareholders. 
    
  The Company has adopted a distribution reinvestment plan ( DRIP ) that provides for reinvestment of any distributions the Company declares in cash on behalf of its shareholders, unless a shareholder elects to receive cash. As a result, if the Board authorizes and the Company declares a cash distribution, then shareholders who have not  opted out  of the DRIP will have their cash distribution automatically reinvested in additional shares of the Company s common stock, rather than receiving the cash distribution. 
    
  The Company may use newly issued shares under the guidelines of the DRIP, or the Company may purchase shares in the open market in connection with its obligations under the plan. 
    
  Deferred debt issuance costs  : Deferred debt issuance costs represent fees and other direct incremental costs incurred in connection with the Company s borrowings. Deferred debt issuance costs are presented as a direct reduction of the related debt liability on the consolidated balance sheets except for deferred debt issuance costs associated with the Company s line of credit arrangements, which are included in prepaid expenses and other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. These amounts are amortized to interest expense over the life of the borrowings. 
    
  Goodwill:   On December 4, 2013, in connection with acquisition of the limited partnership interests in SBIC I LP and membership interest in SBIC I GP (the  SBIC Acquisitions ), the Company recorded goodwill of $1,077, which is included in prepaid expenses and other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. Goodwill is not subject to amortization. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that indicate goodwill may be impaired. There have been no goodwill impairments since the date of the SBIC Acquisitions. 
    
  Intangible asset:   On December 4, 2013, in connection with the SBIC Acquisitions, the Company recorded an intangible asset of $2,500 attributable to the SBIC license. The Company amortizes this intangible asset on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life of 13 years. The Company expects to incur annual amortization expense of $195 in each of the years ending December 31, 2025 and $145 in 2026. 
    
  The Company tests its intangible asset for impairment if events or circumstances suggest that the asset carrying value may not be fully recoverable. The intangible asset, net of accumulated amortization of   $551   and   $405   at   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, is included in prepaid expenses and other assets. 
    
  Interest expense  : Interest expense is recognized on an accrual basis. 
    
  Concentration of credit risk  : Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash deposits at financial institutions. At various times during the year, the Company may exceed the federally insured limits. To mitigate this risk, the Company places cash deposits only with high credit quality institutions. Management believes the risk of loss is minimal.

      ASU 2015-03, Interest   Imputation of Interest:  Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs   
      
    Changes the presentation of debt issuance costs in the financial statements where an entity presents such costs in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an asset. Amortization of the costs is reported as interest expense. ASU 2015-03 did not specifically address presentation or subsequent measurement of debt issuance costs related to line of credit arrangements 
      
    First Quarter 2016 retrospectively 
      
    Resulted in a $3,420 retrospective reduction of both net deferred financing closing costs and SBA debentures payable in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 and a reduction of amortization and write-off of deferred financing closing costs and corresponding increase in interest  expense in the consolidated statement of operations for the three and nine  months ended September 30, 2015 of $96 and $2,004, respectively.  Net deferred debt issuance costs of $3,133 are presented as a direct deduction from the SBA debentures payable in the consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2016. Amortization of deferred debt issuance costs associated with the Company s SBA debentures was $96 and $200 for the three and nine months months ended September 30, 2016, and is included as interest expense in the consolidated statement of operations. Amortization and write-off of deferred financial costs related to the OFS Capital WM revolving line of credit of $1,804 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, is also included in interest expense. There was no impact to consolidated earnings as a result of this adoption

ASU 2015-15, Interest   Imputation of Interest:  Presentation and subsequent measurement of debt issuance costs associated with line-of-credit arrangements - amendments to SEC paragraphs 
      
    Response to SEC views on ASU 2015-03. Given the absence of authoritative guidance within ASU 2015-03 for debt issuance costs related to line of credit arrangements, the SEC stated it would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line of credit arrangement 
      
    First Quarter 2016 retrospectively 
      
    Net deferred financing closing costs of $110 and $185 associated with the Company's PWB Credit Facility are presented as an asset and included in prepaid expenses and other assets in the consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. There was no impact to consolidated earnings as a result of this adoption

    Effect of Adoption on the the financial statements 
      Standards that are not yet adopted 

ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers  
      
    Supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under GAAP. The core principle of the standard is to recognize revenues to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that is expected to be received for those goods or services. The standard defines a five step process to achieve this core principle. The standard must be adopting using either of the following transition methods: (i) a full retrospective approach reflecting the application of the standard in each prior reporting period with the option to elect certain practical expedients, or (ii) a retrospective approach with the cumulative effect of initially adopting ASU 2014-09 recognized at the date of adoption (which includes additional footnote disclosures) 
      
    Annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is not permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of its pending adoption of ASU 2014-09 on the Company s consolidated financial statements and has not yet determined the method by which it will adopt the standard in 2018 
      ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments   Overall 
      
    Modifies how entities measure equity investments and present changes in the fair value of financial liabilities. Entities will have to measure equity investments that do not result in consolidation and are not accounted for under the equity method at fair value, and recognize any changes in fair value in net income unless the investments qualify for the new practicality exception. A practicality exception will apply to those equity investments that do not have a readily determinable fair value and do not qualify for the practical expedient to estimate fair value under ASC 820 - Fair Value Measurement, and as such these investments may be measured at cost 
      
    Annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is required to record its investments at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income in accordance with ASC Topic 946,   Financial Services Investment Companies  . Therefore, the adoption of ASU 2016-01 is not expected to have a material effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements

Note 4. OFS Capital WM 
    
  OFS Capital WM, LLC ( OFS Capital WM ), a wholly-owned investment company subsidiary, was formed in August 2010 with the limited purpose of acquiring, managing and financing senior secured loan investments to middle-market companies in the United States. On September 28, 2010, the Company became the owner of OFS Capital WM through a transaction in which it transferred eligible loans or 100% of its participating interest in certain other loans to OFS Capital WM in exchange for cash and a 100% equity ownership interest in OFS Capital WM. These loans were managed and serviced by MCF Capital Management, LLC ( MCF ) under a loan and security agreement among OFS Capital WM, MCF, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, and Well Fargo Delaware Trust Company, N.A. (the  Loan and Security Agreement ). MCF charged a management fee of 0.25% per annum of the assigned value of the underlying portfolio investments plus an accrued fee that was deferred until termination of the Loan and Security Agreement on May 28, 2015. The Company incurred management fee expense related to this agreement of $-0- for both the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , and   $173   and   $590   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively. 
    
  OFS Capital WM Asset Sale and Related Transactions 
    
  On May 28, 2015, the Company and OFS Capital WM entered into a Loan Portfolio Purchase Agreement with Madison Capital Funding LLC ( Madison ), an affiliate of MCF, pursuant to which OFS Capital WM sold a portfolio of 20 senior secured debt investments with an aggregate outstanding principal balance of $67,807 as of May 28, 2015 to Madison for $67,309 in cash (the  WM Asset Sale ). On May 28, 2015, the total fair value of the debt investments sold, applying the Company s March 31, 2015 fair value percentages to the principal balances of the respective investments on the sale date, was approximately $66,703. The determination of the fair value of the Company s investments is subject to the good faith determination by the Company s Board, which is conducted no less frequently than quarterly, pursuant to the Company s valuation policies and GAAP. 
    
  On May 28, 2015, pursuant to the Loan and Security Agreement, the Company applied $52,414 from the sale proceeds of the WM Asset Sale to pay in full and retire OFS Capital WM s secured credit facility with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. ( WM Credit Facility ). As a result of the termination of the WM Credit Facility, the Company wrote-off the remaining related unamortized deferred financing closing costs of $1,216 on the revolving line of credit, which was included in interest expense for the   three and nine months ended   September 30, 2015. 
    
  On May 28, 2015, in connection with the WM Asset Sale, the Company entered into a Loan Administration Services Agreement with Madison pursuant to which Madison will provide loan servicing and other administrative services to OFS Capital WM with respect to certain of its remaining loan assets. In return for its loan administration services, Madison receives a quarterly loan administration fee of 0.25% per annum based on the average daily principal balances of the loan assets for such quarter. The Company incurred loan administration fee expense of   $13   and   $39   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, and   $15   and   $20   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively. 

Note 5. Related Party Transactions 
    
  Investment Advisory and Management Agreement:    OFS Advisor manages the day-to-day operations of, and provides investment advisory services to, the Company pursuant to an investment advisory and management agreement dated November 7, 2012 ("Advisory Agreement"). Under the terms of the Advisory Agreement, which are in accordance with the 1940 Act and subject to the overall supervision of the Company s Board, OFS Advisor is responsible for sourcing potential investments, conducting research and diligence on potential investments and equity sponsors, analyzing investment opportunities, structuring investments, and monitoring investments and portfolio companies on an ongoing basis. OFS Advisor is a subsidiary of Orchard First Source Asset Management, LLC ( OFSAM ) and a registered investment advisor under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended. 
    
  OFS Advisor s services under the Advisory Agreement are not exclusive to the Company and OFS Advisor is free to furnish similar services to other entities so long as its services to the Company are not impaired. OFS Advisor receives fees for providing services, consisting of two components: a base management fee and an incentive fee. The base management fee is calculated at an annual rate of 1.75% and based on the average value of the Company s total assets (other than cash and cash equivalents but including assets purchased with borrowed amounts and including assets owned by any consolidated entity) at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters, adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the quarter. OFS Advisor has elected to exclude the value of the intangible asset and goodwill resulting from the SBIC Acquisitions from the base management fee calculation.

    OFS Capital Corporation and Subsidiaries               
                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) 
  (Dollar amounts in thousands, except per share data) 

The base management fee is payable quarterly in arrears and was   $1,120   and   $3,324  , for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, and   $1,120   and   $3,813  , for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively. 
    
  The incentive fee has two parts. The first part (part one) is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears based on the Company s pre-incentive fee net investment income for the immediately preceding calendar quarter. For this purpose, pre-incentive fee net investment income means interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees such as commitment, origination and sourcing, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that the Company receives from portfolio companies but excluding fees for providing managerial assistance) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus operating expenses for the quarter (including the base management fee, any expenses payable under the Administration Agreement (as defined below) and any interest expense and dividends paid on any outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the incentive fee). Pre-incentive fee net investment income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest or dividend feature (such as OID, debt instruments with PIK interest, equity investments with accruing or PIK dividend and zero coupon securities), accrued income that the Company has not yet received in cash. 
    
  Pre-incentive fee net investment income is expressed as a rate of return on the value of the Company s net assets (defined as total assets less indebtedness and before taking into account any incentive fees payable during the period) at the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter. The incentive fee with respect to pre-incentive fee net income is 20.0% of the amount, if any, by which the pre-incentive fee net investment income for the immediately preceding calendar quarter exceeds a 2.0% (which is 8.0% annualized) hurdle rate and a  catch-up  provision measured as of the end of each calendar quarter. Under this provision, in any calendar quarter, OFS Advisor receives no incentive fee until the net investment income equals the hurdle rate of 2.0%, but then receives, as a  catch-up,  100.0% of the pre-incentive fee net investment income with respect to that portion of such pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than 2.5%. The effect of this provision is that, if pre-incentive fee net investment income exceeds 2.5% in any calendar quarter, OFS Advisor will receive 20.0% of the pre-incentive fee net investment income. 
    
  Pre-incentive fee net investment income does not include any realized capital gains, realized capital losses or unrealized capital appreciation or depreciation. Because of the structure of the incentive fee, it is possible that the Company may pay an incentive fee in a quarter in which the Company incurs a loss. For example, if the Company receives pre-incentive fee net investment income in excess of the quarterly minimum hurdle rate, the Company will pay the applicable incentive fee even if the Company has incurred a loss in that quarter due to realized and unrealized capital losses. The Company s net investment income used to calculate this part of the incentive fee is also included in the amount of the Company s gross assets used to calculate the base management fee. These calculations are appropriately prorated for any period of less than three months and adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during such quarter. 
    
  The second part (part two) of the incentive fee (the  Capital Gain Fee ) is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the Advisory Agreement, as of the termination date), commencing on December 31, 2012, and equals 20.0% of the Company s aggregate realized capital gains, if any, on a cumulative basis from the date of the election to be a BDC through the end of each calendar year, computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation through the end of such year, less all previous amounts paid in respect of the Capital Gain Fee; provided that the incentive fee determined as of December 31, 2012 was calculated for a period of shorter than twelve calendar months to take into account any realized capital gains computed net of all realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation for the period beginning on the date of the Company s election to be a BDC and ending December 31, 2012. 
    
  The Company accrues the Capital Gain Fee if, on a cumulative basis, the sum of net realized capital gains and (losses) plus net unrealized appreciation and (depreciation) is positive. If, on a cumulative basis, the sum of net realized capital gains (losses) plus net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) decreases during a period, the Company will reverse any excess Capital Gain Fee previously accrued such that the amount of Capital Gains Fee accrued is no more than 20% of the sum of net realized capital gains (losses) plus net unrealized appreciation (depreciation). OFS Advisor has excluded from the Capital Gain Fee calculation any realized gain with respect to (1) the step acquisitions resulting from the SBIC Acquisitions, and (2) the WM Asset Sale. 
    
  The Company incurred incentive fee expense of   $817   and   $2,407   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively. Incentive fees for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , included part one incentive fees (based on net investment income) of   $817   and   $2,546  , respectively. Part two incentive fees (based upon net realized and unrealized gains

and losses, or capital gains) were   $0   and   $(139)   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively which represented the reversal of the part two incentive fee accrued at December 31, 2015. The Company incurred incentive fee expense of   $908   and   $1,514   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively, which consisted entirely of part one incentive fees. 
    
  License Agreement:   The Company entered into a license agreement with OFSAM under which OFSAM has agreed to grant the Company a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use the name  OFS.  
    
  Administration Agreement:   OFS Capital Services, LLC ( OFS Services ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of OFSAM, furnishes the Company with office facilities and equipment, necessary software licenses and subscriptions, and clerical, bookkeeping and record keeping services at such facilities pursuant to an administration agreement dated November 7, 2012 ( Administration Agreement ). Under the Administration Agreement, OFS Services performs, or oversees the performance of, the Company s required administrative services, which include being responsible for the financial records that the Company is required to maintain and preparing reports to its shareholders and all other reports and materials required to be filed with the SEC or any other regulatory authority. In addition, OFS Services assists the Company in determining and publishing its net asset value, oversees the preparation and filing of its tax returns and the printing and dissemination of reports to its shareholders, and generally oversees the payment of the Company s expenses and the performance of administrative and professional services rendered to the Company by others. Under the Administration Agreement, OFS Services also provides managerial assistance on the Company s behalf to those portfolio companies that have accepted the Company s offer to provide such assistance. Payment under the Administration Agreement is equal to an amount based upon the Company s allocable portion of OFS Services s overhead in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including, but not limited to, rent, information technology services and the Company s allocable portion of the cost of its officers, including its chief executive officer, chief financial officer, chief compliance officer, chief accounting officer, and their respective staffs. 
    
  Administration fee expense was   $255   and   $1,009   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, and   $281   and   $1,148   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively. 

Note 6. Investments 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had loans to   37   portfolio companies, totaling   $230,912   in aggregate principal amount, of which   77%   were senior secured loans and   23%   were subordinated loans, as well as equity investments in   16   of these portfolio companies. The Company also held an equity investment in   one   portfolio company in which it did not hold a debt interest. 
    
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company converted $1,765 in principal of a subordinated debt investment into preferred equity units and warrants valued at $1,765 and converted $329 in principal of a senior secured debt investment into preferred equity units valued at $335. In addition, the Company amended a senior secured debt investment for which it received preferred equity units in the same portfolio company valued at $203 and received additional preferred equity units valued at $44 in connection with a $1,250 follow on investment in the same portfolio company.  At   September 30, 2016  , investments consisted of the following:

Note 7. Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
    
  The Company s investments are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by Company management under the supervision, and review and approval of the Board. These fair value are determined in accordance with a documented valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process that includes a review of each investment by an independent valuation firm at least once every 12 months. 
    
  Each quarter the Company assesses whether sufficient market quotations are available or whether a sufficient number of indicative prices from pricing services or brokers or dealers have been received. Investments for which sufficient market quotations are available are valued at such market quotations. With respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, the Company undertakes, on a quarterly basis, a multi-step valuation process as described below: 

For each debt investment, a basic credit rating review process is completed. The risk rating on every credit facility is reviewed and either reaffirmed or revised by OFS Advisor s investment committee. 
                
    Each portfolio company or investment is valued by an investment professional. 
                
    The preliminary valuations are documented and are then submitted to OFS Advisor s investment committee for ratification. 
                
    Independent third-party valuation firm(s) provide valuation services as requested, by reviewing the investment committee s preliminary valuations. OFS Advisor s investment committee s preliminary fair value conclusions on each of the Company s assets for which sufficient market quotations are not readily available is reviewed and assessed by an independent third-party valuation firm at least once in every 12-month period, and more often as determined by the audit committee of the Company s Board or required by the Company s valuation policy. Such valuation assessment may be in the form of positive assurance, range of values or other valuation method based on the discretion of the Company s Board. 
                
    The audit committee of the Board reviews the preliminary valuations of OFS Advisor s investment committee and independent valuation firms and, if appropriate, recommends the approval of the valuations by the Board. 
                
    The Company s Board discusses valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in the portfolio in good faith based on the input of OFS Advisor, the audit committee and, where appropriate, the respective independent valuation firm. 
       
  The Company was unable to obtain sufficient market quotations or indicative prices at   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , and followed the multi-step valuation process. 
    
  Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair values are determined with models or other valuation techniques, valuation inputs, and assumptions market participants would use to value an asset or liability. Valuation inputs are organized in a hierarchy that gives the highest priority to prices for identical assets or liabilities quoted in active markets (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The three levels of inputs in the fair value hierarchy are described below: 
    
  Level 1  : Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity can access at the measurement date. 
    
  Level 2  : Inputs other than quoted prices within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. If the asset or liability has a specified term, a Level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. Level 2 inputs include: (i) quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, (ii) quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, (iii) inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, and (iv) inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. 
    
  Level 3  : Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability, and situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date. 
    
  The inputs into the determination of fair value are based upon the best information under the circumstances and may require significant management judgment or estimation. In certain cases, the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, an investment s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The Company s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and considers factors specific to the investment. 
    
  The Company assesses the levels of the investments at each measurement date, and transfers between levels are recognized on the measurement date. All of the Company s investments, which are measured at fair value, were categorized as Level 3 based  
  
   36 

    OFS Capital Corporation and Subsidiaries               
                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited)

upon the lowest level of significant input to the valuations. There were no transfers among Level 1, 2 and 3 for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  . The following sections describe the valuation techniques used by the Company to measure different financial instruments at fair value and include the levels within the fair value hierarchy in which the financial instruments are categorized. 
    
  The primary method used to estimate the fair value of investments is the discounted cash flow method (although a liquidation analysis, option theoretical, or other methodology may be used when more appropriate). The discounted cash flow approach to determine fair value (or a range of fair values) involves applying an appropriate discount rate(s) to the estimated future cash flows using various relevant factors depending on investment type, including the latest arm s length or market transactions involving the subject security, a benchmark credit spread or other indication of market yields, assumed growth rate (in cash flows), company performance, and capitalization rates/multiples (for determining terminal values of underlying portfolio companies). The valuation based on the inputs determined to be the most reasonable and probable is used as the fair value of the investment, which may include a weighting factor applied to multiple valuation methods. The determination of fair value using these methodologies may take into consideration a range of factors including, but not limited to, the price at which the investment was acquired, the nature of the investment, local market conditions, trading values on public exchanges for comparable securities, current and projected operating performance, financing transactions subsequent to the acquisition of the investment and anticipated financing transactions after the valuation date. Application of these valuation methodologies involves a significant degree of judgment by management. Fair values of new investments or investments where an arm s length transaction occurred in the same security are generally assumed to be equal to their cost ( Transaction Price ) for up to three months after their initial purchase. 
    
  Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of Level 3 investments, the fair value of the investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market or observable inputs existed for such investments and may differ materially from the values that may ultimately be received or settled. Further, such investments are generally subject to legal and other restrictions, or otherwise are less liquid than publicly traded instruments. If the Company were required to liquidate a portfolio investment in a forced or liquidation sale, the Company might realize significantly less than the value at which such investment had previously been recorded. 
    
  The following tables provide quantitative information about the Company s significant Level 3 fair value inputs to the Company s fair value measurements as of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  . In addition to the techniques and inputs noted in the tables below, according to the Company s valuation policy, the Company may also use other valuation techniques and methodologies when determining the Company s fair value measurements. The table below is not intended to be exhaustive, but rather provides information on the significant Level 3 inputs as they relate to the Company s fair value measurements.

    Excludes   $14,315   of senior secured debt investments valued at a Transaction Price.

(1) 
    Excludes $51,122, $0, and $8,933 of senior secured debt investments, subordinated debt investments, and equity investments, respectively, valued at a Transaction Price. 
       
  Changes in market credit spreads or the credit quality of the underlying portfolio company (both of which could impact the discount rate), as well as changes in EBITDA multiples, among other things, could have a significant impact on fair values, with the fair value of a particular debt investment susceptible to change in inverse relation to the changes in the discount rate. Changes in EBITDA multiples, as well as changes in the discount rate, could have a significant impact on fair values, with the fair value of an equity investment susceptible to change in tandem with the changes in EBITDA multiples, and in inverse relation to changes in the discount rate. 
    
  The following tables present changes in investments measured at fair value using Level 3 inputs for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  .

The net change in unrealized appreciation/depreciation for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   reported in the Company s consolidated statements of operations attributable to the Company s Level 3 assets held at those respective period ends was   $(904)   and   $1,306  , respectively.  
    
  The information presented should not be interpreted as an estimate of the fair value of the entire Company since fair value measurements are only required for a portion of the Company s assets and liabilities. Due to the wide range of valuation techniques and the degree of subjectivity used in making the estimates, comparisons between the Company s disclosures and those of other companies may not be meaningful. As of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , the carrying value of the Company s financial instruments, including its debt obligations under its SBA debentures payable, as well as the revolving line of credit (which was terminated on May 28, 2015; see Note 4), approximated their estimated fair value. 

Note 8. Commitments and Contingencies 
    
  Unfunded commitments as of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015   were as follows: 

From time to time, the Company is involved in legal proceedings in the normal course of its business. Although the outcome of such litigation cannot be predicted with any certainty, management is of the opinion, based on the advice of legal counsel, that final disposition of any litigation should not have a material adverse effect on the financial position of the Company as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Additionally, the Company is subject to periodic inspection by regulators to assess compliance with applicable regulations related to its status as a BDC and SBIC I LP is subject to periodic inspections by the SBA.

  (Dollar amounts in thousands, except per share data) 

In the normal course of business, the Company enters into contracts and agreements that contain a variety of representations and warranties that provide general indemnifications. The Company s maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown, as this would involve future claims that may be made against the Company that have not occurred. The Company believes the risk of any material obligation under these indemnifications to be low. 

Note 9. Borrowings 
    
  SBA Debentures:   The SBIC Program allows SBIC I LP to obtain leverage by issuing SBA-guaranteed debentures, subject to issuance of a capital commitment by the SBA and customary procedures. These debentures are non-recourse to the Company, have interest payable semi-annually and a ten-year maturity. The interest rate is fixed at the time of SBA pooling, which is March and September of each year, at a market-driven spread over U.S. Treasury Notes with ten-year maturities. 
    
  Under present regulations of the SBIC Act, the maximum amount of SBA-guaranteed debt that may be issued by a single SBIC licensee is $150,000. An SBIC fund may borrow up to two times the amount of its regulatory capital, subject to customary regulatory requirements. For two or more SBICs under common control, the maximum amount of outstanding SBA-provided leverage cannot exceed $350,000. In connection with the SBIC Acquisitions, the Company increased its total commitments to SBIC I LP to $75,000, which became a drop down SBIC fund of the Company on December 4, 2013. During 2014, the Company fully funded its $75,000 commitment to SBIC I LP. As of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , SBIC I LP had fully drawn the $149,880 of leverage commitments from the SBA.  
    
  On a stand-alone basis, SBIC I LP held   $242,038   and $245,147 in assets at   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, which accounted for approximately   83%   and 83% of the Company s total consolidated assets, respectively. 
    
  The following table shows the Company s outstanding SBA debentures payable as of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  : 

The Company received exemptive relief from the SEC effective November 26, 2013. The exemptive relief allows the Company to exclude SBA guaranteed debentures from the definition of senior securities in the statutory 200% asset coverage ratio under the 1940 Act, allowing for greater capital deployment. 
    
  The effective interest rate on the SBA debentures, which includes amortization of deferred debt issuance costs, was   3.43%   as of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  . Interest expense on the SBA debentures was   $1,295   and   $3,860   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, which includes   $95   and   $286   of debt issuance costs amortization, respectively. Interest expense on the SBA debentures was   $1,185   and   $3,055   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively, which includes   $96   and   $200   of debt issuance costs amortization, respectively. The weighted average fixed cash interest rate on the SBA debentures as of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015   was   3.18%  .

PWB Credit Facility:   On November 5, 2015, the Company entered into a Business Loan Agreement ( BLA ) with Pacific Western Bank, as lender, to provide the Company with a $15,000 senior secured revolving credit facility ( PWB Credit Facility ). The PWB Credit Facility is available for general corporate purposes including investment funding. The maximum availability of the PWB Credit Facility is equal to 50% of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of eligible loans included in the borrowing base and otherwise specified in the BLA. The PWB Credit Facility is guaranteed by OFS Capital WM and secured by all of the Company s current and future assets excluding assets held by SBIC I LP and the Company s SBIC I LP and SBIC I GP partnership interests. The PWB Credit Facility matures on November 6, 2017. Advances under the facility bear interest at a fixed rate per annum equal to 4.75%. The Company incurred debt issuance costs of   $202   in connection with the closing of the PWB Credit Facility. Deferred debt issuance costs, net of accumulated amortization, was   $109   and   $185   as of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. Amortization of debt issuance costs was   $26   and   $76   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . There have been no advances under the facility as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  The BLA contains customary terms and conditions, including, without limitation, affirmative and negative covenants such as information reporting requirements, a minimum tangible net asset value, a minimum quarterly net investment income after incentive fees, and a statutory asset coverage test. The BLA also contains customary events of default, including, without limitation, nonpayment, misrepresentation of representations and warranties in a material respect, breach of covenant, cross-default to other indebtedness, bankruptcy, change in investment advisor, and the occurrence of a material adverse change in our financial condition. 
    
  On October 31, 2016, the BLA was amended to, among other things (i) increase the maximum amount available under the PWB Credit Facility from $15 million to $25 million, (ii) extend the maturity date from November 6, 2017 to October 31, 2018, (iii) increase the fixed interest rate from 4.75% to 5.00% per annum, and (iv) exclude subordinated loan investments (as defined in the BLA) from the borrowing base. In connection with the amendment the Company incurred debt issuance costs of $175 and will incur an unused commitment fee, payable monthly in arrears, equal to 0.50% per annum on any unused portion of the PWB Credit Facility in excess of $15 million. 
    
  OFS Capital WM Revolving Line of Credit:   Prior to the termination of the WM Credit Facility on May 28, 2015 (see Note 4), OFS Capital WM had a $75,000 secured revolving credit facility, as amended from time to time, with Wells Fargo. The WM Credit Facility was secured by all eligible loans acquired by OFS Capital WM, and had a maturity date of December 31, 2018 and a reinvestment period through December 31, 2015. The interest rate on outstanding borrowings was the London Interbank Offered Rate plus 2.50% per annum. The minimum equity requirement was set at $35,000. The interest rate on the outstanding borrowings at December 31, 2014 was 2.76%. The unused commitment fee on the WM Credit Facility was (1) 0.5% per annum of the first $25,000 of the unused facility and (2) 2% per annum of the balance in excess of $25,000, and was included in interest expense on the consolidated statement of operations. Interest expense on the revolving line of credit was $0 and $2,695 for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , which includes $0 and $1,908 of amortization and write-off of debt issuance costs, respectively. During the three months ended March 31, 2015, the Company recorded a $430 write-off of debt issuance costs due to a permanent reduction in the facility s commitment from $100,000 to $75,000. During the three months ended June 30, 2015, the Company incurred a $1,216 write-off of debt issuance costs due to the termination of the facility on May 28, 2015. 

Note 10. Federal Income Tax 
    
  The Company has elected to be taxed as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. In order to maintain its status as a RIC, the Company is required to distribute annually to its shareholders at least 90% of its ICTI, as defined by the Code. Additionally, to avoid a 4% excise tax on undistributed earnings the Company is required to distribute each calendar year the sum of (i) 98% of its ordinary income for such calendar year (ii) 98.2% of its net capital gains for the one-year period ending October 31 of that calendar year, and (iii) any income recognized, but not distributed, in preceding years and on which the Company paid no federal income tax. Maintenance of the Company's RIC status also requires adherence to certain source of income and asset diversification requirements. 
    
  The Company has met the required distribution, source of income and asset diversification requirements as of   September 30, 2016  , and intends to continue meeting these requirements. Accordingly, there is no liability for federal income taxes at the Company level. The Company s ICTI differs from the net increase in net assets resulting from operations primarily due to differences in income recognition on the unrealized appreciation/depreciation of investments, income from Company s equity investments in pass-through entities, PIK dividends that have not yet been declared and paid by underlying portfolio companies, and capital gains and losses and the net creation or utilization of capital loss carryforwards.

                   Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) 
  (Dollar amounts in thousands, except per share data) 

The determination of the tax attributes of the Company s distributions is made annually as of the end of its fiscal year based upon its ICTI for the full year and distributions paid for the full year. If the tax characteristics of the Company s   $9,886   distributions paid during 2016 were determined as of   September 30, 2016  , approximately   $1,415   would have represented return of capital to its shareholders. The Company utilized   $58   and   $2,438   of capital loss carryforward during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, and has   $319   of non-expiring capital loss carryforward remaining as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  The Company records reclassifications to its capital accounts related to permanent differences between GAAP and tax treatment of goodwill amortization, excise taxes, and other permanent differences; and temporary differences between GAAP and tax treatment of realized gains and losses, income arising from Company s equity investments in pass-through entities, PIK dividends, and other temporary differences. These required reclassifications for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , were part of the revisions discussed in Note 2 as they had not been reported in previously issued financial statements. Reclassifications for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , were as follows: 

The tax-basis cost of investments and associated tax-basis gross unrealized appreciation (depreciation) inherent in the fair value of investments as of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015   were as follows:

Note 11. Financial Highlights 
    
  The following is a schedule of financial highlights for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

(1) 
    Calculation is ending market value less beginning market value, adjusting for distributions reinvested at prices obtained in the Company s distribution reinvestment plan for the respective distributions. 
              (2) 
    Calculation is ending net asset value less beginning net asset value, adjusting for distributions reinvested at the Company s quarter-end net asset value for the respective distributions. 
              (3) 
    Based on net asset values as the end of the indicated and preceding calendar quarter for three-month periods, and net asset values as the end of the indicated and   three   preceding calendar quarters for   nine  -month periods. 
              (4) 
    The components of the distributions are presented on an income tax basis. 
              (5) 
    Annualized. 
              (6) 
    Portfolio turnover rate is calculated using the lesser of year-to-date sales and principal payments or year-to-date purchases over the average of the invested assets at fair value. 
              (7) 
    The determination of the tax attributes of the Company s distributions is made annually as of the end of its fiscal year based upon its ICTI for the full year and distributions paid for the full year. Therefore, a determination made on a quarterly basis may not be representative of the actual tax attributes of the Company s distributions for a full year. If the tax characteristics of the Company s distributions paid during   2016   were determined as of   September 30, 2016  , approximately   $0.15   per share would represent a return of capital.

Note 12. Distributions 
    
  The Company intends to make distributions to shareholders on a quarterly basis of substantially all of its net investment income. In addition, although the Company intends to make distributions of net realized capital gains, if any, at least annually, out of assets legally available for such distributions, it may in the future decide to retain such capital gains for investment. 
    
  The Company may be limited in its ability to make distributions due to the BDC asset coverage requirements of the 1940 Act. The Company s ability to make distributions may also be affected by its ability to receive distributions from SBIC I LP, which is governed by SBA regulations. Consolidated cash and cash equivalents includes   $20,607   held by SBIC I LP, which was not available for distribution at   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  The following table summarizes distributions declared and paid for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

Since the Company s IPO, distributions to shareholders total   $47,582  , or   $4.93   per share on a cumulative basis. 
    
  Distributions in excess of the Company s current and accumulated ICTI would be treated first as a return of capital to the extent of the shareholder s tax basis, and any remaining distributions would be treated as a capital gain. The determination of the tax attributes of the Company s distributions is made annually as of the end of its fiscal year based upon its ICTI for the full year and distributions paid for the full year. Therefore, a determination made on a quarterly basis may not be representative of the actual tax attributes of the Company s distributions for a full year. Each year, a statement on Form 1099-DIV identifying the source of the distribution is mailed to the Company s shareholders. If the tax characteristics of the Company s distributions paid during   2016   were determined as of   September 30, 2016  , approximately   $0.87   per share and   $0.15   per share of the Company s distributions represented ordinary income and a return of capital to its shareholders, respectively. 

Note 13. Earnings per Share 
    
  The following table summarizes the calculations for basic and diluted net increase in net assets resulting from operations per common share for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  .

  The following analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto contained elsewhere in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. 

Overview 
    
  We are an externally managed, closed-end, non-diversified management investment company. Our investment objective is to provide our shareholders with both current income and capital appreciation primarily through debt investments and, to a lesser extent, equity investments. Our investment strategy focuses primarily on investments in middle-market companies in the United States. We use the term  middle-market  to refer to companies that may exhibit one or more of the following characteristics: number of employees up to 2,000; revenues between $15 million and $300 million; annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, between $3 million and $50 million; generally, private companies owned by private equity firms or owners/operators; and enterprise value between $10 million and $500 million. For additional information about how we define the middle-market, see  General Investment Criteria/Guidelines.  
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our investment portfolio consisted of outstanding loans of approximately   $230.9 million   in aggregate principal amount in   37   portfolio companies, of which   77%   were senior secured loans and   23%   were subordinated loans, as well as equity investments of   $32.7 million  , at fair value, in 17 portfolio companies, 16 of which we also held a debt investment. As of   September 30, 2016  ,   67%   of our investment portfolio was comprised of senior secured loans,   20%   of subordinated loans and   13%   of equity investments, at fair value. 
    
  While our investment strategy focuses primarily on middle-market companies in the United States, including senior secured loans, which includes first-lien, second-lien and unitranche loans as well as subordinated loans and, to a lesser extent, warrants and other equity securities, we also may invest up to 30% of our portfolio in opportunistic investments of non-eligible portfolio companies. Specifically, as part of this 30% basket, we may consider investments in investment funds that are operating pursuant to certain exceptions to the 1940 Act and in advisers to similar investment funds, as well as in debt of middle-market companies located outside of the United States and debt and equity of public companies that do not meet the definition of eligible portfolio companies because their market capitalization of publicly traded equity securities exceeds the levels provided for in the 1940 Act. 
    
  Our investment strategy includes SBIC I LP, which received a license under the SBA s SBIC Program in May 2012. The SBIC license allows SBIC I LP to receive SBA-guaranteed debenture funding, subject to the issuance of a leverage commitment by the SBA and other customary procedures. SBA leverage funding is subject to SBIC I LP s payment of certain fees to the SBA, and the ability of SBIC I LP to draw on the leverage commitment is subject to its compliance with SBA regulations and policies, including an audit by the SBA. For additional information regarding the regulation of SBIC I LP, see  Regulation Small Business Investment Company Regulations.  
    
  In January 2015, we filed an application with the SBA for a second SBIC license, which, if approved, would provide up to $75.0 million in additional SBA debentures for the funding of our future investments upon our contribution of at least $37.5 million in additional regulatory capital and subject to the issuance of a leverage commitment by the SBA and other customary procedures. There can be no assurance as to whether or when this application will be approved by the SBA. 
    
  On a stand-alone basis, SBIC I LP held approximately   $242.0 million   and $245.1 million in assets at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, which accounted for approximately   83%   and 83% of our total consolidated assets at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
    
  Our investment activities are managed by OFS Advisor and supervised by our board of directors, a majority of whom are independent of us, OFS Advisor and its affiliates. Under the Investment Advisory Agreement (as defined below) between us and OFS Advisor we have agreed to pay OFS Advisor an annual base management fee based on the average value of our total assets (other than cash and cash equivalents but including assets purchased with borrowed amounts and including assets owned by any consolidated entity) as well as an incentive fee based on our investment performance. We have elected to exclude from  
  
   49 

the base management fee calculation any base management fee that would be owed in respect of the intangible asset and goodwill resulting from our acquisitions of the remaining ownership interests in SBIC I LP and SBIC I GP on December 4, 2013. We have also entered into an Administration Agreement with OFS Services. Under our Administration Agreement, we have agreed to reimburse OFS Services for our allocable portion (subject to the review and approval of our independent directors) of overhead and other expenses incurred by OFS Services in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement. 
    
  As a BDC, we must not acquire any assets other than  qualifying assets  specified in the 1940 Act unless, at the time the acquisition is made, at least 70% of our assets, as defined by the 1940 Act, are qualifying assets (with certain limited exceptions). Qualifying assets include investments in  eligible portfolio companies.  Under the relevant SEC rules, the term  eligible portfolio company  includes all private companies, companies whose securities are not listed on a national securities exchange, and certain public companies that have listed their securities on a national securities exchange and have a market capitalization of less than $250 million, in each case organized in the United States. 
    
  We are permitted to borrow money from time to time within the levels permitted by the 1940 Act (which generally allows us to incur leverage for up to 50% of our asset base). We may borrow money when the terms and conditions available are favorable to do so and are aligned with our investment strategy and portfolio composition. The use of borrowed funds or the proceeds of preferred stock to make investments would have its own specific benefits and risks, and all of the costs of borrowing funds or issuing preferred stock would be borne by holders of our common stock. 
    
  We have elected to be treated for tax purposes as a RIC under the Code. To qualify as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and assets diversification requirements. Pursuant to these elections, we generally will not have to pay corporate-level taxes on any income we distribute to our shareholders. 
    
  The 1940 Act generally prohibits BDCs from making certain negotiated co-investments with certain affiliates absent an order from the SEC permitting the BDC to do so. On October 12, 2016, we received exemptive relief from the SEC to permit us to co-invest in portfolio companies with certain other funds managed by OFS Advisor ( Affiliated Funds ) in a manner consistent with our investment objective, positions, policies, strategies and restrictions as well as regulatory requirements and other pertinent factors, subject to compliance with certain conditions (the  Order ). Pursuant to the Order, we are generally permitted to co-invest with Affiliated Funds if a  required majority  (as defined in Section 57(o) of the 1940 Act) of our independent directors make certain conclusions in connection with a co-investment transaction, including that (1) the terms of the transactions, including the consideration to be paid, are reasonable and fair to us and our shareholders and do not involve overreaching by us or our shareholders on the part of any person concerned and (2) the transaction is consistent with the interests of our shareholders and is consistent with our investment objective and strategies.  

Related Party Transactions 
    
  Investment Advisory Agreement 
    
  We have entered into an Investment Advisory Agreement with OFS Advisor, under which OFS Advisor manages the day-to-day operations of, and provides investment advisory services to us. Under the terms of the Advisory Agreement, which are in accordance with the 1940 Act and subject to the overall supervision of our Board, OFS Advisor is responsible for sourcing potential investments, conducting research and diligence on potential investments and equity sponsors, analyzing investment opportunities, structuring investments, and monitoring investments and portfolio companies on an ongoing basis. OFS Advisor is a subsidiary of OFSAM and a registered investment advisor under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended. 
     
  OFS Advisor s services under the Advisory Agreement are not exclusive to us and OFS Advisor is free to furnish similar services to other entities so long as its services to us are not impaired. For example, OFS Advisor also serves as the investment adviser for Hancock Park Corporate Income, Inc. ( Hancock Park ), a corporation formed under the laws of the State of Maryland in December 2015, and that has elected to be treated as a BDC in July 2016.  Hancock Park s investment objective is similar to ours, which is to provide shareholders with current income and capital appreciation primarily through debt investments and, to a lesser extent, equity investments.  
    
  OFS Advisor receives fees for providing services, consisting of two components: a base management fee and an incentive fee. The base management fee is calculated at an annual rate of 1.75% and based on the average value of our total assets (other than cash and cash equivalents but including assets purchased with borrowed amounts and including assets owned by any consolidated entity) at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters, adjusted for any share issuances or  
  
   50 

repurchases during the quarter. OFS Advisor has elected to exclude the value of the intangible asset and goodwill resulting from the SBIC Acquisitions from the base management fee calculation. 
    
  The base management fee expense was approximately   $1.1 million   and   $3.3 million   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively. The base management fee expense was approximately   $1.1 million   and   $3.8 million   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively. 
    
  The incentive fee has two parts. One part (part one) is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears based on our pre-incentive fee net investment income for the immediately preceding calendar quarter.  Pre-incentive fee net investment income  means interest income, dividend income and any other income (including any other fees such as commitment, origination and sourcing, structuring, diligence and consulting fees or other fees that we receive from portfolio companies but excluding fees for providing managerial assistance) accrued during the calendar quarter, minus operating expenses for the quarter (including the base management fee, any expenses payable under the Administration Agreement and any interest expense and dividends paid on any outstanding preferred stock, but excluding the incentive fee). Pre-incentive fee net investment income includes, in the case of investments with a deferred interest or dividend feature (such as OID, debt instruments with PIK interest, equity investments with accruing or PIK dividend, and zero coupon securities), accrued income that we have not yet received in cash. 
    
  Pre-incentive fee net investment income does not include any realized gains, realized losses, unrealized capital appreciation or unrealized capital depreciation. Because of the structure of the incentive fee, it is possible that we may pay an incentive fee in a quarter where we incur a loss. For example, if we receive pre-incentive fee net investment income in excess of the hurdle rate (as defined below) for a quarter, we will pay the applicable incentive fee even if we have incurred a loss in that quarter due to realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation. 
    
  Pre-incentive fee net investment income, expressed as a rate of return on the value of our net assets (defined as total assets less indebtedness and before taking into account any incentive fees payable during the period) at the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter, is compared to a fixed  hurdle rate  of 2.0% per quarter. If market interest rates rise, we may be able to invest our funds in debt instruments that provide for a higher return, which would increase our pre-incentive fee net investment income and make it easier for OFS Advisor to surpass the fixed hurdle rate and receive an incentive fee based on such net investment income. There is no accumulation of amounts on the hurdle rate from quarter to quarter and accordingly there is no clawback of amounts previously paid if subsequent quarters are below the quarterly hurdle rate, and there is no delay of payment if prior quarters are below the quarterly hurdle rate. Pre-incentive fee net investment income fees are prorated for any partial quarter based on the number of days in such quarter. 
    
  We pay OFS Advisor an incentive fee with respect to our pre-incentive fee net investment income in each calendar quarter as follows: 
             
    No incentive fee in any calendar quarter in which the pre-incentive fee net investment income does not exceed the hurdle rate; 
                
    100% of our pre-incentive fee net investment income with respect to that portion of such pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than 2.5% in any calendar quarter. We refer to this portion of our pre-incentive fee net investment income (which exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than 2.5%) as the  catch-up  provision. The catch-up is meant to provide OFS Advisor with 20.0% of the pre-incentive fee net investment income as if a hurdle rate did not apply if this pre-incentive fee net investment income exceeds 2.5% in any calendar quarter; and 
                
    20.0% of the amount of our pre-incentive fee net investment income, if any, that exceeds 2.5% in any calendar quarter. 
          
  The second part (part two) of the incentive fee (the  Capital Gains Fee ) is determined and payable in arrears as of the end of each calendar year (or upon termination of the Investment Advisory Agreement, as of the termination date) and is calculated at the end of each applicable year by subtracting (a) the sum of our cumulative aggregate realized capital losses and our aggregate unrealized capital depreciation from (b) our cumulative aggregate realized capital gains. If such amount is positive at the end of such year, then the Capital Gains Fee for such year is equal to 20.0% of such amount, less the aggregate amount of Capital Gains Fees paid in all prior years. If such amount is negative, then there is no Capital Gains Fee for such year. 

51 

The cumulative aggregate realized capital gains are calculated as the sum of the differences, if positive, between (a) the net sales price of each investment in our portfolio when sold and (b) the accreted or amortized cost basis of such investment. 
    
  The cumulative aggregate realized capital losses are calculated as the sum of the amounts by which (a) the net sales price of each investment in our portfolio when sold is less than (b) the accreted or amortized cost basis of such investment. 
    
  The aggregate unrealized capital depreciation is calculated as the sum of the differences, if negative, between (a) the valuation of each investment in our portfolio as of the applicable Capital Gains Fee calculation date and (b) the accreted or amortized cost basis of such investment. Unrealized capital appreciation is accrued, but not paid until said appreciation is realized. 
    
  We will accrue the Capital Gains Fee if, on a cumulative basis, the sum of net realized capital gains and (losses) plus net unrealized appreciation and (depreciation) is positive. OFS Advisor has excluded from the Capital Gains Fee calculation any realized gain with respect to the step acquisitions resulting from the SBIC Acquisition. The Capital Gains Fee for any partial year is prorated based on the number of days in such year. 
    
  We incurred incentive fee expense of   $0.8 million   and   $2.4 million   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively. Incentive fees for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , consisted of part one incentive fees (based on net investment income) of   $0.8 million   and   $2.5 million  , respectively. The part two incentive fee (based on net realized and unrealized gains and losses, or capital gains) for   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was   $0   and    $(0.1) million   which represents the reversal of the part two incentive fee accrued at December 31, 2015. Incentive fees were   $0.9 million   and   $1.5 million   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively, which consisted entirely of the part one incentive fee. 
    
  License Agreement 
    
  We have entered into a license agreement with OFSAM under which OFSAM has agreed to grant us a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use the name  OFS.  
    
  Administration Agreement 
    
  Pursuant to an Administration Agreement, OFS Services furnishes us with office facilities and equipment, necessary software licenses and subscriptions and clerical, bookkeeping and record keeping services at such facilities. Under the Administration Agreement, OFS Services performs, or oversees the performance of, our required administrative services, which include being responsible for the financial records that we are required to maintain and preparing reports to our shareholders and all other reports and materials required to be filed with the SEC or any other regulatory authority. In addition, OFS Services assists us in determining and publishing our net asset value, oversees the preparation and filing of our tax returns and the printing and dissemination of reports to our shareholders, and generally oversees the payment of our expenses and the performance of administrative and professional services rendered to us by others. Under the Administration Agreement, OFS Services would provide managerial assistance on our behalf to certain portfolio companies that accept our offer to provide such assistance. Payments under the Administration Agreement are equal to an amount based upon our allocable portion (subject to the review and approval of our board of directors) of OFS Services  overhead in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement, including rent, information technology, and our allocable portion of the cost of our officers, including our chief executive officer, chief financial officer, chief compliance officer, chief accounting officer, and corporate secretary, and their respective staffs. The Administration Agreement may be renewed annually with the approval of our board of directors who are not  interested persons.  The Administration Agreement may be terminated by either party without penalty upon 60 days  written notice to the other party. To the extent that OFS Services outsources any of its functions we pay the fees associated with such functions at cost on direct basis to OFS Services. 
    
  For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we incurred administration fee expense of   $0.3 million   and   $1.0 million  , respectively. For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , we incurred administration fee expense of   $0.3 million   and   $1.1 million  , respectively. 
    
  Staffing Agreement 
    
  We do not have any internal management capacity or employees. We depend on the diligence, skill and network of business contacts of the OFS senior professionals to achieve our investment objective. OFS Advisor is a subsidiary of OFSAM and depends upon access to the investment professionals and other resources of OFSAM and its affiliates to fulfill its  
  
   52 

obligations to us under the Investment Advisory Agreement. OFS Advisor also depends upon OFSAM to obtain access to deal flow generated by the professionals of OFSAM and its affiliates. Under the Staffing Agreement between Orchard First Source Capital, Inc. ( OFSC ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of OFSAM, and OFS Advisor, OFSC provides OFS Advisor with the resources necessary to fulfill these obligations. The Staffing Agreement provides that OFSC make available to OFS Advisor experienced investment professionals and access to the senior investment personnel of OFSC for purposes of evaluating, negotiating, structuring, closing and monitoring our investments. The Staffing Agreement also includes a commitment that the members of the Advisor Investment Committee serve in such capacity (including Mr. Ressler, who is currently the Chairman of the Advisor Investment Committee). 
    
  The Staffing Agreement is renewable by the parties thereto on an annual basis. Services under the Staffing Agreement are provided to OFS Advisor on a direct cost reimbursement basis, and such fees are not our obligation. 
    
  OFSC also has entered into a staffing and corporate services agreement with OFS Services. Under this agreement, OFSC makes available to OFS Services experienced investment professionals and access to the administrative resources of OFS Services. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
    
  The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and revenues and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. Critical accounting policies are those that require management to make subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Changes that may be required in the underlying assumptions or estimates in these areas could have a material impact on our current and future financial condition and results of operations. 
    
  Our critical accounting policies and estimates are those relating to fair value estimates and revenue recognition. Management has discussed the development and selection of each critical accounting policy and estimate with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. 
    
  Fair value estimates.   As of   September 30, 2016  , approximately   89%   of our total assets were carried on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value. As discussed more fully in  Item 1 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 3  GAAP requires us to categorize financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value according to a three-level valuation hierarchy. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted, active market prices for identical assets and liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to valuation techniques that require significant management judgment because one or more of the significant inputs are unobservable in the market place (Level 3). All of our assets carried at fair value are classified as Level 3; we typically do not hold equity securities or other instruments that are actively traded on an exchange. 
    
  As described in  Item 1 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Note 7 , we follow a process, under the supervision and review of the Board, to determine these unobservable inputs used to calculate the fair values of our investments. The most significant unobservable inputs in these fair value measurements are the discount rates, EBITDA multiples, and projected cash flows to us, either as contractually due from the investment or from disposition of the investment in an assumed exit transaction. 
    
  We consider a variety of factors in our determination of the discount rate to be applied to an investment including, among other things, investment type, LIBOR swap rate, indicative yields from independent third-party sources and the yield on our investment relative to indicative yields at the time of our investment (initial and subsequent investments) in the portfolio company. 
    
  We also consider a variety of factors in our determination of the EBITDA multiple to be applied to an investment including, among other things, the actual EBITDA multiple for the last arms-length transaction, and the ratio of the portfolio company s EBITDA multiple to the average of EBITDA multiples on comparable public companies. 
    
  For both the discount rate and the EBITDA multiple we also consider developments at the portfolio company since our investment including, but not limited to, trends in the portfolio company s earnings and leverage multiple, and input from our independent third-party valuation firms. This process typically results in a single selected discount rate and/or EBITDA multiple for each investment.  

53 

The following table illustrates the sensitivity of our fair value measures to variations of plus or minus 10% and plus or minus 20% to the estimated values for the unobservable discount rate and EBITDA multiple inputs, respectively, at   September 30, 2016  : 

This table presents the impact to our fair value accounting measures by uniformly modifying our discount rate and EBITDA multiple valuation inputs. These tables do not present the estimated effect of hypothetical changes in actual, observed interest rates, which would affect the cash flows from many of the underlying investments as they are indexed to LIBOR or the Prime Rate of interest, the operating environment of many of our portfolio companies, observed EBITDA multiples on comparable investments, and many other factors, as well as our estimates of the discount rate and EBITDA multiple valuation inputs. The effect of hypothetical changes in actual, observed interest rates on our fair value measures is not subject to reasonable estimation. 
    
     Revenue Recognition  . Our revenue recognition policies are as follows: 
    
  Interest Income:   Interest income is recorded on an accrual basis. Recognized interest income, if payable monthly or quarterly, is reported as interest receivable until collected. Recognized interest income due at maturity or at another stipulated date ( PIK interest ) is recorded as an adjustment to the cost basis of the investment. We accrue interest income until events occur that place a loan into a non-accrual status (see below). Loan origination fees, original issue discount ( OID ), market discount or premium, and loan amendment fees (collectively,  Net Loan Fees ) are capitalized, and we accrete or amortize such amounts as additional interest income over the life of the loan using a method that approximates the effective interest method. Unamortized Net Loan Fees are recorded as an adjustment to the cost basis of the investment.  When we receive a loan principal payment, the unamortized Net Loan Fees related to the paid principal is accelerated and recognized in interest income. All other interest income is recognized as contractually earned. Further, in connection with our debt investments, we may receive warrants or similar equity-related securities ( Warrants ). We determine the cost basis of Warrants based upon their fair values on the date of receipt relative to the total fair value of the debt and Warrants received. Any resulting difference between the face amount of the debt and its recorded cost resulting from the assignment of value to the Warrants is treated as OID, and accreted into interest income as described above. To maintain our status as a RIC, we include non-cash interest income in the determination of distributable income.  
    
  Dividend Income:   Dividend income on common stock, generally payable in cash, is recorded at the time dividends are declared. Dividend income on preferred equity securities is accrued as earned. Dividends on preferred equity securities may be payable in cash or in additional preferred securities, and are generally not payable unless declared or upon liquidation. Declared dividends payable in cash are reported as dividend receivables until collected. Dividends payable in additional preferred securities or contractually earned but not declared ( PIK dividends ) are recorded as an adjustment to the cost basis of the investment. We discontinue accrual of dividends on preferred equity securities when we determine that the dividend may not be collectible. We assess the collectability of the preferred dividends based on factors including the fair value of the preferred equity security, the valuation of the portfolio company s enterprise value, and proceeds expected to be received over the life of the investment. Distributions received from common or preferred equity securities that do not qualify as dividend income are recorded as return of capital and a reduction in the cost basis of the investment. In addition, we may receive cash distributions from portfolio companies that are taxed as flow-through entities. Each distribution is evaluated to determine whether it should be recorded as income or as a return of capital. Distributions classified as a return of capital are recorded as reductions in the cost basis of the investments. 
    
  Fee Income:   We generate revenue in the form of management, valuation, and other contractual fees, which is recognized as the related services are rendered. In the general course of our business, we receive certain fees from our portfolio  
  
   54 

companies, which are non-recurring in nature. Such fees include prepayment fees on certain loans repaid prior to their scheduled due date, which are recognized when received, and fees for capital structuring services from certain portfolio companies, which are recognized upon closing of the investment. 
    
  Net Realized and Unrealized Gain or Loss on Investments:   Investment transactions are reported on a trade-date basis. Realized gains or losses on investments are measured by the difference between the net proceeds from the disposition and the cost basis of the investment, without regard to unrealized gains or losses as of the date of disposition. Investments are reported at fair value as determined by our Board. After recording all appropriate interest, dividend, and other income, some of which is recorded as an adjustment to the cost basis of the investment as described above, we report changes in the fair value of investments as a component of the net changes in unrealized appreciation/depreciation on investments in the consolidated statements of operations. 
     
  Non-accrual loans:   Loans on which the accrual of interest income has been discontinued are designated as non-accrual loans and accounted for on a non-accrual cash method. Loans are generally placed on non-accrual status when a loan either: (i) is delinquent for 90 days or more on principal or interest according to contractual terms of the loan (unless well secured and in the process of collection), or (ii) in the opinion of management, there is reasonable doubt about its collectability. When loans are placed on non-accrual status, all interest previously accrued but not collected interest, other than PIK interest that has been contractually added to the principal balance prior to the designation date, is reversed against current period interest income. Interest payments subsequently received on non-accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management s judgment. Interest accruals are resumed on non-accrual loans only when they are brought current with respect to interest and principal and when, in the judgment of management, the loans are estimated to be fully collectible as to all principal and interest. 

Portfolio Composition and Investment Activity 
    
  Portfolio Composition 
    
  The total fair value of our investments was   $259.2 million   and   $257.3 million   at   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. Our investment portfolio as of   September 30, 2016  , consisted of outstanding loans to   37   portfolio companies, totaling approximately   $230.9 million   in aggregate principal amount, of which   77%   were senior secured loans and   23%   were subordinated loans, and approximately   $32.7 million   were equity investments, at fair value, in   16   portfolio companies in which we also held debt investments and   one   portfolio company in which we solely held an equity investment. Our investment portfolio encompassed a broad range of geographical regions within the United States and industries. We had unfunded commitments of   $2.6 million   to   three   portfolio companies and   $3.8 million   to   three   portfolio companies at   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. Set forth in the tables below is selected information with respect to our portfolio as of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  .

The following table provides a breakdown of our debt investment portfolio by yield to fair value as of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  . 

The weighted average yield to fair value of our debt investment portfolio was   11.88%   and 12.01% at   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The weighted average yield on debt investments at fair value is computed as (a) total annual stated interest on accruing loans excluding default interest plus the annualized accretion of deferred Net Loan Fees divided by (b) total debt investments at fair value excluding assets on non-accrual basis. The weighted average yield on debt investments at fair value is computed as of the balance sheet date. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , floating rate loans comprised   66%   and 59% of our debt investment portfolio, respectively, and fixed rate loans comprised   34%   and 41% of our debt investment portfolio, respectively, as a percent of fair value.

During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we converted $1.8 million in principal of a subordinated debt investment into preferred equity units and warrants valued at $1.8 million and converted $0.3 million in principal of a senior secured debt investment into preferred equity units valued at $0.3 million. In addition, we amended a senior secured debt investment for which we received preferred equity units in the same portfolio company valued at $0.2 million. 
    
  Our level of investment activity may vary substantially from period to period depending on various factors, including, but not limited to, the amount of debt and equity capital available to middle-market companies, the level of merger and acquisition activity, the general economic environment and the competitive environment for the types of investments we make. 
    
  Portfolio Credit Ratings 
    
  We categorize debt investments into seven risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt. 
    
  1 (Low Risk)   A risk rated 1, or Low Risk, credit is a credit that has most satisfactory asset quality and liquidity, as well as good leverage capacity. It maintains predictable and strong cash flows from operations. The trends and outlook for the credit s operations, balance sheet, and industry are neutral to favorable. Collateral, if appropriate, has maintained value and would be capable of being liquidated on a timely basis. Overall, a 1 rated credit would be considered to be of investment grade quality. 
    
  2 (Below Average Risk)   A risk rated 2, or Below Average Risk, credit is a credit that has acceptable asset quality, moderate excess liquidity, and modest leverage capacity. It could have some financial/non-financial weaknesses that are offset by strengths; however, the credit demonstrates an ample current cash flow from operations. The trends and outlook for the credit s operations, balance sheet, and industry are generally positive or neutral to somewhat negative. Collateral, if appropriate, has maintained value and would be capable of being liquidated successfully on a timely basis. 
    
  3 (Average)   A risk rated 3, or Average, credit is a credit that has acceptable asset quality, somewhat strained liquidity, and minimal leverage capacity. It is at times characterized by just acceptable cash flows from operations. Under adverse market conditions, carrying the current debt service could pose difficulties for the borrower. The trends and conditions of the credit s operations and balance sheet are neutral to slightly negative. 
    
  4 (Special Mention)   A risk rated 4, or Special Mention, credit is a credit with no apparent loss of principal or interest envisioned. Nonetheless, it possesses credit deficiencies or potential weaknesses that deserve management s close and continued attention. The credit s operations and/or balance sheet have demonstrated an adverse trend or deterioration that, while serious, has not reached the point where the liquidation of debt is jeopardized. These weaknesses are generally considered correctable by the borrower in the normal course of business but may, if not checked or corrected, weaken the asset or inadequately protect our credit position. 
    
  5 (Substandard)   A risk rated 5, or Substandard, credit is a credit inadequately protected by the current enterprise value or paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral, if any. These credits have well-defined weaknesses based upon objective evidence, such as recurring or significant decreases in revenues and cash flows. These assets are characterized by the possibility that we may sustain loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. The possibility that liquidation would not be timely (e.g. bankruptcy or foreclosure) requires a Substandard classification even if there is little likelihood of loss. 
    
  6 (Doubtful)   A risk rated 6, or Doubtful, credit is a credit with all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as Substandard, with the additional factor that the weaknesses are pronounced to the point that collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values is deemed uncertain. The possibility of loss on a Doubtful asset is high but, because of certain important and reasonably specific pending factors that may strengthen the asset, its classification as an estimated loss is deferred until its more exact status can be determined. 
    
  7 (Loss)   A risk rated 7, or Loss, credit is a credit considered almost fully uncollectible and of such little value that its continuance as an asset is not warranted. It is generally a credit that is no longer supported by an operating company, a credit where the majority of our assets have been liquidated or sold and a few assets remain to be sold over many months or even years, or a credit where the remaining collections are expected to be minimal. 
    
  The following table shows the classification of our debt investments portfolio by credit rating as of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015   (dollar amounts in thousands): 

59 

At   September 30, 2016  , we had   one   non-accrual loan (Community Intervention Services, Inc.) with a fair value of   $5.4 million  . At December 31, 2015, we had one non-accrual loan (Phoenix Brands LLC) with a fair value of   $0.8 million  . 

Results of Operations 
    
  Key Financial Measures 
    
  The following is a discussion of the key financial measures that management employs in reviewing the performance of our operations. 
    
  Revenues  . We generate revenue in the form of interest income on debt investments, capital gains, and dividend income from our equity investments. Our debt investments typically have a term of three to eight years and bear interest at fixed and floating rates. As of   September 30, 2016  , floating rate and fixed rate loans comprised   66%   and   34%  , respectively, of our current debt investment portfolio at fair value; however, in accordance with our investment strategy, we expect that over time the proportion of fixed rate loans will increase. In some cases, our investments will provide for deferred interest or dividend payment, PIK interest, or PIK dividend, respectively, (meaning interest or dividend paid in the form of additional principal amount of the loan or equity security instead of in cash). In addition, we may generate revenue in the form of commitment, structuring or due diligence fees, fees for providing managerial assistance and consulting fees. Loan origination fees, OID, market discount or premium, and loan amendment fees are capitalized, and we accrete or amortize such amounts over the life of the loan as interest income. When we receive principal payments on a loan in an amount that exceeds its carrying value, we will also record the excess principal payment as income. 
      
  Expenses  . Our primary operating expenses include interest expense due under our outstanding borrowings, the payment of fees to OFS Advisor under the Investment Advisory Agreement, our allocable portion of overhead expenses under the Administration Agreement and other operating costs described below. Additionally, we will pay interest expense on any outstanding debt under any new credit facility or other debt instrument we may enter into. We will bear all other out-of-pocket costs and expenses of our operations and transactions, whether incurred by us directly or on our behalf by a third party, including: 

the cost of calculating our net asset value, including the cost of any independent third-party valuation services; 
                
    the cost of effecting sales and repurchases of shares of our common stock and other securities; 
                
    fees payable to third parties relating to making investments, including out-of-pocket fees and expenses associated with performing due diligence and reviews of prospective investments; 
                
    transfer agent and custodial fees; 
                
    out-of-pocket fees and expenses associated with marketing efforts; 
                
    federal and state registration fees and any stock exchange listing fees; 
                
    U.S. federal, state and local taxes; 
                
    independent directors  fees and expenses; 
     
   60 

brokerage commissions; 
                
    fidelity bond, directors  and officers  liability insurance and other insurance premiums; 
                
    direct costs, such as printing, mailing and long-distance telephone; 
                
    fees and expenses associated with independent audits and outside legal costs; 
                
    costs associated with our reporting and compliance obligations under the 1940 Act and other applicable U.S. federal and state securities laws; and 
                
    other expenses incurred by either OFS Services or us in connection with administering our business, including payments under the Administration Agreement that will be based upon our allocable portion (subject to policies reviewed and approved by our board of directors) of overhead. 
       
  We do not believe that our historical operating performance is necessarily indicative of our future results of operations that we expect to report in future periods. We are primarily focused on investments in middle-market companies in the United States, including debt investments and, to a lesser extent, equity investments, including warrants and other minority equity securities, which differs to some degree from our historical investment concentration, in senior secured loans to middle-market companies in the United States. Moreover, as a BDC and a RIC, we will also be subject to certain constraints on our operations, including, but not limited to, limitations imposed by the 1940 Act and the Code. In addition, SBIC I LP is subject to regulation and oversight by the SBA. For the reasons described above, the results of operations described below may not necessarily be indicative of the results we expect to report in future periods. 
    
  Comparison of the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015    
    
  Consolidated operating results for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , are as follows (in thousands): 

Investment Income 
    
  Components of total investment income for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , are as follows (in thousands): 

Interest income     decreased     by     $0.1 million   for the     three months ended September 30, 2016     compared to the     three months ended September 30, 2015  .   The decrease was primarily due to a $0.2 million decrease caused by a 3% decrease in the weighted average principal balance of investments outstanding, offset by a $0.1 million increase caused by a 1% increase in our  
  
   61 

average portfolio cash yield during the three months ended September 30, 2016. Acceleration of Net Loan Fees of $0.1 million and $0.2 million were included in interest income for the     three months ended September 30, 2016     and     2015  ,   respectively.    
    
  Interest income   decreased   by   $1.4 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The decrease was primarily due to a $3.6 million decrease caused by a 18% decrease in the weighted average principal balance of investments outstanding, offset by a $2.3 million increase caused by a 14% increase in our average portfolio cash yield during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . The 18% decrease in the weighted average principal balance of investments and increase in our average portfolio cash yield was primarily a result of the WM Asset Sale which occurred on May 28, 2015. Acceleration of Net Loan Fees of $0.6 million and $0.4 million were included in interest income for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  Dividend income     decreased     by     $0.1 million     for the     three months ended September 30, 2016     compared to the     three months ended September 30, 2015  , due to a net decrease in recognized PIK dividends and timing of common stock dividends declared by our portfolio companies.    
    
  Dividend income   increased   by   $0.3 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , primarily due to an increase in preferred equity cash dividends accrued during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . Preferred equity cash dividends were $0.4 million and $0.2 million for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively, an increase primarily the result of an additional preferred equity security purchased during the second quarter of 2015. 
    
  Fee income     decreased     by     $0.2 million     for the     three months ended September 30, 2016     compared to the     three months ended September 30, 2015  , primarily due to a decrease in prepayment fees. We recorded prepayment fees of $0.2 million resulting from $17.8 million of unscheduled principal payments during the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . There were no prepayment fees recorded during the     three months ended September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Fee income   increased   by   $0.7 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , primarily due to an increase in prepayment fees. We recorded prepayment fees of $0.9 million resulting from $24.3 million of unscheduled principal payments during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . We recorded prepayment fees of $0.2 million resulting from $17.8 million of unscheduled principal payments during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .  
    
  Expenses 
    
  Consolidated expenses for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , are as follows (in thousands): 

We incur significant expenses which involve transactions with related parties, specifically management fees, the incentive fee, and the administrative fees. See  Item 2 Related Party Transactions  and  Item 1 Unaudited Financial Statements Note 5 . 
     
  Interest expense     increased     by     $0.1 million     for the     three months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to the     three months ended September 30, 2015  . The increase was primarily due to cash interest expense incurred on our SBA debentures primarily due to an increase in the weighted average interest rate when the remaining $22.6 million of our debentures pooled on September 23, 2015; our rate on that pool converted from the 1.03% short-term rate to 3.18%.    

62 

Interest expense   decreased   by   $1.7 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The decrease was primarily due to a year-over-year decrease of $0.8 million in cash interest expense on our WM Credit Facility and a $1.6 million write-off of deferred debt issuance costs, both related to our permanent reduction of the WM Credit Facility and the termination of the WM Credit Facility on May 28, 2015, offset by an increase of $0.7 million in cash interest expense incurred on our SBA debentures. Interest expense on our SBA debentures increased due to an increase in the weighted average interest rate and the weighted average debentures outstanding during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , as a result of additional debenture draws of $22.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2015, which pooled on September 23, 2015. 
    
  Management fee expense   decreased   by   $0.8 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , due to a decrease in the average total assets subject to the base management fee. 
    
  Incentive fee expense   increased   by   $0.9 million   for the    nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The increase was due to a 20% increase in pre-incentive fee net investment income for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the corresponding period in the prior year, which resulted in a $0.8 million increase in the incentive fee catch-up provision (the amount of pre-incentive fee income that exceeds the hurdle rate but is less than 2.5%) and a $0.2 million increase in the incentive fee due to the amount of pre-incentive fee income that exceeded 2.5%, partially offset by a $0.1 million decrease in the Capital Gains Fee, which represents the reversal of the accrued Capital Gains Fee at December 31, 2015. 
    
  Net Gain (Loss) on Investments 
    
  Net gain (loss) by investment type for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , are as follows (in thousands): 

Net gain (loss) on investments consists of the aggregate: (a) realized gains and losses from the sale of debt or equity securities, or the redemption of equity securities; and (b) changes in net unrealized appreciation/depreciation on debt and equity investments. In the period in which a realized gain or loss is recognized, such gain or loss will generally be offset by the reversal of previously recognized unrealized appreciation or depreciation, and the net gain recognized in that period will generally be smaller. The unrealized appreciation or depreciation on debt securities is also reversed when those investments are redeemed or paid off prior to maturity. In such instances, the reversal on unrealized appreciation or depreciation will be reported as a net loss or gain, respectively, and may be partially offset by the acceleration of  any premium or discount on the debt security in interest income and any prepayment fees on the debt security in fee income.    
    
  Three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016    
    
  We recognized     net losses     of     $0.4 million     on senior secured debt during the     three months ended September 30, 2016  ,   primarily as a result of the net impact of company-specific performance factors, offset by the impact of changes to certain market loan indices, and the impact of certain investments moving closer to their expected exit events.    
    
  We recognized   net gains   of   $0.9 million   on senior secured debt during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , primarily as a result of the impact of changes to certain market loan indices, and by the impact of portfolio company-specific performance factors, partially offset by the pay-off of certain senior secured debt investments. 
    
  We recognized     net losses     of     $0.2 million     on subordinated debt during the     three months ended September 30, 2016  , principally as a result of the net impact of portfolio company-specific performance factors.

We recognized   net losses   of   $0.3 million   on subordinated debt during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , principally due to the pay-off of certain subordinated debt investments, offset by the net impact of portfolio company-specific performance factors.  
    
  We recognized   net losses   of     $0.3 million   on equity investments for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , primarily attributable to the net impact of portfolio company-specific performance factors, offset primarily by the impact of certain investments moving closer to their expected exit events.    
    
  We recognized   net losses   of   $2.0 million   on equity investments for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , primarily due to the net impact of portfolio company-specific performance factors and the net impact of certain investments moving closer to their expected exit events. In addition, we realized gains of $2.6 million from the redemption of an equity investment. We held this investment from the first quarter of 2014 and recognized unrealized gains of $2.1 million and $0.5 during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. There was no net gain during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, on this transaction. 
    
  Three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015 
    
  We recognized   net losses   of   $1.6 million    on senior secured debt for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , primarily as a result of changes to certain market loan indices and the impact of portfolio-specific performance factors on our valuations. 
    
  We recognized   net losses   of   $1.0 million   on senior secured debt for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , primarily as a result of the net impact of of changes to certain market loan indices and by the net impact of certain investments moving closer to their expected exit events, partially offset by the pay-off of certain senior secured debt investments, including the WM Asset Sale.  
    
  We recognized   net losses   of   $0.7 million   on subordinated debt for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  , primarily as a result of the net impact of certain investments moving closer to their expected exit events. 
    
  We recognized   net losses   of   $0.3 million   on subordinated debt for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , primarily as a result of the net impact of certain investments moving closer to their expected exit events. 
    
  We recognized   net gains   of   $0.1 million   on equity investments for the   three months ended September 30, 2015   primarily as a result of the net impact of certain investments moving closer to their expected exit events, offset by the impact of portfolio company-specific performance factors. 
    
  We recognized   net gains   of   $4.3 million   on equity investments for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015    primarily attributable to the impact of portfolio company-specific factors, the net impact of exit-event assumptions on our valuations and a net gain of $0.9 million from the sale of an equity investment. We realized a $1.4 million gain on the sale of the equity investment, offset by the reversal of previously recognized unrealized gains from the date we held this investment, which includes recognized unrealized gains of $0.5 during the year ended December 31, 2014.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  Sources and Uses of Cash and Cash Equivalents 
    
  We generate cash through operations from net investment income and the net liquidation of portfolio investments, and use cash in our operations in the net purchase of portfolio investments. We must distribute substantially all our ICTI which approximates, but will not always equal, the cash we generate from net investment income to maintain our RIC status. We will not make a final determination regarding the tax character of our distributions until January 2017, however if the tax characteristics of the distributions paid during 2016 were determined as of   September 30, 2016  , we estimate that approximately   $1.4 million   would represent a return of capital. We have no history of net taxable gains, but in the first quarter of 2016 we effectively exhausted our net capital loss carryforward. We also obtain and use cash in the net borrowing of funds from the SBA and commercial sources of debt. These principal sources and uses of cash and liquidity are presented below (in thousands): 

At   September 30, 2016  , we held cash and cash equivalents of   $28.0 million  , a   decrease   of   $4.7 million   from   December 31, 2015  . During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , net purchases of portfolio investments were primarily due to   $2.1 million   of cash collected from the redemption of a warrant investment and   $37.1 million   of cash we received from principal payments on our portfolio investments. These cash receipts were offset by   $40.2 million   of cash we used to purchase portfolio investments. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , net sales and repayments of portfolio investments were primarily due to   $61.9 million   of cash we received from principal payments on our portfolio investments, cash collections of   $97.7 million   from the sale of our portfolio investments, including $7.2 million of cash collection from an investment we sold in December 2014, $67.3 million from the WM Asset Sale, and   $4.4 million   from the sale of our equity interests in two portfolio companies. These cash receipts were offset by   $78.6 million   of cash we used to purchase portfolio investments. 
    
  Net cash from net investment income was   $6.0 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , or   $2.0 million     less than   the corresponding period in   2015  . The decline in cash collected from net investment income was principally due to higher management and incentive fees paid. Cash used to pay incentive fees during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , were $1.4 million greater than the corresponding period in 2015 due to an increase in our pre-incentive fee net investment income in the fourth quarter of 2015 and the first and second quarter of 2016 which were paid during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . Cash used to pay base management fees during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , were $0.2 million greater than the corresponding period in 2015 primarily due to adjustments in the base management fee rate on January 1, 2015, which lead to a $0.9 million increase in cash paid for management fees during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, that was offset by a reduction of $0.7 million in management fees paid during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, due to a decrease in the average fair value of our investment portfolio, primarily as a result of the WM Asset Sale in the second quarter of 2015 and subsequent increase in cash and cash equivalents which are not subject to the management fee.  
    
  Cash paid for interest   increased     $0.1 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the corresponding period in 2015, due to higher payments on a SBA debentures, partially offset by lower payments on the WM Credit Facility. We are required to make interest payments on our SBA debentures semi-annually in March and September through maturity. The weighted average outstanding balance on our SBA debentures, excluding debt issuance costs, increased from $141.6 million for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , to $149.9 million for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . Additionally, during the first and second quarter of 2015, $65.9 million and $22.6 million, respectively, of the weighted average outstanding balance for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , carried interest at a lower pre-pooling, short-term rate. Consequently, we paid cash interest of $4.7 million on our SBA debentures for   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to $3.2 million for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . This increase was partially offset by a decline in cash paid for interest on our WM Credit Facility from $1.4 million in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   to $0 in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, due to the retirement of that facility. 
  
   65 

The net increase in cash paid for management fees, incentive fees and interest for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , over the comparable period in 2015 were offset by an increase in investment income collected, which was the result of greater fees and cash dividends collected. 
    
  Net repayment of borrowings of   $50.0 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   was primarily attributable to $22.0 million of draws from our SBA debentures (net of the fees), offset by $72.6 million of net repayments on the WM Credit Facility. 
    
  SBA Debentures 
    
  SBIC I LP has a SBIC license that allows it to obtain leverage by issuing SBA-guaranteed debentures, subject to issuance of a capital commitment by the SBA and customary procedures. These debentures are non-recourse to us, and bear interest payable semi-annually, and each debenture has a maturity date that is ten years following issuance. The interest rate is fixed at the time of SBA pooling, which is March and September of each year, at a market-driven spread over U.S. Treasury Notes with ten-year maturities. SBA regulations currently limit the amount that an SBIC may borrow to up to a maximum of $150 million when it has at least $75 million in regulatory capital, receives a leverage commitment from the SBA and has been through an examination by the SBA subsequent to licensing. For two or more SBICs under common control, the maximum amount of outstanding SBA-provided leverage cannot exceed $350 million. As of   September 30, 2016  , SBIC I LP had fully drawn the $149.9 million of leverage commitments from the SBA. The SBA debentures do not amortize and are due in full at maturity between September 2022 and September 2025. 
    
  In January 2015, we filed an application with the SBA for a second SBIC license, which, if approved, would provide up to $75.0 million in additional SBA debentures for the funding of our future investments upon our contribution of at least $37.5 million in additional regulatory capital and subject to the issuance of a leverage commitment by the SBA and other customary procedures. There can be no assurance as to whether or when this application will be approved by the SBA. 
    
  SBIC I LP is periodically examined and audited by the SBA s staff to determine its compliance with SBA regulations. If SBIC I LP fails to comply with applicable SBA regulations, the SBA could, depending on the severity of the violation, limit or prohibit SBIC I LP s use of debentures, declare outstanding debentures immediately due and payable, and/or limit SBIC I LP from making new investments. In addition, SBIC I LP may also be limited in its ability to make distributions to us if it does not have sufficient capital in accordance with SBA regulations. Such actions by the SBA would in turn, negatively affect us. 
    
  PWB Credit Facility 
    
  On November 5, 2015, we, as borrower, entered into a Business Loan Agreement ( BLA ) with Pacific Western Bank, as lender, to provide us with a $15.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility ( PWB Credit Facility ) for general corporate purposes, including investment funding. The maximum availability under the PWB Credit Facility is equal to 50% of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of eligible loans included in the borrowing base and otherwise specified in the BLA. The PWB Credit Facility is guaranteed by OFS Capital WM and secured by all of our current and future assets excluding assets held by SBIC I LP and our SBIC I LP and SBIC I GP partnership interests. On a stand-alone basis, SBIC I LP held approximately   $242.0 million   and $245.1 million in assets at   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, respectively, which accounted for approximately   83%   of our total consolidated assets at   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015. The PWB Credit Facility matures on November 6, 2017. Advances under the facility will bear interest at a fixed rate per annum equal to 4.75%. There have been no advances under the facility as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  The BLA contains customary terms and conditions, including, without limitation, affirmative and negative covenants such as information reporting requirements, a minimum tangible net asset value, a minimum quarterly net investment income after incentive fees, and a statutory asset coverage test. The BLA also contains customary events of default, including, without limitation, nonpayment, misrepresentation of representations and warranties in a material respect, breach of covenant, cross-default to other indebtedness, bankruptcy, change in investment advisor, and the occurrence of a material adverse change in our financial condition. 
    
  On October 31, 2016, the BLA was amended to, among other things (i) increase the maximum amount available under the PWB Credit Facility from $15 million to $25 million, (ii) extend the maturity date from November 6, 2017 to October 31, 2018, (iii) increase the fixed interest rate from 4.75% to 5.00% per annum, and (iv) exclude subordinated loan investments (as defined in the BLA) from the borrowing base. In connection with the amendment the Company incurred debt issuance costs of $175 and will incur an unused commitment fee, payable monthly in arrears, equal to 0.50% per annum on any unused portion  
  
   66 

of the PWB Credit Facility in excess of $15 million. See "Item 5 - Other Information - Amendments to Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility." 
    
  WM Asset Sale and Related Transactions. 
    
  On May 28, 2015, we and OFS Capital WM entered into a Loan Portfolio Purchase Agreement with Madison pursuant to which we sold a portfolio of 20 senior secured debt investments with an aggregate principal balance of approximately $67.8 million as of May 28, 2015 to Madison. Madison is an affiliated entity of MCF Capital Management, LLC ( MCF ), which was the loan manager for OFS Capital WM prior to the WM Asset Sale under a Loan and Security Agreement among OFS Capital WM, MCF, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, each of the Lenders from time to time party thereto, and Wells Fargo Delaware Trust Company, N.A. (the  Loan and Security Agreement ). 
    
  As a result of the WM Asset Sale, we received cash proceeds of approximately $67.3 million. On May 28, 2015, the total fair value of the debt investments sold, applying our March 31, 2015 fair value percentages to the principal balances of the respective investments on the sale date, was approximately $66.7 million. The determination of the fair value of our investments is subject to the good faith determination by our board of directors, which is conducted no less frequently than quarterly, pursuant to our valuation policies and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. 
    
  On May 28, 2015, pursuant to the Loan and Security Agreement, we applied approximately $52.4 million from the sale proceeds of the WM Asset Sale to pay in full and retire OFS Capital WM s secured revolving credit facility with the WM Credit Facility.  As a result of the termination of the WM Credit Facility, we wrote-off the remaining related unamortized deferred financing closing costs of $1.2 million on the revolving line of credit. 
    
  In connection with the WM Asset Sale, on May 28, 2015, we entered into a Loan Administration Services Agreement with Madison pursuant to which Madison will provide loan servicing and other administrative services to OFS Capital WM with respect to the remaining loan assets. In return for its loan administration services, Madison will receive a quarterly loan administration fee of 0.25% per annum based on the average daily principal balances of the loan assets for such quarter. 
    
  Other Liquidity Matters 
    
  We expect to fund the growth of our investment portfolio utilizing borrowings under SBA debentures, future equity offerings, and issuances of senior securities or future borrowings to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act. We cannot assure shareholders that our plans to raise capital will be successful. In addition, we intend to distribute to our shareholders substantially all of our ICTI in order to satisfy the requirements applicable to RICs under Subchapter M of the Code. Consequently, we may not have the funds or the ability to fund new investments or make additional investments in our portfolio companies. The illiquidity of our portfolio investments may make it difficult for us to sell these investments when desired and, if we are required to sell these investments, we may realize significantly less than their recorded value. 
    
  In addition, as a BDC, we generally will be required to meet a coverage ratio of total assets, less liabilities and indebtedness not represented by senior securities (including SBIC I LP s SBA-guaranteed debt), to total senior securities, which include all of our borrowings (excluding SBA-guaranteed debt) and any outstanding preferred stock (of which we had none at   September 30, 2016  ), of at least 200%. We received an exemptive order from the SEC to permit us to exclude the debt of SBIC I LP guaranteed by the SBA from the definition of Senior Securities in the statutory 200% asset coverage ratio under the 1940 Act. This requirement limits the amount that we may borrow. To fund growth in our investment portfolio in the future, we anticipate needing to raise additional capital from various sources, including the equity markets and the securitization or other debt-related markets, which may or may not be available on favorable terms, if at all. 

67 

Contractual Obligations 
    
  The following table shows our contractual obligations as of   September 30, 2016   (in thousands): 

(1) 
    Excludes commitments to extend credit to our portfolio companies. 
        
  We have entered into contracts with third parties under which we have material future commitments the Investment Advisory Agreement, pursuant to which OFS Advisor has agreed to serve as our investment adviser, and the Administration Agreement, pursuant to which OFS Services has agreed to furnish us with the facilities and administrative services necessary to conduct our day-to-day operations. 
    
  Commitments and Contingencies 
    
  We had   $2.6 million   and   $3.8 million   of total unfunded commitments to   three   portfolio companies at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. See  Item 1  Unaudited Financial Statements - Note 8.  
    
  Distributions 
    
  We are taxed as a RIC under the Code. Generally, a RIC is entitled to deduct dividends it pays to its shareholders from its ICTI to determine taxable income. ICTI includes our taxable interest, dividend and fee income, and taxable net capital gains. ICTI generally differs from net income for financial reporting purposes due to temporary and permanent differences in the recognition of income and expenses, and generally excludes net unrealized appreciation or depreciation, as gains or losses are not included in ICTI until they are realized. In addition, gains realized for financial reporting purposes may differ from gains included in ICTI as a result of our election to recognize gains using installment sale treatment, which generally results in the deferment of gains for tax purposes until notes or other amounts, including amounts held in escrow, received as consideration from the sale of investments are collected in cash. ICTI includes non-cash income, such as changes in accrued and reinvested interest and dividends, which includes contractual PIK interest, and the amortization of discounts and fees and reduced by non-cash expenses, such as realized losses and depreciation, and amortization expense. Cash collections of income resulting from contractual PIK interest and dividends or the amortization of discounts and fees generally occur upon the repayment of the loans or debt securities that include such items.  
    
  Our board of directors maintains a variable distribution policy with the objective of distributing four quarterly distributions in an amount not less than 90-100% of our taxable quarterly income or potential annual income for a particular year. In addition, at the end of the year, we may also pay an additional special distribution, or fifth distribution, such that we may distribute approximately all of our ICTI in the year it was earned, while maintaining the option to spill over our excess ICTI to a following year. 

68 

The following table summarizes our inception to date distributions declared and paid on all shares (total amount in thousands): 

(1) 
    Represents the distributions declared in the specified quarter, which, if prorated for the number of days remaining in the fourth quarter after the IPO in November 2012, would have been $0.34 per share. 
              (2) 
    The determination of the tax attributes of our distributions is made annually as of the end of our fiscal year based upon our ICTI for the full year and distributions paid for the full year. If the tax characteristics of the distributions paid during fiscal   2016   were determined as of   September 30, 2016  , we estimate that approximately   $0.15   would represent a return of capital. The return of capital portion of each distribution paid during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 (which includes the distribution declared on November 26, 2012) was $0.23, $0.72, and $0.40, respectively. 
       
  Available cash to make distributions could be impacted by, among other things, SBA regulations. Furthermore, we may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to make distributions at a specific level or to increase the amount of these distributions from time to time. If we do not distribute a certain percentage of our income annually, we will suffer adverse tax consequences, including possible loss of our status as a RIC. We cannot assure shareholders that they will receive any distributions at a particular level. 
    
  Distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits are reported as return of capital; the tax treatment to the shareholder will depend on a variety of factors including the shareholder s tax basis in our shares. The determination of the tax attributes of our distributions is made annually as of the end of our fiscal year based upon our ICTI for the full year and distributions paid for the full year; therefore, a determination made on a quarterly basis may not be representative of the tax attributes of our annual distributions to shareholders. For distributions paid during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , out of the approximately   $9.9 million   distribution, approximately   86%   and   14%   represented ordinary income and a return of capital, respectively. 
    
  Each year a statement on Form 1099-DIV identifying the source of the distribution (i.e., paid from ordinary income, paid from net capital gains on the sale of securities, and/or a return of paid-in-capital surplus, which is a nontaxable distribution) is mailed to our U.S. shareholders. To the extent our taxable earnings fall below the total amount of our distributions for that fiscal year, a portion of those distributions may be deemed a taxable return of capital to our shareholders. 
  
   69 

We maintain an  opt-out  distribution reinvestment plan for our common shareholders. As a result, if we declare a distribution, cash distributions are automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock unless the shareholder specifically  opts out  of the distribution reinvestment plan and chooses to receive cash distributions. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
    
  We are subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates. As of   September 30, 2016  ,   66%   of our debt investments bore interest at floating interest rates and   34%   of our debt investments bore fixed interest rates, at fair value. The interest rates on our debt investments bearing floating interest rates are usually based on a floating LIBOR, and the debt investments typically contain interest rate re-set provisions that adjust applicable interest rates to current rates on a periodic basis. Substantially all of the debt investments bearing floating interest rates in our portfolio as of   September 30, 2016   had interest rate floors, which have effectively converted those debt investments to fixed rate debt investments in the current interest rate environment. 
    
  Our current long-term debt bears interest at a fixed rate. We expect that other credit facilities into which we may enter in the future may have floating interest rate provisions. 
    
  Assuming that the interim and unaudited consolidated balance sheet as of   September 30, 2016   were to remain constant and that we took no actions to alter our existing interest rate sensitivity, the following table shows the annualized impact of hypothetical base rate changes in interest rates (in thousands). 

(1) 
    A decline in interest rates would not have a material impact on our net investment income. 
       
  Although we believe that the foregoing analysis is indicative of our sensitivity to interest rate changes as of   September 30, 2016  , it does not adjust for potential changes in the credit market, credit quality, size and composition of the assets in our portfolio, and other business developments, including borrowings under our credit facility, that could affect net increase in net assets resulting from operations, or net income. Accordingly, no assurances can be given that actual results would not differ materially from the statement above. 
    
  We are subject to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates. Changes in interest rates affect both our cost of funding and the valuation of our investment portfolio. Our risk management systems and procedures are designed to identify and analyze our risk, to set appropriate policies and limits and to continually monitor these risks and limits by means of reliable administrative and information systems and other policies and programs. Our investment portfolio and investment income may be affected by changes in various interest rates, including LIBOR and prime rates. 

I  tem 4. Controls and Procedures 
    
  Controls and Procedures 
    
  The Company s management, with the participation of the Company s chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of   September 30, 2016  . The term  disclosure controls and procedures,  as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms.  Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
  
   70 

Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of   September 30, 2016  , the Company s chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of such date, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 
    
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
    
  As previously disclosed in Item 9A of our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, management concluded that there was a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting related to the reconciliation of the components of distributions in the statement of changes in net assets and net assets within the balance sheet. In response to the material weakness identified, management developed and implemented a remediation plan to address the underlying causes of the material weakness. 
    
  The remediation plan included the development and formal documentation of policies and procedures related to our account reconciliation process for components of net assets and distributions, which was enhanced (1) to ensure the proper reclassification entries are recorded to account for the tax character of, and basis differences between tax and GAAP and (2) to ensure the beginning   of the quarter and normal, recurring elements of changes in net assets appropriate to the account, equal the reconciled balance at the end of the quarter   for components of net assets and distributions. 
    
  During the six months ended June 30, 2016, we implemented the new internal control procedures described above to address the previously identified material weakness as of December 31, 2015. After completing our testing of the design and operating effectiveness of our control enhancements, we concluded that we have remediated the previously identified material weakness as of June 30, 2016. 
    
  There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
    
  We, OFS Advisor and OFS Services, are not currently subject to any material pending legal proceedings threatened against us as of   September 30, 2016  . From time to time, we may be a party to certain legal proceedings incidental to the normal course of our business including the enforcement of our rights under contracts with our portfolio companies. Furthermore, third parties may try to seek to impose liability on us in connection with the activities of our portfolio companies. While the outcome of these legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, we do not expect that these proceedings will have a material effect upon our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 

71 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
    
  Investing in our common stock may be speculative and involves a high degree of risk. In addition to the other information contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including our financial statements, and the related notes, schedules and exhibits, you should carefully consider the risk factors described in   Part I,  Item 1A. Risk Factors    in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, which could materially affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. The risks described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K are not the only risks facing our Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results. 
    
  There have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in   Part I,  Item 1A. Risk Factors    in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, which should be read together with the other risk factors and information disclosed elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our other reports filed with the SEC. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
    
  During the three month period ended   September 30, 2016  , we issued   2,888   shares of common stock to shareholders in connection with our distribution reinvestment plan. These issuances were not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The aggregate value of the shares of our common stock issued under our distribution reinvestment plan was approximately   $38 thousand  .

  On November 5, 2015, we, as borrower, entered into a Business Loan Agreement ( BLA ) with Pacific Western Bank, as lender, to provide us with a $15.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility ( PWB Credit Facility ) for general corporate purposes, including investment funding. 
    
  On October 31, 2016, the BLA was amended (the  Secured Revolver Amendment ) to, among other things (i) increase the maximum amount available under the PWB Credit Facility from $15 million to $25 million, (ii) extend the maturity date of the PWB Credit Facility from November 6, 2017 to October 31, 2018, (iii) increase the fixed interest rate from 4.75% to 5.00% per annum and (iv) exclude subordinated loan investments (as defined in the BLA) from the borrowing base. In connection with the Secured Revolver Amendment, we incurred debt issuance costs of $175,000 and will incur an unused commitment fee, payable monthly in arrears, equal to 0.50% per annum on any unused portion of the PWB Credit Facility in excess of $15 million. 
    
  The foregoing description of the Secured Revolver Amendment is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by the full text of such amendment and the Commercial Guaranty Agreement by and among us, OFS Capital WM, LLC, and Pacific Western Bank dated October 31, 2016, which are filed as an exhibits to this report on Form 10-Q as Exhibit 10.1 and Exhibit 10.2, respectively, and are incorporated by reference herein.

  A Commercial Security Agreement dated November 5, 2015 granting Lender a security interest in all business assets of Guarantor. 
  DESCRIPTION OF CHANGE IN TERMS.      This Change In Terms Agreement ("Agreement") is entered into by Borrower and is effective on the latter of (i) its acceptance by Lender, (ii) the satisfaction of all conditions precedent to effectiveness (if any), or (iii) as of the Date of the Agreement set forth above.      Borrower agrees that the terms of the Note, the Business Loan Agreement dated November 5, 2015 (the "Business Loan Agreement"), and any other Related Documents described herein, are hereby modified by the terms of this Agreement.      To the extent any provision of this Agreement conflicts with the provisions of the Note, or any other Related Documents described herein, then the provisions of this Agreement shall control.  Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Business Loan Agreement. 
  1.  The Note is hereby modified as follows: 
  a) The date on which all outstanding principal is due and payable (together with any accrued but unpaid interest) (the "Maturity Date") is hereby extended from November 6, 2017 to October 31, 2018.   
  b) The Principal Amount of the Note is hereby increased from $15,000,000.00 to $25,000,000.00. Borrower promises to pay to Lender, the principal amount of $25,000,000.00, or so much as may be outstanding, together with any accrued but unpaid interest and any unpaid due on the unpaid outstanding principal balance of each advance made under the Note. 
  c) Effective as of the date of this Agreement, the interest rate used to calculate interest payable on the unpaid principal balance of the Note will be at a fixed rate of 5.00%. 
  d) Borrower shall make regular payments as further outlined in this Agreement. 
  2.  Borrower shall cause OFS Capital WM, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company to execute a Commercial Guaranty of the loan in favor of Lender, on Lender     s forms and in the amounts and under the conditions set forth in such guaranty.

  a) The section titled   "Non-Eligible Loan"   is amended to include the following:

  Unused Commitment Fee.    Any unused portion of the $25,000,000.00 commitment, in an amount over $15,000,000.00, shall be subject to a monthly fee of 0.50% (one-half percentage point per annum). 
  PAYMENT.

In addition, Borrower will pay regular monthly payments of all accrued unpaid interest due as of each payment date, beginning November 30, 2016, with all subsequent interest payments to be due on the same day of each month after that. 

CHANGE IN TERMS AGREEEMNT 
    Loan No.: 4061100374    (continued)    Page 2 

INTEREST CALCULATION METHOD.  Interest on this loan is computed on a 365/360 basis; that is, by applying the ratio of the interest rate over a year of 360 days, multiplied by the outstanding principal balance, multiplied by the actual number of days the principal balance is outstanding.  All interest payable under this loan is computed using this method. 
  CONTINUING VALIDITY.    Except as expressly changed by this Agreement, the terms of the original obligation or obligations, including all agreements evidenced or securing the obligation(s), remain unchanged and in full force and effect.  Consent by Lender to this Agreement does not waive Lender's right to strict performance of the obligation(s) as changed, nor obligate Lender to make any future change in terms.  Nothing in this Agreement will constitute a satisfaction of the obligation(s).  It is the intention of Lender to retain as liable parties all makers and endorsers of the original obligation(s), including accommodation parties, unless a party is expressly released by Lender in writing.  Any maker or endorser, including accommodation makers, will not be released by virtue of this Agreement.  If any person who signed the original obligation does not sign this Agreement below, then all persons signing below acknowledge that this Agreement is given conditionally, based on the representation to Lender that the non-signing party consents to the changes and provisions of this Agreement or otherwise will not be released by it.  This waiver applies not only to any initial extension, modification or release, but also to all such subsequent actions. 
  INTEGRATION.   The parties agree that (a) this Agreement and the Business Loan Agreement, as applicable, which governs the Note, together with all of the Related Documents, represents the final agreement between the parties, and therefore incorporates all negotiations of the parties hereto (b) there are no unwritten oral agreements between the parties, and (c) this Agreement may not be contradicted by evidence of any prior, contemporaneous, or subsequent oral agreements or understandings of the parties. 
  PRIOR TO SIGNING THIS AGREEMENT, BORROWER READ AND UNDERSTOOD ALL THE PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT.  BORROWER AGREES TO THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT.

Exhibit 10.2 

COMMERCIAL GUARANTY 

CONTINUING GUARANTEE OF PAYMENT AND PERFORMANCE  .  For good and valuable consideration, Guarantor absolutely and unconditionally guarantees full and punctual payment and satisfaction of the Indebtedness of Borrower to Lender, and the performance and discharge of all Borrower's obligations under the Note and the Related Documents.  This is a guaranty of payment and performance and not of collection, so Lender can enforce this Guaranty against Guarantor even when Lender has not exhausted Lender's remedies against anyone else obligated to pay the Indebtedness or against any collateral securing the Indebtedness, this Guaranty or any other guaranty of the Indebtedness.  Guarantor will make any payments to Lender or its order, on demand, in legal tender of the United States of America, in same-day funds, without set-off or deduction or counterclaim, and will otherwise perform Borrower's obligations under the Note and Related Documents.  Neither Borrower nor Guarantor is entering into any swap obligations with Lender or otherwise in connection with this Agreement, the Loan Agreement, or the other Related Documents, and as a result, Guarantor does not guarantee any obligations of Borrower under or in respect of any of Borrower s existing or future swap obligations. 
  INDEBTEDNESS  .  The word "Indebtedness" as used in this Guaranty has the meaning assigned to such term in the Loan Agreement.If Lender presently holds one or more guaranties, or hereafter receives additional guaranties from Guarantor, Lender's rights under all guaranties shall be cumulative.  This Guaranty shall not (unless specifically provided below to the contrary) affect or invalidate any such other guaranties.  Guarantor's liability will be Guarantor's aggregate liability under the terms of this Guaranty and any such other unterminated guaranties. 
  CONTINUING GUARANTY  .  THIS IS A "CONTINUING GUARANTY" UNDER WHICH GUARANTOR AGREES TO GUARANTEE THE FULL AND PUNCTUAL PAYMENT, PERFORMANCE AND SATISFACTION OF THE INDEBTEDNESS OF BORROWER TO LENDER, NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING OR ACQUIRED, ON AN OPEN AND CONTINUING BASIS.  ACCORDINGLY, ANY PAYMENTS MADE ON THE INDEBTEDNESS WILL NOT DISCHARGE OR DIMINISH GUARANTOR'S OBLIGATIONS AND LIABILITY UNDER THIS GUARANTY FOR ANY REMAINING AND SUCCEEDING INDEBTEDNESS EVEN WHEN ALL OR PART OF THE OUTSTANDING INDEBTEDNESS MAY BE A ZERO BALANCE FROM TIME TO TIME. 
  DURATION OF GUARANTY  .  This Guaranty will take effect when received by Lender without the necessity of any acceptance by Lender, or any notice to Guarantor or to Borrower, and will continue in full force until all the Indebtedness incurred or contracted before receipt by Lender of any notice of revocation shall have been fully and finally paid and satisfied and all of Guarantor's other obligations under this Guaranty shall have been performed in full.  If Guarantor elects to revoke this Guaranty, Guarantor may only do so in writing.  Guarantor's written notice of revocation must be mailed to Lender, by certified mail, at Lender's address listed above or such other place as Lender may designate in writing.  Written revocation of this Guaranty will apply only to new Indebtedness created after actual receipt by Lender of Guarantor's written revocation.  For this purpose and without limitation, the term "new Indebtedness" does not include the Indebtedness which at the time of notice of revocation is contingent, unliquidated, undetermined or not due and which later becomes absolute, liquidated, determined or due.  For this purpose and without limitation, "new Indebtedness" does not include all or part of the Indebtedness that is: incurred by Borrower prior to revocation; incurred under a commitment that became binding before revocation; any renewals, extensions, substitutions, and modifications of the Indebtedness.  Release of any other guarantor or termination of any other guaranty of the Indebtedness shall not affect the liability of Guarantor under this Guaranty.  A revocation Lender receives from any one or more Guarantors shall not affect the liability of any remaining Guarantors under this Guaranty. Guarantor's obligations under this Guaranty shall be in addition to any of Guarantor's obligations, or any of them, under any other guaranties of the Indebtedness or any other person heretofore or hereafter given to Lender unless such other guaranties are modified or revoked in writing; and this Guarantor shall not, unless provided in this Guaranty, affect, invalidate, or supersede any such other guaranty.    It is anticipated that fluctuations may occur in the aggregate amount of the Indebtedness covered by this Guaranty, and Guarantor specifically acknowledges and agrees that reductions in the amount of the Indebtedness, even to zero dollars ($0.00), shall not constitute a termination of this Guaranty.  This Guaranty is binding upon Guarantor so long as any of the Indebtedness remains unpaid and even though the Indebtedness may from time to time be zero dollars ($0.00).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Guaranty shall terminate upon payment in full of the Indebtedness, termination of any commitments by Lender to extend additional credit under the Loan Agreement and termination of the Loan Agreement (in accordance with the terms of the Loan Agreement). 
  GUARANTOR'S AUTHORIZATION TO LENDER  .  Guarantor authorizes Lender, either before or after any revocation hereof,   without notice or demand and without lessening Guarantor's liability under this Guaranty, from time to time:    (A) to take such actions as are permitted to be taken by Lender under the Loan Agreement and the Security Agreements and under applicable law; (B) to alter, compromise, renew, extend, accelerate, or otherwise change one or more times the time for payment or other terms of the Indebtedness or any part of the Indebtedness, including increases and decreases of the rate of interest on the Indebtedness; extensions may be repeated and may be for longer than the original loan term;  (C) to take and hold security for the payment of this Guaranty or the Indebtedness, and exchange, enforce, waive, subordinate, fail or decide not to perfect, and release any such security, with or without the substitution of new collateral;  (D) to release, substitute, agree not to sue, or deal with any one or more of Borrower's sureties, endorsers, or other guarantors on any terms or in any manner Lender may choose;  (E) to determine how, when and what application of payments and credits shall be made on the Indebtedness; and (F) to assign or transfer this Guaranty in whole or in part. 
  GUARANTOR'S  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES  .  Guarantor  represents  and  warrants  to  Lender  that  (A) no  representations  or agreements of any kind have been made to Guarantor which would limit or qualify in any way the terms of this Guaranty;  (B) this Guaranty is executed at Borrower's request and not at the request of Lender;  (C) Guarantor has full power, right and authority to enter into this Guaranty;  (D) the provisions of this Guaranty do not result in a default under any agreement or other instrument binding upon Guarantor and do not result in a violation of any law, regulation, court decree or order applicable to Guarantor, the effect of which, in each case, could reasonably be expected to be, have, or result in a material adverse effect on Guarantor s business or financial condition;  (E) Guarantor has not and will not, without the prior written consent of Lender, sell, lease, assign, transfer, encumber (except for liens otherwise permitted or provided for under the Loan Agreement or the Security Agreement between Guarantor and Lender) or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of Guarantor's assets, provided, however, that consent of Lender shall not be required if the proceeds from such sale, lease, assignment, transfer, or disposition are distributed to Borrower for purposes of reinvestment;  (F) upon Lender's request, Guarantor will provide to Lender financial and credit information in form acceptable to Lender, and all such financial information which currently has been, and all future financial information which will be provided to Lender is and will be true and correct in all material respects and fairly present Guarantor's financial condition as of the dates the financial information is provided;  (G) no material adverse change has occurred in Guarantor's financial condition since the date of the most recent financial statements provided to Lender and no event has occurred which may materially adversely affect Guarantor's financial condition;  (H) no material litigation, claim, investigation, administrative proceeding or similar action (including those for unpaid taxes) against Guarantor is pending or

threatened;  (I) Lender has made no representation to Guarantor as to the creditworthiness of Borrower; and (J) Guarantor has established adequate means of obtaining from Borrower on a continuing basis information regarding Borrower's financial condition. Guarantor agrees to keep adequately informed from such means of any facts, events, or circumstances which might in any way affect Guarantor's risks under this Guaranty, and Guarantor further agrees that, absent a request for information, Lender shall have no obligation to disclose to Guarantor  any information or documents acquired by Lender in the course of  its relationship with Borrower. 
  GUARANTOR'S WAIVERS  .  Except as prohibited by applicable law, Guarantor waives any right to require Lender to  (A) make any presentment, protest, demand, or notice of any kind, including notice of change of any terms of repayment of the Indebtedness, default by Borrower or any other guarantor or surety, any action or nonaction taken by Borrower, Lender, or any other guarantor or surety of Borrower, or the creation of new or additional Indebtedness;  (B) proceed against any person, including Borrower, before proceeding against Guarantor;  (C) proceed against any collateral for the Indebtedness, including Borrower's collateral, before proceeding against Guarantor;  (D) apply any payments or proceeds received against the Indebtedness in any order;  (E) disclose any information about the Indebtedness, the Borrower, the collateral, or any other guarantor or surety, or about any action or nonaction of Lender; or  (F) pursue any remedy or course of action in Lender's power whatsoever. 
  Guarantor also waives any and all rights or defenses arising by reason of  (G) any disability or other defense of Borrower, any other guarantor or surety or any other person;  (H) the cessation from any cause whatsoever, other than payment in full, of the Indebtedness;  (I) the application of proceeds of the Indebtedness by Borrower for purposes other than the purposes understood and intended by Guarantor and Lender;  (J) any act of omission or commission by Lender which directly or indirectly results in or contributes to the discharge of Borrower or any other guarantor or surety, or the Indebtedness, or the loss or release of any collateral by operation of law or otherwise;  (K) any statute of limitations in any action under this Guaranty or on the Indebtedness; or  (L) any modification or change in terms of the Indebtedness, whatsoever, including without limitation, the renewal, extension, acceleration, or other change in the time payment of the Indebtedness is due and any change in the interest rate, and including any such modification or change in terms after revocation of this Guaranty on the Indebtedness incurred prior to such revocation. 
  Guarantor waives all rights of subrogation, reimbursement, indemnification, and contribution and any other rights and defenses that are or may become available to Guarantor by reason of California Civil Code Sections 2787 to 2855, inclusive. 
  Guarantor waives all rights and any defenses arising out of an election of remedies by Lender even though that the election of remedies, such as a non-judicial foreclosure with respect to security for a guaranteed obligation, has destroyed Guarantor's rights of subrogation and reimbursement against Borrower by operation of Section 580d of the California Code of Civil Procedure or otherwise. 
  Guarantor waives all rights and defenses that Guarantor may have because Borrower's obligation is secured by real property.  This means among other things:  (M) Lender may collect from Guarantor without first foreclosing on any real or personal property collateral pledged by Borrower.  (N) If Lender forecloses on any real property collateral pledged by Borrower:  (1) the amount of Borrower's obligation may be reduced only by the price for which the collateral is sold at the foreclosure sale, even if the collateral is worth more than the sale price.  (2) Lender may collect from Guarantor even if Lender, by foreclosing on the real property collateral, has destroyed any right Guarantor may have to collect from Borrower.  This is an unconditional and irrevocable waiver of any rights and defenses Guarantor may have because Borrower's obligation is secured by real property. These rights and defenses include, but are not limited to, any rights and defenses based upon Section  580a, 580b, 580d, or 726 of the Code of Civil Procedure. 
  Guarantor understands and agrees that the foregoing waivers are unconditional and irrevocable waivers of substantive rights and defenses to which Guarantor might otherwise be entitled under state and federal law.  The rights and defenses waived include, without limitation, those provided by California laws of suretyship and guaranty, anti-deficiency laws, and the Uniform Commercial Code.  Guarantor acknowledges that Guarantor has provided these waivers of rights and defenses with the intention that they be fully relied upon by Lender.  Guarantor further understands and agrees that this Guaranty is a separate and independent contract between Guarantor and Lender, given for full and ample consideration, and is enforceable on its own terms.  Until all of the Indebtedness is paid in full, Guarantor waives any right to enforce any remedy Guarantor may have against the Borrower or any other guarantor, surety, or other person, and further, Guarantor waives any right to participate in any collateral for the Indebtedness now or hereafter held by Lender. 
  Guarantor's Understanding With Respect To Waivers  .  Guarantor warrants and agrees that each of the waivers set forth above is made with Guarantor's full knowledge of its significance and consequences and that, under the circumstances, the waivers are reasonable and not contrary to public policy or law.  If any such waiver is determined to be contrary to any applicable law or public policy, such waiver shall be effective only to the extent permitted by law or public policy. 
  Subordination of Borrower's Debts to Guarantor  .  Guarantor agrees that the Indebtedness, whether now existing or hereafter created, shall be superior to any claim that Guarantor may now have or hereafter acquire against Borrower, whether or not Borrower becomes insolvent.  Guarantor hereby expressly subordinates any claim Guarantor may have against Borrower, upon any account whatsoever, to any claim that Lender may now or hereafter have against Borrower with respect to the Indebtedness.  In the event of insolvency and consequent liquidation of the assets of Borrower, through bankruptcy, by an assignment for the benefit of creditors, by voluntary liquidation, or otherwise, the assets of Borrower applicable to the payment of the claims of both Lender and Guarantor shall be paid to Lender and shall be first applied by Lender to the Indebtedness.  Guarantor does hereby assign to Lender all claims which it may have or acquire against Borrower or against any assignee or trustee in bankruptcy of Borrower; provided however, that such assignment shall be effective only for the purpose of assuring to Lender full payment in legal tender of the Indebtedness.  Guarantor agrees, and Lender is hereby authorized, in the name of Guarantor, from time to time to file financing statements and continuation statements and to execute documents and to take such other actions as Lender deems necessary or appropriate to perfect, preserve and enforce its rights under this Guaranty. 
  NEGATIVE COVENANT.    Guarantor covenants and agrees with Lender that while this Agreement is in effect, Guarantor shall not, without the prior written consent of Lender, become a surety or guarantor of any unsecured debt owed by Borrower or any other person or entity to any creditor other than Lender. 
  Miscellaneous Provisions  .  The following miscellaneous provisions are a part of this Guaranty: 
  AMENDMENTS  .  This Guaranty, together with any Related Documents, constitutes the entire understanding and agreement of the parties as to the matters set forth in this Guaranty.  No alteration of or amendment to this Guaranty shall be effective unless given in writing and signed by the party or parties sought to be charged or bound by the alteration or amendment. 
  ATTORNEYS' FEES; EXPENSES  .  Guarantor agrees to pay upon demand all of Lender's costs and expenses, including Lender's attorneys' fees and Lender's legal expenses, incurred in connection with the enforcement of this Guaranty.  Lender may hire or pay someone else to help enforce this Guaranty, and Guarantor shall pay the costs and expenses of such enforcement.  Costs and expenses include Lender's attorneys' fees and legal expenses whether or not there is a lawsuit, including attorneys' fees and legal expenses for bankruptcy proceedings (including efforts to modify or vacate any automatic stay or injunction), appeals, and any anticipated post-judgment collection services.  Guarantor also shall pay all court costs and such additional fees as may be directed by the court. 
  CAPTION HEADINGS  .  Caption headings in this Guaranty are for convenience purposes only and are not to be used to interpret or define the provisions of this Guaranty. 
  GOVERNING LAW  .  This Guaranty will be governed by federal law applicable to Lender and, to the extent not preempted by federal law, the laws of the State of California without regard to its conflicts of law provisions. 
  CHOICE OF VENUE  .  If there is a lawsuit, Guarantor agrees upon Lender's request to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts of Los Angeles County, State of California. 
  INTEGRATION  .  Guarantor further agrees that Guarantor has read and fully understands the terms of this Guaranty.  Guarantor has had the opportunity to be advised by Guarantor's attorney with respect to entering into this Guaranty.  Guarantor further agrees that the Guaranty represents the final agreement between Guarantor and Lender regarding the matters addressed therein and therefore: (a) incorporates all negotiations of

    COMMERCIAL GUARANTY 
  Loan No. 4061100374    (Continued)    Page 3 

the parties relating to the Guaranty; (b) there are no unwritten oral agreements between Lender and Guarantor, and (c) this Guaranty may not be contradicted by evidence of any prior, contemporaneous, or subsequent oral agreements or understandings of Lender and Guarantor.  Guarantor hereby indemnifies and holds Lender harmless from all losses, claims, damages, and costs (including Lender's attorney's fees) suffered by Lender as a result of any breach by Guarantor of the warranties, representations and agreements of this Paragraph. 
  INTERPRETATION  .  If a court finds that any provision of this Guaranty is not valid or should not be enforced, that fact by itself will not mean that the rest of this Guaranty will not be valid or enforced. Therefore, a court will enforce the rest of the provisions of this Guaranty even if a provision of this Guaranty may be found to be invalid or unenforceable.
