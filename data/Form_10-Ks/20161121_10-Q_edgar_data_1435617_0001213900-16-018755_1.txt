1.
ORGANIZATION   

Powerdyne,
Inc., was incorporated on February 2, 2010 in Nevada, and is registered to do business in Rhode Island and Massachusetts. On February
7, 2011, Powerdyne, Inc. merged with Powerdyne International, Inc., formerly Greenmark Acquisition Corporation, a publicly held
Delaware corporation.  

On
December 13, 2010, Powerdyne International, Inc., formerly Greenmark Acquisition Corporation, filed an Amended and Restated Articles
of Incorporation in order to, among other things, increase the authorized capital stock to 300,000,000 common shares, par value
$0.0001 per share. Unless the context specifies otherwise, as discussed in Note 2, references to the  Company  refers
to Powerdyne International, Inc. and Powerdyne, Inc. after the merger.  

At
the closing of the merger, each share of Powerdyne, Inc. s common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
closing of the Merger was exchanged for the right to receive 7,520 shares of common stock of Powerdyne International, Inc. Accordingly,
an aggregate of 188,000,000 shares of common stock of Powerdyne International, Inc. were issued to the holders of Powerdyne, Inc. s
common stock.  

In
2014, Powerdyne International, Inc. filed an amendment to its Articles of Incorporation which increased the authorized capital
stock to 550,000,000 common shares, par value $0.0001 per share.  

On
January 26, 2015, Powerdyne International, Inc. filed an amendment to its Articles of Incorporation which increased the authorized
capital stock to 2,020,000,000 shares consisting of 2,000,000,000 common shares, par value $0.0001 per share and 20,000,000 shares
which may be designated as common or preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share.  

In
March 2014 Company began production and distribution of completely packaged independent electrical generator units that run on
environmentally-friendly fuel sources, such as natural gas and propane.  

2.
REVERSE MERGER ACCOUNTING   

On
February 7, 2011, Greenmark Acquisition Corporation, which was a publicly held Delaware corporation, merged with Powerdyne, Inc.
Upon closing of the transaction, Greenmark Acquisition Corporation, the surviving corporation in the merger, changed its name
to Powerdyne International, Inc.  

The
merger was accounted for as a reverse-merger, and recapitalization in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
in the United States ( GAAP ). Powerdyne, Inc. was the acquirer for financial reporting purposes and the Company was
the acquired company. Consequently, the assets and liabilities and the operations that are reflected in the historical financial
statements prior to the merger are those of Powerdyne, Inc. and have been recorded at the historical cost basis of Powerdyne,
Inc., and the financial statements after completion of the merger include the assets and liabilities of the Company and Powerdyne,
Inc., historical operations of Powerdyne, Inc. and operations of the Company from the closing date of the merger. Common stock
and the corresponding capital amounts of the Company pre-merger were retroactively restated as capital stock shares reflecting
the exchange ratio in the merger. In conjunction with the merger, the Company received no cash and assumed no liabilities from
Greenmark Acquisition Corporation.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

The
summary of significant accounting policies presented below is designed to assist in understanding the Company s financial
statements. Such financial statements and accompanying notes are the representations of the Company s management, who are
responsible for their integrity and objectivity. These accounting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America ( GAAP ) in all material respects, and have been consistently applied in preparing
the accompanying financial statements.  

Going
Concern    

Since
its inception, the Company has devoted substantially all of its efforts to business planning, research and development, recruiting
management and technical staff, acquiring operating assets and raising capital. The Company has not generated significant revenues
from its principal operations, and there is no assurance of future revenues. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had an accumulated
deficit of $3,335,105. The Company s continuation as a going concern is dependent on its ability to generate sufficient
cash flows from operations to meet its obligations and/or obtaining additional financing from its members or other sources, as
may be required.  

The
Company s activities will necessitate significant uses of working capital beyond September 30, 2016. Additionally, the Company s
capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the success of the Company s continued research and development
efforts and the status of competitive products. The Company plans to continue financing its operations with cash received from
financing activities.  

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern; however, the
above condition raises substantial doubt about the Company s ability to do so. The financial statements do not include any
adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications
of liabilities that may result should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.  

Use
of Estimates    

In
preparing these audited financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements
and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments    

The
Company follows guidance for accounting for fair value measurements of financial assets and financial liabilities and for fair
value measurements of nonfinancial items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring
basis. Additionally, the Company adopted guidance for fair value measurement related to nonfinancial items that are recognized
and disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis. The guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy
that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted
quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to measurements
involving significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:  

Level
1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability
to access at the measurement date.  

Level
2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly
or indirectly.  

Level
3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.  

POWERDYNE
INTERNATIONAL, INC.   

   NOTES
TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   

The
Company monitors the market conditions and evaluates the fair value hierarchy levels at least quarterly. For any transfers in
and out of the levels of the fair value hierarchy, the Company elects to disclose the fair value measurement at the beginning
of the reporting period during which the transfer occurred.  

The
Company's financial instruments consisted of cash, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, advances to stockholders, notes payable
and convertible debt. The estimated fair value of cash, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, advances to stockholders, and
notes payable approximates its carrying amount due to the short maturity of these instruments. The recognition of the derivative
values of convertible debt are based on the weighted-average Black-Scholes option pricing model.  

Revenue recognition   

The
Company recognizes its revenue in accordance with ASC Topic 605,   Revenue Recognition  , upon the delivery of
its products when: (1) delivery has occurred or services rendered; (2) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (3) there
are no continuing obligations to the customer; and (4) the collection of related accounts receivable is probable.  

Cash    

The
Company considers all highly-liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.
The Company did not have any cash equivalents as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  

Concentration
of Credit Risk    

Financial
instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and cash equivalents.
The Company places its cash with high quality banking institutions. From time to time, the Company may maintain cash balances
at certain institutions in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limit. The Company has not incurred any loss from
this risk.  

Property
and Equipment    

Property
and equipment is stated at cost. Capital expenditures for improvements and upgrades to existing equipment are also capitalized.
Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. The equipment is depreciated over 10 years on a straight-line basis. Depreciation
expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $9,942 and $7,604, respectively.  

Derivatives
and Hedging    

In
April 2008, the FASB issued a pronouncement that provides guidance on determining what types of instruments or embedded features
in an instrument held by a reporting entity can be considered indexed to its own stock for the purpose of evaluating the first
criteria of the scope exception in the pronouncement on accounting for derivatives.  

This
pronouncement was effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The adoption of
these requirements can affect the accounting for many convertible instruments with provisions that protect holders from a decline
in the stock price. Each reporting period, the Company evaluates whether convertible debt to acquire stock of the Company contain
provisions that protect holders from declines in the stock price or otherwise could result in modification of the exercise price
under the respective convertible debt agreements. The Company determined that the conversion features in the convertible notes
issued during the second, third, and fourth quarters of 2014, contained such provisions and recorded such instruments as derivative
liabilities.  

Long-Lived
Assets    

In
accordance with ASC 350-30 (formerly SFAS No. 144,  Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets ),
the Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their then
carrying values may not be recoverable. When such factors and circumstances exist, the Company compares the projected
undiscounted future cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their estimated useful lives against
their respective carrying amount. Impairment, if any, is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value,
based on market value when available, or discounted expected cash flows, of those assets and is recorded in the period in
which the determination is made. The Company s management currently believes there is no impairment of its long-lived
assets. There can be no assurance however, that market conditions will not change or demand for the Company s products
under development will continue. Either of these could result in future impairment of long-lived assets.

   NOTES
TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   

Income
Taxes    

As
a result of the implementation of certain provisions of ASC 740,  Income Taxes , (formerly FIN 48,  Accounting for Uncertainty
in Income Taxes   An Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109),  ( ASC 740 ), which clarifies the accounting
and disclosure for uncertainty in tax positions, as defined. ASC 740 seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with
certain aspects of the recognition and measurement related to accounting for income taxes.  

In
2010, the Company adopted Accounting for Uncertain Income Taxes under the provisions of ASC 740. ASC 740 clarifies the accounting
for income taxes by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in
the financial statements. It also provides guidance on derecognition, measurement, classification, interest and penalties, accounting
in interim periods, disclosure and transition. The Company did not recognize any additional liability for unrecognized tax benefits
as a result of the adoption of ASC 740. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable
to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective
tax bases. Valuation allowances are established when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will
not be realized.  

The
Company believes that its income tax filing positions and deductions will be sustained on audit and does not anticipate any adjustments
that will result in a material change to its financial position. Therefore, no reserves for uncertain income tax positions have
been recorded pursuant to ASC 740. In addition, we did not record a cumulative effect adjustment related to the adoption of ASC
740. The Company s policy for recording interest and penalties associated with income-based tax audits is to record such
items as a component of income taxes.  

The
Company s tax provision is determined using an estimate of its annual effective tax rate using enacted tax rates expected
to apply to taxable income in the years in which they are earned, adjusted for discrete items, if any, that are taken into account
in the relevant period. Each quarter the Company updates its estimate of the annual effective tax rate, and if its estimated tax
rate changes, we make a cumulative adjustment. Income taxes payable as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were $500 and
$500, respectively.  

Loss
per Common Share    

Basic
loss per common share excludes dilutive securities and is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common
shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per common share reflect the potential dilution that could occur if securities
or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock
that then shared in the earnings of the entity. Since the Company has only incurred losses, basic and diluted loss per share is
the same. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, there were no outstanding dilutive securities.  

The
following table represents the computation of basic and diluted losses per share:  

Net
loss per share is based upon the weighted average shares of common stock outstanding.  

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements    

There
are no recently issued accounting pronouncements that the Company has yet to adopt that are expected to have a material effect
on its financial position results of operations, or cash flows.

LEASE   

On
March 11, 2015 the Company finalized its negotiations with Farmacia Brisas del Mar, a corporation organized under the laws of

equipment to Lessee based upon power consumption. In addition, the custom designed system will also provide cogeneration capabilities
with the addition of chillers to support the air conditioning demands. The agreement provides for a payment to the Company of
a monthly fee equal to the greater of a set monthly base rate or a monthly base rate plus an additional amount based on kilowatt
wattage. The agreement provides for termination by the Company only in the event of nonperformance by the Lessee unless Lessee
pays all payments due for the remainder of the term. The agreement contains representation and warranties, default provisions
and indemnification provisions typical for agreements of this type.

ITEM
2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.   

The
following discussion and analysis is intended as a review of significant factors affecting our financial condition and results
of operations for the periods indicated. The discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements
and the notes presented herein and the financial statements and the other information set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 14, 2016. In addition to historical
information, the following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward-looking
statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ significantly from those anticipated in these
forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors discussed herein and any other periodic reports filed and to be filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  

We
have experienced losses since our inception. Our independent auditors have issued a report raising a substantial doubt about our
ability to continue as a going concern. We have only entered into one agreement for the leasing of our equipment to date and have
derived minimal revenue from such agreement. Our sources of cash to date have been capital invested by shareholders and venture
capital investors/lenders. Our only revenue, $1,240, has come from our one equipment lease agreement.  

The
basis of our overall business is founded on our ability to produce electrical power using state-of-the-art technology to power
electrical generation equipment to produce electricity at a lower cost than the existing means of producing or providing primary
electric power in its target markets. We expect that the difference between our cost to produce electrical power and the current
billing rate of existing local utility providers will present savings for our customers and revenue opportunity for us.  

Our
business is to install and maintain, own and operate electrical power generation equipment ( gensets ) at client locations.
We will own and maintain the equipment to be installed with the customer who will use it to produce its own electrical power.
Our products are intended to be portable, easy-to-use units that can be conveniently deployed in various locations around the
world. The units can also be assembled and combined to produce power centers providing up to 50 megawatts of power.  

Plan
of Operations   

The
Company's strategy is to pursue selected opportunities in markets where inexpensive and environmentally friendly power sources
are needed and/or required.  

Results
of Operations - The nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015:   

Revenues   

Powerdyne
International, Inc. did generate minimal revenues of $488 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, and did generate revenues
of $470 during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  

Total
Operating Expenses    

During the three months ended September 30,
2016, total operating expenses decreased 89.98% to $21,127 from $210,265 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, total operating expenses decreased 58.41% to $145,876 from $350,773 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015. The decrease from the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to the nine months ended September 30, 2016
is related primarily decreases of $17,484 in salaries and wages, $14,367 in outside sales consultant, $3,722 in payroll tax expense,
$4,506 in freight and delivery, $5,560 in filing fees, $4,220 in stock registration fees, $2,500 in venture capital finders 
fees, $20,428 in legal and accounting, $3,950 in permit fees, $4,400 in PR and promotion, $12,875 in materials and supplies, and
$3,360 in travel expenses, $122,500 in non-employee stock compensation, $43,877 in derivative expense, and $138,260 in amortization
of debt discounts, offset by increases of $1,760 in consulting fees, $7,388 in interest expense, $11,321 in bad debt expense, $2,338
in depreciation expense, and $50,345 in change in FV of derivatives. 

Net
loss   

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the net loss decreased 69.87% to ($145,876) from ($482,984) for the nine months ended
September 30, 2015. The decrease in net loss was a result of a decrease in other expenses which included amortization of debt
expense, and derivative expense from the notes issued to investors and change in fair value of derivatives related to the note
issuances.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015, we had working capital deficits of ($420,472) and ($452,739), respectively and an accumulated deficit of $3,335,105. Our
continuation as a going concern is dependent on our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to meet our obligations
and/or obtaining additional financing as may be required. To date, we have generated minimal revenue from operations. We have
experienced losses since our inception. Our independent auditors have issued a report raising a substantial doubt about our ability
to continue as a going concern. Our sources of cash to date have primarily been capital invested by shareholders and venture capital
investors/lenders. Our only revenue, $488, has come from our one equipment lease agreement. For the nine months ended September
30, 2016, we had a $1,789 decrease in net cash. The cash used in operations of ($30,994) was primarily due to net loss from operations
of $145,388 plus non-cash expenses of $9,942 of depreciation, $11,321 of bad debt expense, $30,050 of common stock issued for
services and stock compensation, $224 increase in accounts receivable, and a $63,305 increase in accrued expenses. The total cash
provided by financing activities of $29,205 was due to of proceeds of notes payable to related parties. 

We
currently owe $400,810 (exclusive of interest) under notes due to related parties, of which $13,000 is due December 2016, $25,000
is due January 2017, $35,000 is due February 2017, $40,000 is due April 2017, $52,147 is due May 2017, $45,000 is due June 2017,
$25,000 is due July 2017, $15,000 is due August 2017, $13,000 is due September 2017, $28,102 is due October 2017, $16,049 is due
November 2017, $22,234 is due December 2017, $2,500 is due January 2018, $20,300 is due February 2018, $12,780 is due March 2018,
$12,625 is due June 2018, $5,973 is due July 2018, $11,100 is due August 2018, and $6,000 is due September 2018. Unless the note
holders of currently due notes, convert their notes to stock, we will need to raise additional funds to repay our notes that are
currently due. There can be no assurance that we will have the requisite funding to repay these loans when due.  

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements   

We
have no off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition,
changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources
that is deemed by our management to be material to investors.  

Critical
Accounting Policies   

Use
of Estimates   

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant
estimates and assumptions included in Powerdyne International, Inc. s financial statements relate to estimate of loss contingencies
and accrued other liabilities.  

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments   

ASC
820-10 (formerly SFAS No. 157,  Fair Value Measurements ) requires entities to disclose the fair value of financial instruments,
both assets and liabilities recognized and not recognized on the balance sheet, for which it is practicable to estimate fair value.
ASC 820-10 defines the fair value of a financial instrument as the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current
transaction between willing parties. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the carrying value of certain financial instruments
such as accounts receivable, accounts payable, accrued expenses, and amounts due to/from related party approximates fair value
due to the short-term nature of such instruments.  

Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets   

In
accordance with ASC 350-30 (formerly SFAS No. 144,  Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets ), the
Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their then carrying
values may not be recoverable. When such factors and circumstances exist, the Company compares the projected undiscounted future
cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their estimated useful lives against their respective carrying
amount. Impairment, if any, is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value, based on market value when available,
or discounted expected cash flows, of those assets and is recorded in the period in which the determination is made. The Company s
management currently believes there is no impairment of its long-lived assets. There can be no assurance however, that market
conditions will not change or demand for the Company s products under development will continue. Either of these could result
in future impairment of long-lived assets.

ITEM
4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.   

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   

Our
management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of
our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2016. The term  disclosure controls and procedures,  as defined
in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to
ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls
and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed
by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company's management,
including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well
designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives and management necessarily applies
its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure
controls and procedures as of September 30, 2016, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of
such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level due to the insufficient
controls over timely financial statement preparation and review as well as over the preparation and review around accounting for
certain complex transactions.  

The
design of monitoring controls used to assess the design and operating effectiveness of our internal controls is inadequate. We
also do not have an adequate internal process to report deficiencies in internal control to management on a timely basis.  

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   

We
continue to make progress towards remediating the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. The actions
taken include, amongst others, (i) installing a new accounting system which allows us to implement appropriate procedures and
processes necessary for adequate controls (ii) implementing month end and period end closing procedures and review processes for
key aspects of our financial reporting process, (iii) designing, documenting and implementing policies and procedures; and (iv)
instituting formal procedures for accounting for options.  

No
other changes in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
