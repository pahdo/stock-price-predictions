      Table of Contents           LINGERIE FIGHTING CHAMPIONSHIPS, INC.   NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS September 30, 2016 (UNAUDITED)       NOTE 1   ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF BUSINESS      Lingerie Fighting Championships, Inc. (the  Company ) is a Nevada corporation incorporated on November 29, 2006 under the name Sparking Events, Inc.  The Company s corporate name was changed to Xodtec Group USA, Inc. in June 2009, Xodtec LED, Inc. in May 2010, Cala Energy Corp. in September 2013 and Lingerie Fighting Championships, Inc. on April 1, 2015.      NOTE 2   BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND ACCOUNTING POLICIES        The accompanying unaudited interim financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and are presented in accordance with the requirements of Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, these interim financial statements do not include all of the information and notes required by GAAP for complete financial statements.  These interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected any other interim period or for the year ending December 31, 2016.  At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had no subsidiaries.      Convertible Instruments and Derivatives        The Company evaluates and account for conversion options embedded in convertible instruments in accordance with ASC 815  Derivatives and Hedging Activities.       Fair Value Measurement        The Company adopted the provisions of ASC Topic 820,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures,  which defines fair value as used in numerous accounting pronouncements, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure of fair value measurements.     The estimated fair value of certain financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses are carried at historical cost basis, which approximates their fair values because of the short-term nature of these instruments. The carrying amounts of our short and long term credit obligations approximate fair value because the effective yields on these obligations, which include contractual interest rates taken together with other features such as concurrent issuances of warrants and/or embedded conversion options, are comparable to rates of returns for instruments of similar credit risk.     ASC 820 defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 820 describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:     Level 1   quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities  Level 2   quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable  Level 3   inputs that are unobservable (for example cash flow modeling inputs based on assumptions)                  6       
      Table of Contents          The derivative liability in connection with the conversion feature of the convertible debt, classified as a level 3 liability, is the only financial liability measured at fair value on a recurring basis.     The change in the level 3 financial instrument is as follows:                 The following table summarizes fair value measurement by level at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, measured at fair value on a recurring basis:              NOTE 3   GOING CONCERN        The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP, which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern. The Company has generated nominal revenues since inception, has sustained losses since its organization and requires funding to generate revenue.  These conditions raise substantial doubt as to the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.     Management anticipates that the Company will be dependent, for the near future, on additional investment capital to fund operating expenses.  The Company can give no assurances that it can or will become financially viable and continue as a going concern.      NOTE 4   STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY          Preferred Stock       The authorized preferred stock consists of 10,000,000 shares with a par value $0.001 per share. The board of directors has broad discretion in setting the rights, preferences and privileges of one or more series of preferred stock.  There were no preferred shares issued and outstanding as at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.           Common Stock       The Company has authorized 400,000,000 shares with a par value $0.001 per share.      On November 12, 2015, the Company purchased 750,000 shares of common stock from a consultant for $75.  These shares had been issued by LFC pursuant to a founders  agreement dated July 28, 2014 for $75 and were exchanged for 750,000 shares of common stock pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement.  The founders  agreement gave the Company the right to repurchase the shares at cost if she ceased to be a consultant during the first year.  The Company exercised this right and repurchased the shares.  On January 7, 2016, payment had been provided to the consultant and the shares are accounted for as being cancelled as at September 30, 2016.                  7       
      Table of Contents            Common Stock Issued for Services       On August 10 2016, the Company entered into an agreement for Institutional Funding Services/Public Relation Services. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, the Company will issue monthly, 150,000 shares of common stock as fair value payment of the monthly retainer fee upon execution of the agreement. As of September 30, 2016 the Company has issued 300,000 shares of common stock for services rendered with a fair value of $30,000 based on the market price.       NOTE 5   NOTES PAYABLE        The Company had the following notes payable as at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:             Note payable to Tangiers      On April 4, 2016, the Company entered into an investment agreement with an unrelated party.  Per the investment agreement, the investor will invest up to $5,000,000 to purchase the Company s common stock, par value of $.001 per share. In connection with the investment agreement, the Company entered into a registration rights agreement with the unrelated party which has been filed with the SEC. The maximum investment amount is equal to one hundred percent of the average of the daily trading volume of the common stock for the ten days prior to the put notice entered into by the unrelated party. The total purchase price to be paid in connection with the put notice, is calculated at eighteen percent discount of the lowest trading price of the common stock during the five consecutive trading days immediately succeeding the put notice date.     The Company issued a promissory note to the unrelated party for $100,000, as a commitment fee, which bears interest at 10% of the principle amount and matures seven months from April 4, 2016 with a possible extension to ten months based on whether the Company executes the related investment agreement within 180 days from April 4, 2016. If the registration statement is declared effective within 90 days of the execution of the investment agreement, the Company and the unrelated party agree the principal balance of the note will be immediately reduced by $40,000. The note payable will be available to be converted upon default. Per the agreement, default could occur based on: failure of payment on any outstanding amounts longer than five days after the due date, failure to issue shares after request, or failure to comply with all of the other material provisions included in the agreement. The conversion price is equal to the lower of: (a) 90% of the lowest trading price of the Company s common stock during the 25 consecutive trading days prior to the date on which the unrelated party elects to convert all or part of the note, or (b) 90% of the lowest trading price of the Company s common stock during the 25 consecutive trading days prior to the effective date of April 4, 2016. At the election of the unrelated party, at each closing date (as defined in the investment agreement) after the date which is six months after April 4, 2016, the unrelated party shall retain (or the Company shall pay to the unrelated party) an amount equal to ten percent of each Put Amount (as defined in the agreement), and the amounts shall be applied by the unrelated party as follows: first against the amount of any unpaid interest or other fees, and second against any unpaid principal amounts, until all interest, fees, and principal have been paid.      For the nine month period ending September 30, 2016, $6,000 has been accrued as interest expense.                  8       
      Table of Contents          On April 28, 2016, the Company filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to register 3,500,000 shares of common stock pursuant to the Investment Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement. On May 24, 2016, the Company received a comment letter from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding the registration statement. As of September 30, 2016 the Company is currently formulating a response to the comment letter. There can be no assurance that the registration statement will ever become effective and that the Company will ever be able to draw down on the equity line.     In addition, since the registration statement will not become effective within 90 days of the date of the Investment Agreement, the Company is not entitled to the $40,000 reduction in principal on the promissory note. As of September 30, 2016 the Company and Tangiers are having ongoing discussions and may seek to amend the terms of the promissory note.      Note Payable to Tangiers      On April 4, 2016, the Company entered into a separate promissory note of $57,500 with a $7,500 original issue discount to the unrelated party, which bears interest at 10% of the principal amount. The $57,500 promissory note matures six months from the issue date. The note may be prepaid by the company, in whole, or part, as follows: (a) under thirty days, 105% of principal amount, (b) thirty one to sixty days, 110% of principal amount, (c) sixty one to ninety days, 115% of principal amount, (d) ninety one to one hundred and twenty days, 120% of principal amount, (e) one hundred twenty one to one hundred fifty one days, 125% of principal amount, and (f) one hundred and fifty one to one hundred and eighty days, 135% of principal amount. The note payable will be available to be converted upon default. Per the agreement, default could occur based on: failure of payment on any outstanding amounts longer than five days after the due date, failure to issue shares after request, or failure to comply with all of the other material provisions included in the agreement. The conversion price shall be equal to the lower of 50% of the lowest trading price of the Company s common stock during the 20 consecutive trading days prior to the date on which the unrelated party elects to convert all or part of the note. The discount is being amortized over the life of the note using the effective interest method resulting in $7,500 of interest expense for the nine months September 30, 2016.      For the nine month period ending September 30, 2016, $5,750 has been accrued as interest expense.

Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations        The following discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 and should be read in conjunction with our financial statements, and the notes to those financial statements that are included elsewhere in this report.       Business Overview        We were incorporated in Nevada on November 29, 2006 under the name Sparking Events, Inc., and on September 16, 2013 our corporate name was changed to Cala Energy Corp., (formally, Xodtec LED, Inc.) under which we were engaged in the business of offering services, such as enhanced oil recovery and material supplies, to gas and oil fields predominantly located in Southeast Asia. We were not successful in our efforts and discontinued this line of business.  Since that time, and prior to the  Exchange Agreement  (defined below), we have been a "shell company", as such term is defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act.     On March 31, 2015, the Company, pursuant to share exchange agreement (the "Share Exchange Agreement"), among the Company, Lingerie Fighting Championships, Inc. ( LFC ), and the holders of all of the outstanding common stock and convertible notes of LFC exchanged their common stock and convertible notes of LFC for a total of 16,750,000 shares of common stock, which represented 84.70% of the Company's common stock after giving effect to the issuance of the shares pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement and the shares of common stock issued in the private placement described in the following paragraph.  The issuance of the 16,750,000 shares of common stock to the former holders of LFC's common stock and convertible notes in exchange for the capital stock of LFC is referred to as the reverse acquisition transaction.  The sole director and chief executive officer of LFC became a director and the chief executive officer of the Company.  As a result of the reverse acquisition, the Company's business has become the business of LFC.     On March 31, 2015, contemporaneously with the closing pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement, the Company issued 2,500,000 shares of common stock for a purchase price of $0.08 per share, for a total of $200,000.  The proceeds from the private placement were held in escrow on March 31, 2015, and were paid to the Company on April 2, 2015.  Accordingly, on March 31, 2015, the proceeds from the private placement are reflected as a subscription receivable.  None of the purchasers in the private placement are affiliates of the Company.  As a result of the reverse acquisition with LFC, we ceased to be a shell company on March 31, 2015.     Effective as of April 1, 2015, we changed our name to "Lingerie Fighting Championships, Inc." a name which more accurately represents our new business. We effected the name change by virtue of a short form merger, pursuant to which LFC (our wholly owned subsidiary after the LFC Acquisition) merged with and into the Company, with the Company remaining as the surviving parent corporation. In connection with the name change, we submitted to FINRA a voluntary request for the change of our OTC trading symbol. Our Common Stock now trades under the symbol  BOTY .            As a result of, and in connection with, the reverse acquisition, the Company changed its fiscal year to December 31, which was LFC's fiscal year, from a fiscal year ending February 28.     On April 20, 2015, the Company effected a one-for-800 reverse split, pursuant to which each share of common stock was converted into, and became 1/800 of a share of common stock, with fractional shares being rounded up to the next higher whole number of shares.  As a result of the reverse split, the 339,757,357 shares of common stock, then outstanding, became and were converted into 424,977 shares.  All references to shares of common stock and per share information retroactively reflect the reverse split.     We are engaged in the business of developing and marketing live entertainment involving scripted mixed marital arts events featuring attractive and athletic women, each of whom dresses as a specific character.  Prior to forming LFC, our chairman and chief executive officer, Shaun Donnelly, produced similar events which are available through the Internet.     Our revenue is derived from ticket sales, sales of products relating to our programs and revenue from the media distribution of our programs.  In general, our revenue from media distribution of our programs generally represents a percentage of the revenue generated by the media distribution companies, which is based on reports that we receive from the media distribution companies.  As a result, we do not know the revenue from our programs until we receive a report from the media distribution companies, and there is a considerable delay from the time we produce our programs until the date on which we generate revenue from the media distribution of our programs, and there may be a further delay from the time the distributors report revenue until we receive payment.     On April 28, 2016, the Company filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to register 3,500,000 shares of common stock pursuant to the Investment Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement. On May 24, 2016, the Company received a comment letter from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding the registration statement. As of September 30, 2016 the Company is currently formulating a response to the comment letter. There can be no assurance that the registration statement will ever become effective and that the Company will ever be able to draw down on the equity line.     In addition, since the registration statement will not become effective within 90 days of the date of the Investment Agreement, the Company is not entitled to the $40,000 reduction in principal on the promissory note. As of September 30, 2016 the Company and Tangiers are having ongoing discussions and may seek to amend the terms of the promissory note.      Going Concern      Our financial statements have been prepared in conformity with GAAP, which contemplate our continuation as a going concern. We have generated limited revenues since inception and we have sustained losses since our organization and we require funding to generate revenue.  These conditions raise substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern.      Management anticipates that we will be dependent, for the near future, on additional investment capital to fund operating expenses.  We can give no assurances that it can or will become financially viable and continue as a going concern.             Results of Operations       Three Months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2015       Revenues        We generated revenues of $14,963 and $18,642 for the three month period ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. This decrease in revenue was primarily due to a decrease in license revenues during the quarter.      Cost of Sales      We incurred total cost of sales of $11,395 and $30,086 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in cost of sales was primarily related to decreased payments to subcontractors and a decrease in labor costs during the period.      Operating Expenses      We incurred total operating expenses of $85,088 and $80,595 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  All of these expenses related to general and administrative expenses.  The increase in operating expenses was due primarily to an increase of legal and professional fees of approximately $16,700, a decrease in advertising expense of $12,000.      Net Loss      We incurred a net loss of $256,109 and $92,039 during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in our net loss was due to the increase in operating expenses of $4,500, an increase in interest expense of $47,557 and loss on derivative liabilities of $127,032, offset by an increase in gross profit of $15,012 for the comparative period.      Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015       Revenues      We generated revenues of $19,137 and $18,642 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in revenue was primarily due to license revenues, on-line sales and ticket revenue generated during the period.      Cost of Sales      We incurred total cost of sales of $52,469 and $43,801 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in cost of sales was primarily related increased payments to subcontractors and labor costs.              Operating Expenses      We incurred total operating expenses of $169,265 and $126,701 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  All of these expenses related to general and administrative expenses.  The increase in operating expenses was due primarily to an increase of travel expenses of approximately $31,500, an increase in commissions and fees of $6,000, an increase in office expenses of approximately $9,000. The increase in operating expenses was due to an increase in legal and professional fees of approximately $10,600 and a decrease in advertising fees of approximately $12,000.      Net Loss      We incurred a net loss of $464,217 and $157,110 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in our net loss was due to the increase in operating expenses of $42,564, along with the increase of interest expense of $76,370 and loss on derivative liabilities of $180,000, offset by an increase of revenues of $495, for the comparative period.      Liquidity and Capital Resources      At September 30, 2016, we had a working capital deficiency of $550,236.  The Company intends to fund future operations through equity financing arrangements, which may be insufficient to fund its capital expenditures, working capital and other cash requirements for the year ending December 31, 2016.     The ability of the Company to realize its business plan is dependent upon, among other things, obtaining additional financing to continue operations, and development of its business plan. In response to these problems, management intends to raise additional funds through public or private placement offerings.     These factors, among others, raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.      Cash Flows from Operating Activities      During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company s net cash used in operating activities was $(195,222) and $(149,592), respectively. The cash used in operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 related to the Company s net loss of $(464,217), loss on derivative liability of $180,000, stock   based compensation of $30,000, amortization of debt discount of $64,674 and decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $5,679.      Cash Flows from Investing Activities      During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company had cash provided by investing activities of $0 and $$2,578, respectively.      Cash Flows from Financing Activities      During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company had cash provided by financing activities of $223,675 and 169,250. The cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was related to the proceeds from convertible debt of $173,750, proceeds from promissory notes of $50,000, and payment for cancellation of common shares of $75.             Going Concern        Management anticipates that the Company will be dependent, for the near future, on additional investment capital to fund operating expenses.  The Company can give no assurances that it can or will become financially viable and continue as a going concern.      Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements      We have no off-balance sheet arrangements.      Inflation      We do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations.      Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates      The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to select appropriate accounting policies and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses.        Use of Estimates      The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts or revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.      Stock-Based Compensation      The Company recognizes compensation expense for all equity based payments in accordance with ASC 718  Share-based payments". Under fair value recognition provisions, the Company recognizes equity based compensation net of an estimated forfeiture rate and recognizes compensation cost only for those shares expected to vest over the requisite service period of the award.     Share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, are recognized as compensation expense in the financial statements based on their fair values. That expense is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award, known as the requisite service period (usually the vesting period).     The Company accounts for share based payments granted to non employees in accordance with ASC 505,  Equity Based Payments to Non Employees . The Company determines the fair value of the stock based payment as either the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. If the fair value of the equity instruments issued is used, it is measured using the stock price and other measurement assumptions as of the earlier of either (1) the date at which a commitment for performance by the counterparty to earn the equity instruments is reached, or (2) the date at which the counterparty s performance is complete.        Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.       We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information under this item.              Item 4. Controls and Procedures         Disclosure Controls and Procedures       As required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, our management evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2016.     Disclosure controls and procedures refer to controls and other procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating our disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating and implementing possible controls and procedures.     Management conducted its evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures under the supervision of our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer. Based on that evaluation, Mr. Donnelly concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September 30, 2016.       Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting       Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act. Our management is also required to assess and report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 ( Section 404 ).  At the end of our year ended December 31, 2014 and until March 31, 2015, when we completed the reverse acquisition, we were a privately-owned company and we did not perform an evaluation of our internal controls over financial reporting.  Because we have no employees other than our chief executive officer, and our chief financial officer, who performs his services on an as-needed basis and is a consultant to us, and because we do not have segregation of duties and responsibilities, we do not believe that are internal controls over financial reporting are effective, and we cannot give any assurance that we will be able to design or implement effective internal controls over financial reporting in the near future.       Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting       There were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.              PART II - OTHER INFORMATION         Item 1. Legal Proceedings       We are currently not involved in any litigation that we believe could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. There is no action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or investigation before or by any court, public board, government agency, self-regulatory organization or body pending or, to the knowledge of the executive officers of our company or any of our subsidiaries, threatened against or affecting our company, our common stock, any of our subsidiaries or of our companies or our subsidiaries  officers or directors in their capacities as such, in which an adverse decision could have a material adverse effect.       Item 1A. Risk Factors       We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and are not required to provide the information under this item.       Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds       On April 1, 2016, the Company entered into an agreement to issue a convertible promissory note to an unrelated party for an amount of $40,000 with a $6,000 original issue discount. The convertible promissory note bears interest at 10% per annum and matures twelve months from issue date. The conversion price is 55% of the lowest trading price 25 days prior to conversion.
