Cautionary Statement About Forward-Looking Statements 
  This report includes certain  forward-looking statements  within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Statements in the future tense, and all statements accompanied by terms such as  believe,   project,   expect,   estimate,   assume,   intend,   anticipate,   target,   plan,  and variations thereof and similar terms are intended to be forward-looking statements. We intend that all forward-looking statements we make will be subject to safe harbor protection of the federal securities laws pursuant to Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 
  Our disclosure and analysis in this report, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   and in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission contain forward-looking statements regarding our intent, belief and current expectations about our strategic direction, prospects and future results. From time to time, we also provide forward-looking statements in other materials we release as well as oral forward-looking statements. Such statements give our current expectations or forecasts of future events; they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. Management believes that these forward-looking statements are reasonable as and when made. However, caution should be taken not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements because such statements speak only as of the date when made. 
  Forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our historical experience and our present expectations or anticipated results. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: general economic conditions, both in the U.S. and internationally; significant competition on a local, regional, national, and international basis; changes in our relationships with our significant customers; the existing complex and stringent regulation in the U.S. and internationally, changes to which can impact our business; increased security requirements that may increase our costs of operations and reduce operating efficiencies; legal, regulatory or market responses to global climate change; negotiation and ratification of labor contracts; strikes, work stoppages and slowdowns by our employees; the effects of changing prices of energy, including gasoline, diesel and jet fuel, and interruptions in supplies of these commodities; changes in exchange rates or interest rates; our ability to maintain the image of our brand; breaches in data security; disruptions to the Internet or our technology infrastructure; our ability to accurately forecast our future capital investment needs; exposure to changing economic, political and social developments in international and emerging markets; changes in business strategy, government regulations, or economic or market conditions that may result in substantial impairment of our assets; increases in our expenses or funding obligations relating to employee health, retiree health and/or pension benefits; the potential for various claims and litigation related to labor and employment, personal injury, property damage, business practices, environmental liability and other matters; our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from acquisitions, joint ventures or strategic alliances; our ability to manage insurance and claims expenses; and other risks discussed in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   or our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2016, or described from time to time in our future reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. You should consider the limitations on, and risks associated with, forward-looking statements and not unduly rely on the accuracy of predictions contained in such forward-looking statements. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events, circumstances, changes in expectations, or the occurrence of unanticipated events after the date of those statements.

  NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
   
  NOTE   1  .   BASIS OF PRESENTATION    
  Principles of Consolidation 
  In our opinion, the accompanying interim, unaudited, consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X. These consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) necessary to present fairly our financial position as of   September 30, 2016  , our results of operations for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , and cash flows for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . The results reported in these consolidated financial statements should not be regarded as necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for any other period or the entire year. The interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
  For interim consolidated financial statement purposes, we provide for accruals under our various employee benefit plans and self-insurance reserves for each three month period based on one quarter of the estimated annual expense. 
  Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. These reclassifications had no material impact on our financial position or results of operations. 
  Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
  The carrying amounts of our cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, finance receivables and accounts payable approximate fair value as of   September 30, 2016  . The fair values of our investment securities are disclosed in note   4  , recognized multiemployer pension withdrawal liabilities in note   6  , our short and long-term debt in note   9   and our derivative instruments in note   14  .  We utilized Level 1 inputs in the fair value hierarchy of valuation techniques to determine the fair value of our cash and cash equivalents, and Level 2 inputs to determine the fair value of our accounts receivable, finance receivables and accounts payable. 
  Accounting Estimates 
  The preparation of the accompanying interim, unaudited, consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingencies at the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Estimates have been prepared on the basis of the most current and best information and actual results could differ materially from those estimates. 
   
  NOTE   2  .   RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS    
  Adoption of New Accounting Standards 
    
   In May 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued an accounting standards update that changes the disclosure requirement for reporting investments at fair value. This update removes the requirement to categorize investments for which fair value is measured using the net asset value ( NAV ) per share practical expedient within the fair value hierarchy. These disclosures are limited to investments for which the entity has elected to measure fair value using the practical expedient. Substantially all of our Level 3 pension and postretirement benefit plan assets were measured using NAV as a practical expedient. This guidance became effective for us in the first quarter of 2016 and did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  
  In June 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standards update for companies that grant their employees share-based payments in which the terms of the award provide that a performance target that affects vesting could be achieved after the requisite service period. This guidance became effective for us in the first quarter of 2015 and did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
  Other accounting pronouncements adopted during the periods covered by the consolidated financial statements did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Accounting Standards Issued But Not Yet Effective 
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standards update that addresses the classification and presentation of specific cash flow issues that currently result in diverse practices. The guidance also clarifies how the predominance principle should be applied when cash receipts and cash payments have aspects of more than one class of cash flows. The guidance will generally be applied retrospectively and becomes effective for us in the first quarter of 2018, but early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our consolidated cash flows, but do not expect this standard to have a material impact. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standards update that simplifies the income tax accounting and cash flow presentation related to share-based compensation by requiring the recognition of all excess tax benefits and deficiencies directly on the income statement and classification as cash flows from operating activities on the statement of cash flows. This update also makes several changes to the accounting for forfeitures and employee tax withholding on share-based compensation. This new guidance becomes effective for us in the first quarter of 2017, but early adoption is permitted. At this time, we do not expect this accounting standards update to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standards update that requires lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms beyond twelve months. Although the distinction between operating and finance leases will continue to exist under the new standard, the recognition and measurement of expenses and cash flows will not change significantly from the current treatment. This new guidance requires modified retrospective application and becomes effective for us in the first quarter of 2019, but early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating this update to determine the full impact of its adoption on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows and related disclosures. We expect material changes to our consolidated financial position.  
    
  In January 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standards update which addresses certain aspects of the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. The amendment will be effective for us beginning the first quarter of 2018. At this time, we do not expect this accounting standards update to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standards update that changes the revenue recognition for companies that enter into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services. This amended guidance requires revenue to be recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled for those goods and services when the performance obligation has been satisfied. This amended guidance also requires enhanced disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and related cash flows arising from contracts with customers. In August 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standards update that defers the effective date of the new revenue recognition guidance for one year, to interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted for periods beginning after December 15, 2016. In March 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standards update that further clarifies the May 2014 accounting standards update with respect to principle versus agent considerations in revenue from contracts with customers. In the second quarter of 2016, the FASB issued two accounting standard updates that provide additional guidance when identifying performance obligations and licenses as well as allowing for certain narrow scope improvements and practical expedients. These accounting standard updates have the same effective date as the original standard. The Company is planning to adopt the standard on January 1, 2018. Companies may use either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach to adopt this standard. Management is currently evaluating this standard and the related updates, including which transition approach to use, to determine the full impact of adoption. 
  Other accounting pronouncements issued, but not effective until after   September 30, 2016  , are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

NOTE   3  .   STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION    
  We issue employee share-based awards under the UPS Incentive Compensation Plan, which permits the grant of nonqualified and incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and stock units, and restricted performance shares and performance units, to eligible employees (restricted stock and stock units, restricted performance shares and performance units are herein referred to as "Restricted Units").  Upon vesting, Restricted Units result in the issuance of the equivalent number of UPS class A common shares after required tax withholdings. Dividends accrued on Restricted Units are reinvested in additional Restricted Units at each dividend payable date, and are subject to the same vesting and forfeiture conditions as the underlying Restricted Units upon which they are earned. 
  The primary compensation programs offered under the UPS Incentive Compensation Plan include the UPS Management Incentive Award program, the UPS Long-Term Incentive Performance Award program and the UPS Stock Option program. We also maintain an employee stock purchase plan which allows eligible employees to purchase shares of UPS class A common stock at a discount. Additionally, our matching contributions to the primary employee defined contribution savings plan are made in shares of UPS class A common stock. 
  Management Incentive Award Program ("MIP") 
  During the first quarter of   2016  , we granted Restricted Units under MIP to certain eligible management employees.  Restricted Units granted under MIP generally vest over a five-year period with approximately   20%   of the award vesting on January 15th of each of the years following the grant date (except in the case of death, disability, or retirement, in which case immediate vesting occurs).  The entire grant is expensed on a straight-line basis (less estimated forfeitures) ratably over the requisite service period.  Based on the date that the eligible management population and performance targets were approved for MIP, we determined the award measurement date to be February 4,   2016   (for U.S.-based employees), March 2, 2016 (for management committee employees) and March 21,   2016   (for international-based employees); therefore, the Restricted Units awarded were valued for stock compensation expense purposes using the closing New York Stock Exchange price of   $96.25  ,   $98.77   and   $105.15   on those dates, respectively.   
  Long-Term Incentive Performance Award Program ("LTIP") 
  We award Restricted Units under LTIP to certain eligible management employees. The performance targets are equally-weighted among adjusted consolidated operating return on invested capital, growth in adjusted consolidated revenue and total shareowner return relative to a peer group of companies.  These Restricted Units generally vest at the end of a   three  -year period (except in the case of death, disability, or retirement, in which case immediate vesting occurs on a prorated basis). The number of Restricted Units earned will be based on the percentage achievement of the performance targets established on the grant date.   
  For the two-thirds of the award related to consolidated operating return on invested capital and growth in consolidated revenue, we recognize the grant-date fair value of these Restricted Units (less estimated forfeitures) as compensation expense ratably over the vesting period, based on the number of awards expected to be earned.  Based on the date that the eligible management population and performance targets were approved for the 2016 LTIP Award, we determined the award measurement date to be March 24, 2016; therefore, the target Restricted Units awarded for this portion of the award were valued for stock compensation expense using the closing New York Stock Exchange price of   $105.43   on that date. 
  The remaining one-third of the award related to total shareowner return relative to a peer group is valued using a Monte Carlo model. The model utilized the following assumptions: expected volatility of   16.45%   based on historical stock volatility, a risk-free rate of return of   1.01%   and no expected dividend yield because the units earn dividend equivalents.  This portion of the award was valued with a grant date fair value of   $135.57   per unit and is recognized as compensation expense (less estimated forfeitures) ratably over the vesting period.   
  During the third quarter of 2016, the UPS Compensation Committee approved changes to the compensation arrangements of certain executive officers. These changes include a one-time grant of additional Restricted Units that will vest over the same period as the 2016 LTIP award. Based on the date that the Compensation Committee approved this additional compensation, we determined the award measurement date to be September 16, 2016; therefore, the target Restricted Units awarded for the portion of the award related to consolidated operating return on invested capital and growth in consolidated revenue, were valued for stock compensation expense using the closing New York Stock Exchange price of   $106.86   on that date.

  NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

The remaining one-third of the award related to total shareowner return relative to a peer group is valued using a Monte Carlo model. The model utilized the following assumptions: expected volatility of   16.61%   based on historical stock volatility, a risk-free rate of return of   0.81%   and no expected dividend yield because the units earn dividend equivalents.  This portion of the award was valued with a grant date fair value of   $147.90   per unit and is recognized as compensation expense (less estimated forfeitures) ratably over the vesting period.   
  Nonqualified Stock Options 
  During the first quarter of   2016  , we granted nonqualified stock option awards to a limited group of eligible senior management employees under the UPS Stock Option program. Stock option awards generally vest over a   five  -year period with approximately   20%   of the award vesting at each anniversary date of the grant (except in the case of death, disability, or retirement, in which case immediate vesting occurs).  The options granted will expire   ten   years after the date of the grant.  In the first quarter of   2016   and   2015  , we granted   0.2   million stock options, respectively, at a grant price of   $98.77   and $  101.93  , respectively. The grant price was based on the closing New York Stock Exchange price of March 2, 2016 and March 2, 2015, respectively.  
  During the third quarter of 2016, the UPS Compensation Committee approved changes to the compensation arrangements of certain executive officers. These changes include a one-time grant of   0.1 million   nonqualified stock options at a grant price of $106.86 pursuant to the terms and conditions of the UPS Stock Option program. The grant price was based on the closing New York Stock Exchange price of September 16, 2016. These stock options will vest ratably over   five   years with approximately   20%   of the award vesting at each anniversary date of the grant (except in the case of death, disability, or retirement, in which case immediate vesting occurs). The options granted will expire   ten   years after the date of the grant.  
  The weighted average fair value of our employee stock options granted, as determined by the Black-Scholes valuation model, was   $14.09   for the third quarter 2016 award,   $17.32   for the first quarter 2016 award and $  18.07   for the 2015 award using the following assumptions: 

Compensation expense for share-based awards recognized in net income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was   $125   and   $124   million pre-tax, respectively. Compensation expense for share-based awards recognized in net income for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $471   and $  452   million pre-tax, respectively.

Investment Other-Than-Temporary Impairments 
  We have concluded that no material other-than-temporary impairment losses existed as of   September 30, 2016  . In making this determination, we considered the financial condition and prospects of the issuers, the magnitude of the losses compared with the investments  cost, the length of time the investments have been in an unrealized loss position, the probability that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the securities, the credit rating of the securities and our ability and intent to hold these investments until the anticipated recovery in market value occurs. 
  Maturity Information 
  The amortized cost and estimated fair value of marketable securities at   September 30, 2016  , by contractual maturity, are shown below (in millions). Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because the issuers of the securities may have the right to prepay obligations without prepayment penalties. 

Non-Current Investments and Restricted Cash 
  We had $  444   and $  442   million of restricted cash related to our self-insurance requirements as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   which is reported in non-current investments and restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheets. This restricted cash is primarily invested in money market funds. 
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we held a   $19   million investment in a variable life insurance policy to fund benefits for the UPS Excess Coordinating Benefit Plan.  Additionally, we held escrowed cash related to the acquisition and disposition of certain assets of   $22   and   $12   million as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The amounts described above are classified as non-current investments and restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheets, while the quarterly change in investment fair value is recognized in investment income and other on the statements of consolidated income.  
  Fair Value Measurements 
  Marketable securities utilizing Level 1 inputs include active exchange-traded carbon credit investments and certain U.S. Government debt securities, as these securities have quoted prices in active markets. Marketable securities utilizing Level 2 inputs include asset-backed and equity securities and corporate, government, and municipal bonds. These securities are valued using market corroborated pricing, matrix pricing or other models that utilize observable inputs such as yield curves. 
  We maintain holdings in certain investment partnerships that are measured at fair value utilizing Level 3 inputs (classified as other non-current investments in the tables below and as other non-current assets in the consolidated balance sheets). These partnership holdings do not have quoted prices, nor can they be valued using inputs based on observable market data. These investments are valued internally using a discounted cash flow model with two significant inputs:  (1) the after-tax cash flow projections for each partnership and (2) the risk-adjusted discount rate consistent with the duration of the expected cash flows for each partnership.  The weighted-average discount rates used to value these investments were   7.49%   and   8.22%   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  These inputs, and the resulting fair values, are updated on a quarterly basis.

NOTE   6  .   EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS    
  Company-Sponsored Benefit Plans 
  Information about net periodic benefit cost for our company-sponsored pension and postretirement benefit plans is as follows for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   (in millions):  

During the first   nine   months of   2016  , we contributed $  1.227   billion and   $71   million to our company-sponsored pension and U.S. postretirement medical benefit plans, respectively.  We also expect to contribute   $9   and   $30   million over the remainder of the year to the pension and U.S. postretirement medical benefit plans, respectively.  
  The UPS Retirement Plan (a single-employer defined benefit pension plan sponsored by UPS) was closed to new non-union participants effective July 1, 2016. The Company amended the UPS 401(k) Savings Plan so that employees who previously would have been eligible for participation in the UPS Retirement Plan will, in addition to current benefits under the UPS 401(k) Savings Plan, begin receiving a UPS Retirement Contribution. For employees eligible to receive the Retirement Contribution, UPS will contribute   3%   to   8%   of eligible pay to the UPS 401(k) Savings Plan based on years of vesting service and business unit. Contributions will be made annually in cash to the accounts of participants who are employed on December 31 of each calendar year and become vested after the employee reaches three complete years of service.  
  Multiemployer Benefit Plans 
  We contribute to a number of multiemployer defined benefit and health and welfare plans under terms of collective bargaining agreements that cover our union-represented employees. Our current collective bargaining agreements set forth the annual contribution increases allotted to the plans that we participate in, and we are in compliance with these contribution rates. These limitations on annual contribution rates will remain in effect throughout the terms of the existing collective bargaining agreements. 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   we had $  867   and   $872 million  , respectively, recognized in "other non-current liabilities" on our consolidated balance sheets associated with our previous withdrawal from a multiemployer pension plan. This liability is payable in equal monthly installments over a remaining term of approximately   46   years. Based on the borrowing rates currently available to the Company for long-term financing of a similar maturity, the fair value of this withdrawal liability as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   was $  941   and $  841 million  , respectively. We utilized Level 2 inputs in the fair value hierarchy of valuation techniques to determine the fair value of this liability.

  NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

UPS was a contributing employer to the Central States Pension Fund ( CSPF ) until 2007 when we withdrew from the plan and fully funded our allocable share of unfunded vested benefits by paying a   $6.1 billion   withdrawal liability. Under a collective bargaining agreement with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, UPS agreed to provide coordinating benefits in the UPS/IBT Full Time Employee Pension Plan ( UPS/IBT Plan ) for UPS participants retiring on or after January 1, 2008 in the event that benefits are lawfully reduced by the CSPF in the future. 
    
  In December 2014, Congress passed the Multiemployer Pension Reform Act ( MPRA ), which for the first time ever allowed multiemployer pension plans to reduce benefit payments to retirees, subject to specific guidelines in the statute and government oversight. In September 2015, the CSPF submitted a proposed pension benefit reduction plan to the U.S. Department of the Treasury under the MPRA. The CSPF plan proposed to reduce retirement benefits to the CSPF participants, including UPS participants retiring on or after January 1, 2008. We vigorously challenged the proposed benefit reduction plan because we believed that it did not comply with the law and that certain actions by the CSPF were invalid. On May 6, 2016, the U.S. Department of the Treasury rejected the proposed plan submitted by the CSPF, stating that it failed to satisfy a number of requirements set forth in the MPRA.  
  The CSPF has asserted that it will become insolvent in 2025 which could lead to the reduction of retirement benefits. Although there are numerous factors that could affect the CSPF s status, if the CSPF were to become insolvent as they have projected , UPS may be required to provide coordinating benefits, thereby increasing the current projected benefit obligation for the UPS/IBT Plan by approximately   $4 billion  . The CSPF has said that it believes a legislative solution to its funding status is necessary, and we expect that the CSPF will continue to explore options to avoid insolvency. 
   The potential obligation to pay coordinating benefits from the UPS/IBT Plan is subject to a number of uncertainties, including actions that may be taken by the CSPF, the federal government or others. These actions include whether the CSPF will submit a revised pension benefit reduction plan or otherwise seek federal government assistance, the extent to which benefits are paid by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, as well as the effect of discount rates and various other actuarial assumptions. The numerous uncertainties that exist regarding the ultimate resolution of the CSPF situation prevent us from making reliable estimates of the timing and amount, if any, of CSPF benefit reductions that could result in additional benefit obligations for the UPS/IBT Plan. Therefore, we have not recognized any liability for additional coordinating benefits of the UPS/IBT Plan, but the current projected benefit obligation could materially increase as these uncertainties are resolved. We will continue to assess the impact of these uncertainties on the projected benefit obligation of the UPS/IBT Plan in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 715 - Compensation - Retirement Benefits.  
  Collective Bargaining Agreements 
  As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately   266,000   employees employed under a national master agreement and various supplemental agreements with local unions affiliated with the Teamsters. In addition, our airline pilots, airline mechanics, ground mechanics and certain other employees are employed under other collective bargaining agreements. In 2014, the Teamsters ratified a new national master agreement ( NMA ) with UPS that will expire on July 31, 2018. The economic provisions in the NMA included wage rate increases, as well as increased contribution rates for healthcare and pension benefits. Most of these economic provisions were retroactive to August 1, 2013, which was the effective date of the NMA. During the first quarter of 2015, we remitted $  53   million for these retroactive economic benefits. 
  We have approximately   2,600   pilots who are employed under a collective bargaining agreement with the Independent Pilots Association ("IPA"), which became amendable at the end of 2011. On June 30, 2016, the IPA and the Company announced a tentative agreement on a new five-year labor contract. On August 31, 2016, the IPA members voted to ratify the agreement. Terms of the agreement became effective September 1, 2016 and run through September 1, 2021. The economic provisions in the agreement included pay increases, a signing bonus and enhanced pension benefits.  
  Our airline mechanics are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with Teamsters Local 2727, which became amendable November 1, 2013. We are currently in negotiations with Teamsters Local 2727 for a new agreement. In addition, approximately   3,100   of our auto and maintenance mechanics who are not employed under agreements with the Teamsters are employed under collective bargaining agreements with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers ( IAM ) that will expire on July 31, 2019.

NOTE   8  .   BUSINESS COMBINATIONS    
  In 2016 and 2015, we acquired several businesses that were not material, individually or in the aggregate, to our consolidated financial position or results of operations. These acquisitions were funded with cash from operations. In March 2015, we acquired Poltraf Sp z.o.o. ("Poltraf"), a Polish-based pharmaceutical logistics company recognized for its temperature-sensitive warehousing and transportation solutions. In May 2015 and June 2015, we acquired Parcel Pro, Inc. ("Parcel Pro") and the Insured Parcel Services division of G4S International Logistics ("IPS"), respectively. These businesses provide services and insurance coverage for the transport of high value luxury goods.   
  In August 2015, we acquired Coyote Logistics Midco, Inc. ("Coyote"), a U.S.-based truckload freight brokerage company, for   $1.829 billion  . This acquisition allows us to expand our existing portfolio by adding large scale truckload freight brokerage and transportation management services to our Supply Chain   Freight reporting segment. In addition, we will continue to benefit from synergies in purchased transportation, backhaul utilization, cross-selling to customers, as well as technology systems and industry best practices. The acquisition was funded using cash from operations and issuances of commercial paper.  The final purchase price allocation was completed in the third quarter of 2016 and there were no material adjustments recorded.  
  The financial results of these acquired businesses are included in the Supply Chain   Freight segment from the date of acquisition and were not material to our results of operations.

  The carrying value of our outstanding debt as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   consists of the following (in millions): 

Debt Issuances 
  In March, June and August 2016, we issued floating rate senior notes in principal amounts of   $118  , $  74   and $  35   million, respectively. These notes bear interest at three-month LIBOR less   30   basis points and mature in   2066  . These notes are callable at various times after   30   years at a stated percentage of par value, and putable by the note holders at various times after   one   year at a stated percentage of par value.  
  On October 19, 2016, we issued U.S. and Euro senior rate notes in two separate transactions. These senior notes consist of three separate series, as follows:  
             
    Two series of notes, each in the principal amount of   $500   million, were issued.  These notes bear interest at   2.4%   and   3.4%   fixed rates and are due November   2026   and November   2046  , respectively.  Interest on these notes is payable semi-annually, in each case beginning May 15, 2017. Each note is callable at our option at a redemption price equal to the greater of   100%   of the principal amount, or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon discounted to the redemption date at a benchmark treasury yield plus   10   and   15   basis points, respectively, and accrued interest.

  NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

Notes in the principal amount of    500   million (  $549 million  ) were issued.  These notes bear interest at a   1.0%   fixed rate and are due November   2028  .  Interest on these notes is payable annually, beginning November 15, 2017. The notes are callable at our option at a redemption price equal to the greater of   100%   of the principal amount, or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon discounted to the date of redemption at a benchmark comparable German government bond yield plus   15   basis points and accrued interest.  
     Sources of Credit 
  We are authorized to borrow up to $  10.0   billion under a U.S. commercial paper program and    5.0   billion (in a variety of currencies) under a European commercial paper program. We had the following amounts outstanding under these programs as of   September 30, 2016  : $  2.580   billion with an average interest rate of   0.45%   and    1.056   billion ($  1.179   billion) with an average interest rate of   -0.35%  . As of   September 30, 2016  , we have classified the entire commercial paper balance as a current liability on our consolidated balance sheet. 
  We maintain   two   credit agreements with a consortium of banks. One of these agreements provides revolving credit facilities of   $1.5   billion, and expires on   March 24, 2017  . Generally, amounts outstanding under this facility bear interest at a periodic fixed rate equal to LIBOR for the applicable interest period and currency denomination, plus an applicable margin. Alternatively, a fluctuating rate of interest equal to the highest of (1) JPMorgan Chase Bank s publicly announced prime rate; (2) the Federal Funds effective rate plus   0.50%  ; and (3) LIBOR for a one month interest period plus   1.00%  , plus an applicable margin, may be used at our discretion. In each case, the applicable margin for advances bearing interest based on LIBOR is a percentage determined by quotations from Markit Group Ltd. for our 1-year credit default swap spread, subject to a minimum rate of   0.10%   and a maximum rate of   0.75%  . The applicable margin for advances bearing interest based on the prime rate is   1.00%   below the applicable margin for LIBOR advances (but not lower than   0.00%  ). We are also able to request advances under this facility based on competitive bids for the applicable interest rate. There were no amounts outstanding under this facility as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  The second agreement provides revolving credit facilities of $  3.0   billion, and expires on   March 25, 2021  . Generally, amounts outstanding under this facility bear interest at a periodic fixed rate equal to LIBOR for the applicable interest period and currency denomination, plus an applicable margin. Alternatively, a fluctuating rate of interest equal to the highest of (1) JPMorgan Chase Bank s publicly announced prime rate; (2) the Federal Funds effective rate plus   0.50%  ; and (3) LIBOR for a one month interest period plus   1.00%  , plus an applicable margin, may be used at our discretion. In each case, the applicable margin for advances bearing interest based on LIBOR is a percentage determined by quotations from Markit Group Ltd. for our 1-year credit default swap spread, interpolated for a period from the date of determination of such credit default swap spread in connection with a new interest period until the latest maturity date of this facility then in effect (but not less than a period of one year). The minimum applicable margin rate is   0.10%   and the maximum applicable margin rate is   0.75%   per annum. The applicable margin for advances bearing interest based on the prime rate is   1.00%   below the applicable margin for LIBOR advances (but not less than   0.00%  ). We are also able to request advances under this facility based on competitive bids. There were no amounts outstanding under this facility as of   September 30, 2016  .  
  Debt Covenants 
  Our existing debt instruments and credit facilities subject us to certain financial covenants. As of   September 30, 2016   and for all prior periods, we have satisfied these financial covenants. These covenants limit the amount of secured indebtedness that we may incur, and limit the amount of attributable debt in sale-leaseback transactions, to   10%   of net tangible assets. As of   September 30, 2016  , 10% of net tangible assets was equivalent to   $2.248   billion; however, we have no covered sale-leaseback transactions or secured indebtedness outstanding. We do not expect these covenants to have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity. 
  Fair Value of Debt 
  Based on the borrowing rates currently available to the Company for long-term debt with similar terms and maturities, the fair value of long-term debt, including current maturities, was approximately $  17.330   billion and $  15.524   billion as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  We utilized Level 2 inputs in the fair value hierarchy of valuation techniques to determine the fair value of all of our debt instruments.

Contractual Commitments 
  We have contractual obligations and commitments for the purchase of aircraft, vehicles, technology equipment and building and leasehold improvements. On October 27, 2016, we placed an order for   14   Boeing 747-8 freighters to be delivered between 2017 and 2020. The agreement also includes an option to purchase an additional   14   747-8 freighters. In addition, we have new purchase commitments for aircraft engines, equipment and hub automation and expansion projects.  These new purchase commitments will provide additional capacity for increased demand for our air and ground shipping services. Including these additional obligations, the expected cash outflow to satisfy our total purchase commitments is as follows (in millions): 2016 (remaining) -   $466  ; 2017 -   $1,020  ; 2018 -   $1,010  ; 2019 -   $611  ; 2020 -   $347  ; and thereafter -   $65  .

NOTE   10  .   LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CONTINGENCIES 
  We are involved in a number of judicial proceedings and other matters arising from the conduct of our business activities. 
    
  Although there can be no assurance as to the ultimate outcome, we have generally denied, or believe we have a meritorious defense and will deny, liability in all litigation pending against us, including (except as otherwise noted herein) the matters described below, and we intend to defend vigorously each case. We have accrued for legal claims when, and to the extent that, amounts associated with the claims become probable and can be reasonably estimated. The actual costs of resolving legal claims may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts accrued for those claims. 
  For those matters as to which we are not able to estimate a possible loss or range of loss, we are not able to determine whether the loss will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations or liquidity. For matters in this category, we have indicated in the descriptions that follow the reasons that we are unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss. 
  Judicial Proceedings  
  We are a defendant in a number of lawsuits filed in state and federal courts containing various class action allegations under state wage-and-hour laws. At this time, we do not believe that any loss associated with these matters would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.  
  UPS and our subsidiary The UPS Store, Inc., are defendants in Morgate v. The UPS Store, Inc. et al., an action in the Los Angeles Superior Court brought on behalf of a certified class of all franchisees who chose to rebrand their Mail Boxes Etc. franchises to The UPS Store in March 2003. Plaintiff alleges that UPS and The UPS Store, Inc. misrepresented and omitted facts to the class about the market tests that were conducted before offering the class the choice of whether to rebrand to The UPS Store. Trial is scheduled for mid-2017. 
  There are multiple factors that prevent us from being able to estimate the amount of loss, if any, that may result from the remaining aspects of this case, including: (1) we are vigorously defending ourselves and believe we have a number of meritorious legal defenses; and (2) it remains uncertain what evidence of damages, if any, plaintiffs will be able to present. Accordingly, at this time, we are not able to estimate a possible loss or range of loss that may result from this matter or to determine whether such loss, if any, would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.  
  In AFMS LLC v. UPS and FedEx Corporation, a lawsuit filed in federal court in the Central District of California in August 2010, the plaintiff asserts that UPS and FedEx violated U.S. antitrust law by conspiring to refuse to negotiate with third-party negotiators retained by shippers and by individually imposing policies that prevent shippers from using such negotiators. The Court granted summary judgment motions filed by UPS and FedEx, entered judgment in favor of UPS and FedEx, and dismissed the case. Plaintiff appealed, and briefing is now complete before the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice ( DOJ ) opened a civil investigation of our policies and practices for dealing with third-party negotiators. We have cooperated with this investigation. We deny any liability with respect to these matters and intend to vigorously defend ourselves. There are multiple factors that prevent us from being able to estimate the amount of loss, if any, that may result from these matters including: (1) the DOJ investigation is pending; (2) the Court granted our motion for summary judgment; and (3) the appeal remains pending. Accordingly, at this time, we are not able to estimate a possible loss or range of loss that may result from these matters or to determine whether such loss, if any, would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

In Canada,   four   purported class-action cases were filed against us in British Columbia (2006); Ontario (2007) and Qu bec (2006 and 2013). The cases each allege inadequate disclosure concerning the existence and cost of brokerage services provided by us under applicable provincial consumer protection legislation and infringement of interest restriction provisions under the Criminal Code of Canada. The British Columbia class action was declared inappropriate for certification and dismissed by the trial judge. That decision was upheld by the British Columbia Court of Appeal in March 2010, which ended the case in our favor. The Ontario class action was certified in September 2011. Partial summary judgment was granted to us and the plaintiffs by the Ontario motions court. The complaint under the Criminal Code was dismissed. No appeal is being taken from that decision. The allegations of inadequate disclosure were granted and we are appealing that decision. The motion to authorize the 2006 Qu bec litigation as a class action was dismissed by the motions judge in October 2012; there was no appeal, which ended that case in our favor.  The 2013 Qu bec litigation also has been dismissed.  We deny all liability and are vigorously defending the   one   outstanding case in Ontario. There are multiple factors that prevent us from being able to estimate the amount of loss, if any, that may result from this matter, including: (1) we are vigorously defending ourselves and believe that we have a number of meritorious legal defenses; and (2) there are unresolved questions of law and fact that could be important to the ultimate resolution of this matter. Accordingly, at this time, we are not able to estimate a possible loss or range of loss that may result from this matter or to determine whether such loss, if any, would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.  
  In February 2015, the State and City of New York filed suit against UPS in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, arising from alleged shipments of cigarettes to New York State and City residents. The complaint asserts claims under various federal and state laws.  The complaint also includes a claim that UPS violated the Assurance of Discontinuance it entered into with the New York Attorney General in 2005 concerning cigarette deliveries. Trial was held in September, 2016, and closing arguments were held on November 2, 2016. There are multiple factors that prevent us from being able to estimate the amount of loss, if any, that may result from this case, including: (1) we are vigorously defending ourselves and believe we have a number of meritorious factual and legal defenses; and (2) it remains uncertain how the Court will resolve the State and City s various claims and our defenses. Accordingly, at this time, we are not able to estimate a possible loss or range of loss that may result from this matter or to determine whether such loss, if any, would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. 
  On May 2, 2016, a purported shareowner derivative suit was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery naming certain of UPS s current and former officers and directors as defendants, alleging that they breached their fiduciary duties by failing to monitor UPS s compliance with the Assurance of Discontinuance and other federal and state laws relating to cigarette deliveries. The Company s and individual defendants  motion to dismiss was heard in October, 2016. 
  We are a defendant in various other lawsuits that arose in the normal course of business. We do not believe that the eventual resolution of these other lawsuits (either individually or in the aggregate), including any reasonably possible losses in excess of current accruals, will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. 
  Other Matters  
  In August 2010, competition authorities in Brazil opened an administrative proceeding to investigate alleged anticompetitive behavior in the freight forwarding industry. Approximately   45   freight forwarding companies and individuals are named in the proceeding, including UPS, UPS SCS Transportes (Brasil) S.A., and a former employee in Brazil. UPS submitted its written defenses to these allegations in April 2014. We are cooperating with this investigation, and intend to continue to vigorously defend ourselves.  There are multiple factors that prevent us from being able to estimate the amount of loss, if any, that may result from this matter including: (1) we are vigorously defending the matter and believe that we have a number of meritorious legal defenses; (2) there are unresolved questions of law that could be of importance to the ultimate resolutions of this matter, including the calculation of any potential fine; and (3) there is uncertainty about the time period that is the subject of the investigation. Accordingly, at this time, we are not able to estimate a possible loss or range of loss that may result from this matter or to determine whether such loss, if any, would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.

NOTE   11  .   SHAREOWNERS' EQUITY    
  Capital Stock, Additional Paid-In Capital and Retained Earnings 
  We maintain   two   classes of common stock, which are distinguished from each other primarily by their respective voting rights. Class A shares are entitled to   10   votes per share, whereas class B shares are entitled to   one   vote per share. Class A shares are primarily held by UPS employees and retirees, and these shares are fully convertible on a one-to-one basis into class B shares at any time. Class B shares are publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol  UPS .  Class A and B shares both have a   $0.01   par value, and as of   September 30, 2016  , there were   4.6   billion class A shares and   5.6   billion class B shares authorized to be issued. Additionally, there are   200   million preferred shares, with a   $0.01   par value, authorized to be issued. As of   September 30, 2016  ,   no   preferred shares had been issued. 
     
  The following is a rollforward of our common stock, additional paid-in capital and retained earnings accounts for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   (in millions, except per share amounts): 

We repurchased   19.3   million shares of class A and class B common stock for   $2.004   billion during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , and   20.2   million shares for   $2.035   billion during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . During the first quarter of 2016, we also exercised a capped call option that we entered into in 2015 for which we received   0.2 million   UPS class B shares. The   $25 million   premium payment for this capped call option reduced shareowners' equity in 2015. In total, shares repurchased and received in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were   19.5 million   shares for   $2.029 billion  . In May 2016, the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase authorization of   $8.0   billion, which has no expiration date. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $6.831 billion   of this share repurchase authorization available.

From time to time, we enter into share repurchase programs with large financial institutions to assist in our buyback of company stock. These programs allow us to repurchase our shares at a price below the weighted average UPS share price for a given period. During the   third   quarter of 2016, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase program which allowed us to repurchase   2.8   million shares for $  300   million. The program was completed in September 2016. 
  In order to lower the average cost of acquiring shares in our ongoing share repurchase program, we periodically enter into structured repurchase agreements involving the use of capped call options for the purchase of UPS class B shares. We pay a fixed sum of cash upon execution of each agreement in exchange for the right to receive either a pre-determined amount of cash or stock. Upon expiration of each agreement, if the closing market price of our common stock is above the pre-determined price, we will have our initial investment returned with a premium in either cash or shares (at our election). If the closing market price of our common stock is at or below the pre-determined price, we will receive the number of shares specified in the agreement.  We received (paid) net premiums of   $155   and   $(69)   million during the first   nine   months of   2016   and   2015  , respectively, related to entering into and settling capped call options for the purchase of class B shares.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   no   capped call options outstanding. 
  Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) 
  We experience activity in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) ("AOCI") for unrealized holding gains and losses on available-for-sale securities, foreign currency translation adjustments, unrealized gains and losses from derivatives that qualify as hedges of cash flows and unrecognized pension and postretirement benefit costs.

NOTE   12  .   SEGMENT INFORMATION    
  We report our operations in   three   segments: U.S. Domestic Package operations, International Package operations and Supply Chain   Freight operations. Package operations represent our most significant business and are broken down into regional operations around the world. Regional operations managers are responsible for both domestic and export operations within their geographic area. 
  U.S. Domestic Package 
  Domestic Package operations include the time-definite delivery of letters, documents and packages throughout the United States. 
  International Package 
  International Package operations include delivery to more than   220   countries and territories worldwide, including shipments wholly outside the United States, as well as U.S. export and U.S. import shipments. Our International Package reporting segment includes the operations of our Europe, Asia, Americas and ISMEA (Indian Subcontinent, Middle East and Africa) operating segments. 
  Supply Chain   Freight 
  Supply Chain   Freight includes the operations of our forwarding, logistics, Coyote, UPS Freight and other aggregated business units. Our forwarding, logistics and Coyote units provide services in more than   195   countries and territories worldwide, and include North American and international air and ocean freight forwarding, customs brokerage, truckload freight brokerage, distribution and post-sales services and mail and consulting services. UPS Freight offers a variety of less-than-truckload ( LTL ) and truckload ( TL ) services to customers in North America. Other aggregated business units within this segment include The UPS Store and UPS Capital. 
  In evaluating financial performance, we focus on operating profit as a segment s measure of profit or loss. Operating profit is before investment income, interest expense and income taxes. The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those described in the summary of accounting policies included in the consolidated financial statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , with certain expenses allocated between the segments using activity-based costing methods.

NOTE   14  .   DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT    
  Risk Management Policies 
  We are exposed to market risk, primarily related to foreign exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates. These exposures are actively monitored by management. To manage the volatility relating to certain of these exposures, we enter into a variety of derivative financial instruments. Our objective is to reduce, where it is deemed appropriate to do so, fluctuations in earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency rates, commodity prices and interest rates. It is our policy and practice to use derivative financial instruments only to the extent necessary to manage exposures. As we use price sensitive instruments to hedge a certain portion of our existing and anticipated transactions, we expect that any loss in value for those instruments generally would be offset by increases in the value of those hedged transactions. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. 
  Credit Risk Management 
  The forward contracts, swaps and options discussed below contain an element of risk that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreements; however, we minimize such risk exposures for these instruments by limiting the counterparties to banks and financial institutions that meet established credit guidelines, and by monitoring counterparty credit risk to prevent concentrations of credit risk with any single counterparty. 
   We have agreements with all of our active counterparties (covering the majority of our derivative positions) containing early termination rights and/or zero threshold bilateral collateral provisions whereby cash is required based on the net fair value of derivatives associated with those counterparties. Events such as a counterparty credit rating downgrade (depending on the ultimate rating level) could also allow us to take additional protective measures such as the early termination of trades. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we held cash collateral of $  487   and $  717   million, respectively, under these agreements; this collateral is included in "cash and cash equivalents" on the consolidated balance sheets and its use by UPS is not restricted.  
  In connection with the zero threshold bilateral collateral provisions described above, we were not required to post any collateral with our counterparties as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  As of those dates, there were no instruments in a net liability position that were not covered by the zero threshold bilateral collateral provisions. Additionally, in connection with the agreements described above, we could be required to terminate transactions with certain counterparties in the event of a downgrade of our credit rating.   
  We have not historically incurred, and do not expect to incur in the future, any losses as a result of counterparty default.  
  Accounting Policy for Derivative Instruments 
  We recognize all derivative instruments as assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and, further, on the type of hedging relationship. For those derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments, a company must designate the derivative, based upon the exposure being hedged, as a cash flow hedge, a fair value hedge or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation. 
  A cash flow hedge refers to hedging the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of AOCI, and reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. The remaining gain or loss on the derivative instrument in excess of the cumulative change in the present value of future cash flows of the hedged item, or hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness, are recognized in the statements of consolidated income during the current period. 
  A fair value hedge refers to hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of an existing asset or liability on the consolidated balance sheets that is attributable to a particular risk. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is recognized in the statements of consolidated income during the current period, as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item. 
  A net investment hedge refers to the use of cross currency swaps, forward contracts or foreign currency denominated debt to hedge portions of our net investments in foreign operations. For hedges that meet the effectiveness requirements, the net gains or losses attributable to changes in spot exchange rates are recorded in the foreign currency translation adjustment within AOCI. The remainder of the change in value of such instruments is recorded in earnings.

Types of Hedges 
  Commodity Risk Management 
  Currently, the fuel surcharges that we apply to our domestic and international package and LTL services are the primary means of reducing the risk of adverse fuel price changes on our business. We periodically enter into option contracts on energy commodity products to manage the price risk associated with forecasted transactions involving refined fuels, principally jet-A, diesel and unleaded gasoline. The objective of the hedges is to reduce the variability of cash flows, due to changing fuel prices, associated with the forecasted transactions involving those products. We normally designate and account for these contracts as cash flow hedges of the underlying forecasted transactions involving these fuel products and, therefore, the resulting gains and losses from these hedges are recognized as a component of fuel expense or revenue when the underlying transactions occur. 
  Foreign Currency Risk Management 
  To protect against the reduction in value of forecasted foreign currency cash flows from our international package business, we maintain a foreign currency cash flow hedging program. Our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the Euro, British Pound Sterling, Canadian Dollar, Chinese Renminbi and Hong Kong Dollar. We hedge portions of our forecasted revenue denominated in foreign currencies with option and forward contracts. We normally designate and account for these contracts as cash flow hedges of anticipated foreign currency denominated revenue and, therefore, the resulting gains and losses from these hedges are recognized as a component of international package revenue when the underlying sales transactions occur. 
  We also hedge portions of our anticipated cash settlements of intercompany transactions and interest payments on certain debt subject to foreign currency remeasurement using foreign currency forward contracts. We normally designate and account for these contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted foreign currency denominated transactions; therefore, the resulting gains and losses from these hedges are recognized as a component of investment income and other when the underlying transactions are subject to currency remeasurement.  
  We hedge our net investment in certain foreign operations with foreign currency denominated debt instruments. The use of foreign denominated debt as the hedging instrument allows the debt to be remeasured to foreign currency translation adjustment within AOCI to offset the translation risk from those investments. Any ineffective portion of net investment hedging is recognized as a component of investment income and other. Balances in the cumulative translation adjustment accounts remain until the sale or complete liquidation of the foreign entity.  
  Interest Rate Risk Management 
  Our indebtedness under our various financing arrangements creates interest rate risk. We use a combination of derivative instruments as part of our program to manage the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing. The notional amount, interest payment date and maturity date of the swaps match the terms of the associated debt being hedged. Interest rate swaps allow us to maintain a target range of floating rate debt within our capital structure. 
  We have designated and account for the majority of our interest rate swaps that convert fixed rate interest payments into floating rate interest payments as hedges of the fair value of the associated debt instruments. Therefore, the gains and losses resulting from fair value adjustments to the interest rate swaps and fair value adjustments to the associated debt instruments are recorded to interest expense in the period in which the gains and losses occur. We normally designate and account for interest rate swaps that convert floating rate interest payments into fixed rate interest payments as cash flow hedges of the forecasted payment obligations.  
  We periodically hedge the forecasted fixed-coupon interest payments associated with anticipated debt offerings, using forward starting interest rate swaps, interest rate locks or similar derivatives. These agreements effectively lock a portion of our interest rate exposure between the time the agreement is entered into and the date when the debt offering is completed, thereby mitigating the impact of interest rate changes on future interest expense. These derivatives are settled commensurate with the issuance of the debt, and any gain or loss upon settlement is amortized as an adjustment to the effective interest yield on the debt.

  We have master netting arrangements with substantially all of our counterparties giving us the right of offset for our derivative positions.  However, we have not elected to offset the fair value positions of our derivative contracts recorded on our consolidated balance sheets.  The columns labeled "Net Amounts if Right of Offset had been Applied" indicate the potential net fair value positions by type of contract and location on the consolidated balance sheets had we elected to apply the right of offset.

Our foreign currency, interest rate and investment market price derivatives are largely comprised of over-the-counter derivatives, which are primarily valued using pricing models that rely on market observable inputs such as yield curves, currency exchange rates and investment forward prices; therefore, these derivatives are classified as Level 2.

Additionally, we maintain some interest rate swaps, foreign currency forwards and investment market price forward contracts that are not designated as hedges. These interest rate swap contracts are intended to provide an economic hedge of a portfolio of interest bearing receivables. These foreign exchange forward contracts are intended to provide an economic offset to foreign currency remeasurement and settlement risk for certain assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. These investment market price forward contracts are intended to provide an economic offset to fair value fluctuations of certain investments in marketable securities. 
  We also periodically terminate interest rate swaps and foreign currency options by entering into offsetting swap and foreign currency positions with different counterparties. As part of this process, we de-designate our original swap and foreign currency contracts. These transactions provide an economic offset that effectively eliminates the effects of changes in market valuation.

NOTE   15  .   INCOME TAXES    
  Our effective tax rate increased to   35.0%   in the   third   quarter of   2016   from   34.0%   in the same period of   2015   (  35.1%   year-to-date in   2016   compared to   34.6%   in the same period of   2015  ), primarily due to the prior year rate including   $23 million   of net discrete tax benefits related to adjustments of deferred tax balances, the U.S. tax liability accrual associated with a planned distribution of cash from a Canadian subsidiary to its U.S. parent and increases in our reserves for uncertain tax positions. 
  During the reconciliation of our deferred tax balances in 2015 after filing our annual federal and state tax returns, we identified adjustments to be made in the prior years  deferred tax balances. These deferred tax balances were adjusted in the quarter ended September 30, 2015, which resulted in a reduction of income tax expense of approximately   $66 million  . This adjustment was not material to the consolidated balance sheets or statements of consolidated income. 
  In relation to our acquisition of Coyote (see note 8), we distributed approximately   $500 million   of cash held by a Canadian subsidiary to its U.S. parent during the fourth quarter of 2015. During the third quarter of 2015, and as a result of the intended distribution, we recorded income tax expense of approximately   $21 million  . 
  As discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , we have recognized liabilities for uncertain tax positions. We reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis.  A number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited and ultimately settled. It is difficult to predict the ultimate outcome or the timing of resolution for uncertain tax positions. It is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits could significantly increase or decrease within the next twelve months. However, an estimate of the range of reasonably possible outcomes cannot be made. Items that may cause changes to unrecognized tax benefits include various state filing positions, the allocation of income and expense between tax jurisdictions and other transfer pricing matters. These changes could result from the settlement of ongoing litigation, the completion of ongoing examinations, the expiration of the statute of limitations or other unforeseen circumstances.

Item 2. 
    Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Overview 
  The U.S. economic environment has continued to be mixed as relatively stable consumer conditions are somewhat offset by continued weakness in industrial production, soft business investment and higher inventory levels.  We continue to see modest GDP growth and U.S. manufacturing has shown some positive signs of growth in recent months, but remains weak overall and continues to hinder the pace of expansion in the overall small package delivery market. Low inflation and low fuel prices continued in the economy, giving consumers more purchasing power. Continued growth in e-commerce and omni-channel retail sales has driven package volume demand for residential products. Given these trends, our products most aligned with business-to-consumer shipments have experienced the strongest growth.  
  Outside of the U.S., emerging markets have stabilized in recent months and most developed nations have seen modest growth. The impending exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union creates some uncertainty regarding its impact on global GDP.  The uneven nature of economic growth worldwide and volatile currency markets have continued shifting trade patterns and weakened demand in certain trade lanes. As a result of these circumstances, we continued to adjust our air capacity and cost structure in our transportation network to better match the prevailing volume levels. Our broad portfolio of product offerings and the flexibilities inherent in our transportation network have helped us adapt to these changing trends. 
  While the worldwide economic environment has remained challenging in 2016, we have continued to undertake several initiatives in the U.S. and internationally to (1) improve the flexibility and capacity in our transportation network; (2) improve yield management; and (3) increase operational efficiency and contain costs across all segments. Most notably, the continued deployment of technology improvements (including several facility automation projects and the accelerated deployment of our On Road Integrated Optimization and Navigation system - "ORION") should continue to increase our network capacity and improve operational efficiency, flexibility and reliability. Additionally, we have continued to utilize newly expanded operating facilities to improve time-in-transit for shipments in each region. 
  Our consolidated results are presented in the table below:

Results of Operations Segment Review 
  The results and discussions that follow are reflective of how our executive management monitors the performance of our reporting segments. From time to time, we supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) with certain non-GAAP financial measures, including, as applicable, "adjusted" operating profit, operating margin, income before income taxes, effective tax rate, net income and earnings per share to exclude the impact of mark-to-market pension accounting adjustments. We believe that these adjusted measures provide meaningful information to assist investors and analysts in understanding our financial results and assessing our prospects for future performance. We believe these adjusted financial measures are important indicators of our recurring operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to, our core operating results, and provide a better baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses. 
  Certain operating expenses are allocated between our reporting segments based on activity-based costing methods. These activity-based costing methods require us to make estimates that impact the amount of each expense category that is attributed to each segment. Changes in these estimates will directly impact the amount of expense allocated to each segment and therefore the operating profit of each reporting segment. There were no significant changes in our expense allocation methodologies during   2016   or   2015  .

Revenue 
  The change in overall revenue was impacted by the following factors in 2016 compared with the corresponding period of 2015:  

Volume 
  Our total volume increased in the   third   quarter and year-to-date periods of 2016 compared with 2015, despite having one less operating day, primarily due to continued growth in the retail, healthcare, automotive and professional services segments.  Business-to-consumer shipments, which represent approximately 46% of total U.S. Domestic Package volume, grew more than 9% for the third quarter of 2016 compared with 2015 due to increases in both air and ground shipments led by UPS SurePost. Additionally, business-to-business shipments increased, driven primarily by retail industry return services. 
  Among our air products, volume increased for Next Day Air services in the   third   quarter and year-to-date periods of 2016     particularly for those products most aligned with business-to-consumer shipping. We also experienced growth in our deferred air product volume in the   third   quarter and year-to-date periods of 2016 due to strong growth in e-commerce.  
  The increase in ground volume in the   third   quarter and year-to-date periods of 2016 was driven by both business-to-consumer and business-to-business shipping activity. The continued growth was fueled by e-commerce, which resulted in increased use of returns and SurePost services.

     Table of Contents  
  UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND 
  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 

Rates and Product Mix 
  Overall revenue per piece increased 0.9% for the   third   quarter of 2016, and remained relatively flat year-to-date compared with the same period of 2015, primarily due to the implementation of several rate and accessorial charge increases (as described below), largely offset by lower fuel surcharge rates and changes in customer and product mix.    
  Revenue per piece for ground and air products was positively impacted by a base rate increase on December 28, 2015. UPS Ground rates and accessorial charges increased an average net 4.9%, while UPS Air services and accessorial charges increased an average net 5.2%. The surcharge increased for Over Maximum Packages and the index tables for the Ground and Air fuel surcharges were adjusted effective November 2, 2015. A charge for UPS s Third-Party Billing Service was implemented, effective January 4, 2016. Additionally, the dimensions of ground packages incurring the UPS Additional Handling charge were changed effective June 6, 2016. 
  Revenue per piece for deferred products increased in the   third   quarter and for the year-to-date period of 2016, while Next Day Air declined.     All products were negatively impacted by lower fuel surcharge rates. Deferred revenue per piece increased primarily due to heavier-weight packages partially offset by product mix. The Next Day Air revenue per piece decline was caused by a shift in customer and product mix. We experienced relatively stronger growth in our lighter-weight business-to-consumer shipments particularly our Next Day Air Saver product, which have lower average yields than our heavier-weight commercial shipments.    
  Ground revenue per piece increased 1.1% for the   third   quarter of 2016, but remained flat year-to-date compared with the same period of 2015, primarily due to an increase in volume and rate increases offset by a decrease in average weight per piece and lower fuel surcharge rates.     Additionally, customer and product mix changes had a slightly negative impact on revenue per piece as a greater portion of volume in 2016, relative to 2015, came from residential customers and lighter-weight shipments.  
  Fuel Surcharges 
  UPS applies a fuel surcharge on our domestic air and ground services. The air fuel surcharge is based on the U.S. Department of Energy s ( DOE ) Gulf Coast spot price for a gallon of kerosene-type jet fuel, while the ground fuel surcharge is based on the DOE s On-Highway Diesel Fuel price. Based on published rates, the average fuel surcharges for domestic air and ground products were as follows: 

Total domestic fuel surcharge revenue decreased by $40 million in the   third   quarter of 2016 ($241 million year-to-date) as a result of lower fuel surcharge rates caused by declining jet and diesel fuel prices; however, the impact of lower fuel prices was partially mitigated by pricing changes to the fuel surcharge indices, as well as the overall increase in package volume. 
  Operating Expenses 
  Operating expenses for the segment increased $435 million in the   third   quarter of 2016 ($802 million year-to-date),     primarily due to increases in pick-up and delivery costs ($243 million), the cost of operating our domestic integrated air and ground network ($69 million), the cost of package sorting ($62 million), accessorials and indirect operating costs ($61 million) for the quarter ($515, $53, $114 and $120 million, respectively, year-to-date).     For the third quarter, the cost increases were largely due to higher employee compensation expenses, which were impacted by (1) an increase in average daily union labor hours to support volume growth; (2) an increase in wage rates     and (3) an increase in health and welfare costs (due to headcount and contractual contribution rate increases to multiemployer plans). For the   third   quarter of 2016, these costs include an increase in workers' compensation expense due to more favorable actuarial adjustments in 2015 compared with 2016.  
  Total cost per piece increased 1.6% for the   third   quarter of 2016 compared with the   third   quarter of 2015 (down 0.2% year-to-date), due to the cost increases described previously, including higher costs associated with benefits in addition to lower fuel savings realized in 2016 partially offset by productivity gains during the third quarter and year-to-date period. Productivity improvements have continued to be realized through adjusting our air and ground networks to better match volume levels and utilizing technology to increase package sorting and delivery efficien  cy. The   continued deployment of ORION has contained the growth of average daily vehicle miles driven, while the increased redirect of SurePost volume to optimize delivery density on UPS vehicles has reduced the delivery costs for business-to-consumer shipments.

Operating Profit and Margin 
  Operating profit decreased $6 million for the   third   quarter of 2016 compared with 2015, as operating margin decreased 70 basis points to 13.5%. Higher pension and healthcare costs, contractual union wage increases and higher workers' compensation adjustments in 2015 more than offset the volume growth, productivity improvements and net effect of fuel (fuel expense decreased faster than fuel surcharge revenue) discussed previously.  
  On a year-to-date basis, operating profit increased $104 million in 2016 compared with 2015, as operating margin decreased 10 basis points to 13.1%. Revenue growth from increased volume and enhanced productivity through the continued deployment of ORION technology resulted in higher operating profit, but was partially offset by the net impact of fuel (fuel surcharge revenue decreased faster than fuel expense) and more favorable workers' compensation adjustments in 2015 compared with 2016.

  Revenue   
  The change in overall revenue was impacted by the following factors in   2016   compared with the corresponding period of   2015  : 

Volume 
  Our overall average daily volume increased in the   third   quarter and year-to-date periods of 2016 compared with the corresponding periods of 2015, largely due to strong demand from several economic sectors including retail, healthcare and high tech.  
  The export volume growth in the   third   quarter and year-to-date periods of 2016 was mainly driven by our European and Asian operations. Europe and Asia export volume showed significant growth to all regions particularly in the Asia-to-Europe and Asia-to-U.S. trade lanes. Americas export volume increased for the quarter, with solid growth in the Americas-to-Asia and Americas-to-U.S. trade lanes. Export volume into the U.S. grew in all trade lanes. U.S. export volume was flat for the quarter, largely due to the impact of the stronger U.S. Dollar. Export volume growth increased across all products. This growth was led by our premium express products, such as our Worldwide Express services, as we continue to expand these premium services to new markets.

The increase in domestic volume in the   third   quarter and year-to-date periods of 2016 was primarily due to growth in  Italy, France, Turkey and Canada. 
  Rates and Product Mix 
  Total average revenue per piece decreased 2.8% in the   third   quarter of 2016 (1.8% year-to-date) including the impact of lower fuel surcharge rates and a 90 basis point reduction from the impact of currency (110 basis point reduction year-to-date). These factors were partially offset by an increase in base rates and a continuing shift in product mix as the growth in premium products continues to exceed the growth in our standard products.  
  On December 28, 2015, we implemented an average 5.2% net increase in base and accessorial rates for international shipments originating in the United States (Worldwide Express, Worldwide Saver, UPS Worldwide Expedited and UPS International Standard service). Rate changes for shipments originating outside the U.S. are made throughout the year and vary by geographic market. 
  Export revenue per piece decreased 2.2% in the   third   quarter 2016 (2.1% year-to-date) including the impact of lower fuel surcharge rates and a 30 basis point reduction from the impact of currency (60 basis point reduction year-to-date). These factors were partially offset by an increase in base rates and a continuing shift in product mix as the growth in premium products continues to exceed the growth in our standard products.   
  Domestic revenue per piece decreased 3.4% in the   third   quarter of 2016 (2.5% year-to-date) including the impact of lower fuel surcharge rates and a 290 basis point reduction from the impact of currency (350 basis point reduction year-to-date). These factors were partially offset by an increase in base rates. 
  Fuel Surcharges 
  We maintain fuel surcharges on our international air and ground services. The fuel surcharges for international air products originating inside or outside the United States are indexed to the DOE's Gulf Coast spot price for a gallon of kerosene-type jet fuel, while the fuel surcharges for ground products originating outside the United States are indexed to fuel prices in the international region or country where the shipment takes place. Total international fuel surcharge revenue decreased by $25 million for the   third   quarter of 2016 compared with 2015 ($139 million year-to-date), primarily due to lower fuel prices; however, this was partially offset by pricing changes made to the fuel surcharge indices.  
  Operating Expenses 
  Overall operating expenses for the segment decreased $4 million in the   third   quarter of 2016 compared with 2015 ($165 million year-to-date). This decrease was mostly due to lower fuel prices and a $19 million decrease from currency exchange rate movements ($93 million year-to-date). 
  The decrease in operating expenses was largely driven by the costs of operating our international integrated air and ground network, which decreased $16 million ($124 million year-to-date). The decrease in network costs was largely driven by the impact of currency exchange rate movements, lower fuel expense, and restraining the growth in aircraft block hours (2.5% increase in the third quarter and a 0.4% increase year-to-date), as a result of ongoing modifications to our air network. This was achieved even with a 7.1% increase in   third   quarter international export volume (3.9% increase year-to-date) and continuing air product service enhancements. These decreases were offset by a $19 million increase in pick-up and delivery costs in the   third   quarter compared to the corresponding period of 2015, largely due to increased volume. Year-to-date pick-up and delivery costs were down an additional $13 million compared to the corresponding period of 2015, largely due to the impact of currency exchange rate movements and lower fuel expense.   
  The remaining change in operating expenses in the   third   quarter and year-to-date periods of 2016 compared with 2015 was largely due to a reduction in the costs of package sorting and decreases in indirect operating costs.  
  Operating Profit and Margin 
  Operating profit increased $69 million in the   third   quarter of 2016 compared with 2015 ($206 million year-to-date), while operating margin increased by 190 basis points to 19.0% (220 basis points to 19.6% year-to-date). Operating profit and margin were positively affected by several factors including revenue management initiatives, the net impact of fuel, effective network management and cost containment initiatives.

   In August 2015, we acquired Coyote Logistics Midco, Inc ("Coyote"), a truckload freight brokerage company. Coyote's financial results are included in the above table within Forwarding and Logistics from the date of acquisition, which has impacted the year-over-year comparability of revenue, operating expenses and operating profit.   
  Revenue   
  Total revenue for the Supply Chain   Freight segment increased $197 million in the third quarter of 2016 ($719 million year-to-date) compared with 2015. Forwarding and Logistics revenue increased $235 million in the   third   quarter of 2016 ($831 million year-to-date) compared with 2015 primarily due to the Coyote acquisition midway through the third quarter of 2015. The increase driven by Coyote was partially offset by a combination of volume and tonnage declines in our international air freight business (impacted by management focus on reducing lower-yielding accounts and softer market conditions), lower rates charged to our customers (largely due to overcapacity in the market), as well as the adverse impact of currency exchange rate movements and lower fuel surcharge rates (due to declining fuel prices). Revenue for our logistics products increased in the   third   quarter and year-to-date periods of 2016 compared with 2015, as we experienced solid growth in our mail services, healthcare, retail, aerospace and automotive solutions; however, this was partially offset by the adverse impact of currency exchange rate movements and revenue declines among our high tech customers. 
  Freight revenue decreased $39 million in the   third   quarter of 2016 ($152 million year-to-date) compared with 2015, primarily due to a 5.9% (8.4% year-to-date) decline in tonnage, a 5.2% (6.1% year-to-date) decrease in shipments and a $15 million decrease ($73 million year-to-date) in fuel surcharge revenue due to lower diesel fuel prices. The decline in shipments and the reduction in weight per shipment were impacted by revenue management initiatives, a decline in market demand and customer mix.  LTL Revenue per hundredweight increased, as LTL base rate increases averaging 4.9% took effect on October 26, 2015 and September 19, 2016.

Revenue for the other businesses within Supply Chain   Freight increased $1 million in the   third   quarter of 2016 ($40 million year-to-date) compared with 2015 due to revenue growth at The UPS Store, UPS Capital and UPS Customer Solutions.  
  Operating Expenses   
  Total operating expenses for the Supply Chain   Freight segment increased $210 million in the third quarter of 2016 ($751 million year-to-date) compared with 2015. Forwarding and Logistics operating expenses increased $236 million for the   third   quarter of 2016 ($844 million year-to-date) compared with 2015. This increase was largely due to the acquisition of Coyote during the third quarter of 2015, partially offset by the impact of currency exchange rate movements and lower fuel expense. Purchased transportation expense increased by $222 million in the   third   quarter of 2016 ($734 million year-to-date) compared to 2015 largely due to the acquisition of Coyote, as well as increased volume and rates for mail services. These increases were partially offset by a combination of lower volume and tonnage in our international air freight forwarding business, lower buy rates due to softer market conditions and the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements. 
  Although freight operating expenses decreased $28 million in the   third   quarter of 2016 ($130 million year-to-date) compared with 2015, total cost per LTL shipment increased by 4.5% in the third quarter of 2016 (1.7% year-to-date) compared with 2015. The decrease in operating expenses was largely due to the costs associated with operating our linehaul network (which increased slightly by $4 million over the prior year quarter but decreased $39 million year-to-date as compared to 2015), decreases in pick-up and delivery expenses (which decreased $15 million over the prior year quarter and $39 million year-to-date) and decreases in other expenses (which decreased $18 million over the prior year quarter and $53 million year-to-date). The declines in network costs and pick-up and delivery expenses were driven by a reduction in fuel expense and expense for outside transportation carriers (largely due to lower LTL volume and fuel surcharges passed on to us by outside carriers). 
  Operating expenses for the other businesses within Supply Chain   Freight increased $2 million in the   third   quarter of 2016 ($37 million year-to-date) compared with 2015. 
  Operating Profit and Margin 
  Total operating profit for the Supply Chain   Freight segment decreased $13 million in the third quarter of 2016 ($32 million year-to-date) compared with 2015.  
  Operating profit for the Forwarding and Logistics units, which includes Coyote, decreased by $1 million in the   third   quarter of 2016 ($13 million year-to-date) compared with 2015, primarily due to volume and tonnage declines and revenue management initiatives undertaken in our global freight forwarding operations to improve low-yielding accounts. Operating margins for our global freight forwarding operations decreased slightly in the third quarter of 2016 and improved year-to-date compared with 2015. Operating profit and margins for the logistics unit decreased slightly in the third quarter and year-to-date periods of 2016 compared with 2015. Coyote generated operating profit in the third quarter and year-to-date periods of 2016.   
  Operating profit for our freight unit decreased $10 million in the   third   quarter of 2016 ($22 million year-to-date) compared with 2015, as decreases in volume and tonnage more than offset the increased yields and productivity improvements during the quarter. Margins were pressured in the third quarter of 2016 as shipments declined at a faster rate than expenses. 
  The combined operating profit for all of our other businesses in this segment decreased $2 million in the   third   quarter of 2016 (a $3 million increase year-to-date) compared with 2015.

Consolidated Operating Expenses 

Compensation and Benefits 
  Compensation costs increased $139 million for the third quarter of 2016 ($412 million year-to-date) compared with 2015 largely due to higher U.S. domestic hourly and management compensation costs and the acquisition of Coyote during the third quarter of 2015.  Total compensation costs increased 3.0% for the third quarter and year-to-date periods, while consolidated average daily volume growth was 5.9% (3.6% year-to-date). U.S. domestic compensation costs for hourly employees increased largely due to contractual union wage increases and a 5.2% increase in average daily union labor hours (3.0% year-to-date). The increase in average daily labor hours was less than daily volume growth due to productivity gains. Compensation costs for management employees increased primarily due to merit salary increases and slight growth in the overall size of the workforce. 
  Benefits expense increased $260 million for the   third   quarter of 2016 compared with 2015 ($512 million year-to-date) primarily due to the following factors:  
             
    Health and welfare costs increased $76 million for the   third   quarter ($251 million year-to-date), largely due to increased contributions to multiemployer plans resulting from contractual contribution rate increases and an overall increase in the size of the workforce.  
                
    Pension expense increased $28 million for the   third   quarter ($71 million year-to-date), primarily due to additional expense for multiemployer pension plans, which were impacted by contractual contribution rate increases and an overall increase in the size of the workforce.  
                
    Vacation, holiday and excused absence expense increased $15 million for the   third   quarter ($54 million year-to-date), due to salary increases and growth in the overall size of the workforce. 
                
    Workers' compensation expense increased $125 million in the   third   quarter ($97 million year-to-date).  Insurance reserves are established for estimates of the loss that we will ultimately incur on reported workers' compensation claims, as well as estimates of claims that have been incurred but not reported, and take into account a number of factors including our history of claim losses, payroll growth and the impact of safety improvement initiatives.  In 2015, we experienced more favorable actuarial adjustments, resulting in increased expense in 2016.

Repairs and Maintenance 
  The $24 million increase in repairs and maintenance expense for the third quarter of 2016 compared with 2015 ($81 million year-to-date) was primarily due to aircraft engine maintenance and cost alignments. 
  Depreciation and Amortization 
  Depreciation and amortization expense increased $27 million in the third quarter of 2016 ($118 million year-to-date)  compared with 2015, primarily due to three factors:  (1) depreciation expense on vehicles increased due to the replacement of older, fully-depreciated vehicles, technology upgrades on new vehicles and an overall increase in the size of our vehicle fleet in our U.S. Domestic Package and UPS Freight operations; (2) depreciation expense for buildings and facilities increased due to leasehold improvements and purchases of new equipment and (3) amortization expense increased largely due to new internally developed capitalized software, as well as intangible assets resulting from business acquisitions. 
  Purchased Transportation 
  The $286 million increase in purchased transportation expense charged to us by third-party air, rail, ocean and truck carriers for the third quarter of 2016 ($749 million year-to-date) compared with 2015 was primarily driven by the following factors: 
             
    Expense for our forwarding and logistics business increased $224 million in the third quarter ($739 million year-to-date), due to the acquisition of Coyote and increased volume and rates for mail services; these items were partially offset by a combination of decreased volume and tonnage in our international air freight forwarding business, lower buy rates due to softer market conditions and the impact of foreign currency exchange rates. 
                
    Expense for our International Package segment increased $33 million in the third quarter ($60 million year-to-date), primarily due to the increased usage of third party carriers; these items were partially offset by the impact of currency exchange rate movements as well as lower fuel surcharges passed to us from outside transportation providers.  
                
    Expense for our U.S. Domestic Package segment increased $38 million for the third quarter (an increase of $4 million year-to-date), primarily due to increased volume and rates, partially offset by lower fuel surcharges passed to us from rail carriers and outside contract carriers.  
                
    Expense for our UPS Freight business decreased $6 million in the third quarter ($48 million year-to-date), due to a decrease in LTL shipments and lower fuel surcharges passed to us from outside transportation providers.  
     Fuel 
  The $76 million decrease in fuel expense for the third quarter of 2016 ($420 million year-to-date) compared with 2015 was primarily due to lower jet fuel, diesel and unleaded gasoline prices, which decreased fuel expense by $85 million ($455 million year-to-date). These decreases were partially offset by increased fuel consumption, primarily due to increases in total aircraft block hours and Domestic Package delivery stops (due to higher volume) which increased expense by $9 million in the third quarter of 2016 ($35 million year-to-date).  
  Other Occupancy 
  Other occupancy expense increased $7 million in the third quarter of 2016 as compared to 2015 primarily due to higher facility rent expense.  Year-to-date 2016 expense decreased $3 million as compared to 2015 largely due to a decrease in facility rent expense, natural gas and electric utility costs and snow removal costs at our operating facilities in the first quarter of 2016.  
  Other Expenses 
  The $26 million decrease in other expense in the third quarter of 2016 ($61 million year-to-date) compared with 2015 was largely due to reduced auto liability insurance and better cost alignment.

Other Income and (Expense) 

Investment Income and Other 
  The growth in investment income and other for the   third   quarter and year-to-date of   2016   as compared to 2015 was primarily due to a decrease in losses from fair value adjustments on real estate partnerships, higher interest income and unrealized gains on investments and a benefit from foreign currency exchange rate movements. 
  Interest Expense 
  Interest expense increased in the   third   quarter and year-to-date of   2016   primarily due to an increase in long-term debt and higher effective interest rates on senior notes.  
   
  Income Tax Expense 

Our effective tax rate increased to 35.0% in the   third   quarter of   2016   from 34.0% in the same period of   2015   (35.1%  year-to-date in 2016 compared to 34.6% in the same period of 2015), primarily due to the prior year rate including $23 million of net discrete tax benefits related to adjustments of deferred tax balances, the U.S. tax liability accrual associated with a planned distribution of cash from a Canadian subsidiary to its U.S. parent and increases in our reserves for uncertain tax positions. 
  During the reconciliation of our deferred tax balances in 2015 after filing our annual federal and state tax returns, we identified adjustments to be made in the prior years  deferred tax balances. These deferred tax balances were adjusted in the quarter ended September 30, 2015, which resulted in a reduction of income tax expense of approximately $66 million. This adjustment was not material to the consolidated balance sheets or statements of consolidated income. 
  In relation to our acquisition of Coyote (see note 8), we distributed approximately $500 million of cash held by a Canadian subsidiary to its U.S. parent during the fourth quarter of 2015. During the third quarter of 2015, and as a result of the intended distribution, we recorded income tax expense of approximately $21 million.

  Cash Flows From Operating Activities 
  The following is a summary of the significant sources (uses) of cash from operating activities (amounts in millions): 

___________________  
           (a) 
    Represents depreciation and amortization, gains and losses on derivative transactions and foreign exchange, deferred income taxes, provisions for uncollectible accounts, pension and postretirement benefit expense, stock compensation expense, and other non-cash items. 
     Net cash from operating activities decreased $1.052 billion in the third quarter of 2016 compared with 2015, largely due to  higher pension and post retirement benefit contributions and reduced receipts of hedge margin collateral from counterparties. These were partially offset by higher net income and improvements in our working capital position. The net hedge margin collateral received from derivative counterparties decreased by $420 million in 2016 relative to 2015, due to a decreased net fair value asset position of the derivative contracts used in our currency and interest rate hedging programs. Net cash payments for income taxes increased in 2016 compared with 2015 and were impacted by the timing of estimated tax payments and receipt of refunds relative to changes in estimates for the underlying tax liabilities. The $390 million improvement in our working capital position in 2016 was primarily driven by decreased average days outstanding on accounts receivable and favorable changes in the timing of cash receipts and payments.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our worldwide holdings of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $  5.358 billion  , of which $2.445 billion was held by non-U.S. subsidiaries. The amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held by our U.S. and non-U.S subsidiaries fluctuates throughout the year due to a variety of factors, including the timing of cash receipts and disbursements in the normal course of business. Cash provided by operating activities in the U.S. continues to be our primary source of funds to finance U.S. operating needs, capital expenditures, share repurchases and dividend payments to shareowners. To the extent that such amounts represent previously untaxed earnings, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held by non-U.S. subsidiaries could be subject to tax if such amounts were repatriated in the form of dividends; however, not all non-U.S. cash balances would have to be repatriated in the form of a dividend if returned to the U.S. When amounts earned by non-U.S. subsidiaries are expected to be indefinitely reinvested, no accrual for taxes is provided.

Cash Flows From Investing Activities 
  Our primary sources (uses) of cash from investing activities were as follows (amounts in millions): 

We have commitments for the purchase of aircraft, vehicles, equipment and real estate to provide for the replacement of existing capacity and anticipated future growth. We generally fund our capital expenditures with our cash from operations. Capital spending on buildings and facilities increased in the first   nine   months of 2016 in our U.S. and international package businesses, largely due to several facility automation and capacity expansion projects. Capital spending on information technology was flat in the first   nine   months of 2016 compared to the corresponding period of 2015 largely due to the timing of purchases of hardware and capitalized software projects. Capital spending on aircraft in both 2016 and 2015 primarily related to purchases of rotable parts for our existing aircraft fleet. Capital spending on vehicles decreased in the first   nine   months of 2016 in our U.S. and international package businesses, largely due to the timing of vehicle replacements. 
  Future capital spending will depend on a variety of factors, including economic and industry conditions. We anticipate that our capital expenditures for 2016 will be approximately $2.8 billion, which includes planned purchase deposits for aircraft on order.  
  The net changes in finance receivables were primarily due to growth in our cargo finance products and loan principal paydowns in our business credit and leasing portfolios. The purchases and sales of marketable securities are largely determined by liquidity needs and the periodic rebalancing of investment types and will fluctuate from period to period.  
  The cash paid for business acquisitions in 2016 was related to our acquisition of area franchise rights related to The UPS Store. The cash paid for business acquisitions in the first nine months of 2015 was primarily related to our acquisition of Coyote, Poltraf Sp. z.o.o., Parcel Pro, Inc., and the Insured Parcel Services Division of G4S International Logistics. Other investing activities include minority investments in private ventures, capital contributions into certain investment partnerships and changes in restricted cash balances and various other items.

Cash Flows From Financing Activities 
  Our primary sources (uses) of cash from financing activities are as follows (amounts in millions, except per share data): 

We repurchased a total of   19.3   million shares of class A and class B common stock for   $2.004   billion in the first   nine   months of   2016  , and   20.2   million shares for   $2.035   billion for the first   nine   months of   2015   (  $2.007   and   $2.028   billion in repurchases for   2016   and   2015  , respectively, are reported on the statements of consolidated cash flows due to unsettled repurchases). During the first quarter of 2016, we also exercised a capped call option that we entered into in 2015 which allowed us to repurchase 0.2 million class B shares. The $25 million premium payment for this capped call option was classified as an other financing activity in 2015. In total, shares repurchased and received year-to-date in 2016 were   19.5 million   shares for   $2.029 billion  .  
  In May 2016, the Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase authorization of   $8.0   billion, which has no expiration date. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $6.831 billion   of this share repurchase authorization available. 
  Share repurchases may take the form of accelerated share repurchases, open market purchases or other such methods as we deem appropriate. The timing of our share repurchases will depend upon market conditions. Unless terminated earlier by the resolution of our Board, the program will expire when we have purchased all shares authorized for repurchase under the program. We anticipate repurchasing a total of approximately $  2.7   billion of shares in 2016.    
  The declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on various factors, including our net income, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects and other relevant factors. We increased our quarterly cash dividend payment to $0.78 per share in   2016  , compared with the previous $0.73 quarterly dividend rate in   2015  . We expect to continue the practice of paying regular cash dividends.  
  Issuances and repayments of debt in the first   nine   months of   2016   and   2015   consisted primarily of commercial paper and the issuances of $118, $74 and $35 million of floating rate senior notes in March 2016, June 2016 and August 2016, respectively. We consider the overall fixed and floating interest rate mix of our portfolio and the related overall cost of borrowing when planning for future issuances and non-scheduled repayments of debt.

As of   September 30, 2016  , our commercial paper programs had   $3.759 billion   outstanding in a variety of currencies, which includes $  2.580   billion and    1.056   billion ($  1.179   billion). The average balance of our U.S. dollar denominated commercial paper was $1.343 billion and the average interest rate paid was 0.44% during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . The average balance of our pound sterling denominated commercial paper was  94 million ($123 million) and the average interest rate paid was 0.52% during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  The average balance of our euro denominated commercial paper was   556 million ($621 million) and the average interest rate received was -0.26% during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . The amount of commercial paper outstanding fluctuates throughout the year based on liquidity needs.  
  The variation in cash received from common stock issuances to employees was primarily due to the level of stock option exercises during the first   nine   months of   2016   and   2015  .  
  The cash outflows in other financing activities were impacted by several factors.  Cash inflows (outflows) from the premium payments and settlements of capped call options for the purchase of UPS class B shares were $ 155 and ($69) million during the first   nine   months of   2016   and   2015  , respectively.  Cash outflows related to the repurchase of shares to satisfy tax withholding obligations on vested employee stock awards was $159 and $176 million during the first   nine   months of   2016   and   2015  , respectively.   
   
  Sources of Credit 
  See note   9   to the unaudited consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our available credit and the financial covenants that we are subject to as part of our credit agreements. 
   
  Contractual Commitments 
  We have contractual obligations and commitments for the purchase of aircraft, vehicles, technology equipment and building and leasehold improvements. On October 27, 2016, we placed an order for 14 Boeing 747-8 freighters to be delivered between 2017 and 2020. The agreement also includes an option to purchase an additional 14 747-8 freighters. In addition, we have new purchase commitments for aircraft engines, equipment and hub automation and expansion projects.  These new purchase commitments will provide additional capacity for increased demand for our air and ground shipping services. Including these additional obligations, the expected cash outflow to satisfy our total purchase commitments is as follows (in millions): 2016 (remaining) - $466; 2017 - $1,020; 2018 - $1,010; 2019 - $611; 2020 - $347; and thereafter - $65. 

Guarantees and Other Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  We do not have guarantees or other off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, which we believe could have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity.

Item 3. 
    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
     We are exposed to market risk from changes in certain commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices. All of these market risks arise in the normal course of business, as we do not engage in speculative trading activities. In order to manage the risk arising from these exposures, we utilize a variety of commodity, foreign exchange and interest rate forward contracts, options and swaps. A discussion of our accounting policies for derivative instruments and further disclosures are provided in note   14   to the unaudited consolidated financial statements. 
  The total fair value asset (liability) of our derivative financial instruments is summarized in the following table (in millions): 

Our market risks, hedging strategies and financial instrument positions at   September 30, 2016   have not materially changed from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . In 2016, we entered into several foreign currency forwards on the Euro, British Pound Sterling, Canadian Dollar, Japanese Yen, Mexican Peso, Singapore Dollar and Indian Rupee, as well as terminated forwards that expired during the first   nine   months of   2016  . We entered into several foreign currency options on the Euro, British Pound Sterling and Canadian Dollar, as well as terminated currency option positions that expired during the first   nine   months of   2016  . We entered into new forwards to manage the market value fluctuations of certain investments in marketable securities, as well as terminated forwards that expired during the first   nine   months of   2016  . The remaining fair value changes between   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2016   in the preceding table are primarily due to interest rate, foreign currency exchange rate and market price changes between those dates. 
  The forward contracts, swaps and options previously discussed contain an element of risk that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreements; however, we minimize such risk exposures for these instruments by limiting the counterparties to banks and financial institutions that meet established credit guidelines and by monitoring counterparty credit risk to prevent concentrations of credit risk with any single counterparty.

     Table of Contents  

We have agreements with all of our active counterparties (covering the majority of our derivative positions) containing early termination rights and/or zero threshold bilateral collateral provisions whereby cash is required based on the net fair value of derivatives associated with those counterparties. Events such as a credit rating downgrade (depending on the ultimate rating level) could also allow us to take additional protective measures such as the early termination of trades.  Under these agreements, we held cash collateral of $  487   million and were not required to post any collateral with our counterparties as of   September 30, 2016  .  
  We have not historically incurred, and do not expect to incur in the future, any losses as a result of counterparty default. 
  The information concerning market risk in Item 7A under the caption  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk  of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , is hereby incorporated by reference in this report.

    Controls and Procedures 
     Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures: 
  As of the end of the period covered by this report, management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ( Exchange Act )). Based upon that evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms; and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management to allow their timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting: 
  There were no changes in the Company s internal controls over financial reporting during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

           Item 1A. 
    Risk Factors 
     There have been no material changes to the risk factors described in Part 1, Item 1A in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   other than as described below.  
  Employee health and retiree health and pension benefit costs represent a significant expense to us. 
    
  UPS was a contributing employer to the Central States Pension Fund ( CSPF ) until 2007 when we withdrew from the plan and fully funded our allocable share of unfunded vested benefits by paying a $6.1 billion withdrawal liability. Under a collective bargaining agreement with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, UPS agreed to provide coordinating benefits in the UPS/IBT Full Time Employee Pension Plan ( UPS/IBT Plan ) for UPS participants retiring on or after January 1, 2008 in the event that benefits are lawfully reduced by the CSPF in the future. 
    
  In December 2014, Congress passed the Multiemployer Pension Reform Act ( MPRA ), which for the first time ever allowed multiemployer pension plans to reduce benefit payments to retirees, subject to specific guidelines in the statute and government oversight. In September 2015, the CSPF submitted a proposed pension benefit reduction plan to the U.S. Department of the Treasury under the MPRA. The CSPF plan proposed to reduce retirement benefits to the CSPF participants, including UPS participants retiring on or after January 1, 2008. We vigorously challenged the proposed benefit reduction plan because we believed that it did not comply with the law and that certain actions by the CSPF were invalid. On May 6, 2016, the U.S. Department of the Treasury rejected the proposed plan submitted by the CSPF, stating that it failed to satisfy a number of requirements set forth in the MPRA.  
  The CSPF has asserted that it will become insolvent in 2025 which could lead to the reduction of retirement benefits. Although there are numerous factors that could affect the CSPF s status, if the CSPF were to become insolvent as they have projected , UPS may be required to provide coordinating benefits, thereby increasing the current projected benefit obligation for the UPS/IBT Plan by approximately $4 billion. The CSPF has said that it believes a legislative solution to its funding status is necessary, and we expect that the CSPF will continue to explore options to avoid insolvency. 
   The potential obligation to pay coordinating benefits from the UPS/IBT Plan  is subject to a number of uncertainties, including actions that may be taken by the CSPF, the federal government or others. These actions include whether the CSPF will submit a revised pension benefit reduction plan or otherwise seek federal government assistance, the  extent to which benefits are paid by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, as well as the effect of discount rates and various other actuarial assumptions. The  numerous uncertainties that exist regarding the ultimate resolution of the CSPF situation prevent us from making reliable estimates of the timing and amount , if any, of CSPF benefit reductions that could result in additional benefit obligations for the UPS/IBT Plan. Therefore, we have not recognized any liability for additional coordinating benefits of the UPS/IBT Plan, but the current projected benefit obligation could materially increase as these uncertainties are resolved.  We will continue to assess the impact of these uncertainties on the projected benefit obligation of the UPS/IBT Plan in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 715 - Compensation - Retirement Benefits.

  Share repurchases may take the form of accelerated share repurchases, open market purchases, or other such methods as we deem appropriate. The timing of our share repurchases will depend upon market conditions. Unless terminated earlier by the resolution of our Board, the program will expire when we have purchased all shares authorized for repurchase under the program.  We anticipate repurchasing a total of approximately $  2.7   billion of shares in 2016.

UPS 401(k) SAVINGS PLAN 
  EFFECTIVE AS OF JANUARY 1, 2014 
    
  PURPOSE 
  This UPS 401(k) Savings Plan ("Plan") was originally established effective as of July 1, 1988 to permit individuals not covered by a collective bargaining agreement who are employed by United Parcel Service of America, Inc. or another Employer Company to put money aside for retirement, on a pre tax or after tax basis, to supplement that which they will receive from Social Security and other pension or retirement plans in which they participate. 
  The Plan was amended and restated effective as of December 31, 2008  to merge the UPS Qualified Stock Ownership Plan with and into this Plan, to amend the Plan to provide for employer matching contributions, to amend for final Code   415 regulations, and  to amend the Plan for other general plan revisions. 
  The Plan was amended and restated effective as of January 1, 2014 to incorporate several amendments, to make revisions required by   United States v. Windsor  , 570 U.S. 12, 133 S. Ct. (2013), and to make certain other amendments.   
  The Plan is hereby amended and restated effective July 1, 2016 to incorporate certain other changes, including the addition of the UPS Retirement Contribution, to make certain changes to the automatic enrollment feature, and to make certain other changes and amendments to the Plan. 
  Participants who earn an Hour of Service on or after the Effective Date shall be subject to the provisions of this Plan.  All other Participants shall be subject to the terms and provisions of the Prior Plan. 
  The distribution of benefits for all Participants (whether employed by the Employer before or after the Effective Date) that had not yet commenced prior to the Effective Date of this amendment and restatement shall be governed by the provisions of this Plan.

  (b)      Amount of UPS Retirement Contribution  .  The amount of the UPS Retirement Contribution for each Participant shall be the percentage of the Participant s Eligible Compensation for the Plan Year specified in Appendix 4.2, which shall be determined based upon the Employer Company for which such Participant was employed on the last day of the Plan Year and the Participant s UPS Retirement Contribution Years of Service as set forth in Appendix 4.2.

If the Participant is not employed by an Employer Company on the last day of the Plan Year for any reason (including death, Disability, leave of absence, or retirement, etc.), or if the Participant is employed by an Employer Company that does not participate in UPS Retirement Contributions on the last day of the Plan Year, the Participant shall not be eligible for a UPS Retirement Contribution for that Plan Year.  
  (d)      Vesting and Forfeitures  .   A Participant shall vest in such Participant s UPS Retirement Contributions in accordance with Article VIII.  Any forfeitures applicable to UPS Retirement Contributions shall be treated and used as described in Article VIII.    
    
  Section 4.3      Top Heavy Contribution  .  As of the last day of each Plan Year, a determination will be made on whether this Plan is top heavy as described in Section 15.9 and, if this Plan is top heavy, the Employer Companies will contribute such amounts, if any, as are necessary to satisfy minimum top-heavy allocation requirements.  Any such contributions will be credited as of the last day of such Plan Year to the affected Participants' Top Heavy Account.

The SavingsPLUS     Contribution may be made in cash or UPS Stock or in any combination of cash and UPS Stock, as determined by the Employer.  An Employer Company may make SavingsPLUS Contributions for any Accounting Period in installments at any time during the Accounting Period (or such other period specified in Appendix 14.3) may make the Employer contributions called for under this Article IV at any time during the Plan Year or in the following year before the due date (after taking any extensions into account) for filing the Employer Company's federal income tax return for such Plan Year. UPS Retirement Contributions shall be credited to the eligible Participant s UPS Retirement Contribution Account as soon as practicable following the end of the Plan Year, but in no event later than the latest date permitted under applicable law and shall be made in the form of a cash contribution. 
  Section 4.5      Responsibility to Make Employer Contributions  .  The Employer in its absolute discretion may choose to make the employer contributions called for under this ARTICLE IV on behalf of all of the Employer Companies and to charge each Employer Company with its allocable portion of the contributions in accordance with those procedures the Employer in its absolute discretion deems appropriate.

Article V.      LIMITATIONS ON CONTRIBUTIONS AND ALLOCATIONS       
  Section 5.1      Order      .  The allocation of contributions made under this Plan (other than Rollover Contributions) will be subject to the limitations of this Section 5.1, as applied, in the following order: 
  (a)    the Code   415 limitations under Section 5.2, 
  (b)    the Code   402(g) limitations under     Section 5.3, 
  (c)    the Code   401(k) limitations for Highly Compensated Employees under Section 5.4, 
  (d)    the Code   401(m) limitations for Highly Compensated Employees under Section 5.5. 
    
  Section 5.2      Code   415 Limitations  . Refer to Appendix 5.2. 
  (a)      Coordination with Code   401(k) and Code  402(g)  .  Any Pre-Tax Contributions that are not allocated because of the limitations of Appendix 5.2 will be disregarded for the purposes of the Code  402(g) limitations under Section 5.3 and the Code  401(k) limitations under Section 5.4. 
  Section 5.3      Code   402(g) Limitations  . 
  (a)    A Participant s total Pre-Tax Contributions under this Plan and  elective deferrals  within the meaning of Code   402(g) under all other qualified plans, contracts and arrangements maintained by an Affiliate during any calendar year will not exceed the annual dollar limit under Code   402(g) (or, with respect to Participants in Puerto Rico, such lower limit as may be prescribed under Puerto Rican law).      A Participant  whose Pre-Tax Contributions  together with other elective deferrals under a plan of an Affiliate exceed the applicable limitation, shall  be deemed to have made a request for a refund under Section 5.3(b) and the excess will be refunded in accordance with such Section. 
  (b)    If a Participant s  Pre-Tax Contributions for a calendar year, when added to the  elective deferrals  within the meaning of  Code   402(g) made for a calendar year on behalf of such Participant under plans, contracts or arrangements of an employer that is not an Affiliate (for example, another unrelated employer s  
  
   26 

Code   401(k) plan or tax sheltered annuity) for that calendar year, exceed the Code   402(g) dollar limit, he or she may request a refund of that excess (or, if less, the Participant s Pre-Tax Contributions deducted during such calendar year under this Plan) by filing an election no later than March 1 of the following calendar year.  A Participant s election under this Section 5.3(b) will specify the dollar amount of the excess and include a written statement that absent the refund, the Pre-Tax Contributions made under this Plan plus the other contributions described in this Section 5.3 will exceed the Code   402(g) limit for that calendar year. 
  (1)    Any refund timely requested or deemed requested under this Section 5.3(b) (adjusted for investment gain or loss) will be made no later than the April 15 that immediately follows the date the refund is requested or deemed requested. 
  (2)    Any Pre-Tax Contributions (other than Pre-Tax Contributions described in the second sentence of this Section 5.3(b)(2)) that exceed the limit set forth in Code   402(g) will be taken into account for purposes of the ADP Test     under Section 5.4 regardless of whether the Pre-Tax Contributions are refunded to a Participant in accordance with this Section 5.3(b).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, excess Pre-Tax Contributions of a Nonhighly Compensated Employee will not be taken into account for purposes of the ADP Test to the extent the excess arises solely from Pre-Tax Contributions under this Plan and pre-tax contributions under all other qualified plans, contracts and arrangements maintained by the Affiliates to the extent prohibited under Code   401(a)(30).  Excess Pre-Tax Contributions that are refunded under this Section 5.3(b) will not be taken into account for purposes of the Code   415 limitations under Section 5.2. 
  (c)    Refunds of excess Pre-Tax Contributions will be adjusted for investment gain or loss for the Plan Year for which the deferrals were made and for the period between the end of such calendar year and the date the deferrals are distributed in accordance with the regulations under Code   402(g). 
  
   27 

Section 5.4      Code   401(k) Limitations for Highly Compensated Employees  . 
  (a)      ADP Test  .  The average of the Highly Compensated Employees  ADPs for a Plan Year, when compared to the average of the Nonhighly Compensated Employees  ADPs for the same Plan Year will satisfy either of the following tests: 
  (1)    the average of the ADPs for all Highly Compensated Employees is not more than 125% of the average of the ADPs for all Nonhighly Compensated Employees, or 
  (2)    the average of the ADPs for all Highly Compensated Employees is not more than two times the average of the ADPs for all Nonhighly Compensated Employees, and the excess of the average of the ADPs for all Highly Compensated Employees over the average of the ADPs for all Nonhighly Compensated Employees is not more than two percentage points. 
  In performing the ADP Test for a Plan Year, the applicable averages will be calculated taking into account each Participant who was eligible to make Pre Tax Contributions at any time during that Plan Year. 
  (b)      Aggregation with Other Plans or Arrangements  .  The ADP for any Highly Compensated Employee will be determined as if all contributions made on behalf of such Highly Compensated Employee during the same Plan Year under one, or more than one, other plan described in Code   401(k) maintained by an Affiliate had been made under this Plan or, at the option of the Committee, the Plan may be permissively aggregated with such other plans if they have the same Plan Year and use the same ADP testing method.  If this Plan satisfies the coverage requirements of Code   410(b) only if aggregated with one or more other plans, or if one or more other plans satisfy the coverage requirements of Code   410(b) only if aggregated with this Plan, this Section 5.4 will be applied by determining the ADPs of all Participants as if all those plans were a single plan. 
  (c)      Other Requirements and Elections  .  The determination and treatment of the Pre Tax Contributions and ADP of any Participant will satisfy any other requirements prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury including any subsequent Internal Revenue Service guidance issued under Code   401(k), and, in performing the ADP Test, the Committee may use any alternatives and elections authorized under the applicable regulations, rulings or revenue procedures.  If the Plan applies Code   410(b)(4)(B) (exclusion of employees less than age 21 or without one year of  
  
   28 

service) for Code   410(b) testing purposes the Plan will perform the ADP Test using the ADP of each eligible Highly Compensated Employee for the Plan Year and the ADP of each eligible Nonhighly Compensated Employee for the preceding Plan Year, disregarding each eligible Nonhighly Compensated Employee who was not age 21 or had not completed one year of service by the end of the preceding Plan Year. 
  (d)      Action to Satisfy ADP Test  . 
  (1)      Refund of Excess Contributions  .  Excess Contributions (adjusted for investment gain or loss) will be refunded no later than the last day of the immediately following Plan Year to Highly Compensated Employees on whose behalf the Excess Contributions were made.  Refunds will be made on the basis of the amount of Pre-Tax Contributions for such Plan Year starting with the Highly Compensated Employee with the greatest dollar amount of Pre-Tax Contributions, first from his or her unmatched Pre-Tax Contributions and thereafter from his or her Pre-Tax Contributions that are matched, and such refunds will be made first pro-rata from Investment Options other than the UPS Stock Fund and then, if necessary, from the UPS Stock Fund.  The Excess Contributions that would otherwise be refunded will be reduced (in accordance with the Code   401(k) regulations) by any refund made to the Highly Compensated Employee under Section 5.3.  In the case of a Highly Compensated Employee who is an eligible employee in more than one plan of an Affiliate to which elective contributions are made, the amount of the Excess Contributions refunded to the Highly Compensated Employee for any Plan Year must not exceed the amount of his or her Pre-Tax Contributions actually contributed to the Plan for the Plan Year. 
  (2)      Determination of Investment Gain or Loss  .  Excess Contributions will be adjusted for investment gain or loss for the Plan Year for which the contributions were made in accordance with the regulations under Code   401(k) but will not be adjusted for investment gain or loss for the period between the end of the Plan Year and the date the Excess Contributions are distributed. 
  Section 5.5      Code   401(m) Limitations For Highly Compensated Employees  . 
  
   29 

(a)      ACP Test  .  The average of the Highly Compensated Employees  ACPs for a Plan Year, when compared to the average of the Nonhighly Compensated Employees  ACPs for the same Plan Year will satisfy either of the following tests: 
  (1)    the average of the ACPs for all Highly Compensated Employees does not exceed 125% of the average of the ACPs for all Nonhighly Compensated Employees, or 
  (2)    the average of the ACPs for all Highly Compensated Employees is not more than two times the average of the ACPs for all Nonhighly Compensated Employees, and the excess of the average of the ACPs for all Highly Compensated Employees over the average of the ACPs for all Nonhighly Compensated Employees is not more than two percentage points. 
  In performing the ACP Test for a Plan Year, the applicable averages will be calculated taking into account each Participant who was eligible to make Pre-Tax Contributions at any time during that Plan Year. 
  (b)      Aggregation with Other Plans or Arrangements  . 
  (1)    The ACP for any Highly Compensated Employee will be determined as if any  employee contributions  (within the meaning of Code   401(m)) and any  matching contributions  (within the meaning of Code   401(m)(4)) allocated to his or her account during the same Plan Year under one, or more than one, other plan described in Code   401(a) or   401(k) maintained by an Affiliate had been made under this Plan or, at the option of the Committee, the Plan may be permissively aggregated with such other plans.  If this Plan satisfies the coverage requirements of Code   410(b) only if aggregated with one or more other plans, or if one or more other plans satisfy the coverage requirements of Code   410(b) only if aggregated with this Plan, then this Section 5.5 will be applied by determining the ACPs of all Participants as if all the plans were a single plan. 
  (c)      Action to Satisfy ACP Test  . 
  (1)      Distribution or Forfeiture of Excess Aggregate Contributions  . 
  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan to the contrary, Excess Aggregate Contributions made for any Plan Year (adjusted for investment gains and losses) will be distributed from the Accounts of Highly  
  
   30 

Compensated Employees no later than the last day of the immediately following Plan Year. 
    
  The Excess Aggregate Contributions will be distributed on behalf of each Highly Compensated Employee, starting with the Highly Compensated Employee who has the largest sum of those contributions and ending when the Excess Aggregate Contributions are distributed.  The Excess Aggregate Contributions will first be reduced by distributing After Tax Contributions and then by distributing SavingsPLUS Contributions and such distributions will be made first pro-rata from Investment Options other than the UPS Stock Fund and then, if necessary, from the UPS Stock Fund. 
    
  In the case of a Highly Compensated Employee who is an eligible employee in more than one plan of an Affiliate to which employee and matching contributions are made, the amount of the Excess Aggregate Contributions refunded to the Highly Compensated Employee for any Plan Year must not exceed the amount of his or her After-Tax Contributions and SavingsPLUS Contributions actually contributed to the Plan for the Plan Year. 
    
  (2)      Determination of Investment Gain or Loss  .  Excess Aggregate Contributions will be adjusted for investment gain or loss for the Plan Year for which such contributions were made in accordance with the regulations under Code   401(m) but will not be adjusted for investment gain or loss for the period between the end of the Plan Year and the date the Excess Aggregate Contributions are distributed. 
  Section 5.6      Roth Contributions  .      Roth Contributions shall be treated as Pre-Tax Contributions under this Article V and if Pre-Tax Contributions are required to be distributed to satisfy any such limitation, such distribution shall be made first from the affected Participant s Roth Contribution Account and if there is an insufficient amount in that account, the remainder of the distribution shall be made from the Participant s Pre-Tax Contribution Account. 
  Article VI.      VALUATION AND ACCOUNT DEBITS AND CREDITS       
  Section 6.1      Accounts  .  The Committee will establish and maintain an Account (composed of such subaccounts as the Committee deems appropriate) in the name of each  
  
   31 

Participant to which will be credited such sums of cash or other property from time to time contributed or transferred to this Plan together with the earnings, profits and appreciation on those assets and to which will be charged the losses and depreciation on those assets and the Participant s share of the expenses of this Plan and the Trust Funds unless the Employer Companies pay for such expenses. 
  Section 6.2      Corrections  .  If an error or omission is discovered in any Account, an appropriate adjustment will be made to such Account and to such other Accounts as deemed appropriate and proper under the circumstances by or at the direction of the Committee in order to remedy such error or omission. 
    
  Article VII.      INVESTMENTS       
  Section 7.1      Investment of Trust Funds  . 
  (a)    The Committee shall select Investment Options; provided, however, that one of the Investment Options shall be a fund invested primarily in UPS Stock.  It is intended that the Plan satisfy the conditions for the participant-directed investment of Plan accounts contained in ERISA   404(c) and the regulations thereunder (Labor Regulation Section 2550.404c-1), so as to afford to each Participant the opportunity to exercise control over the assets in his or her Account and to choose, from a broad range of investment alternatives, the manner in which said assets are invested. In accordance with Sections 7.2 through 7.4, each Participant shall have the opportunity to choose, in accordance with such procedures as the Committee may prescribe, among the Investment Options.  The allocation of the Participant s Account among Investment Options must be made in one percent (1%) increments. 
  (b)    The Committee shall (1) determine the manner and frequency of investment instructions and limitations on such instructions and (2) establish such other procedures as may be necessary or appropriate to implement Participant and Beneficiary instructions in accordance with the requirements of ERISA Section 404(c), including procedures to provide Participants and Beneficiaries with an opportunity to obtain written confirmation of their investment instructions.  Any such procedures may be amended or modified from time to time by the Committee  
  
   32 

at its discretion and all such procedures and any amendments or modifications to such procedures are incorporated into and made a part of this Plan. 
  The Committee shall provide for at least three Investment Options in addition to the UPS Stock Fund each of which is diversified and has materially different risk and return characteristics.  The Committee shall permit a Participant to divest his or her investment in the UPS Stock Fund and reinvest an equivalent amount in other Investment Options at periodic, reasonable opportunities occurring no less frequently than quarterly.  The Committee shall not impose any restrictions or conditions with respect to the investment in the UPS Stock Fund that are not imposed on other Investment Options except as required or as are reasonably designed to ensure compliance with applicable securities laws or as otherwise permitted under the Treasury Regulations under Code   401(a)(35).  To the extent that the Plan is an  applicable defined contribution plan  within the meaning of Code   401(a)(35)(E) and the regulations thereunder, the requirements of Appendix 7.1, Diversification Requirements of Code   401(a)(35), shall apply. 
    
  Section 7.2      Investment of Accounts  . 
  (a)      Investment Election  .  The Trustees shall invest and reinvest each Participant s Account among the Investment Options in accordance with the instructions provided by such Participant, which shall remain in force until altered in accordance with Sections 7.3 and 7.4. 
  Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) a Participant may, on a form provided by the Committee, make a separate written election to have his or her Rollover Contribution invested in a manner independent of his or her other subaccounts, so long as such written election is transmitted to the Trustees at the same time as the Rollover Contribution is made to the Plan; and (b) a Participant must provide separate investment elections for his or her Roth Contribution Account. Such investment directions must be in increments of one percent (1%).  Such investment directions must result in the investment of one hundred percent (100%) of the directed amount.  Authorizations that do not result in an allocation of one hundred percent (100%) or are incorrect in any other respect will not be processed and the prior investment allocation shall continue in effect.      Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Trustees may refuse to follow any investment instructions that the Trustees or the Committee reasonably believes could result in a transaction prohibited under ERISA   406 or Code   4975 and for which there is no exemption, could generate income that would  
  
   33 

be taxable to the Plan, would not be in accordance with the Plan or with ERISA, could cause the Trustee to maintain indicia of ownership of Plan assets outside of the United States, could jeopardize the Plan s tax exempt status or could result in a loss to the Plan in excess of the Participant s Account. 
    
  Notwithstanding the forgoing, contributions may not be invested directly in the Self-Managed Account; however, a Participant may direct the transfer of contributions and other amounts invested in another Investment Option into the Self-Managed Account pursuant to Section 7.4. 
    
  (b)      Deemed Investment Elections  .  If a Participant is deemed to have made a Pre-Tax Contribution election pursuant to Section 3.1(b), and he or she does not make an Affirmative Investment Election, his or her Pre-Tax Contributions will be invested in the default investment fund as designated by the Committee, based on the Participant s date of birth as reflected in the records of the recordkeeper at the time of the contribution to the Trust Funds: 
  If, for any reason, the recordkeeper s records as to the Participant s date of birth are not correct, (a) the recordkeeper will correct the incorrect data as soon as administratively practicable after it is notified, in writing, of the error and (b) the Pre-Tax Contributions made to the Plan prior to such correction will remain invested in the Investment Options designated by the date of birth on the recordkeeper s records at the time the Pre-Tax Contribution was made to the Plan, until such time as the Participant makes an Affirmative Investment Election.  The Trustee shall invest and reinvest each Participant s Account among the Investment Options in accordance with the deemed investment elections provided by this Section 7.2(b), which shall remain in force until altered in accordance with Sections 7.2(a), 7.3 and 7.4. 
  Section 7.3      Investment Allocation of Future Contributions  .  Each Participant may elect to change the investment allocation of future Pre-Tax Contributions or After-Tax Contributions at any time.  Each election to change a Participant s investment allocation among Investment Options shall be made via the VRU or in accordance with such other procedures as are prescribed by the Committee from time to time, and shall be effective as soon as practicable following the receipt thereof.  Such election shall apply uniformly to all future Pre-Tax Contributions and After-Tax Contributions made by or on behalf of the Participant.  Changes must be in increments of one percent (1%).  Changes must result in a total investment of one hundred percent (100%) of the Participant s contributions under the Plan.  Authorizations that do not result in an allocation of one hundred percent (100%)  
  
   34 

of the Participant s future contributions or are incorrect in any other respect will not be processed and the prior investment allocation shall continue in effect. 
  Notwithstanding the forgoing, contributions may not be invested directly in the Self-Managed Account; however, a Participant may direct the transfer of contributions and other amounts invested in another Investment Option into the Self-Managed Account pursuant to Section 7.4. 
    
  Section 7.4      Transfer of Account Balances Between Investment Options  . 
  (a)      General  .  Each Participant may elect to transfer the balances in his or her Account among the Investment Options at any time.  Such election shall be made via the VRU, or in accordance with such other procedures as shall be prescribed by the Committee from time to time, and shall be effective as soon as practicable following receipt thereof, subject to limitations, if any, of the investment vehicles selected.  If a transfer authorization does not result in the allocation of one hundred percent (100%) of the Participant s Account or if it is incorrect in any other respect, the transfer authorization will not be processed by the Committee and the prior investment allocation will continue in effect.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this subparagraph, amounts credited to any subaccount must remain credited to that subaccount until distribution from the Plan, unless the Committee determines that such contributions (and investment gains or losses on such contributions) should be credited to a different subaccount. 
  (b)      Self-Managed Account Transfers  .  A Participant s initial transfer into the Self-Managed Account must equal or exceed $2,500.  Any subsequent transfer into the Self-Managed Account must equal or exceed $1,000.  A transfer to the Self-Managed Account shall be permitted only if a Participant has $500 or more invested in Investment Options, other than the Self-Managed Account, immediately following such transfer. All investments in the Self-Managed Account shall be in accordance with administrative processes and procedures established by the Committee.  
  Section 7.5      Ownership Status of Funds  .  The assets of each Investment Option shall be owned by one of the Trustees.  The applicable Trustee or a recordkeeper designated by the Committee shall maintain or have maintained records for each Investment Option allocating a portion of the investment representing such Investment Option to each Participant who has elected that his or her Account be invested in such Investment Option.   
  
   35 

The records shall reflect the U.S. dollar value of each Participant s portion of each Investment Option. 
  Section 7.6      Statements  .  The Committee shall furnish or cause to be furnished to each Participant, at least annually, a statement of his or her Account. 
  Section 7.7      Transition Period to Implement Plan Changes  .  In connection with a change in record keepers, trustees, or other service providers for the Plan, a change in the methodology for valuing accounts, a change in investment options, a plan merger or other circumstances, a temporary interruption in the normal operations of the Plan may be required in order to properly implement such change or merger or take action in light of such circumstances.  In such event or under such circumstances, the Committee, may take such action as it deems appropriate under the circumstances to implement such change or merger or in light of such circumstances, including authorizing a temporary interruption in a Participant s ability to obtain information about his or her Account, to take distributions from such Account and to make changes in the investment of that Account, provided the Committee will take appropriate action as to give Participants as much advance notice of the interruption as possible and to minimize the scope and length of the interruption in normal Plan operations.  In addition, when changing Investment Options, the Committee will take such action as it deems appropriate under the circumstances to direct the investment of the funds pending completion by a Trustee of the administrative processes necessary to transfer investment authority to the Participants, including, but not limited to, mapping monies from old funds to new funds.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, one Investment Option will be a fund designed to invest primarily in UPS Stock. 
  Section 7.8      Alternate Payees and Beneficiaries  .  Solely for purposes of this Article VII, an Alternate Payee or a Beneficiary of a deceased Participant will be treated as a Participant. 
  Section 7.9      Investment in UPS Stock  .  The Trustee of the UPS Stock Fund  may purchase UPS Stock from any source, provided that the Trustee will pay no more than Fair Market Value for any share.  The Trustee may purchase either outstanding shares, newly issued shares, or treasury shares.  To the extent that the Trustee needs to obtain cash, the Trustee may sell UPS Stock to the Employer for no less than Fair Market Value.  The Committee shall direct the Trustee as to its responsibilities to suspend purchases of UPS Stock when such suspension is necessary to comply with any applicable law or applicable stock exchange rule or regulation in which event purchases will be made or resumed when the Committee reasonably concludes that purchases are permitted under applicable law.  The recordkeeper selected by the Committee will account for the cost or other basis of all  
  
   36 

UPS Stock held in the UPS Stock Fund in accordance with Treasury Regulation   1.402(a)-1(b)(2)(ii). 
  Section 7.10      Voting and Tender Rights of UPS Shares  .  The Employer has engaged a third party recordkeeper, which has the responsibility to maintain Participant records, including the names, addresses and number of shares of Participants and Beneficiaries holding UPS Stock.  The recordkeeper s duties with regard to proxies is to provide the Trustee of the UPS Stock Fund with a list which includes the name, address and number of shares held for each Participant and Beneficiary as of the applicable date.  That Trustee has the responsibility to furnish Participants and Beneficiaries with the information set forth in Section 7.1(b)(3), to reconcile the number of shares that are voted or tendered by Participants and Beneficiaries and to vote or tender the remaining shares pursuant to Sections 7.10(a) and 7.10(b). 
  (a)      Voting of UPS Shares  .  Shares of UPS Stock will be voted by the Trustee  of the UPS Stock Fund as directed by the Participants or Beneficiaries invested in the UPS Stock Fund.  All shares of UPS Stock will be voted by the Trustee in the same proportion as voting instructions are timely received by the Trustee.  When determining the percentage of shares to be voted in favor of or against a particular measure, the Trustee will disregard shares of UPS Stock for which the Trustee has not timely received voting instructions.  For example, if Participants and Beneficiaries fail to timely provide voting instructions on 25% of the UPS Stock Fund, all shares of UPS Stock held in the UPS Stock Fund will be voted in accordance with the timely instructions received for 75% of the UPS Stock. 
  (b)      Tender of UPS Shares  .  In the event of a tender offer for UPS Stock, shares of UPS Stock will be tendered or not tendered as directed by the Participants or Beneficiaries.  The failure to give a timely direction to tender is deemed to be a direction not to tender. 
  (c)      Communication  .  The Trustee will (in an appropriate and timely manner) furnish, or cause to be furnished, to Participants and Beneficiaries who are entitled to direct the Trustee whether to tender the shares of UPS Stock allocated to his or her Account with the same information and notices as are furnished to other shareholders who are entitled to vote or entitled to tender regarding the matters to be voted upon or the tender offer and will provide them with adequate opportunity to deliver their instructions to the Trustee.  The Trustee in its discretion will determine the manner in which instructions with respect to the voting or tender of UPS Stock will be given and any such instructions will be confidential.

           (c) 
    Repayment of Account; Restoration of Non-Vested Account  .  Except as provided below, a Participant who is re-hired by the Employer or an Employer Company shall have the right to repay to the Plan the portion of the Participant s Account which was previously distributed to him or her.  In the event the Participant repays the entire distribution he or she received from the Plan, the Plan shall restore the non-vested portion (i.e. forfeited portion) of the Participant s Account.  A Participant s Account shall first be restored, to the extent possible, out of Forfeitures under the Plan.  To the extent such forfeitures are insufficient to restore the Participant s Account, restoration shall be made from Employer Contributions.  A Participant who was deemed to have received a distribution of his or her vested Account (  see   subsection (b) above) shall be deemed to have repaid such vested Account if such Participant his rehired before such Participant incurs five consecutive Breaks in Service. 
     
   38 

(d) 
    Restrictions of Repayment Account  .  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Plan, a Participant shall not have the right to repay to the Plan the portion of his or her Account which was previously distributed to him after any of the following events:  (i) the Participant incurs five consecutive Breaks in Service before returning to employment, or (ii) the Participant fails to repay the prior distribution within five years after the Participant is re-employed by the Employer or an Employer Company.

    Amounts forfeited shall be used in accordance with Section 9.19. 

Article IX.      DISTRIBUTIONS, WITHDRAWALS AND TRANSFERS     
  Section 9.1      General  .   A Participant may request distribution of his or her Account when he or she has a Severance from Employment and a Participant may request a withdrawal from his or her Account before a Severance from Employment to the extent provided in Sections 9.8, 9.9 and 9.10. 
  Section 9.2      Request for Distribution upon Severance from Employment  .  A Participant who has a Severance from Employment may request a distribution of his or her Account in one of the distribution forms described in Section 9.5.  Following such request, payment of the Account will begin as soon as practicable (but, generally, no earlier than thirty (30) days) after his or her request for payment. 
  Unless the Participant otherwise elects or the Participant s consent is not required under this Section 9.2, payment of a Participant s Account will be made no later than the sixtieth (60th) day after the close of the Plan Year in which the latest of the following events occurs: 
  (a)    the date on which the Participant attains age sixty-two (62), which is the normal retirement age under the Plan; or 
  (b)    the Participant has a Severance from Employment. 
  
   39 

A Participant s consent to distribution is not required if the value of his or her Account is less than $1,000, and a cash lump sum distribution will automatically be made to such a Participant as soon as practicable following his or her Severance from Employment, without his or her consent. 
  Section 9.3      Automatic Deferral of Payment  .  A Participant who does not request a distribution of his or her Account under Section 9.2 (other than a Participant whose consent is not required) will be deemed to have elected to defer payment of his or her Account (which deemed election will be in lieu of a written election that conforms to the requirements of Code   401(a)(14) and regulations promulgated thereunder) until the earlier of: 
  (a)    the date of such Participant s death, or 
  (b)    the later of (1) the date such Participant attains age seventy and one-half (70 ) or (2) his or her Severance from Employment. 
  Such date is referred to as the  Latest Deferral Date . 
  If the Latest Deferral Date occurs as a result of the Participant s death, any amount remaining in the Account on such date (including amounts invested in the Self-Managed Account and the UPS Stock Fund) shall be paid in a cash lump sum as soon as administratively practicable following such date. 
  If the Latest Deferral Date occurs for a reason other than the Participant s death and the Participant has not received a distribution from the Plan that will satisfy the requirements of Code   401(a)(9) for such year, a minimum distribution that  conforms to Section 9.4 shall automatically be made from the Plan. 
  Section 9.4      Required Beginning Date under Code   401(a)(9)      . 
  Notwithstanding any contrary Plan provision, a Participant s Account will be paid to him or her no later than April 1 of the calendar year following (a) the calendar year in which he or she reaches age seventy and one-half (70 ) or (b) if later, for a Participant who is not a five percent (5%) owner (as defined in Code   416), the calendar year in which he or she has a Severance from Employment. 
  Distributions under Article IX shall conform to the minimum distribution requirements of Code   401(a)(9) in accordance with Appendix 9.4.  The distribution required by Code   401(a)(9) may, at the election of the Participant or Beneficiary, be the minimum distribution required by Code   401(a)(9).  If a Participant or Beneficiary is  
  
   40 

required to receive a minimum distribution for a Plan Year but such Participant or Beneficiary does not provide the information required to determine the exact amount of such distribution, the Committee will establish procedures for completing distributions required by Code   401(a)(9). 
  Section 9.5      Distribution Form  . 
  (a)      Normal Form  .  Distribution of each Participant s Account shall be made in a lump sum of the Participant s entire Account, unless the Participant elects a partial lump sum distribution, installments under Section 9.5(b) or another distribution option available under Appendix 14.3 as a result of a merged plan.  A Participant who has a Severance from Employment may request a partial lump sum distribution of less than his or her entire Account balance.  There is no minimum amount for a partial lump sum distribution and each partial lump sum distribution is subject to a service fee established by the Committee. 
  (b)      Installment Options  .  A Participant who has a Severance from Employment shall be eligible to receive all or if he or she elects a partial lump sum distribution, the remaining portion of his or her Account in a series of monthly installment payments only if he or she has an account at a financial institution that can accept monthly wire transfers.  A Participant may select in accordance with procedures prescribed by the Committee either (i) the amount of each monthly installment payment or (ii) the number of monthly installment payments, that he or she would like to receive; provided, however, a Participant must select a minimum of twelve (12) monthly installment payments and the initial monthly installment payment must be at least fifty dollars ($50). 
  Monthly installment payments shall cease as soon as administratively possible following the death of the Participant, unless the surviving Spouse who is the Beneficiary elects otherwise pursuant to Section 9.6(d). 
  A Participant may elect to terminate his or her installment election at any time.  Such Participant may elect another form of distribution under this Section 9.5 at any time, provided the requirements of this Section 9.5 are independently satisfied with respect to each such new election. 
  Notwithstanding anything contrary in this   9.5, installment payments shall not be made from the Self-Managed Account or the UPS Stock Fund. 
  
   41 

(c)      Source of Distribution  .  Distributions shall be made in accordance with procedures established by the Committee and, unless otherwise requested by the Participant, shall be made first from that portion of his or her Account other than the Self-Managed Account or the UPS Stock Fund, second from the UPS Stock Fund and third from the Self-Managed Account. 
  Section 9.6      Death  . 
  (a)      General  .  Subject to the provisions set forth in Appendix 14.3, if a Participant dies before his or her Account is paid to him or her in full, the remaining portion of the Account will be paid to his or her Beneficiary determined in accordance with (b) below. 
  (b)      Determination of Beneficiary  .  A Participant s Beneficiary(ies) will be determined as follows: 
  (1)    Except as otherwise provided below, a Participant s sole primary Beneficiary will be his or her surviving Spouse, if the Participant is lawfully married on the date of his or her death. 
  (2)    If the Participant was not lawfully married at death, if the Participant s surviving Spouse consented in writing before a notary public to the designation of some other person or persons as the Participant s Beneficiary or if the Committee determines that spousal consent is not required under the Code or ERISA, then the Participant s Beneficiary will be the person or persons so designated in writing by the Participant on a form satisfactory to the Committee in accordance with (c) below. 
  (3)    The Participant s Beneficiaries will be his or her estate, if any of the following apply: 
  (i)    The Participant did not have a Spouse and failed to properly designate another Beneficiary; 
  (ii)    Neither the Participant s Spouse, if any, nor any other Beneficiaries survive the Participant; or 
  (iii)    After following the procedures in Section 9.19 (Forfeiture in Case of Unlocatable Participant), the whereabouts of each person designated as a Beneficiary is unknown and no death  
  
   42 

benefit claim is submitted to the Committee prior to December 31 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which the Participant died. 
  (c)      Designation of Beneficiaries  .  A Participant may designate one or more Beneficiaries in a manner satisfactory to the Committee which may include among other things, the use of an approved form, an on-line method via the Plan administrator s website, or telephonically.  A Participant may designate both primary Beneficiaries and contingent Beneficiaries. Unless clearly indicated otherwise by the Participant in his or her Beneficiary designation made in accordance with this Section 9.6(c):  (1) if the Participant designates multiple primary Beneficiaries or multiple contingent Beneficiaries, each will share equally in the Account and (2) persons designated as contingent Beneficiaries will be treated as the Participant s Beneficiaries only if each of the Participant s primary Beneficiaries fail to survive the Participant or cannot be located at the time of the distribution of the Participant s Account.  A Participant may change his or her designation of Beneficiary from time to time, provided, however, that if the Participant s Spouse, if any, is not the sole primary Beneficiary of the Account, such Spouse, if any, must consent to the designation of other Beneficiaries in writing before a notary public.  No such designation or change will be effective unless and until it is received by the Committee prior to the Participant s death.  The Beneficiary designations under this Plan will supersede and replace any and all Beneficiary designations made under other plans merged into this Plan. 
  (d)      Payment to Beneficiary  .  Subject to 9.5(b), a Beneficiary s interest in the Account of a deceased Participant will be paid to him or her in a single lump sum as soon as practicable after the Committee determines that the person has an interest in the Account.  Distribution will be completed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the date of the Participant s death.  Notwithstanding the forgoing, if a Participant had elected to receive monthly installment payments, his or her surviving Spouse who is his or her Beneficiary may elect to continue monthly installment payments after the Participant s death. 
  (e)      Information to the Committee  .  In its discretion, the Committee may require a copy of the Participant s death certificate and such other information as the Committee deems relevant to be submitted by the Beneficiary when making a request for death benefits under the Plan. 
  
   43 

Section 9.7      Distribution Pursuant to a Qualified Domestic Relations Order  .  Any portion of a Participant s Account that is awarded to an alternate payee by reason of a qualified domestic relations order in accordance with Section 15.4(c) will, to the extent provided in such order, become available for distribution as soon as practicable following the determination by the Committee that the order meets the requirements of Code   414(p).  If the qualified domestic relations order so provides, an alternate payee may receive a lump sum distribution of less than the entire balance credited to that portion of the Participant s Account allocated to such alternate payee.  There is no minimum amount for such partial distributions and each partial distribution is subject to a service fee established by the Committee. 
  Section 9.8      In-Service Withdrawals  .  A Participant may make a withdrawal from his or her Account, other than the Self-Managed Account, before his or her Severance from Employment in accordance with the rules of this Section 9.8 or, in the case of a Merged Account, in accordance with the rules of Section 9.10.

A Participant may withdraw all or a portion of his or her After Tax Contribution Account or his or her Rollover Contribution Account at any time by making a request for withdrawal via VRU or in accordance with such other procedures prescribed by the Committee from time to time. 
  The Participant s After Tax Contribution Account or Rollover Contribution Account shall both be considered a separate  contract  for purposes of Code   72(d) and a withdrawal from those subaccounts will be allocated on a pro rata basis with respect to the pre and after tax monies held in such subaccount. 
    
  A Participant's subaccount for after-tax contributions under a Merged Account shall be treated as part of his or her After Tax Contribution Account and a Participant's subaccount for rollover contributions under a Merged Account shall be treated as a part of his or her Rollover Contribution Account for purposes of this Section 9.8. 
    
  (b)      Withdrawals After Age Fifty-Nine and One-Half (59  )  .  A Participant may withdraw all or a portion of his or her Pre Tax Contribution Account, Roth Contribution Account or, if applicable, any subaccount for pre-tax contributions or Roth contributions under a Merged Account after age fifty-nine and one-half (59  
  
   44 

), by submitting a request for withdrawal via VRU or in accordance with such other procedures prescribed by the Committee for this purpose. 
  (c)      Hardship Withdrawals  .  Prior to age fifty-nine and one-half (59  ), a Participant may withdraw any portion of his or her Pre-Tax Contribution Account or, if applicable, any subaccount for pre-tax contributions under a Merged Account (other than earnings on the Pre-Tax Contributions or pre-tax contributions under a Merged Plan held in the respective subaccount) in the event of financial hardship and a hardship withdrawal will be granted if, and to the extent that, the Committee determines that the withdrawal is  necessary  to satisfy an  immediate and heavy financial need  as determined in accordance with this Section 9.8(c).  Amounts in a Participant s After-Tax Contribution Account; Rollover Contribution Account; UPS Retirement Contribution Account; SavingsPLUS Account; Roth Contribution Account, Top Heavy Account, as well as any amounts invested in the Self-Managed Account and UPS Stock Fund shall not be available for hardship withdrawal.

  (i)    expenses for unreimbursed medical care described in Code   213(d) incurred by the Participant, the Participant s Spouse or dependents (as defined in Code   152, without regard to Code    152(b)(1), 152(b)(2) and 152(d)(1)(B)) and amounts necessary for those individuals to obtain the medical care; 
  (ii)    the purchase of a principal residence for the Participant (excluding mortgage payments); 
  (iii)    the payment of tuition and related educational fees, including  room and board, for the next twelve (12) months of post secondary education for the Participant or the Participant s Spouse, children or dependents (as defined in Code   152, without regard to Code    152(b)(1), 152(b)(2) and 152(d)(1)(B));

  (vii)    the satisfaction of a federal tax levy on the Account of the Participant under the Plan pursuant to Code   6331. 
  (2)      Withdrawal Necessary to Satisfy Need  .  A hardship withdrawal will be deemed to be  necessary  to satisfy a financial need only if both of the following conditions are satisfied: 
  (i)    The withdrawal will not exceed the amount of the need and any amounts necessary to pay any federal, state or local income taxes or penalties reasonably anticipated to result from the withdrawal; and 
  (ii)    The Participant has obtained all distributions and withdrawals (other than hardship withdrawals) from any employee stock ownership plan under Code   404(k), and all nontaxable loans currently available from all plans maintained by the Affiliates.  However, a Participant will not be required to obtain a loan if the effect of the loan would be to increase the amount of the need. 
  (3)      Suspension of Contributions and Adjusted Limits  .  If any portion of the hardship withdrawal comes from the Participant s Pre-Tax Contribution Account, for the six (6) month period following the date of the withdrawal, the Participant cannot make any Pre-Tax Contributions or After-Tax Contributions under this Plan or elective deferrals or employee contributions under any plan maintained an Affiliate.  For this purpose,  plan  means all qualified and nonqualified plans of deferred compensation, including a stock option, stock purchase or other similar plan, but excluding a health or welfare benefit plan (even if it is part of a cafeteria plan described in Code   125). 
  
   46 

(4)      Procedures  .  Any hardship withdrawal election must describe in detail the nature of the hardship and the amount needed as a result of the hardship and must include any additional information that the Committee requests consistent with this Section 9.8(c), including but not limited to, personal financial records. 
  (5)      Special Rules related to Federal Tax Levy Hardship Withdrawals  .  Notwithstanding any other contrary provision of this   9.8, the following special rules shall apply only to a federal tax levy hardship withdrawal described in   9.8(c)(1)(vii):

  (iii)    the hardship distribution shall be made directly to the U. S. Treasury or other entity specifically identified in the federal tax levy. 
  Finally, the hardship withdrawal rules in this Section 9.8(c)(1)(i) through (vii) are intended to satisfy the safe harbor requirements in the Code   401(k) regulations, and the Committee has the power to implement written procedures to modify these rules and to adopt additional rules to the extent permissible under those regulations. 
    
  (d)      Payment of Withdrawal  .  Payment of the amount requested under  Section 9.8 if permitted will be made to the Participant in a single lump sum as soon as practicable after his or her election is processed. 
  Section 9.9      Disability  .  A Participant who has been absent for more than 52 weeks on account of Disability (but who has not experienced a Severance from Employment) and  
  
   47 

whose Disability continues through the date of withdrawal under this Section 9.9 may withdraw all or any portion of his or her Account, other than the Self-Managed Account, at any time by submitting a request for withdrawal in accordance with the procedures adopted by the Committee for this purpose.

  (vi)    any distribution of Pre-Tax Contributions or pre-tax contributions under a Merged Account pursuant to Section 9.8(c) on account of hardship.

  (5)      Additional Limitations  .  Notwithstanding the foregoing, 
  (i)    if the Distributee elects to have his or her Eligible Rollover Distribution paid in part to him or her and paid in part as a Direct Rollover,  the Direct Rollover must be in an amount of two hundred dollars ($200) or more; and

The minimum distribution rules of Code   401(a)(9) as described in Section 9.4 shall apply for purposes of determining the amount of the distribution that may be transferred to the Inherited IRA. 
  
   50 

Section 9.14      30 Day Waiver  .  A distribution may commence less than thirty (30) days after the notice required with respect to such distributions under Code   411(a)(11) ( Notice ) is given, provided that:

  Section 9.18      Claims Procedure  .  All grievances, complaints or claims concerning any aspect of the operation or administration of the Plan or Trust Funds, including a claim for benefits hereunder (collectively, a  claim for benefits  or  claim ) must be directed to the Committee or to a member of the Committee designated for that purpose.  Each claim for benefits must be filed with the Committee, in writing, within 12 months of the date benefit payments were requested to begin or the date of the action, or inaction, causing the claim for benefits 
  Within ninety (90) days following receipt of a claim for benefits, the Committee will determine whether the claimant is entitled to benefits, or other administrative action, under the Plan, unless additional time is required for processing the claim.  In this event, the Committee will, within the initial ninety (90)-day period, notify the claimant that additional time is needed, explain the reason for the extension, and indicate when a decision on the claim will be made, and such decision will be made within one hundred eighty (180) days of the date the claim is filed. 
  
   51 

A denial by the Committee of a claim for benefits will be stated in writing and delivered or mailed to the claimant.  The notice will set forth the specific reasons for the denial, written in a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant.  The notice will include specific reference to the Plan provisions on which the denial is based and a description of any additional material or information necessary to perfect the claim, an explanation of why this material or information is necessary, the steps to be taken if the claimant wishes to submit his or her claim for review, a description of the Plan s review procedures, the time limits applicable to such procedures, and a statement of the claimant s right to bring a civil action under ERISA   502(a) after all claims appeal procedures have been exhausted. 
  The Committee will afford a reasonable opportunity to any claimant whose request for benefits has been denied for a review of the decision denying the claim.  The review must be requested by written application to the Committee within sixty (60) days following receipt by the claimant of written notification of denial of his or her claim.  Pursuant to this review, the claimant or his or her duly authorized representative may review any documents, records and other information which are pertinent to the denied claim and may submit issues and comments in writing.  A claimant may also submit documents, records and other information relating to his or her claim, without regard to whether such information was submitted in connection with his or her original benefit claim. 
  A decision on the claimant s appeal of the denial of a claim for benefits shall ordinarily be made by the Committee at the next regularly scheduled meeting that immediately follows receipt of the request for review, unless the request for review is received within 30 days of such meeting date.  In that case, the review will occur at the second regularly scheduled meeting following the Plan s receipt of the request for review.  If an extension of time is required because of special circumstances, the Committee will provide the claimant with written notice of the extension decreeing the special circumstances and the date as of which the benefit determination will be made, prior to the commencement of the extension.  A benefit determination will be made no later than the third regularly scheduled meeting of the Committee following the Plan s receipt of the request for review. 
  The decision on review will be in writing and will include specific reasons for the decision, written in a manner calculated to be understood by the claimant, specific reference to the Plan provisions on which the decision is based, a statement that the claimant or his or her authorized personal representative may review any documents and records relevant to the claim determination, a statement describing any further voluntary appeals procedure, if any, and a statement of the claimant s right to bring a civil action under ERISA   502(a). 
  
   52 

No action at law or in equity to recover under this Plan shall be commenced later than one year from the date of the decision on review (or if no decision is furnished within 120 days of receipt of the request for review, one year after the 120th day after receipt of the request for review).  Failure to file suit within this time period shall extinguish any right to benefits under the Plan.   
  Any action at law or in equity to recover under this Plan by a Participant or beneficiary relating to or arising under the Plan shall only be brought in the US District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, and this court shall have personal jurisdiction over any participant or beneficiary named in the action.   
    
  Section 9.19      Forfeiture in Case of Unlocatable Participant  .  If the Committee is unable to pay any benefits under the Plan to any Participant or to a Beneficiary of any Participant who is entitled to benefits under this Plan because the location of such person cannot be ascertained, the Committee will proceed as follows: 
  (a)    Within 90 days of the date any benefits are payable under this Plan, the Committee will send an appropriate notice to such individual, to the last address for such individual listed in the Committee s records. 
  (b)    If this notice is returned as unclaimed or the individual cannot be located at the end of the ninety (90)-day period which follows the ninety (90)-day period referred to in Section 9.19(a), the Committee will send a notice to the last address listed in its records for the individual and will attempt to locate such individual through a commercial locator service. 
  (c)    If such individual has not been located by the December 31 of the calendar year following the calendar year in which benefits become payable and in the case of a Beneficiary, there is no alternate Beneficiary identified under the procedures of Section 9.6, all amounts held for his or her benefit will be forfeited and all liability for payment of that benefit will terminate, unless some other procedure is permitted or required by law.  In any such case, the funds released as a result of such forfeiture each Plan Year will be applied as provided in Section 9.19(d).  However, if an individual subsequently makes what the Committee determines to be a valid and proper claim to the Committee for his or her benefit that was forfeited, the forfeited amount will be restored without interest and will be distributed in accordance with the terms of this Plan. 
  
   53 

(d)    Forfeitures shall be applied in the next following Plan Year and in subsequent Plan Years to the following items in the order set forth below until all the forfeitures have been so applied: 
  (i)    (i)    to restore each previously forfeited benefit upon a valid and proper claim as described in Section 9.18 or upon repayment of a distribution following reemployment, pursuant to Section 8.2; 
  (ii)    to offset future SavingsPLUS Contributions or UPS Retirement Contributions. 
  (iii)    to pay the reasonable and proper expenses of the Plan and Trust Funds as provided under Article XII; and 
  To the extent forfeitures for any Plan Year exceed amounts described in (i) through (iii), such excess forfeitures shall be allocated to each Participant who is an Eligible Employee for such Plan Year on a per capita basis. 
  Section 9.20      Distribution/Transfer Processing Rules  .  All distributions, transfers and other transactions will be processed via VRU or in accordance with such other procedures as may be prescribed from time to time by the Committee, or the Trustee, including procedures regarding the use of reasonable blackout periods during which no transactions are processed.

Section 10.1      Hardship Loans  . 
  (a)      Hardship Loans  .  Hardship loans from a person s Account under this Plan are available in accordance with this Section     10.1; provided, however, that the portion of a person s Account allocated to his or her SavingsPLUS     Account, Roth Contributions Account, UPS Retirement Contribution Account, or invested in a Self-Managed Account  or the UPS Stock Fund shall not be available for hardship loans.  A Participant     may apply for a second loan while a first loan is outstanding, provided that repayment on the first loan is being made in a timely manner.  Subject to Section 10.2 and Section 10.3, no more than two loans may be outstanding at any one time, and any loan balance which is "rolled over" into a Participant s Account or a loan from a Merged Plan shall be counted for the purpose of this limitation. Any loan application must satisfy spousal consent rules, if applicable.  Application for a loan may be made only for the following purposes: 
  (1)    the purchase of a principal residence; 
  (2)    the payment of tuition and related educational fees, including room and board expenses, for the next twelve (12) months of post  secondary education for a Participant, his or her Spouse or dependents (as defined in Code   152, without regard to Code    152(b)(1), 152(b)(2) and 152(d)(1)(B)); 
  (3)    the payment of expenses for medical care (as described in Code   213(d)) previously incurred by the Participant, his or her Spouse or any dependents (as defined in Code   152, without regard to Code    152(b)(1), 152(b)(2) and 152(d)(1)(B)), or necessary for those persons to obtain medical care; 
  (4)    the payment to prevent eviction from or foreclosure on a Participant s principal residence; 
  (5)    the payment of expenses in connection with the adoption of a child; 
  (6)    the payment of unreimbursed funeral expenses for a family member of a Participant.  For this purpose "family member" shall mean the Spouse of a Participant, the child of a Participant or the Participant s Spouse, the parent or step-parent of a Participant or the Participant s Spouse, the brother or sister of a Participant or the Participant s Spouse, the grandparent  
  
   55 

of a Participant or the Participant s Spouse, or the grandchild of a Participant or the Participant s Spouse; and 
  (7)    expenses for the repair or damage to the Participant s principal residence that qualify for the casualty deduction under Code   165 (determined without regard to whether the loss exceeds 10% of adjusted gross income. 
  (b)      Administration  .  The Committee will be the named fiduciary responsible for the administration of the loan program under this Plan.  The Committee will establish objective nondiscriminatory written procedures for that loan program in compliance with Labor Regulation   2550.408b 1.  Those procedures and any amendments to those procedures, to the extent not inconsistent with the terms of this Plan, are incorporated by this reference as part of this Plan. 
  (c)      Statutory Requirements  . 
  (1)      General  .  All loans made under this Plan will comply with the following requirements under ERISA   408(b)(1): 
  (i)    Each Participant or Beneficiary of a deceased Participant who is a  party-in-interest  (as defined in ERISA   3(14) ) may request a loan from the Plan; 
  (ii)    Loans will be made available to Participants and Beneficiaries who are eligible for a loan on a reasonably equivalent basis; 
  (iii)    Loans will not be made available to Highly Compensated Employees in an amount greater than the amount made available to other Employees; 
  (iv)    Loans will be made in accordance with specific provisions regarding loans set forth in this Plan and the written loan procedures established by the Committee; 
  (v)    Loans will bear a reasonable rate of interest as set by the Committee; and 
  (vi)    Loans will be adequately secured. 
  
   56 

(2)      Repayment Period  . 
  (i)    Principal and interest on the loan must be repaid in substantially level installments with payments not less frequently than quarterly over a period of five (5) years or less, or up to fifteen (15) years in the case of a residential loan. 
  (ii)    The Committee may establish such rules as it deems necessary or appropriate for the repayment of loans, including a cure period for repayments.  The Committee may permit a Participant who is on a bona fide leave of absence either without pay or with pay that is at a rate that is less than the amount of the installment payments required under the terms of the loan to suspend repayment for the period of the absence (but not to exceed a year, except in the case of a Participant who is performing qualified military service within the meaning of Code   414(u)(5)).  If payments are suspended, the loan will be reamortized on the date that such Participant is no longer entitled to a suspension at the then outstanding principal and interest (including interest accrued during the absence) in substantially equal installments over the remaining loan term.  The loan term for a Participant engaged in qualified military service within the meaning of Code   414(u)(5) shall be extended by the period of such service.  Except in the case of a Participant engaged in qualified military service within the meaning of Code   414(u)(5), in no event shall any loan become due and payable later than the applicable period described in Section 10.1(c)(2)(i).  In the case of a suspension of loan payments during a period of qualified military service within the meaning of Code   414(u)(5), the loan must be paid in full (including interest that accrues during such period) by the end of the original term extended by the period of military service. 
  (iii)    A loan made under this Section 10.1 shall become due and payable in full: 
  (A)    if a Participant s employment as an Employee terminates for any reason whatsoever unless such Participant remains a  party in interest  with respect to this Plan following his termination of employment; 
  
   57 

(B)    if the Committee or a Trustee conclude that the Participant or Beneficiary no longer is a good credit risk; or 
  (C)    to the extent permissible under federal law, if a Participant s or Beneficiary s obligation to repay the loan has been discharged through a bankruptcy or any other legal process or action which did not actually result in payment in full. 
  (3)      Limitations on Amounts  .  No loan will be available to a Participant or a Beneficiary under this Section 10.1 if the Committee determines he or she would be unable to repay such loan in a timely fashion.  The principal amount of a loan made under this Plan to a Participant or Beneficiary, together with the outstanding principal amount of any loan made under any plan maintained by an Affiliate that satisfies the requirements of Code    401 or 403, may not exceed the lesser of: 
  (i)    Fifty percent (50%) of that person s vested portion of his or her Account (excluding any amounts in such person s SavingsPLUS Account, Roth Contribution Account, Self-Managed Account, UPS Stock and subject to any special consent requirements under Appendix 14.3.) at the time the loan is made; or: 
  (ii)    Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000), reduced by the excess (if any) of: 
  (D)    the highest outstanding balance of any previous loans from this Plan and any other plan maintained by an Affiliate during the one year period ending immediately before the date on which the current loan is made over 
  (E)    the outstanding balance of the previous loans on the date on which the current loan is made. 
  (iii)      Minimum Loan Amount  .  The minimum loan amount is one thousand dollars ($1,000). 
  
   58 

(4)      Interest Rate  .  The interest rate for a loan made under this Section 10.1     shall be one percent above the prime rate as published in the   Wall Street Journal   as of the last business day of the month preceding the month in which the loan application is made.  The interest rate will remain fixed for the duration of the loan except to the extent otherwise required by applicable law. 
  (5)      Method of Repayment  .  Repayment of a loan made under this Section 10.1 shall be made through payroll withholding except that payment by check will be permitted under any circumstances where the Committee determines that payroll deduction would be impracticable or prohibitive.  Further, a loan may be repaid in full at any time prior to the expiration of the installment period of such loan by a single sum payment to the Trustees of the outstanding principal balance then due plus any accrued but unpaid interest.  All repayments made to an Affiliate shall be transferred to the Trustees as soon as practicable after such Affiliate deducts them or receives them. 
  (6)      Security and Default  . 
  (i)    Any loan made to a Participant or Beneficiary under this Section 10.1 shall be secured by an amount equal to the lesser of (A) the outstanding principal and interest due under such loan or (B) fifty percent (50%) of his or her total vested interest in his or her Account (excluding any amounts in such person s SavingsPLUS Account or Roth Contribution Account). 
  (ii)    The events of default shall be set forth in the promissory note and security agreement which evidences the loan, and such events may include the following: 
  (A)    failure to repay the loan before the end of the five (5) year maximum period or fifteen (15) year period in the case of a residential loan set forth in Section 10.1(c)(2). 
  (B)    failure to repay the amount due and payable on the loan upon the occurrence of an event described in Section 10.1(c)(2)(iii). 
  
   59 

(iii)    Upon default of a loan the Trustees shall upon direction by the Committee foreclose on such loan and exercise the Plan s security interest in the Participant s or Beneficiary s Account by reducing the amount otherwise distributable to him or her under this Plan by the principal amount of the loan plus any accrued but unpaid interest then due at the time of default as determined without regard to whether the loan had been discharged through a bankruptcy or any other legal process or action which did not actually result in payment in full. 
  (iv)    The Committee shall have the power to direct the Trustees to take such action as the Committee deems necessary or appropriate to stop the payment of an Account to or on behalf of a Participant or Beneficiary who fails to repay a loan (without regard to whether his or her obligation to repay such loan had been discharged through a bankruptcy or any other legal process or action) until his or her Account has been reduced by the principal plus accrued but unpaid interest due (without regard to such discharge) on such loan or to distribute the note which evidences such loan in full satisfaction of any interest in such Account which is attributable to the value of such note. 
  (7)      Distribution and Default  .  The vested portion of an Account actually payable to an individual who has an outstanding loan will be determined by reducing the vested portion of an Account by the amount of the security interest in the Account.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Plan or in the written loan procedures, in the event of default, foreclosure on the note and execution of the security interest in an Account will not occur until a distributable event occurs under this Plan. 
  (8)      Other Conditions  .  Any loan made under this Plan shall be subject to such other terms, limitations and conditions as the Committee from time to time shall deem necessary or appropriate 
  (9)      Accounting  .  A loan to a Participant shall be considered a separate investment of the Account of the Participant.  The proceeds of the loan shall be withdrawn pro rata from each Investment Option in which the Participant s Account is invested at the time of the loan and repayments of principal and interest on the loan shall be invested in the Investment Options in effect at  
  
   60 

the time of repayment pursuant to the Participant s investment election under Article VII. 
  Section 10.2      Rollover of Loan Balances  .  An Eligible Employee who becomes an Eligible Employee as a result of an acquisition by the Employer or an Affiliate may elect to rollover one or more loans from another qualified retirement plan in connection with the rollover of the Participant s entire balance under such plan.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) if a Participant rolls over more than two loans under this Section 10.2 such Participant may not apply for or take a new loan under Section 10.1(a) until he or she has repaid in full all but one loan, and after such repayment such Participant shall be subject to the limitation set forth in Section 10.1(a) and (b) in no event shall a loan rolled over from another qualified retirement plan include any amounts distributed from a designated Roth account (as defined in Treasury Regulation   1.402A-1, Q A-1). 
  Section 10.3      Loans from Merged Plans  .  Any outstanding loan under a Merged Plan shall continue to be repaid under this Plan following the merger in accordance with Appendix 14.3.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Participant had more than two loans under a Merged Plan such Participant may not apply for or take a new loan under Section 10.1(a) until he or she has repaid in full all but one loan, and after such repayment such Participant shall be subject to the limitation set forth in Section 10.1(a). 
  Article XI.      TRUST FUND       
  Section 11.1      Trustee Responsibilities  .  The Trustees will hold in trust all assets of the Trust Funds and will manage, invest and administer the Trust Funds in accordance with the terms of the trust agreements between the Employer and the Trustees, as amended from time to time, and incorporated herein by reference and this Plan without distinction between principal and income and the Trustees will be responsible for valuing all assets other than UPS Stock.

Charges for processing distributions, rollovers and loans ( Distribution Expenses ) will be allocated  
  
   61 

directly to the Account of each Participant or Beneficiary who has requested a distribution, rollover or loan.  The charges for Distribution Expenses  shall be established by the Committee from time to time and may vary depending on the type of distribution, rollover or loan requested by the Participant or Beneficiary.  All expenses (other than Distribution Expenses) shall be paid from forfeitures or to the extent forfeitures are insufficient, shall be allocated among all of the Accounts on a per capita basis.  The Employer Companies, however, will have the right to pay all or any part of any expenses and to be reimbursed from the Trust Funds for any expenses paid by them that are properly payable from the Trust Funds.  Any expenses that cannot be paid from the Trust Funds will be paid by the Employer Companies. 
  Article XIII.      ADMINISTRATIVE COMMITTEE       
  Section 13.1      Committee  .  The Plan will be administered by a Committee consisting of not less than three members appointed by the Board, each of whom is and shall be a  named fiduciary  with respect to the Plan.  The Committee will be the  plan administrator  of the Plan as that term is used in ERISA and the agent for service of process on or with respect to the Plan. 
  Section 13.2      Vacancies on Committee  .  Committee members will serve at the pleasure of the Board, and all vacancies will be filled by the Board.  Committee members may resign at any time, such resignation to be effective when accepted by the Board. 
  Section 13.3      Authority of Committee  .  The Committee will establish rules for the administration of the Plan, and will decide all questions arising in the administration of the Plan not specifically delegated or reserved to the Board, the Employer or the Trustees.  Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Plan, the Committee will have the exclusive right and complete discretion and authority to control the operation, management and administration of this Plan, with all powers necessary to enable the Committee to properly carry out such responsibilities, including but not limited to, the power to interpret the Plan, to construe the Plan s terms, and to decide any matters arising in and with respect to the administration and operation of the Plan, and, subject to the claims procedure described in Section 9.18, any interpretations or decisions so made will be final and binding on all persons; provided, however that all such interpretations and decisions will be applied in a uniform manner to all similarly situated persons. 
  Section 13.4      Action by Committee      .  The Committee will act by a majority of the Committee members at that time in office.  Such action may be taken either by a vote at a meeting or in writing without a meeting.  The Committee may appoint subcommittees and  
  
   62 

also may authorize any one or more of the Committee members or any agent to execute any document or documents or to take any other action on behalf of the Committee, except that no member of the Committee will have the right to take any such action on any matter relating solely to himself or herself or to any of his or her rights or benefits under the Plan. 
  Section 13.5      Liability of the Committee  .  The Committee and its members, to the extent of the exercise of their authority, will discharge their duties with respect to the Plan in accordance with ERISA.  No member will be responsible for the actions or omissions of another member or of any other party that is a fiduciary with respect to this Plan, other than himself or herself, which are not in conformity with the Plan or ERISA, unless (a) the member knowingly participates in or knowingly conceals such conduct which he or she knows to be in breach of this standard, (b) his or her own conduct has enabled the other member or other fiduciary to be in breach of this standard, or (c) he or she has knowledge of such breach by another member or other fiduciary and fails to make reasonable efforts under the circumstances to remedy such breach. 
  Section 13.6      Authority to Appoint Officers and Advisors  .  The Committee may appoint such officers as it may deem advisable and may adopt by laws covering the transaction of its business.  The Committee may appoint and employ an Investment Manager or Managers, counsel, agents and such other service providers, including clerical, accounting and advisory service providers, as it may require in carrying out the provisions of the Plan, and will be fully protected in relying upon any action taken in reliance upon advice given by such persons. 
  Section 13.7      Committee Meeting  .  The Committee will hold meetings at such place or places, and at such time or times as it may determine from time to time, but not less frequently than once each calendar quarter. 
  Section 13.8      Compensation and Expenses of Committee  .  The members of the Committee may receive reasonable compensation for their services as the Board from time to time may determine.  Such compensation and all other expenses of the Committee, including the compensation of officers, actuaries or counsel, agents or others that the Committee may employ, will constitute expenses of the Trust Funds unless paid by the Employer Companies.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Committee member who is employed on a full time basis by an Employer Company will receive no compensation, but may be reimbursed for expenses incurred. 
  Section 13.9      Records  .  The Committee will keep or cause to be kept accurate and complete books and records.

Section 13.10      Fiduciary Responsibility Insurance, Bonding  .  If the Employer has not done so, the Committee may purchase appropriate insurance on behalf of the Plan and the Plan s fiduciaries, including the members of the Committee, to cover liability or losses occurring by reason of the acts or omissions of a fiduciary; provided, however, that such insurance, to the extent purchased by the Plan, must permit recourse by the insurer against the fiduciary in the case of a breach of a fiduciary duty or obligation by such fiduciary.  The cost of such insurance will be borne by the Trust Funds, unless the insurance is paid for by the Employer.  The Committee will also obtain a bond covering all of the Plan s fiduciaries, to be paid from the assets of the Trust Funds. 
  Section 13.11      Delegation of Specific Responsibilities  .  The members of the Committee may agree in writing signed by each member to allocate to any one of their number or to other persons (including corporations or other entities) any of the responsibilities with which they are charged pursuant hereto, including the appointment of a record keeper and one or more Investment Managers, provided any agreement allocating such duties will be in writing and kept with the records of the Plan and, in the case of the appointment of an Investment Manager, the person is a named fiduciary.  If such delegation is made to a person who is not a member of the Committee, that person or, in the case of a corporation or other entity, its responsible officer, will acknowledge the acceptance and understanding of such duties and responsibilities. 
  Section 13.12      Allocation of Responsibility Among Fiduciaries for Plan and Trust Administration  .  The fiduciaries of this Plan, including the Trustees, the Employer, the Board and the Committee, will have only those specific powers, duties, responsibilities and obligations as are specifically given them under this Plan.  Each fiduciary warrants that any directions given, information furnished, or action taken will be in accordance with the provisions of the Plan authorizing or providing for such direction, information or action.  Furthermore, each fiduciary may rely upon any such direction, information or action of another fiduciary as being proper under this Plan, and is not required under this Plan to inquire into the propriety of any such direction, information or action.  It is intended that each fiduciary will be responsible for the proper exercise of its own powers, duties, responsibilities and obligations under this Plan and will not be responsible for any act or failure to act of another fiduciary.  No fiduciary guarantees the Trust Funds in any manner against investment loss or depreciation in asset value. 
  Section 13.13      Indemnification  .  The Employer (to the extent permissible under the Employer s charter and by laws and applicable law) will indemnify the officers and employees of the Employer and each Employer Company and the members of the  
  
   64 

Committee, and their heirs, successors and assigns from and against any liability, assessment, loss, expense or other cost of any kind or description whatsoever, including legal fees and expenses, actually incurred by him or her on account of any action or proceeding, actual or threatened, that arises as a result of his or her acting within the scope of his or her authority under this Plan, provided (a) such action or proceeding does not arise as a result of his or her own gross negligence, willful misconduct or lack of good faith and (b) such protection is not otherwise provided through insurance. 
  Article XIV.      AMENDMENT, TERMINATION AND MERGER       
  Section 14.1      Amendment  .  The Board reserves the right at any time and from time to time to amend this Plan in any respect in writing, and the amendment will be binding upon a Trustee and all Employer Companies without further action; provided, that no amendment will be made that (unless otherwise permissible under applicable law) would (a) divert any of the assets of the Trust Funds to any purpose other than the exclusive benefit of Participants and Beneficiaries, (b) eliminate or reduce an optional form of benefit except to the extent permissible under Code   411(d)(6) or (c) change the rights and duties of the Trustees without its consent.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Plan may be amended retroactively to affect the Account maintained for any person if necessary to cause this Plan and the Trust Funds to be exempt from income taxes under the Code. 
  Section 14.2      Termination  .  The Employer expects this Plan to be continued indefinitely but, of necessity, reserves the right to terminate or to partially terminate this Plan or to discontinue its contributions at any time by action of the Board.  The Employer also reserves the right to terminate or to partially terminate the participation in this Plan by an Employer Company by action of the Board.  An Employer Company s participation in this Plan automatically will terminate if, and at such time as, it ceases to satisfy the requirements to be an Employer Company for any reason whatsoever (other than through a merger or consolidation into another Employer Company), but termination of participation by an Employer Company will not be deemed to be a termination or partial termination of the Plan except to the extent required under the Code. 
  If there is a termination or partial termination of this Plan or a declaration of a discontinuance of contributions to this Plan, the Accounts of all affected Participants who are employees as of the effective date of the termination, partial termination or declaration will become fully vested.  The Committee will cause all unallocated amounts to be allocated to the appropriate Accounts of the affected Participants and Beneficiaries.  Upon direction of the Committee, the Trustees will distribute Accounts to Participants and Beneficiaries in  
  
   65 

accordance with uniform rules established by the Committee consistent with Code   401(a) and Code   401(k). 
  Section 14.3      Merger, Consolidation or Transfer of Plan Assets  .  No merger or consolidation of this Plan with, or transfer of assets or liabilities of this Plan to, any other plan will occur unless each Participant in the Plan would (if the Plan then terminated) receive a benefit immediately after the merger, consolidation, or transfer that is equal to or greater than the benefit he or she would have been entitled to receive immediately before the merger, consolidation or transfer (if the Plan had then terminated). 
  The Committee may authorize the Trustees to accept a transfer of assets from or to transfer Trust Fund assets to the trustee, custodian or insurance company holding assets of any other plan that satisfies the requirements of Code   401(a) in connection with a merger or consolidation with or other transfer of assets and liabilities to or from any such plan, provided that the transfer will not affect the qualification of this Plan under Code   401(a). 
  Any special provisions that apply to amounts transferred under this Section 14.3 shall be set forth in Appendix 14.3. 
  Article XV.      MISCELLANEOUS       
  Section 15.1      Headings  .  The headings and subheadings in this Plan have been inserted for convenience of reference only and are to be ignored in the construction of the provisions of this Plan.  All references to Articles, Sections and to paragraphs will be to Sections, and to subsections of this Plan unless otherwise indicated. 
  Section 15.2      Construction  .  In the construction of this Plan, the singular will include the plural in all cases where that meaning would be appropriate.  This Plan will be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Georgia, to the extent that those laws are not preempted by federal law.  This Plan will not be construed to grant, nor will grant, any rights or interests to Participants or Beneficiaries in addition to those minimum rights and interests required under ERISA.  Further, the Trust Fund is intended to be tax exempt under the Code. 
  Any reference to a statute will also include a reference to any successor statute and if any amendment renumbers a section of a statute referenced in this Plan, any such reference to such section automatically will become a reference to that section as renumbered. 
  
   66 

Section 15.3      Counterparts  .  This Plan may be executed by the Employer and the Trustees in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken together shall be deemed to be one document. 
  Section 15.4      Prohibition Against Attachment  . 
  (a)    None of the benefits payable hereunder will be subject to the claims of any creditor of any Participant or Beneficiary other than this Plan nor will those benefits be subject to attachment, garnishment or other legal or equitable process by any creditor of a Participant or Beneficiary other than this Plan, nor will any Participant or Beneficiary have any right to alienate, anticipate, commute, pledge, encumber, or assign any of such benefits. 
  (b)    If any Participant or Beneficiary under the Plan becomes bankrupt or attempts to anticipate, alienate, sell, transfer, assign, pledge, encumber or charge any benefit under the Plan, the interest of such person in such benefit shall, in the discretion of the Committee, cease and terminate, and in that event the Committee may direct the Trustees to hold or apply the same or any part thereof to or for the benefit of such Participant or Beneficiary, his or her Spouse, children, or other dependents, or any of them, in such manner and in such proportion as the Committee may deem proper. 
  (c)    The restrictions of subsections (a) and (b) of this Section will not be violated by either (1) the creation of a right to payments from this Plan by reason of a qualified domestic relations order (as defined in Code   414(p)) or (2) the making of such payments.  In accordance with uniform and nondiscriminatory procedures established by the Committee from time to time, the Committee upon the receipt of a domestic relations order that seeks to require the distribution of a Participant s Account in whole or in part to an alternate payee (as the term is defined in Code   414(p)(8)) will: 
  (1)    promptly notify the Participant and such alternate payee of the receipt of such order and of the procedure that the Committee will follow to determine whether such order constitutes a qualified domestic relations order within the meaning of Code   414(p); 
  (2)    determine whether such order constitutes a qualified domestic relations order, notify the Participant and the alternate payee of the results  
  
   67 

of such determination and, if the Committee determines that such order does constitute a qualified domestic relations order; 
  (3)    transfer such amounts, if any, from the Participant s Account to a separate bookkeeping account for such alternate payee as the Committee determines necessary to satisfy the requirements of the order and Code   414(p); and 
  (4)    make such distribution to such alternate payee as the Committee deems called for under the terms of such order in accordance with Code   414(p) without regard to whether a distribution would be permissible at such time to the Participant under the terms of this Plan. 
  An alternate payee will be treated the same as a Beneficiary of a deceased Participant pending the distribution of such alternate payee s entire interest under this Plan.  Further, an alternate payee who is the Spouse or former Spouse of the Participant may elect that any distribution that qualifies as an eligible rollover distribution (within the meaning of Code   401(a)(31)) be transferred directly to an eligible retirement plan in accordance with Section 9.13. 
  Section 15.5      Benefits Supported Only by the Trust Funds  .  Any person having any claim for any benefit under this Plan must look solely to the assets of the Trust Funds for satisfaction.  In no event will the Trustees, the Employer, an Employer Company, the Committee or any of their officers, directors or agents be liable in their individual capacities to any person whomsoever for the payment of benefits under the provisions of this Plan. 
  Section 15.6      Satisfaction of Claims  .  Any payment to a Participant or Beneficiary, or to the legal representative or heirs at law of either, made in accordance with the provisions of this Plan will to the extent of such payment be in full satisfaction of all claims under this Plan against the Trustees, the Employer, any Employer Company and the Committee, any of whom may require that person, his or her legal representative or heirs at law, as a condition precedent to such payment, to execute a receipt and release in a form acceptable to the Committee. 
  Section 15.7      Nonreversion  .  No part of the Trust Funds will ever be used for or be diverted to purposes other than for the exclusive benefit of Participants and Beneficiaries except that, upon direction of the Committee, the Trustees will return contributions to the Employer Companies in the following circumstances, to the extent permitted by the Code and ERISA: 
  
   68 

(a)    a contribution that is made by a mistake of fact will be returned, provided the return is made within one year after the payment of such contribution; and 
  (b)    a contribution may be returned to the extent that the Internal Revenue Service denies an income tax deduction of such contribution, provided such return is made within one year after such denial, all such contributions being made expressly on the condition that such contributions are deductible in full for federal income tax purposes. 
  Section 15.8      Top Heavy Plan  . 
  (a)      Determination  .  The Committee as of the last day of each Plan Year (the  determination date ) will determine the sum of the present value of the accrued benefits of  key employees  (as defined in Code   416(i)(1)) and the sum of the present value of the accrued benefits of all other employees in accordance with the rules set forth in Code   416(g), or will take such other action as the Committee deems appropriate to conclude that no such determination is necessary under the circumstances.  If the sum of the present value of the accrued benefits of such key employees exceeds sixty percent (60%) of the sum of the present value of the accrued benefits of all employees as of the determination date, this Plan will be  top heavy  for the immediately following Plan Year.  For purposes of this Section, the present value of the accrued benefit of each employee will be equal to the sum of: 
  (1)    the balance of the employee s Account under this Plan (determined for this purpose as of the last day of each Plan Year, which is the  valuation date  for this Plan); 
  (2)    the present value of the employee s accrued benefit, if any, (determined as of the most recent valuation date occurring within a twelve (12) month period ending on the determination date) under: 
  (i)    each qualified plan (as described in Code   401(a)) maintained by an Affiliate (A) in which a key employee is a participant or (B) that enables any plan described in subclause (ii) to meet the requirements of Code   401(a)(4) or   410 (the  required aggregation group ), and 
  (ii)    each other qualified plan maintained by an Affiliate (other than a plan described in clause (i) that may be aggregated with  
  
   69 

this Plan and the plans described in clause (i), provided such aggregation group (including a plan described in this clause (ii) continues to meet the requirements of Code   401(a)(4) and   410 (the  permissive aggregation group  and 
  (3)    the value of any withdrawals and distributions made from this Plan and the plans described in (2) above during the 1-year period ending on such determination date and the value of any contributions due under this Plan and the defined contribution plans described in (2) above but as yet unpaid as of such determination date.  The preceding sentence shall also apply to distributions under a terminated plan which, had it not been terminated, would have been required to be aggregated with the Plan under Code   416(g)(2)(A)(i).  In the case of a distribution made for a reason other than Severance from Employment, death or disability, this provision shall be applied by substituting  5-year period  for  1-year period.  
  provided, however, the accrued benefit of any employee will be disregarded if such employee has not performed any services for any Affiliate at any time during the one (1) year period ending on the date as of which such determination is made. 
  (b)      Special Top Heavy Contribution  .  If the Committee determines that this Plan is  top heavy  for any Plan Year, the following special rules will apply notwithstanding any other rules to the contrary set forth elsewhere in this Plan. 
  A contribution will be made for each Participant who is an Eligible Employee on the last day of such Plan Year that, when added to the employer contribution and forfeitures otherwise allocated on behalf of such individual for such Plan Year under this Plan and any other defined contribution plan maintained by an Affiliate, is equal to: 
  (1)    for each such Eligible Employee who is not a participant in a top heavy defined benefit plan maintained by the Employer or an Affiliate, the lesser of (a) three percent (3%) of such Eligible Employee s Compensation for such year or (b) the percentage at which contributions are made (or are required to be made) for such year to the key employee for whom such percentage is the highest; or 
  
   70 

(2)    for each such Eligible Employee who also participates in a top heavy defined benefit plan maintained by the Employer or an Affiliate, five percent (5%) of such Eligible Employee s Compensation for such year; 
  provided, however, that no such contribution will be made under this Section for any Eligible Employee to the extent such Eligible Employee receives the top heavy minimum contributions (as described in Code   416(c)) under another defined contribution plan maintained by the Employer or an Affiliate for such Plan Year. 
    
  SavingsPLUS Contributions shall be taken into account for purposes of satisfying the minimum contribution requirements of Code   416(c)(2) and the Plan.  The preceding sentence shall apply with respect to SavingsPLUS Contributions or, if the minimum contribution requirement is met in another defined contribution plan, such other plan.  SavingsPLUS Contributions that are used to satisfy the minimum contribution requirements shall be treated as employer matching contributions for purposes of the actual contribution percentage test and the other requirements of Code   401(m). 
    
  Section 15.9      USERRA  .  Notwithstanding anything in this Plan to the contrary, contributions, benefits and service credit with respect to qualified military service shall be provided in accordance with Code   414(u).  Additionally, to the extent required under Code   414(u), a Participant eligible to make contributions to this Plan with respect to a period of military leave from an employer that sponsored a merged plan (as listed in Appendix 15.9) and which leave occurred (all or in part) prior to the merger of such merged plan into this Plan, and the amount of such contributions for the portion of the leave that occurred prior to the merger shall be determined under the terms of the merged Plan as in effect during the period of the applicable leave. 
  In the case of a Participant who dies while performing qualified military service (as defined in Section 414(u) of the Code), his or her Beneficiary shall be entitled to any additional benefits (other than benefit accruals relating to the period of qualified military service) provided under the Plan had the Participant resumed and then terminated employment on account of death. 
    
  Section 15.10      Family and Medical Leave Act  .  Notwithstanding any other provision, this Plan shall be interpreted and administered in all respects so that it complies with the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, as may be amended from time to time. 
  
   71 

Section 15.11      No Estoppel of Plan  .  No person is entitled to any benefit under this Plan except and to the extent expressly provided under this Plan.  The fact that payments have been made from this Plan in connection with any claim for benefits under this Plan does not (a) establish the validity of the claim, (b) provide any right to have such benefits continue for any period of time, or (c) prevent this Plan from recovering the benefits paid to the extent that the Committee determines that there was no right to payment of the benefits under this Plan.  Thus, if a benefit is paid to a person under this Plan and it is thereafter determined by the Committee that such benefit should not have been paid (whether or not attributable to an error by such person, the Committee or any other person), then the Committee may take such action as the Committee deems necessary or appropriate to remedy such situation, including without limitation by (1) deducting the amount of any overpayment theretofore made to or on behalf of such person from any succeeding payments to or on behalf of such person under this Plan or from any amounts due or owing to such person by the Employer or any Affiliate or under any other plan, program or arrangement benefiting the employees or former employees of the Employer or any Affiliate, or (2) otherwise recovering such overpayment from whoever has benefited from it. 
  If the Committee determines that an underpayment of benefits has been made, the Committee will take such action as it deems necessary or appropriate to remedy such situation.  However, in no event will interest be paid on the amount of any underpayment other than the investment gains (or losses) credited to the Participant s Account pending payment.

Appendix 5.2    MAXIMUM BENEFITS       
    
  The limitations of this Appendix shall apply in Limitation Years beginning on or after July 1, 2007, except as otherwise provided herein.  Capitalized terms are defined in Section 3 hereof or, if not defined in Section 3, in the main body of the Plan.  All Section references are to Sections of this Appendix 5.2, except as otherwise provided. 
    
  Section 1.1  .  If the Participant does not participate in, and has never participated in another qualified plan maintained by the Employer or a welfare benefit fund, as defined in Code   419(e) maintained by the Employer, or an individual medical account, as defined in Code   415(1)(2), maintained by the Employer, or a simplified employee pension, as defined in Code   408(k), maintained by the Employer, which provides an annual addition as defined in Section 3.1, the amount of Annual Additions which may be credited to the Participant s Account for any Limitation Year will not exceed the lesser of the Maximum Permissible Amount or any other limitation contained in this Plan.  If the Employer contribution that would otherwise be contributed or allocated to the Participant s Account would cause the Annual Additions for the Limitation Year to exceed the Maximum Permissible Amount, the amount contributed or allocated will be reduced so that the Annual Additions for the Limitation Year will equal the Maximum Permissible Amount. 
    
  Section 2.1  .  This Section applies if, in addition to this Plan, the Participant is covered under another qualified defined contribution plan maintained by the Employer, a welfare benefit fund maintained by the Employer, an individual medical account maintained by the Employer, or a simplified employee pension maintained by the Employer (collectively  Qualified Plans ), that provides an Annual Addition during any Limitation Year.  The Annual Additions which may be credited to a Participant s Account under this Plan for any such Limitation Year will not exceed the Maximum Permissible Amount reduced by the Annual Additions credited to a Participant s Account under the other Qualified Plans for the same Limitation Year.  If the Annual Additions with respect to the Participant under other Qualified Plans maintained by the Employer are less than the Maximum Permissible Amount and the Employer contribution that would otherwise be contributed or allocated to the Participant s Account under this Plan would cause the Annual Additions for the Limitation Year to exceed this limitation, the amount contributed or allocated will be reduced so that the Annual Additions under all such plans and funds for the Limitation Year will equal the Maximum Permissible Amount.  If the Annual Additions with respect to the Participant under such other Qualified Plans, in the aggregate are equal to the Maximum Permissible Amount, no amount will be contributed or allocated to the Participant s Account under this Plan for the Limitation Year. 
  
   82 

Section 3.  Definitions. 
    
  Section 3.1.   Annual Additions  .  The sum of the following amounts credited to a Participant s Account for the Limitation Year: 
    
  (a)    employer contributions; 
    
  (b)    employee contributions; 
    
  (c)    forfeitures; 
    
  (d)    amounts allocated to an individual medical account, as defined in Code   415(1)(2), which is part of a pension or annuity plan maintained by the Employer are treated as Annual Additions to a defined contribution plan.  Also amounts derived from contributions paid or accrued which are attributable to post-retirement medical benefits, allocated to the separate account of a key employee, as defined in Code   419A(d)(3), under a welfare benefit fund, as defined in Code   419(e), maintained by the Employer are treated as Annual Additions to a defined contribution plan; and 
    
  (e)    allocations under a simplified employee pension. 
    
  Section 3.2.    Compensation  .  For purposes of Code   415, Compensation is defined as wages, within the meaning of Code   3401(a), and all other payments of compensation to an employee by the Employer (in the course of the employer s trade or business) for which the Employer is required to furnish the employee a written statement under    6041(d), 6051(a)(3), and 6052 (i.e., wages, tips and other compensation as reported on Form W-2).  Compensation shall be determined without regard to any rules under Code   3401(a) that limit the remuneration included in wages based on the nature or location of the employment or the services performed (such as the exception for agricultural labor in Code   3401(s)(2). 
    
  Except as provided herein, Compensation for a Limitation Year is the compensation actually paid or made available during such Limitation Year. 
    
  For Limitation Years beginning on or after July 1, 2007, Compensation for a Limitation Year shall also include compensation paid by the later of 2   months after an employee s severance from employment with the employer maintaining the plan or the end of the Limitation Year that includes the date of the employee s severance from employment with the employer maintaining the plan if:   
  
   83 

(a) the payment is regular compensation for services during the employee s regular working hours, or compensation for services outside the employee s regular working hours (such as overtime or shift differential), commissions, bonuses, or other similar payments, and, absent a severance from employment, the payments would have been paid to the employee while the employee continued in employment with the employer; (b) the payment is for unused accrued bona fide sick, vacation or other leave that the employee would have been able to use if employment had continued; or (c) the payment is received by the employee pursuant to a nonqualified unfunded deferred compensation plan and would have been paid at the same time if employment had continued, but only to the extent includible in gross income.    
    
  Any payments not described above shall not be considered Compensation if paid after severance from employment, even if they are paid by the later of 2   months after the date of severance from employment or the end of the Limitation Year that includes the date of severance from employment, except, payments to an individual who does not currently perform services for the employer by reason of qualified military service (within the meaning of Code   414(u)(1)) to the extent these payments do not exceed the amounts the individual would have received if the individual had continued to perform services for the employer rather than entering qualified military service. 
    
  Back pay, within the meaning of Treasury Regulation  1.415(c)-2(g)(8), shall be treated as Compensation for the Limitation Year to which the back pay relates to the extent the back pay represents wages and compensation that would otherwise be included under this definition. 
    
  For Limitation Years beginning after December 31, 1997, Compensation paid or made available during such Limitation Year shall include amounts that would otherwise be included in Compensation but for an election under Code   125(a),  402(e)(3),   402(h)(1)(B),   402(k), or   457(b). For Limitation Years beginning after December 31, 2000, Compensation shall also include any elective amounts that are not includible in the gross income of the employee by reason of Code   132(f)(4).  For Limitation Years beginning after December 31, 2001, Compensation shall also include deemed   125 compensation.  Deemed   125 compensation is an amount that is excludable under Code   106 that is not available to a participant in cash in lieu of group health coverage under a Code   125 arrangement solely because the participant is unable to certify that he or she has other health coverage.  Amounts are deemed   125 compensation only if the employer does not request or otherwise collect information regarding the participant s other health coverage as part of the enrollment process for the health plan. 
    
  Effective for years beginning after December 31, 2008, a Participant receiving a differential wage payment (as described in Code   414(u)(12)) shall be treated as an employee of the Employer  
  
   84 

making the differential wage payment and, for purposes of this Appendix 5.2, the differential wage payment shall be treated as Compensation. 
    
  Section 3.3.    Defined Contribution Dollar Limitation  .  $40,000, as adjusted under Code   415(d). 
    
  Section 3.4.    Employer  .  Employer means United Parcel Service of America, Inc. and Affiliates. 
    
  Section 3.5.    Limitation Year  .  The calendar year.  All qualified plans maintained by the Employer must use the same Limitation Year.  If the Limitation Year is amended to a different 12-consecutive month period, the new Limitation Year must begin on a date within the Limitation Year in which the amendment is made. 
    
  Section 3.6.    Maximum Permissible Amount  . 
    
  Except for catch up contributions described in Code   414(v), the Maximum Permissible Amount for any Limitation Year shall not exceed the lesser of: 

(b) 
    100 percent of the Participant s Compensation for the Limitation Year. 
       
  The Compensation limit referred to in (b) shall not apply to any contribution for medical benefits after separation from service (within the meaning of Code    401(h) or 419A(f)(2)) which is otherwise treated as an Annual Addition. 
    
  If a short Limitation Year is created because of an amendment changing the Limitation Year to a different 12-consecutive month period, the Maximum Permissible Amount will not exceed the Defined Contribution Dollar Limitation multiplied by the following fraction: 
    
  Number of months in the short Limitation Year 
  12 

85 

Appendix 7.1 
  Diversification Requirements of Code   401(a)(35) 
    
  Effective for Plan Years beginning after December 31, 2007. 
    
  Diversification Requirements for Pre-Tax Contributions, After-Tax Contributions, Catch-Up Contributions, Roth Contributions and Rollover Contributions Invested in Employer Securities. 
    
  Section 1. The provisions of this Appendix apply only if the Plan holds any publicly traded employer security, except as described in Section 1.1.  For purposes of this Appendix a publicly traded security is a security which is traded on a national securities exchange that is registered under section 6 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1935 or which is traded on a foreign national securities exchange that is officially recognized, sanctioned, or supervised by a governmental authority and the security is deemed by the Securities and Exchange Commission as having a  ready market  under SEC Rule 15c3-1 (17 CFR 240.15c3). 
    
  Section 1.1. If the Employer, or any member of a controlled group of corporations which includes the Employer, has issued a class of stock which is a publicly traded employer security, and the Plan holds employer securities which are not publicly traded employer securities, then the Plan shall be treated as holding publicly traded employer securities. 
    
  Section 1.2. With respect to a Participant (including for purposes of this section an alternate payee who has an account or a deceased Participant s Beneficiary), if any portion of the Participant s account is invested in publicly traded employer securities, then the Participant must be offered the opportunity to elect to divest those employer securities and reinvest an equivalent amount in other investment options as described in Section 1.3. 
    
  Section 1.3. At least three investment options (other than employer securities) must be offered to Participants described in Section 1.2.  Each investment option must be diversified and have materially different risk and return characteristics. Periodic reasonable divestment and reinvestment opportunities must be provided at least quarterly. 
    
  Except as provided in Code Section 401(a)(35)(D)(ii)(I), restrictions (either direct or indirect) or conditions will not be imposed on the investment of publicly traded employer securities if such restrictions or conditions are not imposed on the investment of other plan assets.

  Section 2.  The provisions of this Appendix apply only if the Plan holds any publicly traded employer security, except as described in Section 2.1.  For purposes of this Appendix, a publicly traded security is a security which is traded on a national securities exchange that is registered under section 6 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1935 or which is traded on a foreign national securities exchange that is officially recognized, sanctioned, or supervised by a governmental authority and the security is deemed by the Securities and Exchange Commission as having a  ready market  under SEC Rule 15c3-1 (17 CFR 240.15c3). 
    
  Section 2.1. If the Employer, or any member of a controlled group of corporations (as described in Treasury Regulation   1.401(a)(35)-1(f)(2)(iv)(A)) which includes the Employer, has issued a class of stock which is a publicly traded employer security, and the Plan holds employer securities which are not publicly traded employer securities, then the Plan shall be treated as holding publicly traded employer securities. 
    
  Section 2.2. With respect to a Participant (including for purposes of this section an alternate payee who has an account or a deceased Participant s Beneficiary), if any portion of the Participant s account is invested in publicly traded employer securities, then the Participant must be offered the opportunity to elect to divest those employer securities and reinvest an equivalent amount in other investment options as described in Section 2.3. 
    
  Section 2.3. At least three investment options (other than employer securities) must be offered to Participants described in Section 2.2.  Each investment option must be diversified and have materially different risk and return characteristics.

Except as provided in Treasury Regulation sections 1.401(a)(35)-1(e)(2) and (3), restrictions (either direct or indirect) or conditions will not be imposed on the investment of publicly traded employer securities if such restrictions or conditions are not imposed on the investment of other plan assets.

  Section 1.    General Rules 
    
           1.1. 
    Effective Date  .  The provisions of this Appendix 9.4 will apply for purposes of determining required minimum distributions for calendar years beginning with the 2003 calendar year. 
       
           1.2. 
    Precedence  .  The requirements of this article will take precedence over any inconsistent provisions of the Plan.  However, the only benefit payment options available from the Plan are contained in Section 9.5 of the Plan.  This Appendix 9.4 does not provide any benefit payment option that is not provided in such Section. 
       
  1.3.      Requirements of Treasury Regulations Incorporated  .  All distributions required under this Appendix 9.4 will be determined and made in accordance with the Code   401(a)(9) Treasury Regulations. 
    
  Section 2.    Time and Manner of Distribution  . 
    
  2.1.      Required Beginning Date  .  The Participant's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed, to the Participant no later than the Participant's required beginning date. 
    
  2.2.      Death of Participant Before Distributions Begin  .  If the Participant dies before distributions begin, the Participant's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed, no later than as follows: 
    
  (a)    If the Participant's surviving Spouse is the Participant's sole designated Beneficiary, then distributions to the surviving Spouse will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the Participant died, or December 31 of the calendar year in which the Participant would have attained age 70 1/2 , if later. 
    
  (b)    If the Participant's surviving Spouse is not the Participant's sole designated Beneficiary, then distributions to the designated Beneficiary will be completed by  
  
   88 

December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the Participant s death. 
    
  (c)    If there is no designated Beneficiary as of September 30 of the year following the year of the Participant's death, the Participant's entire interest will be distributed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the Participant's death. 
    
  (d)    If the Participant's surviving Spouse is the Participant's sole designated Beneficiary and the surviving Spouse dies after the Participant but before distributions to the surviving Spouse begin, this section 2.2, other than section 2.2(a), will apply as if the surviving Spouse were the Participant. 
    
  For purposes of this section 2.2 and section 4, unless section 2.2(d) applies, distributions are considered to begin on the Participant's required beginning date. If section 2.2(d) applies, distributions are considered to begin on the date distributions are required to begin to the surviving Spouse under section 2.2(a).  If distributions under an annuity purchased from an insurance company irrevocably commence to the participant before the participant s required beginning date (or to the participant s surviving Spouse before the date distributions are required to begin to the surviving Spouse under section 2.2(a)), the date distributions are considered to begin is the date distributions actually commence. 
    
  2.3.      Forms of Distribution  .  Unless the Participant's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company or in a single sum on or before the required beginning date, as of the first distribution calendar year all benefit payments from the Plan will be made in accordance with sections 3 and 4 of this Appendix.  If the Participant's interest is distributed in a benefit payment option other than a single sum, such payments will be made in accordance with the requirements of Code   401(a)(9) and the Treasury Regulations thereunder. 
    
  Section 3.    Required Minimum Distributions During Participant's Lifetime  . 
    
  3.1.      Amount of Required Minimum Distribution For Each Distribution Calendar Year  .  During the Participant's lifetime, the minimum amount that will be distributed for each distribution calendar year is the lesser of: 

89 

(a)    the quotient obtained by dividing the Participant's Account balance by the distribution period in the Uniform Lifetime Table set forth in Treasury Regulation 1.401(a)(9)-9, using the Participant's age as of the Participant's birthday in the distribution calendar year; or 
    
  (b)    if the Participant's sole designated Beneficiary for the distribution calendar year is the Participant's Spouse, the quotient obtained by dividing the Participant's Account balance by the number in the Joint and Last Survivor Table set forth in Treasury Regulation 1.401(a)(9)-9, using the Participant's and Spouse's attained ages as of the Participant's and Spouse's birthdays in the distribution calendar year. 
    
  3.2.      Lifetime Required Minimum Distributions Continue Through Year of Participant's Death  . Required minimum distributions will be determined under this Section 3 beginning with the first distribution calendar year and up to and including the distribution calendar year that includes the Participant's date of death.

  4.1.      Death On or After Date Distributions Begin  . 
    
  (a)    Participant Survived by Designated Beneficiary. If the Participant dies on or after the date distributions begin and there is a designated Beneficiary, the minimum amount that will be distributed for each distribution calendar year after the year of the Participant's death is the quotient obtained by dividing the Participant's Account balance by the longer of the remaining life expectancy of the Participant or the remaining life expectancy of the Participant's designated Beneficiary, determined as follows: 
    
  (1)    The Participant's remaining life expectancy is calculated using the age of the Participant in the year of death, reduced by one for each subsequent year. 
    
  (2)    If the Participant's surviving Spouse is the Participant's sole designated Beneficiary, the remaining life expectancy of the surviving Spouse is calculated for each distribution calendar year after the year of the Participant's death using the surviving Spouse's age as of the Spouse's birthday in that year.  For distribution calendar years after the year of the surviving Spouse's death, the  
  
   90 

remaining life expectancy of the surviving Spouse is calculated using the age of the surviving Spouse as of the Spouse's birthday in the calendar year of the Spouse's death, reduced by one for each subsequent calendar year. 
    
  (3)    If the Participant's surviving Spouse is not the Participant's sole designated Beneficiary, the designated Beneficiary's remaining life expectancy is calculated using the age of the designated Beneficiary in the year following the year of the Participant's death, reduced by one for each subsequent year. 
    
  (b)    No Designated Beneficiary. If the Participant dies on or after the date distributions begin and there is no designated Beneficiary as of September 30 of the year after the year of the Participant's death, the minimum amount that will be distributed for each distribution calendar year after the year of the Participant's death is the quotient obtained by dividing the Participant's Account balance by the Participant's remaining life expectancy calculated using the age of the Participant in the year of death, reduced by one for each subsequent year. 
    
  4.2.      Death Before Date Distributions Begin  . 
    
  (a)    Participant Survived by Designated Beneficiary.  If the Participant dies before the date distributions begin and there is a designated Beneficiary, the minimum amount that will be distributed for each distribution calendar year after the year of the Participant's death is the quotient obtained by dividing the Participant's Account balance by the remaining life expectancy of the Participant's designated Beneficiary, determined as provided in section 4.1. 
    
  (b)    No Designated Beneficiary. If the Participant dies before the date distributions begin and there is no designated Beneficiary as of September 30 of the year following the year of the Participant's death, distribution of the Participant's entire interest will be completed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the Participant's death. 
    
  (c)    Death of Surviving Spouse Before Distributions to Surviving Spouse Are Required to Begin. If the Participant dies before the date distributions begin, the Participant's surviving Spouse is the Participant's sole designated Beneficiary, and the surviving Spouse dies before distributions are required to begin to the surviving

Spouse under section 2.2(a), this section 4.2 will apply as if the surviving Spouse were the Participant.

For taxable years commencing on or after January 1, 2013, shall be $15,000, regardless of the employee s annual compensation.  
    
  6.    Article III, Section 3.1(d)(2), of the Plan is amended to add the following paragraph at the end of the Section:

The maximum annual limit for Catch-Up Contributions shall be $1,500 per year.  Such Catch-Up Contributions shall be credited to the Participant s Pre-Tax Contribution Account of each Participant who has made such Catch-Up Contribution.  Any such Catch-Up Contribution shall be paid to the Trust within the time period required under ERISA and the regulations thereunder.  Any Catch-Up Contribution under this Subsection, and any deferral election relating to such contribution, shall be made in accordance with the rules and procedures adopted by the Committee.  
    
  7.    Article V of the Plan is amended to add a new section 5.7, which shall read as follows:

   104 

(c)    Puerto Rico Direct Rollover

  (2)    Direct rollovers under this Section 9.13 shall be made in accordance with rules and procedures established by the Committee. 
    
  (3)    For purposes of this Section 9.13, a distributee may include (1) a Participant, and, to the extent permitted by the Puerto Rico Internal Revenue Code of 2011, as amended, or by the Puerto Rico Treasury Department, (2) a Participant s Spouse, or (3) an alternate payee under a qualified domestic relations order who is the Spouse or former Spouse of a Participant.

However, if the Plan:  (i) uses a trust organized in Puerto Rico or a Puerto Rico co-trustee which will act as paying agent, and (ii) invest no less than 10% of its assets (determined on an average daily basis) in the Plan Year of the distribution and the two preceding Plan Years, in certain assets treated as located in Puerto Rico (as defined in the Puerto Rico Internal Revenue Code of 2011, as amended, and the regulations issued thereunder), the long term capital gain arising from the distribution will be taxed instead at a rate of 10%.  
    
  10.    Article X, Section 10.1(c), of the Plan is amended to add to it a new paragraph (10), which shall read as follows: 

105

  13.    These amendments shall govern the administration of the Plan, to the extent it is applicable to Participants employed in Puerto Rico ( Puerto Rico Participant ).  To the extent the Plan covers any Puerto Rico Participant, it will be administered pursuant to, and in compliance with, the requirements of Sections 1033.09 and 1081.01 of the Puerto Rico Internal Revenue Code of 2011, as amended.
