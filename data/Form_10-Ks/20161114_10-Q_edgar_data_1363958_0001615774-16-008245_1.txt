NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited) 

1.  Basis of Presentation, Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies     

Basis of Presentation   

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements have been prepared according to the instructions to Form 10-Q and Section 210.8-03(b) of Regulation S-X of the Securities
and Exchange Commission (SEC) and, therefore, certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) have
been omitted. 

In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting
of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the three
and nine month period ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year
ending December 31, 2016. 

For further information, refer to the Condensed Consolidated
Financial Statements and footnotes thereto included in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. The condensed consolidated
balance sheet at December 31, 2015, has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements at that date, but does
not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP. 

Nature of Business   

Western Capital Resources, Inc. ( WCR ) is
a parent company owning operating subsidiaries, with percentage owned shown parenthetically, as summarized below: 

Franchise   

o   AlphaGraphics, Inc. ( AGI ) (99.2%)   franchisor of 258 domestic and 25 international AlphaGraphics Business
Centers which specialize in the planning, production and management of visual communications for businesses and individuals throughout
the world.   

Cellular Retail   

o   PQH Wireless, Inc. and subsidiaries ( PQH ) (100%)   owns and operates 126 cellular retail stores as an exclusive
dealer of the Cricket brand.   

Direct to Consumer   

o   J   P Park Acquisitions, Inc. ( JPPA ) (100%   Acquired July 1, 2015)   an online and direct marketing
distribution retailer of live plants, seeds, holiday gifts and garden accessories selling its products under Park Seed, Jackson
  Perkins, and Wayside Gardens brand names as well as a wholesaler under the Park Wholesale brand.   

o   Restorers Acquisition, Inc. ( RAI ) (100%   Acquired July 1, 2015)   an online and direct marketing
distribution retailer of home improvement and restoration products operating under Van Dyke s Restorers.   

o   J   P Real Estate, LLC ( JPRE ) (100%   Acquired July 1, 2015)   owns real estate utilized as JPPA s
distribution and warehouse facility and the corporate offices of JPPA and RAI.   

Consumer Finance   

o   Wyoming Financial Lenders, Inc. ( WFL ) (100%)   owns and operates 45  payday  stores in eight
states (Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wisconsin and Wyoming) providing sub-prime short-term uncollateralized
non-recourse  cash advance  or  payday  loans typically ranging from $100 to $500 with a maturity of generally
two to four weeks, sub-prime short-term uncollateralized non-recourse installment loans typically ranging from $300 to $800 with
a maturity of six months, check cashing and other money services to individuals.   

o 
     Express
Pawn, Inc. ( EPI ) (100%)   owns and operates three retail pawn stores in Nebraska and Iowa providing collateralized
non-recourse pawn loans and retail sales of merchandise obtained from forfeited pawn loans or purchased from customers.  

References in these financial statement notes to  Company 
or  we  refer to Western Capital Resources, Inc. and its subsidiaries. References to specific companies within our
enterprise, such  AGI,   PQH,   JPPA,   RAI,   JPRE,   WFL 
or  EPI  are references only to those companies. 

7   

Basis of Consolidation   

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts
of WCR, its wholly owned subsidiaries and other entities in which the Company owns a controlling financial interest. For financial
interests in which the Company owns a controlling financial interest, the Company applies the provisions of ASC 810 applicable
to reporting the equity and net income or loss attributable to noncontrolling interests. All significant intercompany balances
and transactions of the Company have been eliminated in consolidation. 

Use of Estimates   

The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that may affect certain reported amounts and disclosures in the condensed consolidated financial statements and
accompanying notes. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed
to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant management estimates relate
to the notes and loans receivable allowance, carrying value and impairment of long-lived goodwill and intangible assets, inventory
valuation and obsolescence, estimated useful lives of property and equipment, gift certificate and customer credits liability and
deferred taxes and tax uncertainties. 

Reclassifications   

Certain Statements of Income reclassifications have been
made in the presentation of our prior financial statements and accompanying notes to conform to the presentation as of and for
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements   

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB )
issued a comprehensive new revenue recognition standard that will supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under
US GAAP. This standard, including subsequent updates, is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15,
2017. The Company is currently assessing the potential effects on our financial condition, results of operations and consolidated
financial statements. 

In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17,  Income
Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes  ( ASU 2015-17 ). The standard requires that
deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet rather than being separated into current and
noncurrent. ASU 2015-17 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2016.
Early adoption is permitted and the standard may be applied either retrospectively or on a prospective basis to all deferred tax
assets and liabilities. The Company early adopted ASU 2015-17 during our first quarter of fiscal year 2016 on a retrospective basis.
Accordingly, we reclassified the current deferred taxes to noncurrent on our December 31, 2015 Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet,
which decreased current deferred tax assets by $0.56 million and decreased noncurrent deferred tax liabilities by $0.56 million. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,  Leases
(Topic 842)  ( ASU 2016-02 ). The standard requires recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance
sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods
within those years, beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted and the standard is to be applied using a modified
retrospectively approach. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that ASU 2016-02 will have on our financial condition,
results of operations and consolidated financial statements. 

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,  Financial
Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments  ( ASU 2016-13 ).
The standard requires a financial asset (or a group of financial assets) measured at amortized cost basis to be presented at the
net amount expected to be collected. ASU 2016-13 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning
after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted earlier as of the fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including
interim periods within those fiscal years and the standard is to be applied using a modified retrospectively approach. The Company
is currently evaluating the impact that ASU 2016-13 will have on our financial condition, results of operations and consolidated
financial statements. 

No other accounting pronouncements issued or effective
during the fiscal quarter have had or are expected to have a material impact on our condensed consolidated financial statements. 

2.  Risks Inherent in the Operating Environment   

Regulatory   

The Company s Consumer Finance segment activities
are highly regulated under numerous local, state, and federal laws, regulations and rules, which are subject to change. New laws,
regulations or rules could be enacted or issued, interpretations of existing laws, regulations or rules may change and enforcement
action by regulatory agencies may intensify. Over the past several years, consumer advocacy groups and certain media reports have
advocated governmental and regulatory action to prohibit or severely restrict sub-prime lending activities of the kind conducted
by the Company. The federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has indicated that it will use its authority to further regulate
the payday industry and has been actively enforcing existing regulations within its jurisdiction. 

8   

Any adverse change in present local, state, and federal
laws or regulations that govern or otherwise affect lending could result in the Consumer Finance segment s curtailment or
cessation of operations in certain or all jurisdictions or locations. Furthermore, any failure to comply with any applicable local,
state or federal laws or regulations could result in fines, litigation, closure of one or more store locations or negative publicity.
Any such change or failure would have a corresponding impact on the Company s and segment s results of operations and
financial condition, and could also negatively affect the Company s general business prospects due to lost or decreased operating
income or if negative publicity effects its ability to obtain additional financing as needed. 

In addition, the passage of federal or state laws and regulations
or changes in interpretations of them could, at any point, essentially prohibit the Consumer Finance segment from conducting its
lending business in its current form. Any such legal or regulatory change would certainly have a material and adverse effect on
the Company, its operating results, financial condition and prospects, and perhaps even the viability of the Consumer Finance segment. 

3.  Loans Receivable   

At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Consumer
Finance segment s outstanding loans receivable aging was as follows: 

4.  Loans Receivable Allowance   

As a result of the Consumer Finance segment s collection
efforts, it historically writes off approximately 43% of returned payday items.  Based on days past the check return
date, write-offs of payday returned items historically have tracked at the following approximate percentages: 1 to 30 days  
43%; 31 to 60 days   65%; 61 to 90 days   83%; 91 to 120 days   89%; 121 to 150 days   91%; and 151 + days
  93%. 

9   

A rollforward of the Consumer Finance segment s loans
receivable allowance is as follows: 

5.  Accounts Receivable   

A breakdown of accounts receivables by segment as of September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are as follows: 

6.  Deferred Revenue and Other Liabilities   

Deferred revenue and other liabilities consist of the following: 

10   

7.  Notes Payable   Long Term 

Future minimum long-term principal payments are as follows: 

On April 22, 2016, WCR entered into a Credit Agreement with a financial institution. The Credit Agreement
provides the Company with an acquisition loan facility in an aggregate amount of up to $9,000,000, having a commitment maturity
date of April 21, 2018. Funds advanced under the acquisition loan facility bear interest at a floating per annum rate equal to
one-month LIBOR plus 3.50%, adjusted on a monthly basis, and mature five years from the date of advance. At closing, $3,500,000
was advanced under the acquisition loan replacing the $3,000,000 River City Equity debt and $500,000 of other term debt. At September
30, 2016 approximately $7,195,000 of credit was available under the acquisition and revolving credit facilities. 

See Note 13 for additional terms and conditions related
to the Credit Agreement. 

8.    Reincorporation    

On January 20, 2016, our shareholders approved a plan to
reincorporate Western Capital Resources, Inc. in Delaware at a special meeting of the shareholders called for that purpose. The
reincorporation was completed May 11, 2016. 

11   

9.    Cash Dividends    

10.    Other Operating Expense

A breakout of other expense is as follows: 

11.    Pro Forma Information

Effective June 1, 2015, PQH purchased with cash all outstanding
membership interests in four separate limited liability companies (Green Communications, LLC, an Arizona LLC, Green Communications,
LLC, an Oregon LLC, Green Communications, LLC, a Washington LLC and Go Green, LLC an Arizona LLC). Effective July 1, 2015,
the Company acquired a 100% interest in the businesses of RAI, JPPA, and JPRE, by completing a merger and contribution transaction. 

The results of the operations for the acquired business
have been included in the consolidated financial statements since the dates of the acquisition. The following table presents the
unaudited results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and the unaudited pro forma results of operations
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 (in thousands, except for per share data) as if the acquisitions had been
consummated at the beginning of 2015. The pro forma net income below excludes the expense of the transactions. The pro forma results
of operations are prepared for comparative purposes only and do not necessarily reflect the results that would have occurred had
the acquisition occurred at the beginning of the 2015 or the results which may occur in the future. 

12   

13   

13.  Commitments and Contingencies   

Employment Agreements   

The Company is party to an Amended and Restated Employment
Agreement with its Chief Executive Officer, Mr. John Quandahl. Among other things, this agreement contains provisions for an annual
performance-based cash bonus pool for management. The agreement was amended April 1, 2016 to extend the term through March 2019. 

Pursuant to the Company s numerous employment agreements,
bonuses of approximately $390,000 and $1,083,000 were accrued for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016, respectively. 

14   

Credit Facility   

On April 22, 2016, WCR entered into a Credit Agreement
with a financial institution. Certain company subsidiaries are guarantors of the borrowings and obligations under the Credit Agreement.
All borrowings under the Credit Agreement are secured by substantially all assets of WCR and the guarantor subsidiaries. 

The Credit Agreement requires WCR to meet certain financial
tests, including a leverage ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement. Subject to certain exceptions,
the Credit Agreement contains covenants limiting the company s ability to (or to permit the guarantor subsidiaries to) merge
or consolidate with, or engage in a sale of substantially all assets to, any party, but WCR or any guarantor subsidiary generally
may nonetheless merge with another party if (i) WCR or guarantor subsidiary is the entity surviving such merger, and (ii) immediately
after giving effect to such merger, no default shall have occurred and be continuing under the Credit Agreement. Subject to certain
exceptions, the Credit Agreement also contains covenants limiting WCR s ability to (or to permit the guarantor subsidiaries
to) create liens on assets, incur additional indebtedness, make certain types of investments, and pay dividends or make certain
other types of restricted payments, but WCR may nonetheless pay dividends to its shareholders if (a) there are no outstanding loans
or unpaid interest under the revolving credit facility, and (b) no default shall have occurred and be continuing under the Credit
Agreement. Some covenant waivers were granted by the financial institution during the three months ended September 30, 2016. 

Cellular Retail Growth Commitment   

Effective June 6, 2016, PQH entered into a Cricket Wireless
Exclusive Dealer Agreement Amendment for Retail Expansion. Per the agreement, PQH commits to open at least 150 locations by December
31, 2017, including 50 locations by December 31, 2016. Also effective June 6, 2016, Cricket Wireless, LLC has increased certain
compensation arrangements in the existing dealer agreement and will provide a subsidy for each location opened during the term
of the agreement. 

Wireless Retail Transaction  

PQH entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement for the
acquisition of 20 Cricket Wireless retail locations for $2,050,000 and an option to purchase an additional 33 locations for an
aggregate purchase price of $7,200,000. In addition, if PQH exercised its option, seller has an option to retain a 30% ownership
in the 53 store transaction, with a corresponding adjustment to the purchase price. It is anticipated that the transaction will
close in November 2016. 

Consumer Finance Segment Law Change  

On November 8, 2016, South Dakota voters approved a
measure effectively banning payday lending in South Dakota. Unless delayed, the effective date of the measure will be November
16, 2016. Revenue generated in South Dakota is approximately 5% of Consumer Finance segment year to date revenue through September
30, 2016. 

The Company evaluated all other events or transactions
that occurred after September 30, 2016 up through November 14, 2016, the date we issued these financial statements. During this
period we did not have any additional material subsequent events that impacted our financial statements. 

15   

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations   

Forward-Looking Statements  

Some of the statements made in this report are  forward-looking
statements,  as that term is defined under Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934. These forward-looking statements are based upon our current expectations and projections about future events. Whenever
used in this report, the words  believe,   anticipate,   intend,   estimate,   expect 
and similar expressions, or the negative of such words and expressions, are intended to identify forward-looking statements, although
not all forward-looking statements contain such words or expressions. The forward-looking statements in this report are primarily
located in the material set forth under the heading  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations  (Part I, Item 2), but may be found in other parts of this report as well. These forward-looking statements
generally relate to our plans, objectives and expectations for future operations and are based upon management s current
estimates and projections of future results or trends. Although we believe that our plans and objectives reflected in or suggested
by these forward-looking statements are reasonable, we may not achieve these plans or objectives. You should read this report completely
and with the understanding that actual future results may be materially different from what we expect. We will not necessarily
update forward-looking statements even though our situation may change in the future. 

Specific factors that might cause actual results to differ
from our expectations embodied in our forward-looking statements, or that might affect the value of the common stock, include but
are not limited to: 

the seasonal nature of the products sold in our Direct to Consumer segment - a significant portion of pre-tax net income contributed
by the segment is earned during the months of March through May and December, consequently the third quarter of each year typically
results in a net loss;   

the success of new stores related to our expansion plans in the Retail Wireless segment;   

changes in local, state or federal laws and regulations governing lending practices, or changes in the interpretation of such
laws and regulations;   

litigation and regulatory actions directed toward us or the industries in which we operate, particularly in certain key states
or nationally;   

our need for additional financing;   

unpredictability or uncertainty in financing markets which could impair our ability to grow our business through acquisitions;   

changes in Cricket dealer compensation;   

the impact on us, as a Cricket dealer, of the AT T acquisition of the Cricket Wireless business;   

failure of or disruption caused by a significant vendor;   

outside factors that affect our ability to obtain product and fulfill orders; and   

our ability to successfully operate or integrate recent or future business acquisitions.   

Other factors that could cause actual results to differ
from those implied by the forward-looking statements in this report are more fully described in the  Risk Factors 
section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. 

Industry data and other statistical information used in
this report are based on independent publications, government publications, reports by market research firms or other published
independent sources.  Some data are also based on our good faith estimates, derived from our review of internal surveys
and the independent sources listed above.  Although we believe these sources are reliable, we have not independently
verified the information.

Discussion of Critical Accounting
Policies  

Our condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying
notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applied on
a consistent basis.  The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make a number of estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.  We evaluate
these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis.  We base these estimates on the information currently available
to us and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances.  Actual results could
vary materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 

Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note
1,  Basis of Presentation, Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,  of the notes to our
condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report.  We believe that the following critical accounting
policies affect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial
statements. 

Loan Loss Allowance  

Included in loans receivable are unpaid principal, interest
and fee balances of payday, installment, pawn and title loans that have not reached their maturity date, and  late 
payday loans that have reached maturity within the last 180 days and have remaining outstanding balances.  Late payday
loans generally are unpaid loans where a customer s personal check has been deposited and the check has been returned due
to non-sufficient funds in the customer s account, a closed account, or other reasons. All returned items are charged-off
after 180 days, as collections after that date have not been significant. Loans are carried at cost plus accrued interest or fees
through maturity date, less payments made and a loans receivable allowance. 

The Company does not specifically reserve for any individual
payday, installment or title loan.  The Company aggregates loan types for purposes of estimating the loss allowance using
a methodology that analyzes historical portfolio statistics and management s judgment regarding recent trends noted in the
portfolio. This methodology takes into account several factors, including (1) the amount of loan principal, interest and fee outstanding,
(2) historical charge offs from loans that originated during the last 24 months, (3) current and expected collection patterns and
(4) current economic trends. The Company utilizes a software program to assist with the tracking of its historical portfolio statistics.
A loan loss allowance is maintained for anticipated losses for payday and installment loans based primarily on our historical percentages
by loan type of net charge offs, applied against the applicable balance of loan principal, interest and fees outstanding. The Company
also periodically performs a look-back analysis on its loan loss allowance to verify the historical allowance established tracks
with the actual subsequent loan write-offs and recoveries. The Company is aware that as conditions change, it may also need to
make additional allowances in future periods. Loan losses or charge-offs of pawn or title loans are not recorded because the value
of the collateral exceeds the loan amount. See Note 4 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report
for a rollforward of our loans receivable allowance. 

Valuation of Long-lived and Intangible
Assets  

We assess the possibility of impairment of long-lived and
intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Factors
that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future
cash flows, significant changes in the manner of use of acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business, and significant
negative industry events or trends. In addition, we conduct an annual goodwill impairment test as of October 1 each year. We assess
our goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level by applying a fair value test. This fair value test involves a two-step
process. The first step is to compare the carrying value of our net assets to our fair value. If the fair value is determined to
be less than the carrying value, a second step is performed to measure the amount of the impairment, if any. 

Results of Operations   Three Months Ended September
30, 2016 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2015  

Net income attributable to our common shareholders was
$0.78 million, or $0.08 per share (basic and diluted), for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, compared to $0.87 million, or
$0.09 per share (basic and diluted), for the quarter ended September 30, 2015. 

We expect segment operating results and earnings per share
to change throughout 2016 due, at least in part, to the seasonality of the Direct to Consumer and Cellular Retail segments, growth
in the Cellular Retail segment and potential mergers and acquisitions activity. 

Following is a discussion of operating results by segment. 

18   

The following table provides quarter-over-quarter revenues
and net income attributable to WCR common shareholders by operating segment (in thousands): 

19   

Franchise   

The table below summarizes the number of AlphaGraphics
business centers owned and operated by franchisees during the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

Our U.S. franchisees reported approximate center sales
for the quarters ended September 30 as follows: 

Revenues and net income for the quarters ended September 30, 2016
and 2015 were $4.28 million versus $3.68 million and $0.75 million versus $0.83 million, respectively. Contributing to the revenue
growth of 16.40% was a 9.01% increase in royalty and franchise development fee revenue and a 150.78% increase in services revenue
which includes revenue from new low margin services added in 2016. The revenue growth of 3.89% was offset with the increase direct
cost of services provided and a 13.61% increase in operating costs, resulting in the segment net income decrease to $0.75 million
from $0.83 million in the prior year comparable quarter. 

Cellular Retail   

A summary table of the number of Cricket cellular retail
stores we operated during the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 follows: 

The Cellular Retail division revenues and contribution
to net income each decreased period over period. A significant portion of revenue is from phone sales and there are two factors
that have influenced a decline in phone revenue period over period. Prior year comparable quarter volume was positively influenced
by customer migrations to Cricket Wireless  new GSM network, so a volume decrease was anticipated. Discounting of phones
is also a significant factor affecting revenue and discounts increased approximately $1.35 million period over period. These discounts
also reduce cost of phones and do not impact gross profit or net income. While phone sales revenue decreased period over period,
dealer compensation and customer fees increased 17.9%. Other factors contributing to the decline in net income are growth related
and include increased marketing and development costs, infrastructure costs and depreciation expense. 

Direct to Consumer   

The Direct to Consumer segment has seasonal sources of
revenue and historically experiences a greater proportion of annual revenue and net income in the months of March through May and
December due to the seasonal products it sells. For the current quarter, the Direct to Consumer segment had net loss of ($0.33)
million compared to a net loss of ($0.57) million for the comparable prior year period. Revenues for the three month period ended
September 30, 2016 were $5.94 million compared to pro forma revenues for the comparable period in 2015 of $5.44 million, an increase
in of 9.2% 

20   

Consumer Finance   

A summary table of the number of consumer finance locations
we operated during the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 follows: 

Our Consumer Finance segment revenues decreased 8.7% for
the quarter ended September 30, 2016 compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2015. We sold or closed 6 underperforming store
locations between the comparable periods and regional economic downturns in the Midwest, primarily Wyoming, North Dakota and South
Dakota, continue to contribute to revenue declines. Reductions in net bad debt and operating costs have helped to keep the net
income flat quarter over quarter. 

Corporate   

Costs related to our Corporate segment were $0.10 million
for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 compared to $0.21 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2015. 

Results of Operations   Nine Months Ended September
30, 2016 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015  

Net income attributable to our common shareholders was
$4.54 million, or $0.48 per share (basic and diluted), for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $2.14 million,
or $0.30 per share (basic and diluted), for the comparable period in 2015 and compared to pro forma net income for the prior comparable
period of $4.43 million or $0.47 per share (basic and diluted). As further discussed below, The Franchise, Direct to Consumer and
Consumer Finance operating segments each contributed to the increase in net income for the year over year period, while the Retail
Wireless segment decreased. 

As previously noted, we expect segment operating results
and earnings per share to change throughout 2016 due, at least in part, to the seasonality of the Direct to Consumer and Cellular
Retail segments, growth in the Cellular Retail segment and potential mergers and acquisitions activity. 

Following is a discussion of operating results by segment. 

21   

The following table provides period over period revenues
and net income attributable to WCR common shareholders by operating segment (in thousands): 

22   

Franchise   

The table below summarizes the number of AlphaGraphics
business centers owned and operated by franchisees during the nine month periods ended September, 2016 and 2015: 

Our U.S. franchisees reported approximate center sales
for the nine month periods ended September 30 as follows: 

Revenues for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 and
2015 were $11.45 million and $9.64 million, respectively. Contributing to the revenue growth of 18.78% was a 7.14% increase in
royalty and franchise development fee revenue and a 122.04% increase in services revenue, primarily attributable to revenue from
new low margin services added in 2016. The revenue growth, net of direct costs and together with a 6.18% increase in operating
costs period over period resulted in the segment net income increase to $1.83 million from $1.59 million for the prior year comparable
period. 

Cellular Retail   

A summary table of the number of Cricket cellular retail
stores we operated during the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 follows: 

Average store revenue and gross profit was down period
over period as expected since the prior period volume was positively influenced by customer migrations to Cricket Wireless 
new GSM network. Discounted phone prices (with a corresponding decrease in cost) have also contributed to the decrease in revenue.
However, dealer compensation and customer fee revenue, both with no direct cost of revenues associated with the revenue, each have
increased. Increased operating costs include one-time store consolidation costs in addition to cost incurred related to expansion
efforts. Management expects to realize the benefit of these non-recurring costs in the mid-term. 

Direct to Consumer   

On July 1, 2015, we added our newest segment, Direct to
Consumer. Revenues for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 were $30.70 million, up a marginal 1.3% from pro forma revenues
for the comparable period in 2015 of $30.30 million. For the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, the Direct to Consumer
segment had net income of $1.68 million and pro forma net income of $1.37 million in the comparable period of the prior year, a
22.6% increase. 

23   

Consumer Finance   

A summary table of the number of consumer finance locations
we operated during the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 follows: 

Our Consumer Finance segment revenues decreased 6.57% for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from the comparable nine month period ended September 30, 2015. Same store payday and
installment lending revenue decreased 3.76%. The impact of the regional economic downturns in the Midwest, primarily Wyoming, North
Dakota and South Dakota, have contributed significantly to the decrease in same store revenue period over period. Similarly to
the quarter over quarter results, reductions in net bad debt and operating costs have helped to keep the net results relatively
stable period over period. 

Corporate   

Costs related to our Corporate segment were $0.46 million for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $0.71 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The nine month period
in 2015 included approximately $0.32 million in transaction related costs. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

Summary cash flow data is as follows: 

At September 30, 2016, we had cash of $7.90 million
compared to cash of $3.55 million on September 30, 2015. Both comparable periods include cash flows utilized for growth in our
Cellular Retail segment. We believe that our available cash, combined with expected cash flows from operations and available financing,
will be sufficient to fund our scheduled debt repayments and the Cellular Retail segment anticipated capital expenditures through
September 30, 2017. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

We had no off-balance sheet arrangements as of September
30, 2016.

Item 4. Controls and Procedures   

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed
to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed pursuant to the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms,
and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. A control system, no matter how well conceived
and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance the objectives of the control system are met. 

We utilize the Committee of Sponsoring Organization s
 Internal Control   Integrated Framework, 2013 version,  for the design, implementation and assessment of the effectiveness
of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. 

As of September 30, 2016, our Chief Executive Officer and
Chief Financial Officer carried out an assessment of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as such term is
defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934.  Based
on this assessment, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded our disclosure controls and procedures are
effective as of September 30, 2016 . 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  

There were no changes in our internal control over financial
reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal control over financial reporting.
