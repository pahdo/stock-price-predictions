  NOTE 1 Basis of Presentation 
  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with instructions to the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X. Consequently, certain information and note disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States have been condensed or omitted. References to the  Company,   EMCOR,   we,   us,   our  and similar words refer to EMCOR Group, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries unless the context indicates otherwise. Readers of this report should refer to the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in our latest Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
  In our opinion, the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments (consisting only of a normal recurring nature) necessary to present fairly our financial position and the results of our operations. The results of operations for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending   December 31, 2016  . 
   
  NOTE 2 New Accounting Pronouncements 
  In March 2016, we adopted the accounting pronouncement issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) to update guidance on how companies account for certain aspects of share-based payments to employees. This pronouncement is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted. This guidance requires all income tax effects of awards to be recognized in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled and changes the presentation of excess tax benefits on the statement of cash flows. We adopted these provisions on a prospective basis. In addition, this pronouncement changes guidance on: (a) accounting for forfeitures of share-based awards and (b) employers  accounting for an employee s use of shares to satisfy the employer s statutory income tax withholding obligation.  As a result of the adoption, we recorded an adjustment to retained earnings of   $1.0 million   to recognize net operating loss carryforwards, net of a valuation allowance, attributable to excess tax benefits on stock compensation that had not been previously recognized to additional paid in capital. The adoption of this pronouncement did not have a material impact on our financial position and/or results of operations. 
  In February 2016, an accounting pronouncement was issued by the FASB to replace existing lease accounting guidance.  This pronouncement is intended to provide enhanced transparency and comparability by requiring lessees to record right-of-use assets and corresponding lease liabilities on the balance sheet for most leases.  Expenses associated with leases will continue to be recognized in a manner similar to current accounting guidance.  This pronouncement is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted.  The adoption is required to be applied on a modified retrospective basis for each prior reporting period presented. We have not yet determined the effect that the adoption of this pronouncement may have on our financial position and/or results of operations. 
  On January 1, 2016, we adopted the accounting pronouncement issued by the FASB which eliminates the requirement that an acquirer in a business combination account for measurement-period adjustments retrospectively.  Instead, an acquirer will recognize a measurement-period adjustment during the period in which it determines the amount of the adjustment.  The adoption of this pronouncement did not have a material impact on our financial position and/or results of operations. 
  On January 1, 2016, we adopted the accounting pronouncement issued by the FASB to update the guidance related to the presentation of debt issuance costs. This guidance requires debt issuance costs, related to a recognized debt liability, be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability rather than being presented as an asset.  We adopted this pronouncement on a retrospective basis, and the adoption did not have a material impact on our financial position and/or results of operations. 
  In November 2015, an accounting pronouncement was issued by the FASB to simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes within the balance sheet.  This pronouncement eliminates the requirement  that deferred tax assets and liabilities are presented as current or noncurrent based on the nature of  the underlying assets and liabilities.  Instead, the pronouncement requires all deferred tax assets and liabilities, including valuation allowances, be classified as noncurrent.  This pronouncement is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted.  We intend to adopt this pronouncement on January 1, 2017, and the adoption will not have a material impact on our financial position and/or results of operations.

  NOTE 2  New Accounting Pronouncements - (Continued) 

In May 2014, an accounting pronouncement was issued by the FASB to clarify existing guidance on revenue recognition. This guidance includes the required steps to achieve the core principle that a company should recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This pronouncement is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The guidance permits the use of one of two retrospective transition methods. We have not yet selected a transition method nor have we determined the effect that the adoption of the pronouncement may have on our financial position and/or results of operations. 
   
  NOTE 3 Acquisitions of Businesses       
  On   April 15, 2016  , we completed the acquisition of Ardent Services, L.L.C. and Rabalais Constructors, LLC (collectively,  Ardent ). This acquisition has been included in our United States electrical construction and facilities services segment.  Ardent provides electrical and instrumentation services to the energy infrastructure market in North America, and this acquisition further strengthens our position in electrical construction and services and broadens our capabilities across the industrial and energy sectors, especially in the Gulf Coast, Midwest and Western regions of the United States.  Under the terms of the transaction, we acquired   100%   of Ardent s equity interests for total consideration of   $201.4 million  . In connection with the acquisition of Ardent, we acquired working capital of   $36.5 million   and other net assets of   $3.9 million   and have preliminarily ascribed   $119.5 million   to goodwill and   $41.5 million   to identifiable intangible assets. Goodwill is calculated as the excess of the consideration transferred over the net assets acquired and represents the future economic benefits expected from this strategic acquisition. We expect that   $99.7 million   of the acquired goodwill will be deductible for tax purposes.  The weighted average amortization period for the identifiable intangible assets is approximately   13.5   years. 
  On   April 1, 2016  , we acquired a company for an immaterial amount.  This company provides mobile mechanical services within the Southeastern region of the United States, and its results have been included in our United States building services segment. 
  On   June 1, 2015   and   October 13, 2015  , we acquired two companies, each for an immaterial amount. These companies primarily provide mechanical construction services, and their results have been included in our United States mechanical construction and facilities services segment.  
  The purchase price allocations for the businesses acquired in 2016 are still preliminary and subject to change during their respective measurement periods. The acquisition of these businesses was accounted for by the acquisition method, and the prices paid for them have been allocated to their respective assets and liabilities, based upon the estimated fair value of their assets and liabilities at the dates of their respective acquisitions. 
   
  NOTE 4 Disposition of Assets     
  Due to a historical pattern of losses in the construction operations of our United Kingdom segment and our negative assessment of construction market conditions in the United Kingdom for the foreseeable future, we announced during the quarter ended June 30, 2013 our decision to withdraw from the construction market in the United Kingdom.  During the third quarter of 2014, we ceased construction operations in the United Kingdom. The results of the construction operations of our United Kingdom segment for all periods are presented in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as discontinued operations. 
    
  The results of discontinued operations are as follows (in thousands):

  NOTE 4 Disposition of Assets - (Continued) 

Included in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are the following major classes of assets and liabilities associated with the discontinued operation (in thousands): 

At September 30, 2016, the assets and liabilities of the discontinued operation consisted of accounts receivable, contract retentions and contract warranty obligations that are expected to be collected or fulfilled in the ordinary course of business. Additionally at September 30, 2016, there remained   $0.1 million   of obligations related to employee severance, which are expected to be paid in 2017. The settlement of the remaining assets and liabilities may result in additional income and/or expenses. Such income and/or expenses are expected to be immaterial and will be reflected as discontinued operations as incurred.

  Calculation of Basic and Diluted Earnings (Loss) per Common Share

Credit Facilities             
  Until August 3, 2016, we had a credit agreement (the  2013 Credit Agreement ), as amended, which provided for a revolving credit facility of    $750.0 million   (the  2013 Revolving Credit Facility ) and a term loan of   $350.0 million   (the  2013 Term Loan ).  The 2013 Credit Agreement was effective November 25, 2013. Effective August 3, 2016, we amended and restated the 2013 Credit Agreement to provide for a   $900.0 million   revolving credit facility (the  2016 Revolving Credit Facility ) and a   $400.0 million   term loan (the  2016 Term Loan ) (collectively referred to as the  2016 Credit Agreement ) expiring   August 3, 2021  . The proceeds of the 2016 Term Loan were used to repay amounts drawn under the 2013 Term Loan, as well as a portion of the outstanding balance under the 2013 Revolving Credit Facility.  We may increase the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility to   $1.3 billion   if additional lenders are identified and/or existing lenders are willing to increase their current commitments. We may allocate up to   $300.0 million   of available capacity under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility to letters of credit for our account or for the account of any of our subsidiaries. Obligations under the 2016 Credit Agreement are guaranteed by most of our direct and indirect subsidiaries and are secured by substantially all of our assets and most of the assets of most of our subsidiaries. The 2016 Credit Agreement contains various covenants providing for, among other things, maintenance of certain financial ratios and certain limitations on payment of dividends, common stock repurchases, investments, acquisitions, indebtedness and capital expenditures. We were in compliance with all such covenants as of   September 30, 2016   with respect to the 2016 Credit Agreement and   December 31, 2015   with respect to the 2013 Credit Agreement. A commitment fee is payable on the average daily unused amount of the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility, which ranges from   0.15%   to   0.30%  , based on certain financial tests. The fee was   0.20%   of the unused amount as of   September 30, 2016  . Borrowings under the 2016 Credit Agreement bear interest at (1) a base rate plus a margin of   0.00%   to   0.75%  , based on certain financial tests, or (2) United States dollar LIBOR (  0.52%   at   September 30, 2016  ) plus   1.00%   to   1.75%  , based on certain financial tests. The base rate is determined by the greater of (a) the prime commercial lending rate announced by Bank of Montreal from time to time (  3.50%   at   September 30, 2016  ), (b) the federal funds effective rate, plus     of 1.00%  , (c) the daily one month LIBOR rate, plus   1.00%  , or (d)   0.00%  . The interest rate in effect at   September 30, 2016   was   1.77%  . Fees for letters of credit issued under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility range from   1.00%   to   1.75%   of the respective face amounts of outstanding letters of credit and are computed based on certain financial tests. We capitalized an additional   $3.0 million   of debt issuance costs associated with the 2016 Credit Agreement. Debt issuance costs are amortized over the life of the agreement and are included as part of interest expense. In connection with the amendment and restatement of the 2013 Credit Agreement,   $0.1 million   attributable to the acceleration of expense for debt issuance costs in connection with the 2013 Credit Agreement was recorded as part of interest expense during the third quarter of 2016. We are required to make principal payments on the 2016 Term Loan in installments on the last day of March, June, September and December of each year, commencing with the calendar quarter ending December 31, 2016, in the amount of   $5.0 million  , with a payment of all unpaid principal and interest due on August 3, 2021.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the balance of the 2016 Term Loan and the 2013 Term Loan was   $400.0 million   and   $315.0 million  , respectively. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had approximately   $115.4 million   and   $99.0 million   of letters of credit outstanding, respectively. There were   $125.0 million   in borrowings outstanding under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility as of   September 30, 2016  .  There were   no   borrowings outstanding under the 2013 Revolving Credit Facility as of   December 31, 2015  . 

NOTE 8 Fair Value Measurements         
  We use a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy, which gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets, is comprised of the following three levels: 
  Level 1   Unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. 
  Level 2   Observable inputs, other than Level 1 inputs. Level 2 inputs would typically include quoted prices in markets that are not active or financial instruments for which all significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly. 
  Level 3   Prices or valuations that require inputs that are both significant to the measurement and unobservable.

  NOTE 8 Fair Value Measurements - (Continued) 

The following tables provide the assets and liabilities carried at fair value measured on a recurring basis as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   (in thousands):     

________ 
            (2) 
    Restricted cash is classified as  Prepaid expenses and other  in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
              (3) 
    Deferred compensation plan assets are classified as  Other assets  in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
     We believe that the carrying values of our financial instruments, which include accounts receivable and other financing commitments, approximate their fair values due primarily to their short-term maturities and low risk of counterparty default. The carrying value of our debt associated with the 2016 Credit Agreement approximates its fair value due to the variable rate on such debt.    
   
  NOTE 9 Income Taxes     
  For the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , our income tax provision from continuing operations was   $30.8 million   and   $25.7 million  , respectively, based on effective income tax rates, before discrete items and less amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests, of   38.1%   and   38.0%  , respectively. The actual income tax rates on income from continuing operations, less amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests, for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , inclusive of discrete items, were   37.2%   and   38.1%  , respectively. For the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , our income tax provision from continuing operations was   $82.7 million   and   $74.7 million  , respectively, based on effective income tax rates, before discrete items and less amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests, of   37.8%   and   37.9%  , respectively. The actual income tax rates on income from continuing operations, less amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests, for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , inclusive of discrete items, were   36.7%   and   38.0%  , respectively. The increase in the 2016 income tax provision was primarily due to increased income from continuing operations. The decrease in the actual income tax rate on income from continuing operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily due to the reversal of   $0.8 million   of reserves for uncertain income tax positions. The decrease in the actual income tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily due to   $2.1 million   of tax benefits recognized upon the issuance of common stock under share-based compensation plans. 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the amount of unrecognized income tax benefits was   $3.9 million   and   $4.8 million   (of which   $2.2 million   and   $3.0 million  , if recognized, would favorably affect our effective income tax rate), respectively.                                                                
  We report interest expense related to unrecognized income tax benefits in the income tax provision.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had approximately   $0.4 million   of accrued interest related to unrecognized income tax benefits included as a liability in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.  For each of the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , less than   $0.1 million   of interest income was recognized. For each of the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2015  , less than   $0.1 million   of interest expense was recognized.

  NOTE 9 Income Taxes - (Continued) 

It is reasonably possible that approximately   $3.3 million   of unrecognized income tax benefits at   September 30, 2016  , primarily relating to uncertain tax positions attributable to tax return filing positions, will significantly decrease in the next twelve months as a result of estimated settlements with taxing authorities and the expiration of applicable statutes of limitations. 
  We file income tax returns with the Internal Revenue Service and various state, local and foreign tax agencies. The Company is currently under examination by various taxing authorities for the years 2008 through 2014.

NOTE 12 Commitments and Contingencies 
  Government Contracts 
  As a government contractor, we are subject to U.S. government audits and investigations relating to our operations, including claims for fines, penalties and compensatory and treble damages, and possible suspension or debarment from doing business with the government.  Based on currently available information, we believe the outcome of ongoing government disputes and investigations will not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity. 
  Legal Matters        
  One of our subsidiaries was a subcontractor to a mechanical contractor ( Mechanical Contractor ) on a construction project where an explosion occurred in 2010. An investigation of the matter could not determine who was responsible for the explosion. As a result of the explosion, lawsuits have been commenced against various parties, but, to date, no lawsuits have been commenced against our subsidiary with respect to personal injury or damage to property as a consequence of the explosion. However, the Mechanical Contractor has asserted claims, in the context of an arbitration proceeding against our subsidiary, alleging that our subsidiary is responsible for a portion of the damages for which the Mechanical Contractor may be liable as a result of: (a) personal injury suffered by individuals as a result of the explosion and (b) the Mechanical Contractor s legal fees and associated management costs in defending against any and all such claims. In the most recent filing with the arbitrator, the Mechanical Contractor has stated claims against our subsidiary for alleged violations of the Connecticut and Massachusetts Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices Acts in the ongoing arbitration proceeding. Further, the general contractor (as assignee of the Mechanical Contractor) on the construction project, and for whom the Mechanical Contractor worked, has alleged that our subsidiary is responsible for losses asserted by the owner of the project and/or the general contractor because of delays in completion of the project and for damages to the owner s property. We believe, and have been advised by counsel, that we have a number of meritorious defenses to all such matters. We believe that the ultimate outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity. Notwithstanding our assessment of the final impact of this matter, we are not able to estimate with any certainty the amount of loss, if any, which would be associated with an adverse resolution. 
  We are involved in several other proceedings in which damages and claims have been asserted against us. Other potential claims may exist that have not yet been asserted against us. We believe that we have a number of valid defenses to such proceedings and claims and intend to vigorously defend ourselves. We do not believe that any such matters will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity.  Litigation is subject to many uncertainties and the outcome of litigation is not predictable with assurance. It is possible that some litigation matters for which reserves have not been established could be decided unfavorably to us, and that any such unfavorable decisions could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity. 
  Restructuring expenses         
  Restructuring expenses, primarily relating to employee severance obligations, were   $0.5 million   and   $1.3 million   for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and   $0.3 million   and   $0.7 million   for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. As of   September 30, 2016  , the balance of these restructuring obligations yet to be paid was   $0.5 million  , the majority of which is expected to be paid during 2016. No material expenses in connection with restructuring from continuing operations are expected to be incurred during the remainder of 2016. 
  The changes in restructuring activity by reportable segments during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were as follows (in thousands):

ITEM 2. 
    MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. 

We are one of the largest electrical and mechanical construction and facilities services firms in the United States. In addition, we provide a number of building services and industrial services. Our services are provided to a broad range of commercial, industrial, utility and institutional customers through approximately 75 operating subsidiaries and joint venture entities. Our offices are located in the United States and the United Kingdom. 
  During the third quarter of 2014, we ceased construction operations in the United Kingdom. The results of the construction operations of our United Kingdom segment for all periods are presented in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as discontinued operations.  
  Impact of Acquisitions 
  In order to provide a more meaningful period-over-period discussion of our operating results, we may discuss amounts generated or incurred (revenues, gross profit, selling, general and administrative expenses and operating income) from companies acquired. The amounts discussed reflect the acquired companies  operating results in the current reported period only for the time period these entities were not owned by EMCOR in the comparable prior reported period. 
   
  Overview 
  The following table presents selected financial data for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   (in thousands, except percentages and per share data):    

The results of our operations for the 2016 third quarter set new company records in terms of revenues, operating income, net income attributable to EMCOR Group, Inc. and diluted earnings per common share from continuing operations for a third quarter. Revenues increased within all of our reportable segments, except for our United Kingdom building services segment and our United States industrial services segment. The increase in revenues was attributable to: (a) our domestic construction segments, due to increased activity within the majority of the market sectors in which we operate, and (b) our United States building services segment, primarily due to higher volume within its mobile mechanical services operations.  In addition, companies acquired in 2016 and 2015, which are reported in our United States electrical construction and facilities services segment, our United States mechanical construction and facilities services segment, and our United States building services segment, generated incremental revenues of $90.8 million.  The decrease in revenues from our United Kingdom building services segment was due to the effect of unfavorable exchange rates for the British pound versus the United States dollar and a decrease in project activity within the commercial market sector.  
  Operating income increased within all of our reportable segments, except for our United Kingdom building services segment.  Our operating income was favorably impacted by: (a) our United States mechanical construction and facilities services segment, primarily attributable to an  increase in gross profit from commercial and manufacturing construction projects, and (b) our United States building services segment, predominately as a result of increased gross profit within our mobile mechanical services operations. In addition, companies acquired in 2016 and 2015 generated operating income of $9.1 million, net of $1.4 million of amortization expense associated with identifiable intangible assets. Corporate administration operating loss increased as a result of: (a) an increase in employment costs, such as incentive compensation, primarily due to higher projected annual operating results than in the same prior year period, and (b) an increase in certain non-income related taxes, (c) an increase in software licensing costs and (d) an increase in legal costs.

     Table of Contents  

Our operating margin (operating income as a percentage of revenues) for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was 4.5% compared to operating margin of 4.1% for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Operating margin increases within our United States building services segment, our United States mechanical construction and facilities services segment and our United States industrial services segment were offset by a decrease in operating margin within our United States electrical construction and facilities services segment. 
  Operating Segments 
  We have the following reportable segments which provide services associated with the design, integration, installation, start-up, operation and maintenance of various systems: (a) United States electrical construction and facilities services (involving systems for electrical power transmission and distribution; premises electrical and lighting systems; low-voltage systems, such as fire alarm, security and process control; voice and data communication; roadway and transit lighting; and fiber optic lines); (b) United States mechanical construction and facilities services (involving systems for heating, ventilation, air conditioning, refrigeration and clean-room process ventilation; fire protection; plumbing, process and high-purity piping; controls and filtration; water and wastewater treatment; central plant heating and cooling; cranes and rigging; millwrighting; and steel fabrication, erection and welding); (c) United States building services; (d) United States industrial services; and (e) United Kingdom building services. The  United States building services  and  United Kingdom building services  segments principally consist of those operations which provide a portfolio of services needed to support the operation and maintenance of our customers  facilities, including commercial and government site-based operations and maintenance; facility maintenance and services, including reception, security and catering services; outage services to utilities and industrial plants; military base operations support services; mobile maintenance and services; floor care and janitorial services; landscaping, lot sweeping and snow removal; facilities management; vendor management; call center services; installation and support for building systems; program development, management and maintenance for energy systems; technical consulting and diagnostic services; infrastructure and building projects for federal, state and local governmental agencies and bodies; and small modification and retrofit projects, which services are not generally related to customers  construction programs. The segment  United States industrial services  principally consists of those operations which provide industrial maintenance and services, mainly for refineries and petrochemical plants, including on-site repairs, maintenance and service of heat exchangers, towers, vessels and piping; design, manufacturing, repair and hydro blast cleaning of shell and tube heat exchangers and related equipment; refinery turnaround planning and engineering services; specialty welding services; overhaul and maintenance of critical process units in refineries and petrochemical plants; and specialty technical services for refineries and petrochemical plants. 
   
  Results of Operations 
  Revenues 
  The following tables present our operating segment revenues from unrelated entities and their respective percentages of total revenues (in thousands, except for percentages):

     Table of Contents  

As described below in more detail, our revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased to $1.92 billion compared to $1.70 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2015, and our revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased to $5.60 billion compared to $4.94 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in revenues for both periods was primarily attributable to: (a) increased revenues from both of our domestic construction segments, (b) increased demand for our industrial field services within our United States industrial services segment and (c) increased revenues from our mobile mechanical services operations within our United States building services segment. In addition, companies acquired in 2016 and 2015, which are reported in our United States electrical construction and facilities services segment, our United States mechanical construction and facilities services segment and our United States building services segment, generated incremental revenues of $90.8 million and $179.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. 
  Revenues of our United States electrical construction and facilities services segment were $458.6 million and $1,227.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to revenues of $344.4 million and $1,009.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. Excluding the acquisition of Ardent Services, L.L.C. and Rabalais Constructors, LLC (collectively,  Ardent ), the increase in revenues for both periods was primarily attributable to an increase in revenues from commercial and transportation construction projects, partially offset by a decrease in revenues from healthcare construction projects.  Additionally, the increase in revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was partially attributable to an increase in revenues from hospitality construction contracts. The results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 included $58.6 million and $104.0 million, respectively, of revenues generated by Ardent. 
  Our United States mechanical construction and facilities services segment revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were $697.7 million, a $110.2 million increase compared to revenues of $587.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Revenues of this segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $1,939.5 million, a $287.0 million increase compared to revenues of $1,652.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in revenues for both periods was primarily attributable to an increase in activity within the majority of the market sectors in which we operate. The results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 included $14.9 million and $43.3 million, respectively, of revenues generated by companies acquired in 2015.  
  Revenues of our United States building services segment for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased by $26.5 million compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015, and revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased by $49.9 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The increase in revenues for both periods was primarily attributable to increased revenues from: (a) our mobile mechanical services operations as a result of greater project, service and controls activities and (b) our energy services operations, as a result of an increase in large project activity.  The results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 included $17.3 million and $32.4 million, respectively, of revenues generated by a company acquired in 2016. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in revenues from our government site-based services operations as a result of the loss of certain contracts not renewed pursuant to rebid and certain scope reductions within their current contract portfolio. 
  Revenues of our United States industrial services segment for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased by $2.9 million compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015, and revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased by $130.2 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was attributable to a decrease in revenues from our shop services operations due to lower demand for new heat exchangers as a result of a curtailment in capital spending by most large integrated oil companies, partially offset by increased demand for our field services offerings. The increase in revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was due to increased demand for specialty services offerings within our field services operations, including large project activity, partially offset by a decrease in revenues from our shop services operations. In addition, revenues for the nine months

     Table of Contents  

ended September 30, 2015 were negatively impacted by a nationwide strike by union employees of certain major oil refineries which led to the loss and deferral of certain turnaround projects.  
  Our United Kingdom building services segment revenues were $73.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to revenues of $97.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, and revenues were $251.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to revenues of $275.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This segment s revenues decreased by $13.2 million and $24.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, related to the effect of unfavorable exchange rates for the British pound versus the United States dollar resulting, in part, from the decision by the United Kingdom to exit the European Union. Additionally, the decrease in revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was partially attributable to a decrease in project activity within the commercial market sector. 
  Backlog             
  The following table presents our operating segment backlog from unrelated entities and their respective percentages of total backlog (in thousands, except for percentages): 

Our backlog at September 30, 2016 was $3.90 billion compared to $3.77 billion at December 31, 2015 and $3.77 billion at September 30, 2015. The increase in backlog at September 30, 2016 compared to backlog at December 31, 2015 was primarily attributable to an increase in backlog from all of our reportable segments, except for our United States building services segment and our United States industrial services segment. Backlog increases with awards of new contracts and decreases as we perform work on existing contracts. Backlog is not a term recognized under United States generally accepted accounting principles; however, it is a common measurement used in our industry. We include a project within our backlog at such time as a contract is awarded and agreement on contract terms has been reached. Backlog includes unrecognized revenues to be realized from uncompleted construction contracts plus unrecognized revenues expected to be realized over the remaining term of services contracts. However, we do not include in backlog contracts for which we are paid on a time and material basis and a fixed amount cannot be determined, and if the remaining term of a services contract exceeds 12 months, the unrecognized revenues attributable to such contract included in backlog are limited to only the next 12 months of revenues provided for in the contract award. Our backlog also includes amounts related to services contracts for which a fixed price contract value is not assigned when a reasonable estimate of total revenues can be made from budgeted amounts agreed to with our customer. Our backlog is comprised of: (a) original contract amounts, (b) change orders for which we have received written confirmations from our customers, (c) pending change orders for which we expect to receive confirmations in the ordinary course of business and (d) claim amounts that we have made against customers for which we have determined we have a legal basis under existing contractual arrangements and as to which we consider recovery to be probable. Such claim amounts were immaterial for all periods presented. Our backlog does not include anticipated revenues from unconsolidated joint ventures or variable interest entities and anticipated revenues from pass-through costs on contracts for which we are acting in the capacity of an agent and which are reported on the net basis. We believe our backlog is firm, although many contracts are subject to cancellation at the election of our customers. Historically, cancellations have not had a material adverse effect on us.

Cost of sales and Gross profit 
  The following table presents our cost of sales, gross profit (revenues less cost of sales) and gross profit margin (gross profit as a percentage of revenues) (in thousands, except for percentages):    

Our gross profit increased by $32.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. Gross profit increased by $74.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was attributable to increases in gross profit within all of our reportable segments, except for our United Kingdom building services segment and our United States industrial services segment. The increase in gross profit for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was attributable to increases in gross profit within all of our reportable segments, except for our United Kingdom building services segment. Our gross profit margin was 13.9% and 13.9% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Gross profit margin was 13.7% and 14.0% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  Gross profit margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was negatively impacted by $6.9 million and $17.4 million of losses incurred on a transportation construction project in the Northeastern United States within our United States electrical construction and facilities services segment, resulting in a 0.3% negative impact on the Company s gross profit margin for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. 
  Selling, general and administrative expenses 
  The following table presents our selling, general and administrative expenses and SG A margin (selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues) (in thousands, except for percentages):    

Our selling, general and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased by $16.3 million to $181.4 million compared to $165.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  Selling, general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased by $42.5 million to $530.7 million compared to $488.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were 9.4% and 9.5% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to 9.7% and 9.9% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was due to higher employee related costs such as incentive compensation and salaries, as well as certain non-income related taxes.  Increased incentive compensation was principally due to higher projected annual operating results than in the same prior year period, which resulted in increased accruals for certain of our incentive compensation plans. The increase in salaries was attributable to an increase in headcount due to higher revenues than in the same prior year period, as well as cost of living adjustments and merit pay increases. Additionally, the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 included $3.8 million of transaction costs associated with the acquisition of Ardent in April 2016, as well as increases in information technology costs and bad debt expense.  The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 included $11.0 million and $20.9 million, respectively, of expenses directly related to companies acquired in 2016 and 2015, including amortization expense attributable to identifiable intangible assets of $1.2 million and $2.5 million, respectively. The decrease in SG A margin for both periods was partially attributable to an increase in revenues without commensurate increases in our overhead cost structure. 
  Restructuring expenses     
  Restructuring expenses, primarily relating to employee severance obligations, were $0.5 million and $1.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and $0.3 million and $0.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. As of September 30, 2016, the balance of these restructuring obligations yet to be paid was $0.5 million, the majority of which is expected to be paid during 2016. No material expenses in connection with restructuring from continuing operations are expected to be incurred during the remainder of 2016.

Operating income 
  The following tables present our operating income (loss) and operating income (loss) as a percentage of segment revenues from unrelated entities (in thousands, except for percentages):    

As described below in more detail, operating income was $86.1 million and $234.0 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to $70.0 million and $203.0 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. Operating margin was 4.5% and 4.2% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to 4.1% for each of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. 
  Operating income of our United States electrical construction and facilities services segment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $30.9 million and $70.6 million, respectively, compared to operating income of $25.5 million and $67.5 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. The increase in operating income for both periods was primarily attributable to the acquisition of Ardent, which contributed operating income of $5.7 million and $7.2 million, net of $0.7 million and $1.4 million of amortization expense associated with identifiable intangible assets, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. Additionally, the increase in operating income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was partially attributable to an increase in gross profit from commercial and manufacturing construction

contracts.  Operating income was negatively impacted by $6.9 million and $17.4 million of losses incurred on a transportation construction project in the Northeastern United States as a result of productivity issues attributable to unfavorable job-site conditions for which we will seek recovery, resulting in a 1.4% and 1.3% negative impact on the segment s operating margin for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively.  This project is expected to be completed by the end of 2016.  
  Our United States mechanical construction and facilities services segment operating income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $39.4 million, a $12.5 million increase compared to operating income of $26.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $101.5 million, a $21.3 million increase compared to operating income of $80.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in operating income for both periods was attributable to an increase in gross profit from commercial, manufacturing,  healthcare and water and wastewater construction projects. Additionally, the results for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 included the receipt of $2.0 million from the former owner of a company we had previously acquired as a result of a settlement of a claim by us under the acquisition agreement. Companies acquired in 2015 generated operating income of $1.7 million and $3.0 million, net of $0.2 million and $0.6 million of amortization expense associated with identifiable intangible assets, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. The increase in operating margin for the both periods was partially attributable to a decrease in the ratio of selling, general and administrative expenses to revenues.  
  Operating income of our United States building services segment for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased by $6.5 million compared to operating income for the three months ended September 30, 2015, and its operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased by $0.2 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in operating income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was attributable to an increase in gross profit from project, service and controls activities within our mobile mechanical services operations. Additionally, a company acquired during the second quarter of 2016, reported within our mobile mechanical services operations, generated operating income of $1.7 million and $2.6 million, net of $0.5 million and $0.9 million of amortization expense associated with identifiable intangible assets, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016.  The decrease in operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was attributable to: (a) lower operating income within our commercial site-based services operations, partially as a result of a reduction in snow removal activities due to less snowfall in areas where our contracts are based on a per snow event basis, (b) a decrease in operating income within our government site-based services operations and (c) a decrease in operating income within our energy services operations, as a result of a loss incurred on a large project. In addition, operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 included the impact of $2.7 million of gross profit recognized upon the favorable settlement of a claim by us against the former owner of a company we previously acquired. The increase in operating margin for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was attributable to an increase in gross profit margin. 
  Operating income of our United States industrial services segment for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased by $0.2 million compared to operating income for the three months ended September 30, 2015, and its operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased by $22.0 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in operating income for both periods was attributable to an increase in gross profit from specialty services offerings within our field services operations, including large project activity.  In addition, this segment s results for the first nine months of 2015 were negatively impacted by a nationwide strike by union employees of certain major oil refineries, which led to the loss and deferral of certain turnaround projects. The increase in operating income for both periods was partially offset by a decrease in gross profit from our shop services operations due to lower demand for new heat exchangers as a result of a curtailment in capital spending by most large integrated oil companies.  The increase in operating margin for both periods was attributable to a decrease in the ratio of selling, general and administrative expenses to revenues.  
  Our United Kingdom building services segment operating income was $2.6 million and $9.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to operating income of $3.4 million and $8.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. The decrease in operating income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was primary attributable to a decrease of $0.5 million relating to the effect of unfavorable exchange rates for the British pound versus the United States dollar and a decrease in project activity within the commercial market sector. The increase in operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily attributable to an increase in gross profit from project activity within the commercial market, partially as a result of several contract awards won in 2015, offset in part by a decrease of $0.9 million relating to the effect of unfavorable exchange rates for the British pound versus the United States dollar. The increase in operating margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was attributable to an increase in gross profit margin. 
  Our corporate administration operating loss for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $23.5 million compared to $15.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Our corporate administration operating loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $67.4 million compared to $52.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in expenses for both periods was primarily due to: (a) an increase in employment costs, such as incentive compensation, primarily due to higher projected annual operating results than in the same prior year period, (b) an increase in certain non-income  
  
   23 

     Table of Contents  

related taxes, (c) an increase in software licensing costs and (d) an increase in legal costs.  Additionally, operating loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased as a result of $3.8 million of transaction costs associated with the acquisition of Ardent in April 2016. 
  Interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $3.5 million and $2.2 million, respectively. Interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $9.0 million and $6.7 million, respectively.     The increase in interest expense for both periods was primarily due to increased outstanding borrowings in 2016 compared to 2015. Interest income for each of the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $0.2 million. Interest income for each of the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $0.5 million. 
  For the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , our income tax provision from continuing operations was   $30.8 million   and   $25.7 million  , respectively, based on effective income tax rates, before discrete items and less amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests, of   38.1%   and   38.0%  , respectively. The actual income tax rates on income from continuing operations, less amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests, for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , inclusive of discrete items, were   37.2%   and   38.1%  , respectively. For the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , our income tax provision from continuing operations was   $82.7 million   and   $74.7 million  , respectively, based on effective income tax rates, before discrete items and less amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests, of   37.8%   and   37.9%  , respectively. The actual income tax rates on income from continuing operations, less amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests, for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , inclusive of discrete items, were   36.7%   and   38.0%  , respectively. The increase in the 2016 income tax provision was primarily due to increased income from continuing operations. The decrease in the actual income tax rate on income from continuing operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily due to the reversal of $0.8 million of reserves for uncertain income tax positions. The decrease in the actual income tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily due to $2.1 million of tax benefits recognized upon the issuance of common stock under share-based compensation plans. 
  Discontinued operations 
  Due to a historical pattern of losses in the construction operations of our United Kingdom segment and our negative assessment of construction market conditions in the United Kingdom for the foreseeable future, we announced during the quarter ended June 30, 2013 our decision to withdraw from the construction market in the United Kingdom. During the third quarter of 2014, we ceased construction operations in the United Kingdom. The results of the construction operations of our United Kingdom segment for all periods are presented in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements as discontinued operations. 
   
  Liquidity and Capital Resources         
  The following table presents our net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, investing activities and financing activities (in thousands):        

Our consolidated cash balance increased by approximately $17.7 million from $486.8 million at December 31, 2015 to $504.6 million at September 30, 2016. Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $128.9 million compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $95.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to a $19.8 million increase in net income, a $19.6 million increase in net over-billings related to the timing of customer billings and payments and an $8.9 million decrease in our accounts receivable balances, partially offset by a $25.9 million increase in income taxes paid. Net cash used in investing activities was $260.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to net cash used in investing activities of $22.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in net cash used in investing activities was primarily due to the increase in payments for acquisitions of businesses and property, plant and equipment. Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased by approximately $213.1 million compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in net cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to borrowings of $220.0 million under our revolving credit facility and a decrease in distributions to noncontrolling interests, partially offset by an increase in funds used for the repurchase of common stock. Cash flows from discontinued operations were immaterial and are not expected to significantly affect future liquidity.

These purchase orders are not reflected in EMCOR s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and should not impact future cash flows, as amounts should be recovered through customer billings.

    Represents primarily insurance related liabilities and liabilities for deferred income taxes, incentive compensation and deferred compensation, classified as other long-term liabilities in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Cash payments for insurance and deferred compensation related liabilities may be payable beyond three years, but it is not practical to estimate these payments; therefore, these liabilities are reflected in the 1-3 years payment period. We provide funding to our post retirement plans based on at least the minimum funding required by applicable regulations. In determining the minimum required funding, we utilize current actuarial assumptions and exchange rates to forecast estimates of amounts that may be payable for up to five years in the future. In our judgment, minimum funding estimates beyond a five year time horizon cannot be reliably estimated and, therefore, have not been included in the table. 
              (4) 
    Includes $0.4 million of accrued interest. 
       
  Until August 3, 2016, we had a credit agreement (the  2013 Credit Agreement ), as amended, which provided for a revolving credit facility of  $750.0 million (the  2013 Revolving Credit Facility ) and a term loan of $350.0 million (the  2013 Term Loan ).  The 2013 Credit Agreement was effective November 25, 2013. Effective August 3, 2016, we amended and restated the 2013 Credit Agreement to provide for a $900.0 million revolving credit facility (the  2016 Revolving Credit Facility ) and a $400.0 million term loan (the  2016 Term Loan ) (collectively referred to as the  2016 Credit Agreement ) expiring August 3, 2021. The proceeds of the 2016 Term Loan were used to repay amounts drawn under the 2013 Term Loan, as well as a portion of the outstanding balance under the 2013 Revolving Credit Facility.  We may increase the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility to $1.3 billion if additional lenders are identified and/or existing lenders are willing to increase their current commitments. We may allocate up to $300.0 million of available capacity under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility to letters of credit for our account or for the account of any of our subsidiaries. Obligations under the 2016 Credit Agreement are guaranteed by most of our direct and indirect subsidiaries and are secured by substantially all of our assets and most of the assets of most of our subsidiaries. The 2016 Credit Agreement contains various covenants providing for, among other things, maintenance of certain financial ratios and certain limitations on payment of dividends, common stock repurchases, investments, acquisitions, indebtedness and capital expenditures. We were in compliance with all such covenants as of   September 30, 2016   with respect to the 2016 Credit Agreement and   December 31, 2015   with respect to the 2013 Credit Agreement. A commitment fee is payable on the average daily unused amount of the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility, which ranges from 0.15% to 0.30%, based on certain financial tests. The fee was   0.20%   of the unused amount as of   September 30, 2016  . Borrowings under the 2016 Credit Agreement bear interest at (1) a base rate plus a margin of 0.00% to 0.75%, based on certain financial tests, or (2) United States dollar LIBOR (  0.52%   at   September 30, 2016  ) plus 1.00% to 1.75%, based on certain financial tests. The base rate is determined by the greater of (a) the prime commercial lending rate announced by Bank of Montreal from time to time (  3.50%   at   September 30, 2016  ), (b) the federal funds effective rate, plus   of 1.00%, (c) the

     Table of Contents  

daily one month LIBOR rate, plus 1.00%, or (d) 0.00%. The interest rate in effect at   September 30, 2016   was   1.77%  . Fees for letters of credit issued under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility range from 1.00% to 1.75% of the respective face amounts of outstanding letters of credit and are computed based on certain financial tests. We capitalized an additional $3.0 million of debt issuance costs associated with the 2016 Credit Agreement. Debt issuance costs are amortized over the life of the agreement and are included as part of interest expense. In connection with the amendment and restatement of the 2013 Credit Agreement, $0.1 million attributable to the acceleration of expense for debt issuance costs in connection with the 2013 Credit Agreement was recorded as part of interest expense during the third quarter of 2016. We are required to make principal payments on the 2016 Term Loan in installments on the last day of March, June, September and December of each year, commencing with the calendar quarter ending December 31, 2016, in the amount of $5.0 million, with a payment of all unpaid principal and interest due on August 3, 2021.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the balance of the 2016 Term Loan and the 2013 Term Loan was $400.0 million and $315.0 million, respectively. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had approximately   $115.4 million   and   $99.0 million   of letters of credit outstanding, respectively. There were   $125.0 million   in borrowings outstanding under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility as of September 30, 2016.  There were   no   borrowings outstanding under the 2013 Revolving Credit Facility at   December 31, 2015  . 
  The terms of our construction contracts frequently require that we obtain from surety companies ( Surety Companies ) and provide to our customers payment and performance bonds ( Surety Bonds ) as a condition to the award of such contracts. The Surety Bonds secure our payment and performance obligations under such contracts, and we have agreed to indemnify the Surety Companies for amounts, if any, paid by them in respect of Surety Bonds issued on our behalf. In addition, at the request of labor unions representing certain of our employees, Surety Bonds are sometimes provided to secure obligations for wages and benefits payable to or for such employees. Public sector contracts require Surety Bonds more frequently than private sector contracts, and accordingly, our bonding requirements typically increase as the amount of public sector work increases. As of   September 30, 2016  , based on the percentage-of-completion of our projects covered by Surety Bonds, our aggregate estimated exposure, assuming defaults on all our then existing contractual obligations, was approximately $1.1 billion. Surety Bonds are issued by Surety Companies in return for premiums, which vary depending on the size and type of bond. 
  From time to time, we discuss with our current and other Surety Bond providers the amounts of Surety Bonds that may be available to us based on our financial strength and the absence of any default by us on any Surety Bond issued on our behalf and believe those amounts are currently adequate for our needs. However, if we experience changes in our bonding relationships or if there are adverse changes in the surety industry, we may seek to satisfy certain customer requests for Surety Bonds by posting other forms of collateral in lieu of Surety Bonds such as letters of credit, parent company guarantees or cash, seeking to convince customers to forego the requirement for Surety Bonds, by increasing our activities in our business segments that rarely require Surety Bonds such as our building and industrial services segments, and/or by refraining from bidding for certain projects that require Surety Bonds. There can be no assurance that we would be able to effectuate alternatives to providing Surety Bonds to our customers or to obtain, on favorable terms, sufficient additional work that does not require Surety Bonds. Accordingly, if we were to experience a reduction in the availability of Surety Bonds, we could experience a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows. 
  In the ordinary course of business, we, at times, guarantee obligations of our subsidiaries under certain contracts. Generally, we are liable under such an arrangement only if our subsidiary fails to perform its obligations under the contract. Historically, we have not incurred any substantial liabilities as a consequence of these guarantees. 
  We do not have any other material financial guarantees or off-balance sheet arrangements other than those disclosed herein. 
  We are a party to lawsuits and other proceedings in which other parties seek to recover from us amounts ranging from a few thousand dollars to over $10.0 million. We do not believe that any such matters will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity. 
  On September 26, 2011, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase up to $100.0 million of our outstanding common stock.  On December 5, 2013, October 23, 2014 and October 28, 2015, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase up to an additional $100.0 million, $250.0 million and $200.0 million of our outstanding common stock, respectively. During 2016, we have repurchased approximately   0.6 million   shares of our common stock for approximately   $29.0 million  . Since the inception of the repurchase programs through   September 30, 2016  , we have repurchased   10.5 million   shares of our common stock for approximately   $424.9 million  . As of   September 30, 2016  , there remained authorization for us to repurchase approximately   $225.1 million   of our shares. The repurchase programs do not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of common stock and may be suspended, recommenced or discontinued at any time or from time to time without prior notice. We may repurchase our shares from time to time to the extent permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements, including provisions in our credit agreement placing limitations on such repurchases. The repurchase programs have been and will be funded from our operations.

We have paid quarterly dividends since October 25, 2011. We expect that such quarterly dividends will be paid in the foreseeable future. Prior to October 25, 2011, no cash dividends had been paid on the Company s common stock. We currently pay a regular quarterly dividend of $0.08 per share.  Our 2016 Credit Agreement places limitations on the payment of dividends on our common stock. However, we do not believe that the terms of such agreement currently materially limit our ability to pay a quarterly dividend of $0.08 per share for the foreseeable future. The payment of dividends has been and will be funded from our operations.  
  Our primary source of liquidity has been, and is expected to continue to be, cash generated by operating activities. We also maintain our 2016 Revolving Credit Facility that may be utilized, among other things, to meet short-term liquidity needs in the event cash generated by operating activities is insufficient or to enable us to seize opportunities to participate in joint ventures or to make acquisitions that may require access to cash on short notice or for any other reason. Negative macroeconomic trends may have an adverse effect on liquidity.  During economic downturns, there have been typically fewer small discretionary projects from the private sector, and our competitors have aggressively bid larger long-term infrastructure and public sector contracts. Short-term liquidity is also impacted by the type and length of construction contracts in place and large turnaround activities in our United States industrial services segment that are billed in arrears pursuant to contractual terms that are standard within the industry. Performance of long duration contracts typically requires greater amounts of working capital. While we strive to maintain a net over-billed position with our customers, there can be no assurance that a net over-billed position can be maintained. Our net over-billings, defined as the balance sheet accounts  Billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts  less  Cost and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts , were   $324.5 million   and   $311.5 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  Long-term liquidity requirements can be expected to be met initially through cash generated from operating activities and our 2016 Revolving Credit Facility. Based upon our current credit ratings and financial position, we can reasonably expect to be able to incur long-term debt to fund acquisitions. Over the long term, our primary revenue risk factor continues to be the level of demand for non-residential construction services and for building and industrial services, which is influenced by macroeconomic trends including interest rates and governmental economic policy. In addition, our ability to perform work is critical to meeting long-term liquidity requirements. 
  We believe that our current cash balances and our borrowing capacity available under our 2016 Revolving Credit Facility or other forms of financing available to us through borrowings, combined with cash expected to be generated from operations, will be sufficient to provide short-term and foreseeable long-term liquidity and meet our expected capital expenditure requirements.  
   
  Certain Insurance Matters 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we utilized approximately $115.0 million and $97.8 million, respectively, of letters of credit obtained under our 2016 Revolving Credit Facility and our 2013 Revolving Credit Facility, respectively, as collateral for our insurance obligations. 
   
  New Accounting Pronouncements 
  We review new accounting standards to determine the expected financial impact, if any, that the adoption of such standards will have. See Part I. Item 1,  Financial Statements   Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements   Note 2, New Accounting Pronouncements , for further information regarding new accounting standards, including the anticipated dates of adoption and the effects on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity. 
   
  Application of Critical Accounting Policies 
  Our condensed consolidated financial statements are based on the application of significant accounting policies, which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in Note 2   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. We believe that some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of accounting policies that affect our financial condition and results of operations are the impact of changes in the estimates and judgments pertaining to: (a) revenue recognition from (i) long-term construction contracts for which the percentage-of-completion method of accounting is used and (ii) services contracts; (b) collectibility or valuation of accounts receivable; (c) insurance liabilities; (d) income taxes; and (e) goodwill and identifiable intangible assets. 
  Revenue Recognition for Long-term Construction Contracts and Services Contracts 
  We believe our most critical accounting policy is revenue recognition from long-term construction contracts for which we use the percentage-of-completion method of accounting. Percentage-of-completion accounting is the prescribed method of  
  
   27 

     Table of Contents  

accounting for long-term contracts in accordance with Accounting Standard Codification ( ASC ) Topic 605-35,  Revenue Recognition   Construction-Type and Production-Type Contracts , and, accordingly, is the method used for revenue recognition within our industry. Percentage-of-completion is measured principally by the percentage of costs incurred to date for each contract to the estimated total costs for such contract at completion. Certain of our electrical contracting business units measure percentage-of-completion by the percentage of labor costs incurred to date for each contract to the estimated total labor costs for such contract. Pre-contract costs from our construction projects are generally expensed as incurred. Application of percentage-of-completion accounting results in the recognition of costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts reflected in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets arise when revenues have been recognized but the amounts cannot be billed under the terms of contracts. Such amounts are recoverable from customers upon various measures of performance, including achievement of certain milestones, completion of specified units or completion of a contract. 
  Costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts also include amounts we seek or will seek to collect from customers or others for errors or changes in contract specifications or design, contract change orders in dispute or unapproved as to both scope and price or other customer-related causes of unanticipated additional contract costs (claims and unapproved change orders). Such amounts are recorded at estimated net realizable value and take into account factors that may affect our ability to bill and ultimately collect unbilled revenues. The profit associated with claim amounts is not recognized until the claim has been settled and payment has been received. We did not recognize any material amounts associated with claim settlements during the periods presented. Due to uncertainties inherent in estimates employed in applying percentage-of-completion accounting, estimates may be revised as project work progresses. Application of percentage-of-completion accounting requires that the impact of revised estimates be reported prospectively in the condensed consolidated financial statements. In addition to revenue recognition for long-term construction contracts, we recognize revenues from the performance of services for maintenance, repair and retrofit work consistent with the performance of services, which are generally on a pro-rata basis over the life of the contractual arrangement. Expenses related to all services arrangements are recognized as incurred. Revenues related to the engineering, manufacturing and repairing of shell and tube heat exchangers are recognized when the product is shipped and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. Costs related to this work are included in inventory until the product is shipped. Provisions for the entirety of estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, we incurred $6.9 million and $17.4 million, respectively, of losses on a transportation project within our United States electrical construction and facilities services segment as a result of productivity issues attributable to unfavorable job-site conditions. There were no other significant losses recognized during the   three and nine   months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 
  Accounts Receivable 
  We are required to estimate the collectibility of accounts receivable. A considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the likelihood of realization of receivables. Relevant assessment factors include the creditworthiness of the customer, our prior collection history with the customer and related aging of the past due balances. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , our accounts receivable of   $1,495.6 million   and   $1,359.9 million  , respectively, included allowances for doubtful accounts of   $15.3 million   and   $11.2 million  , respectively. The increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts was due to an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts, partially offset by the write-off of previously reserved for accounts receivable. Specific accounts receivable are evaluated when we believe a customer may not be able to meet its financial obligations due to deterioration of its financial condition or its credit ratings. The allowance for doubtful accounts requirements are based on the best facts available and are re-evaluated and adjusted on a regular basis as additional information is received. 
  Insurance Liabilities  
  We have loss payment deductibles for certain workers  compensation, automobile liability, general liability and property claims, have self-insured retentions for certain other casualty claims and are self-insured for employee-related healthcare claims. Losses are recorded based upon estimates of our liability for claims incurred and for claims incurred but not reported. The liabilities are derived from known facts, historical trends and industry averages utilizing the assistance of an actuary to determine the best estimate for the majority of these obligations. We believe the liabilities recognized on our balance sheets for these obligations are adequate. However, such obligations are difficult to assess and estimate due to numerous factors, including severity of injury, determination of liability in proportion to other parties, timely reporting of occurrences and effectiveness of safety and risk management programs. Therefore, if our actual experience differs from the assumptions and estimates used for recording the liabilities, adjustments may be required and will be recorded in the period that the experience becomes known. Our estimated insurance liabilities for workers  compensation, automobile liability, general liability and property claims increased by $8.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to higher revenues, including the impact of acquired companies. If our estimated insurance liabilities for workers  compensation, automobile liability, general liability and property claims had increased by 10%, it would have resulted in $15.3 million of additional expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.

Income Taxes     
  We had net deferred income tax liabilities at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   of $129.8 million and $120.6 million, respectively, primarily resulting from differences between the carrying value and income tax basis of certain identifiable intangible assets and depreciable fixed assets, which will impact our taxable income in future periods. Included within these net deferred income tax liabilities are deferred income tax assets. A valuation allowance is required when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred income tax asset will not be realized. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the total valuation allowance on deferred income tax assets, related to state net operating carryforwards, was approximately $1.7 million and $0.8 million, respectively.  
  Goodwill and Identifiable Intangible Assets     
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $979.3 million   and   $500.1 million  , respectively, of goodwill and net identifiable intangible assets (primarily consisting of our contract backlog, developed technology/vendor network, customer relationships, non-competition agreements and trade names), primarily arising out of the acquisition of companies.  As of   December 31, 2015  , goodwill and net identifiable intangible assets were   $843.2 million   and   $472.8 million  , respectively. The changes to goodwill since December 31, 2015 were related to the acquisition of two companies in 2016 and a purchase price adjustment related to an acquisition made in 2015.  The determination of related estimated useful lives for identifiable intangible assets and whether those assets are impaired involves significant judgments based upon short and long-term projections of future performance. These forecasts reflect assumptions regarding the ability to successfully integrate acquired companies, as well as macroeconomic conditions. ASC Topic 350,  Intangibles   Goodwill and Other  ( ASC 350 ) requires goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite useful lives not be amortized, but instead tested at least annually for impairment (which we test each October 1, absent any impairment indicators), and be written down if impaired. ASC 350 requires that goodwill be allocated to its respective reporting unit and that identifiable intangible assets with finite lives be amortized over their useful lives. 
  We test for impairment of our goodwill at the reporting unit level. Our reporting units are consistent with the reportable segments identified in Note 13,  Segment Information , of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements. In assessing whether our goodwill is impaired, we utilize the two-step process as prescribed by ASC 350. The first step of this test compares the fair value of the reporting unit, determined based upon discounted estimated future cash flows, to the carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value exceeds the carrying amount, no further analysis is required and no impairment loss is recognized. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value, the goodwill of the reporting unit is potentially impaired and step two of the goodwill impairment test would need to be performed to measure the amount of an impairment loss, if any. In the second step, the impairment is computed by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of the goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of its goodwill, an impairment loss in the amount of the excess is recognized and charged to operations. No impairment of our goodwill was recognized during the   three and nine   months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $979.3 million   of goodwill on our balance sheet and, of this amount, 39.3% relates to our United States industrial services segment, 25.0% relates to our United States building services segment, 23.1% relates to our United States mechanical construction and facilities services segment and 12.6% relates to our United States electrical construction and facilities services segment. As of the date of our latest impairment test, October 1, 2015, the carrying values of our United States industrial services segment, our United States building services segment, our United States mechanical construction and facilities services segment and our United States electrical construction and facilities services segment were approximately $725.5 million, $445.1 million, $249.5 million and $62.9 million, respectively.  The fair values of our United States industrial services segment, our United States building services segment, our United States mechanical construction and facilities services segment and our United States electrical construction and facilities services segment exceeded their carrying values by approximately $52.5 million, $291.2 million, $773.2 million, and $661.7 million, respectively.  The weighted average cost of capital used in testing goodwill for impairment was 11.1%, 11.1%  and 11.0% for our domestic construction segments, our United states building services segment and our United States industrial services segment, respectively. The perpetual growth rate used was 2.7% for all of our domestic segments. 
  We also test for the impairment of trade names that are not subject to amortization by calculating the fair value using the  relief from royalty payments  methodology. This approach involves two steps: (a) estimating reasonable royalty rates for each trade name and (b) applying these royalty rates to a net revenue stream and discounting the resulting cash flows to determine fair value. This fair value is then compared with the carrying value of each trade name. If the carrying amount of the trade name is greater than the implied fair value of the trade name, an impairment in the amount of the excess is recognized and charged to operations. No impairment of our trade names was recognized during the   three and nine   months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.

     Table of Contents  

In addition, we review for the impairment of other identifiable intangible assets that are being amortized whenever facts and circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be fully recoverable. This test compares their carrying values to the undiscounted pre-tax cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets. If the assets are impaired, the assets are written down to their fair values, generally determined based on their future discounted cash flows. No impairment of our other identifiable intangible assets was recognized during the   three and nine   months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 
  We have certain businesses, particularly within our United States industrial services segment, whose results are highly impacted by the demand for some of our offerings within the industrial and oil and gas markets. Future performance of this segment, along with a continued evaluation of the conditions of its end user markets, will be important to ongoing impairment assessments.  Should this segment s actual results suffer a decline or expected future results be revised downward, the risk of goodwill impairment or impairment of other identifiable intangible assets would increase.  
  Our development of the present value of future cash flow projections used in impairment testing is based upon assumptions and estimates by management from reviews of our operating results, business plans, anticipated growth rates and margins, and weighted average cost of capital, among others.  Those assumptions and estimates can change in future periods, and other factors used in assessing fair value are outside the control of management, such as interest rates.  There can be no assurance that estimates and assumptions made for purposes of our goodwill and identifiable asset impairment testing will prove to be accurate predictions of the future.  If our assumptions regarding future business performance or anticipated growth rates and/or margins are not achieved, or there is a rise in interest rates, we may be required to record goodwill and/or identifiable asset impairment charges in future periods.  
  Although we have not yet conducted our October 1, 2016 goodwill and other impairment tests, there have been no impairments recognized through the first nine months of 2016. It is not possible at this time to determine if any such future impairment charge would result or, if it does, whether such a charge would be material. 
   
  ITEM 3.   QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 
  We have not used any derivative financial instruments during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , including trading or speculating on changes in interest rates or commodity prices of materials used in our business. 
  We are exposed to market risk for changes in interest rates for borrowings under the 2016 Credit Agreement, which provides for a revolving credit facility and a term loan. Borrowings under the 2016 Credit Agreement bear interest at variable rates. As of   September 30, 2016  , there were borrowings of $125.0 million outstanding under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility and the balance of the 2016 Term Loan was $400.0 million. This instrument bears interest at (1) a base rate plus a margin of 0.00% to 0.75%, based on certain financial tests, or (2) United States dollar LIBOR (  0.52%   at   September 30, 2016  ) plus 1.00% to 1.75%, based on certain financial tests. The base rate is determined by the greater of (a) the prime commercial lending rate announced by Bank of Montreal from time to time (  3.50%   at   September 30, 2016  ), (b) the federal funds effective rate, plus   of 1.00%, (c) the daily one month LIBOR rate, plus 1.00%, or (d) 0.00%. The interest rate in effect at   September 30, 2016   was   1.77%  . Based on the $525.0 million borrowings outstanding under the 2016 Credit Agreement, if overall interest rates were to increase by 25 basis points, interest expense, net of income taxes, would increase by approximately $0.8 million in the next twelve months. Conversely, if overall interest rates were to decrease by 25 basis points, interest expense, net of income taxes, would decrease by approximately $0.8 million in the next twelve months. Fees for letters of credit issued under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility range from 1.00% to 1.75% of the respective face amounts of outstanding letters of credit and are computed based on certain financial tests. The 2016 Credit Agreement expires on August 3, 2021. There is no guarantee that we will be able to renew the 2016 Credit Agreement at its expiration. 
  We are also exposed to construction market risk and its potential related impact on accounts receivable or costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts. The amounts recorded may be at risk if our customers  ability to pay these obligations is negatively impacted by economic conditions. We continually monitor the creditworthiness of our customers and maintain on-going discussions with customers regarding contract status with respect to change orders and billing terms. Therefore, we believe we take appropriate action to manage market and other risks, but there is no assurance that we will be able to reasonably identify all risks with respect to collectibility of these assets. See also the previous discussions of Revenue Recognition from Long-term Construction Contracts and Services Contracts and Accounts Receivable under the heading,  Application of Critical Accounting Policies  in Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
  Amounts invested in our foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the end of the period. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded as accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income, a component of equity, in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. We believe the exposure to the effects that fluctuating foreign currencies may have on our consolidated results of operations is limited because the foreign operations primarily invoice customers and  
  
   30 

     Table of Contents  

collect obligations in their respective local currencies. Additionally, expenses associated with these transactions are generally contracted and paid for in their same local currencies. 
  In addition, we are exposed to market risk of fluctuations in certain commodity prices of materials, such as copper and steel, which are used as components of supplies or materials utilized in our construction, building services and industrial services operations. We are also exposed to increases in energy prices, particularly as they relate to gasoline prices for our fleet of over 9,500 vehicles. While we believe we can increase our contract prices to adjust for some price increases in commodities, there can be no assurance that such price increases, if they were to occur, would be recoverable. Additionally, our fixed price contracts do not allow us to adjust our prices and, as a result, increases in material or fuel costs could reduce our profitability with respect to projects in progress. 
   
  ITEM 4.   CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 
  Based on an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as required by Rule 13a-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934), our President and Chief Executive Officer, Anthony J. Guzzi, and our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mark A. Pompa, have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchanges Act of 1934) are effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. 
  There have not been any changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) during the fiscal quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.

    Section 1.3.    Letters of Credit  . 
  (a)      General Terms  .  Subject to the terms, conditions and limitations hereof (including those set forth in Section 1.1 hereof), as part of the U.S. Revolving Facility, the Applicable Issuer shall issue Financial Letters of Credit or Performance Letters of Credit (each a    Letter of Credit   ) under the U.S. Revolving Facility for the account of a Borrower and/or one or more of its Subsidiaries in U.S. Dollars or Alternative Currencies in an aggregate undrawn face amount up to the L/C Sublimit;   provided  , no Applicable Issuer shall be required to issue a Letter of Credit hereunder if, after giving effect to such Letter of Credit, the aggregate undrawn face amount of all Letters of Credit issued by such Applicable Issuer and any affiliate of the Applicable Issuer would exceed the Applicable Issuer s Cap.  Each Letter of Credit shall be issued by the Applicable Issuer, but each U.S. Lender shall be obligated to reimburse the Applicable Issuer for such U.S. Lender s U.S. Revolver Percentage of the amount of each drawing thereunder in accordance with the terms hereof and, accordingly, each Letter of Credit shall constitute usage of the U.S. Dollar Commitment of each U.S. Lender pro rata in an amount equal to its U.S. Revolver Percentage of the U.S. Dollar Equivalent of the L/C Obligations then outstanding.  As of the Closing Date, each of the Existing Letters of Credit shall constitute, for all purposes of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, a Letter of Credit issued and outstanding hereunder.  Each Letter of Credit shall conform to the Applicable Issuer s policies as to form and shall be a Letter of Credit which the Applicable Issuer may lawfully issue.  Each Letter of Credit shall support payment of an obligation of the Borrower which applies for such Letter of Credit or an obligation of such Borrower s Restricted Subsidiary or of a Strategic Venture or other joint venture permitted by Section 7.12 hereof in which the applicant or one of its Restricted Subsidiaries has an equity interest. 
  (b)      Applications  .  At any time before the Revolving Credit Termination Date, the Applicable Issuer shall, subject to all of the terms and conditions hereof, at the request of the Company (which is acting on behalf of the Borrowers pursuant to Section 1.7 hereof), issue one or more Letters of Credit, in a form satisfactory to the Applicable Issuer, in an aggregate face amount not to exceed the L/C Sublimit and the relevant Applicable Issuer s Cap upon the receipt of an application and reimbursement agreement, if applicable, for the relevant Letter of Credit in the form customarily prescribed by the Applicable Issuer for the type of Letter of Credit in question, duly executed by the Borrower for whose account such Letter of Credit was issued (each such application together with the related reimbursement agreement, if any, being referred to herein as an    Application   ).      Each Letter of Credit issued hereunder shall (a) be payable, as determined by the Company acting on behalf of the applicable Borrower, in U.S. Dollars or an Alternative Currency and (b) expire not later than (i) the Revolving Credit Termination Date for Letters of Credit issued by Bank of Montreal and (ii) the date which is five days prior to the Revolving Credit Termination Date for  
  
   -3- 

Letters of Credit issued by an Applicable Issuer other than Bank of Montreal;   provided,   that in the sole discretion of the Agent and the Applicable Issuer, one or more Letters of Credit may be issued and renewed with an expiration date after the Revolving Credit Termination Date (but no later than one year after the Revolving Credit Termination Date) so long as the applicable Borrower deposits with the Agent at least five (5) Business Days prior to the Revolving Credit Termination Date Cash Collateral to be held in accordance with Section 8.4(b) hereof in an amount not less than 105% of the face amount of such Letters of Credit (it being understood that the participations of the Lenders (other than the Applicable Issuer) in any such Letter of Credit shall terminate on the Revolving Credit Termination Date to the extent such Letter of Credit has been Cash Collateralized in accordance with the foregoing).      Notwithstanding anything contained in any Application to the contrary, (i) the applicable Borrower s obligation to pay fees in connection with each Letter of Credit shall be as exclusively set forth in Section 3.3 hereof, (ii) except as otherwise provided in Section 2.12, 2.13 or Section 3.5 hereof or during existence of an Event of Default, the Applicable Issuer will not call for the funding by such Borrower of any amount under a Letter of Credit, or any other form of collateral security (other than the Collateral, if any, and the Guaranty Agreements) for such Borrower s obligations in connection with such Letter of Credit, before being presented with a drawing thereunder, and (iii) if the Applicable Issuer is not timely reimbursed for the amount of any drawing under a Letter of Credit on the date such drawing is paid, upon written notice from the Applicable Issuer the Borrower s obligation to reimburse the Applicable Issuer for the amount of such drawing shall bear interest (which the relevant Borrower hereby promises to pay) from and after the date such drawing is paid at a rate per annum equal to the sum of 2% plus the Applicable Margin for Eurodollar Loans from time to time in effect.  The Issuer will promptly notify the Agent of each request for a Letter of Credit and of the issuance of a Letter of Credit and the Agent shall promptly thereafter so notify each of the Lenders.  If an Applicable Issuer issues any Letters of Credit with expiration dates that are automatically extended unless such Applicable Issuer gives notice that the expiration date will not so extend beyond its then scheduled expiration date, such Applicable Issuer will give such notice of non renewal before the time necessary to prevent such automatic extension if before such required notice date (i) the expiration date of such Letter of Credit if so extended would be after the Revolving Credit Termination Date unless the Borrowers provide Cash Collateral in accordance with this Section 1.3(b), (ii) the Aggregate Revolving Commitments have been terminated, or (iii) an Event of Default exists and the Required Lenders have given the Applicable Issuer instructions not to so permit the extension of the expiration date of such Letter of Credit.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the parties hereto hereby confirm and agree that each Applicable Issuer s obligation to issue, amend or extend the expiration date of a Letter of Credit is subject to the conditions of Section 6, the other terms of this Section 1.3 and the other provisions of this Agreement, and such Applicable Issuer will not issue, amend or extend the expiration date of any Letter of Credit if the Agent or the Required Lenders notify in writing such Applicable Issuer of any Default or Event of Default that is continuing and direct the Applicable Issuer not to take such action.   
  (c)      The Reimbursement Obligation  .  (i) Subject to Section 1.3(b) hereof, the obligation of a Borrower to reimburse the Applicable Issuer for all drawings under a Letter of Credit issued for such Borrower s account (a    Reimbursement Obligation   ) shall be governed by the Application related to such Letter of Credit, except that reimbursement of each drawing shall be made in immediately available funds at the designated office of the Applicable Issuer by no later than 12:00 Noon (local time at the issuing office  
  
   -4- 

of the Applicable Issuer) on the date when such drawing is paid in the case of payment before 12:00 Noon (local time at the issuing office of the Applicable Issuer), and in all other cases by 12:00 Noon (local time at the issuing office of the Applicable Issuer) of the next Business Day.  If the relevant Borrower does not make any such reimbursement payment on the date due and the applicable Participating Lenders fund their participations therein in the manner set forth in Section 1.3(d) below, then all payments thereafter received by the Applicable Issuer in discharge of any of the relevant Reimbursement Obligations shall be distributed in accordance with Section 1.3(d) below. 
  (ii)    The Borrower s obligation to reimburse the Applicable Issuer as provided in subsection (c)(i) of this Section shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the relevant Application under any and all circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit or this Agreement, or any term or provision therein, (ii) any draft or other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment by the Applicable Issuer under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit, or (iv) any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or provide a right of setoff against, the Borrowers  obligations hereunder.  None of the Agent, the Lenders, or the Applicable Issuers shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the Applicable Issuer;   provided   that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse the Applicable Issuer from liability to the relevant Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the such Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by such Borrower that are caused by the Applicable Issuer s failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof.  The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Applicable Issuer (as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), the Applicable Issuer shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination.  In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to documents presented which appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, the Applicable Issuer may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit.

(d)      The Participating Interests  .  Each U.S. Lender, by its acceptance hereof, severally agrees to purchase from the Applicable Issuer, and the Applicable Issuer hereby agrees to sell to each such U.S. Lender (a    Participating Lender   ), an undivided percentage participating interest (a    Participating Interest   ), to the extent of its U.S. Revolver Percentage, in each Letter of Credit issued by, and each Reimbursement Obligation owed to, the Applicable Issuer.  Upon any failure by a Borrower to pay any Reimbursement Obligation in respect of a Letter of Credit issued for such Borrower s account at the time required on the date the related drawing is paid, as set forth in Section 1.3(c) above, or if the Applicable Issuer is required at any time to return to a Borrower or to a trustee, receiver, liquidator, custodian or other Person any portion of any payment of any Reimbursement Obligation, each applicable Participating Lender shall, not later than (i) with respect to payments required to be made in U.S. Dollars, the Business Day it receives a certificate from the Applicable Issuer to such effect, if such certificate is received before 1:00 p.m. (local time at the office of the Issuer), or not later than the following Business Day, if such certificate is received after such time, and (ii) with respect to payments required to be made in an Alternative Currency, not later than three (3) Business Days after receipt of such certificate pay to the Applicable Issuer an amount equal to its U.S. Revolver Percentage, of such unpaid or recaptured Reimbursement Obligation together with interest on such amount accrued from the date such payment is required under this clause (d) to the date of such payment by such Participating Lender at a rate per annum equal to (i) from the date the related payment by such Participating Lender is required to be made under this clause (d) to the date two (2) Business Days after payment by such Participating Lender is due hereunder, the Federal Funds Rate for each such day and (ii) from the date two (2) Business Days after the date such payment is due from such Participating Lender to the date such payment is made by such Participating Lender, the rate per annum determined by adding the Applicable Margin to the Base Rate in effect for each such day.  Each such Participating Lender shall thereafter be entitled to receive its U.S. Revolver Percentage of each payment received in respect of the relevant Reimbursement Obligation and of interest paid thereon, with the Applicable Issuer retaining its Percentage as a Lender hereunder. 
  The several obligations of the Participating Lenders to the Issuers under this Section 1.3 shall be absolute, irrevocable and unconditional under any and all circumstances whatsoever (except, to the extent such Borrower is relieved from its obligation to reimburse the Applicable Issuer for a drawing under a Letter of Credit due solely to the Applicable Issuer s gross negligence or willful misconduct in determining that documents received under the Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof as determined by a final, non appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction) and shall not be subject to any set off, counterclaim or defense to payment which any Participating Lender may have or have had against any one or more of the Borrowers, the Agent, any other Lender or any other Person whatsoever.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, such obligations shall not be affected by any Default or Event of Default or by any reduction or termination of any Aggregate Revolving Commitment of any Lender, and each payment by a Participating Lender under this Section 1.3 shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever.  The Agent shall be entitled to offset amounts received for the account of a Lender under this Agreement against unpaid amounts due from such Lender hereunder (whether as fundings of participations, indemnities or otherwise). 
  
   -6- 

(e)      Indemnification  .  Each of the Participating Lenders shall, to the extent of their respective Percentages, indemnify the Applicable Issuers (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrowers) against any cost, expense (including reasonable counsel fees and disbursements), claim, demand, action, loss or liability (except such as result solely from the Applicable Issuer s gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a final, non appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction) that the Applicable Issuers may suffer or incur in connection with any Letter of Credit.  The obligations of the Participating Lenders under this Section 1.3(e) and all other parts of this Section 1.3 shall survive termination of this Agreement and of all other L/C Documents. 
  (f)      Effect of the Applications  .  To the extent that any provision of an Application relating to any Letter of Credit is inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement, the provisions of this Agreement shall apply. 
  Section 1.4.    Manner of Borrowing Loans and Designating Applicable Interest Rates      .   
  (a)      Notice to the Agent.    The Company (which is acting on behalf of the Borrowers pursuant to Section 1.7 hereof) shall give notice to the Agent by no later than 10:00 a.m. (Chicago time):  (i) at least three (3) Business Days before the date on which the applicable Borrower requests the Lenders to advance a Borrowing of Eurodollar Loans or a Borrowing in an Alternative Currency and (ii) on the date the applicable Borrower requests the Lenders to advance a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans.  The Loans included in each Borrowing shall bear interest initially at the type of rate specified in such notice of a new Borrowing.  Thereafter, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the applicable Borrower may from time to time elect to change or continue the type of interest rate borne by each Borrowing or, subject to the minimum amount requirement for each outstanding Borrowing set forth in Section 1.5 hereof, a portion thereof, as follows:  (i) if such Borrowing is of Eurodollar Loans, on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, the Borrower may continue part or all of such Borrowing as Eurodollar Loans or, with respect to a Borrowing denominated in U.S. Dollars, convert part or all of such Borrowing into Base Rate Loans or (ii) if such Borrowing is of Base Rate Loans, on any Business Day, the Company may convert all or part of such Borrowing into Eurodollar Loans for an Interest Period or Interest Periods specified by the Company (acting on behalf of the applicable Borrower).  The Borrowers acknowledge that no Multicurrency Revolving Loan may be requested as, or converted into, a Base Rate Loan.  The Company shall give all such notices requesting the advance, continuation or conversion of a Borrowing to the Agent in accordance with Section 1.7(b) hereof.  Notice of the continuation of a Borrowing of Eurodollar Loans for an additional Interest Period or of the conversion of part or all of a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans into Eurodollar Loans must be given by no later than 10:00 a.m. (Chicago time) at least three (3) Business Days before the date of the requested continuation or conversion.  All such notices concerning the advance, continuation or conversion of a Borrowing shall specify the date of the requested advance, continuation or conversion of a Borrowing (which shall be a Business Day), the amount of the requested Borrowing to be advanced, continued or converted, the type of Loans to comprise such new, continued or converted Borrowing, if such Borrowing is to be comprised of Eurodollar Loans, the Interest Period applicable thereto, if the Borrowing such Borrowing is a Revolving Loan, whether it is under the Multicurrency Revolving Facility or the U.S. Revolving Facility, and if such Borrowing is under the Multicurrency Revolving Facility, the currency (whether in U.S. Dollars  
  
   -7- 

or an Alternative Currency) of the Multicurrency Revolving Loan.  Any such written notice of an advance of Borrowing shall be substantially in the form of Exhibit E attached hereto or such other under form as may be reasonably acceptable to the Agent.  Upon notice to the Company by the Agent or the Required Lenders (or, in the case of an Event of Default under Section 8.1(k) or 8.1(l) hereof with respect to any Borrower, without notice), no     Borrowing of Eurodollar Loans shall be advanced, continued, or created by conversion if any Default or Event of Default then exists.   
  (b)      Notice to the Lenders  .  The Agent shall give prompt telephonic, facsimile or other telecommunication notice to each Lender of any notice from a Borrower received pursuant to Section 1.4(a) above, and, if such notice requests the Lenders to make Eurodollar Loans, the Agent shall give notice to the Company and each Lender by like means of the interest rate applicable thereto promptly after the Agent has made such determination. 
  (c)      Borrower s Failure to Notify.    If the Company fails to give notice pursuant to Section 1.4(a) above of the continuation or conversion of any outstanding principal amount of a Borrowing of Eurodollar Loans before the last day of its then current Interest Period within the period required by Section 1.4(a) and such Borrowing is not prepaid in accordance with Section 3.4, such Borrowing shall automatically be converted into a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans (or, if such Borrowing is an Alternative Currency, such Borrowing shall be continued for an Interest Period of one month).  In the event the applicable Borrower fails to give notice pursuant to Section 1.4(a) above of a Borrowing equal to the amount of a Reimbursement Obligation and has not notified the Agent by 12:00 noon (Chicago time) on the day such Reimbursement Obligation becomes due that it intends to repay such Reimbursement Obligation through funds not borrowed under this Agreement, such Borrower shall be deemed to have requested a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans under the U.S. Revolving Facility (or, at the option of the Swing Line Lender, under the Swing Line) on such day in the amount of the Reimbursement Obligation then due, which Borrowing shall be applied to pay the Reimbursement Obligation then due. 
  (d)      Disbursement of Loans  .  Not later than 1:00 p.m. (Chicago time) on the date of any requested advance of a new Borrowing, subject to Section 6 hereof, each Lender shall make available its Loan comprising part of such Borrowing (i) that is denominated in U.S. Dollars in funds immediately available at the principal office of the Agent in Chicago, Illinois (or at such other location as the Agent shall designate) or, (ii) that is denominated in an Alternative Currency at such office as the Agent has previously agreed to with the relevant Borrower, in each case in the currency received by the Agent from the Lenders.  
  (e)      Agent Reliance on Lender Funding.    Unless the Agent shall have been notified by a Lender prior to (or, in the case of a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans, by 1:00 p.m. (Chicago time) on the date on which such Lender is scheduled to make payment to the Agent of the proceeds of a Loan (which notice shall be effective upon receipt) that such Lender does not intend to make such payment, the Agent may assume that such Lender has made such payment when due and the Agent may in reliance upon such assumption (but shall not be required to) make available to the relevant Borrower the proceeds of the Loan to be made by such Lender and, if any Lender has not in fact made such payment to the Agent, such Lender shall, on demand, pay to the Agent the amount made available to such Borrower attributable to such Lender together  
  
   -8- 

with interest thereon in respect of each day during the period commencing on the date such amount was made available to such Borrower and ending on (but excluding) the date such Lender pays such amount to the Agent at a rate per annum equal to:  (i) from the date the related advance was made by the Agent to the date two (2) Business Days after payment by such Lender is due hereunder, the Federal Funds Rate for each such day, (ii) from the date two (2) Business Days after the date such payment is due from such Lender to the date such payment is made by such Lender, the Base Rate in effect for each such day, or (iii) in the case of a Multicurrency Revolving Loan denominated in an Alternative Currency, the cost to the Agent of funding the amount it advanced to fund such Multicurrency Lender s Revolving Loan, as determined by the Agent.  If such amount is not received from such Lender by the Agent immediately upon demand, the applicable Borrower will, on demand, repay to the Agent the proceeds of the Loan attributable to such Lender with interest thereon at a rate per annum equal to the interest rate applicable to the relevant Loan. 
  (f)      Availability of Alternative Currency.    The Multicurrency Lenders  obligations to make Multicurrency Revolving Loans in an Alternative Currency or to provide or participate in Letters of Credit payable in an Alternative Currency shall always be subject to such Alternative Currency being freely available to each of them in the relevant market.  If any Multicurrency Lender reasonably determines that such currency requested is unavailable to it in the amount and for the term requested it shall so notify the Agent within one Business Day of its receipt of the aforesaid notice and the Agent shall promptly notify the Company and each other Multicurrency Lender of its receipt of such notice and the request of the Company for the Borrowing in the Alternative Currency in question shall otherwise be deemed withdrawn.  
    Section 1.5.    Minimum Borrowing Amounts  .   Each Borrowing of Base Rate Loans shall be in an amount not less than $2,000,000, or such greater amount which is an integral multiple of $100,000, and each Borrowing of Eurodollar Loans shall be in an amount not less than $5,000,000, or such greater amount which is an integral multiple of $100,000. 
  Section 1.6.    Maturity of Loans        . 
    (a)      Scheduled Payments of Term Loans.    The Borrowers shall make principal payments on the Term Loans in installments on the last day of each March, June, September, and December in each year, commencing with the first full calendar quarter ending after the Closing Date, with the amount of each such principal installment to equal $5,000,000, with a final payment of all principal and interest not sooner paid on the Term Loans due and payable on Term Loan Maturity Date.  Each such principal payment shall be applied to the Lenders holding the Term Loans pro rata based upon their Term Loan Percentages. 
  (b)      Revolving Loans.    Each Revolving Loan, both for principal and interest not sooner paid, shall mature and be due and payable by the Borrowers on the Revolving Credit Termination Date.   

-9- 

(b)      Swing Loans  .  Each Swing Loan, both for principal and interest not sooner paid, shall mature and be due and payable by the Borrowers on the Revolving Credit Termination Date.   
    Section 1.7.    Appointment of Company as Agent for Borrowers; Reliance by Agent        . 
  (a)      Appointment  .  Each Borrower irrevocably appoints the Company as its agent hereunder to make requests on such Borrower s behalf under Section 1 hereof for Borrowings to be made by such Borrower and for Letters of Credit to be issued for such Borrower s account and to take any other action contemplated by the Loan Documents with respect to credit extended hereunder to such Borrower.  The Agent and the Lenders shall be entitled to conclusively presume that any action by the Company under the Loan Documents is taken on behalf of any one or more of the Borrowers whether or not the Company so indicates. 
  (b)      Reliance  .  All requests for Borrowings and selection of interest rates, currencies and Interest Periods applicable thereto may be written or oral, including by telephone, facsimile, or other telecommunication device acceptable to the Agent (which notice shall be irrevocable once given).  The Borrowers agree that the Agent may rely on any such notice given by any person the Agent in good faith believes is an Authorized Representative without the necessity of independent investigation (the Borrowers hereby indemnifying the Agent and Lenders from any liability or loss ensuing from such reliance), and in the event any such telephonic or other oral notice conflicts with any written confirmation, such oral or telephonic notice shall govern if the Agent has acted in reliance thereon. 
    Section 1.8.    Swing Loans  .  (a)   Generally.    Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, as part of the U.S. Revolving Facility, the Swing Line Lender may, in its discretion, make loans in U.S. Dollars to the Company under the Swing Line (individually a    Swing Loan    and collectively the    Swing Loans   ) which shall not in the aggregate at any time outstanding exceed the Swing Line Sublimit.  The Swing Loans may be requested by the Company from time to time and Borrowings thereunder may be repaid and used again during the period ending on the Revolving Credit Termination Date;   provided   that each Swing Loan must be repaid on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto.  Each Swing Loan shall be in a minimum amount of $250,000 or such greater amount which is an integral multiple of $100,000. 
    (b)      Interest on Swing Loans  .  Each Swing Loan shall bear interest until maturity (whether by acceleration or otherwise) at a rate per annum equal to (i) the sum of the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin for Base Rate Loans under the U.S. Revolving Facility as from time to time in effect or (ii) the Quoted Rate.  Interest on each Swing Loan shall be due and payable prior to such maturity on the last day of each Interest Period applicable thereto. 
  (c)      Requests for Swing Loans  .  The Company shall give the Agent prior notice (which may be written or oral), no later than 12:00 Noon (Chicago time) on the date upon which the Company requests that any Swing Loan be made, of the amount and date of such Swing Loan, and the Interest Period requested therefor.  The Agent shall promptly advise the Swing Line Lender of any such notice received from the Company.  Within 30 minutes after receiving such notice, the Swing Line Lender shall in its discretion quote an interest rate to the Company at which the Swing Line Lender would be willing to make such Swing Loan available to the Company for the Interest Period so requested (the rate so quoted for a given Interest Period  
  
   -10- 

being herein referred to as    Quoted Rate   ).  The Company acknowledges and agrees that the interest rate quote is given for immediate and irrevocable acceptance.  If the Company does not so immediately accept the Quoted Rate for the full amount requested by the Company for such Swing Loan, the Quoted Rate shall be deemed immediately withdrawn and such Swing Loan shall bear interest at the rate per annum determined by adding the Applicable Margin for Base Rate Loans under the U.S. Revolving Facility to the Base Rate as from time to time in effect.  Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the proceeds of such Swing Loan shall be made available to the Company on the date so requested at the offices of the Agent in Chicago, Illinois. 
  (d)      Refunding Loans  .  In its sole and absolute discretion, the Swing Line Lender may at any time, on behalf of the Company (which hereby irrevocably authorizes the Swing Line Lender to act on its behalf for such purpose) and with notice to the Agent and the Company, request each U.S. Lender to make a U.S. Revolving Loan in the form of a Base Rate Loan in an amount equal to such U.S. Lender s Percentage of the amount of the Swing Loans outstanding on the date such notice is given.  Unless an Event of Default described in Section 8.1(k) or 8.1(l) exists with respect to the Company, regardless of the existence of any other Event of Default, each U.S. Lender shall make the proceeds of its requested U.S. Revolving Loan available to the Agent (for the account of the Swing Line Lender), in immediately available funds, at the Agent s principal office in Chicago, Illinois, before 12:00 Noon (Chicago time) on the Business Day following the day such notice is given.  The proceeds of such Borrowing of U.S. Revolving Loans shall be immediately applied to repay the outstanding Swing Loans. 
  (e)      Participations  .  If any Lender refuses or otherwise fails to make a U.S. Revolving Loan when requested by the Swing Line Lender pursuant to Section 1.8(d) above (due to the existence of an Event of Default described in Section 8.1(k) or 8.1(l)), such U.S. Lender will, by the time and in the manner such U.S. Revolving Loan was to have been funded to the Swing Line Lender, purchase from the Swing Line Lender an undivided participating interest in the outstanding Swing Loans in an amount equal to its U.S. Revolver Percentage of the aggregate principal amount of Swing Loans that were to have been repaid with such U.S. Revolving Loans.  Each U.S. Lender that so purchases a participation in a Swing Loan shall thereafter be entitled to receive its U.S. Revolver Percentage of each payment of principal received on the Swing Loan and of interest received thereon accruing from the date such U.S. Lender funded to the Swing Line Lender its participation in such U.S. Revolving Loan.  The several obligations of the U.S. Lenders under this Section shall be absolute, irrevocable, and unconditional under any and all circumstances whatsoever and shall not be subject to any set off, counterclaim or defense to payment which any Lender may have or have had against the Company, any other Borrower, any Guarantor, any other Lender or any other Person whatever.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, such obligations shall not be affected by any Default or Event of Default or by any reduction or termination of the U.S. Dollar Commitments of any U.S. Lender, and each payment made by a U.S. Lender under this Section shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. 
    Section 1.9.    Default Rate  .  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, while any Event of Default exists or after acceleration, the relevant Borrower shall pay interest (after as well as before  
  
   -11- 

entry of judgment thereon to the extent permitted by law) on the principal amount of all Loans owing by it at a rate per annum equal to: 
  (a)    for any Base Rate Loan or any Swing Loan bearing interest based on the Base Rate, the sum of 2.0% plus the Applicable Margin plus the Base Rate from time to time in effect; 
  (b)    for any Eurodollar Loan denominated in U.S. Dollars or any Swing Loan bearing interest at the Quoted Rate, the sum of 2.0% plus the rate of interest in effect thereon at the time of such Event of Default until the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto and, thereafter, at a rate per annum equal to the sum of 2.0% plus the Applicable Margin for Base Rate Loans plus the Base Rate from time to time in effect; and 
  (c)    for any Eurodollar Loan denominated in an Alternative Currency, the sum of 2.0% plus the rate of interest in effect thereon at the time of such Event of Default until the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto and, thereafter at a rate per annum equal to the sum of the Applicable Margin, plus a rate of two percent (2.0%) plus the rate of interest per annum as determined by the Agent (rounded upwards, if necessary, to the nearest whole multiple of one sixteenth of one percent (1/16%)) at which overnight or weekend deposits of the appropriate currency (or, if such amount due remains unpaid more than three Business Days, then for such other period of time not longer than six months as the Agent may elect in its absolute discretion) for delivery in immediately available and freely transferable funds would be offered by the Agent to major banks in the interbank market upon request of such major banks for the applicable period as determined above and in an amount comparable to the unpaid principal amount of any such Loan (or, if the Agent is not placing deposits in such currency in the interbank market, then the Agent s cost of funds in such currency for such period). 
  provided, however,   that in the absence of acceleration, any adjustments pursuant to this Section shall be made at the election of the Agent, acting at the request or with the consent of the Required Lenders, with written notice to the Borrowers.  While any Event of Default exists or after acceleration, interest shall be paid on demand of the Agent at the request or with the consent of the Required Lenders. 
    Section 1.10.    Increase in Commitment        .    Provided no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Company may, on any Business Day on or prior to the Revolving Credit Termination Date, from time to time, increase the aggregate amount of the U.S. Dollar Commitments and/or the Multicurrency Commitments by delivering a Commitment Amount Increase Request in the form of Exhibit D hereto at least five (5) Business Days prior to the desired effective date of such increase (the    Commitment Amount Increase   ) identifying an additional Lender acceptable to the Agent and each Applicable Issuer in its reasonable discretion or additional U.S. Dollar Commitment and/or Multicurrency Commitment agreed to be made by any existing Lender (each such additional Lender or existing Lender (in its capacity as such) being referred to as an    Additional Lender   ) and the amount of its U.S. Dollar Commitment and/or Multicurrency Commitment (or additional amount of its U.S. Dollar Commitment and/or Multicurrency Commitment).  The aggregate amount of all such Commitment Amount Increases shall not exceed  
  
   -12- 

$400,000,000.  The effective date of the Commitment Amount Increase shall be agreed upon by the Company, such Additional Lender and the Agent (whose agreement shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).  Upon the effectiveness thereof, each Additional Lender shall advance the relevant Revolving Loans and purchase Participating Interests in all then outstanding Letters of Credit in an amount sufficient such that after giving effect to such relevant Revolving Loans and purchases each Lender (including such Additional Lender) shall have outstanding its respective Percentage of the aggregate Revolving Loans and Participating Interests then outstanding.  It shall be a condition to such effectiveness that no Eurodollar Loans be outstanding on the date of such effectiveness unless the Borrowers pay all amounts due under Section 2.5 hereof, and that the Company shall not have terminated any portion of the Aggregate Revolving Commitments pursuant to Section 3.5(a) hereof.  The Company agrees to pay any reasonable fees or expenses of the Agent (including reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel) relating to any Commitment Amount Increase.  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no Lender shall have any obligation to increase its Aggregate Revolving Commitment and no Lender s Aggregate Revolving Commitment shall be increased without its consent thereto, and each Lender may at its option, unconditionally and without cause, decline to increase its Aggregate Revolving Commitment. 
  Section 1.11.    Removal of a Borrower  .  The Company may remove any Restricted Subsidiary as a Borrower (a    Removed Borrower   ) hereunder so long as (i) the Company has provided the Agent prior written notice at least five (5) Business Days prior to the effective date of such removal, (ii) all Reimbursement Obligations of, all Revolving Loans made to, the Removed Borrower and all accrued interest owing thereon are paid in full on or prior to the effective date of such removal, (iii) no Letters of Credit issued on the account of such Removed Borrower are outstanding unless the Agent has received Cash Collateral in an amount equal to 105% of the face principal amount of such Letters of Credit or such Removed Borrower has entered into other arrangements with the Agent and the Applicable Issuer satisfactory to the Agent and such Applicable Issuer with respect to such Letters of Credit, (iv) no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing or would result from the removal of such Removed Borrower, and (v) the removal of such Removed Borrower does not have a Material Adverse Effect on such Removed Borrower s ability to continue to provide its Guaranty and pledge of Collateral as required hereunder or under any of the other Loan Documents.  Upon satisfaction of the foregoing, the Lenders and the Issuers shall not be obligated to make Loans to, or issue Letters of Credit on account of, such Removed Borrower.  The Company cannot designate a Restricted Subsidiary as a Borrower hereunder if such Borrower has been a Removed Borrower.  
    Section 1.12.    Conversions.    For all purposes of this Agreement, where a determination of the used, unused or available amount of the Aggregate Revolving Commitments or of the outstanding amount of Credit Utilizations is necessary, Credit Utilizations payable in an Alternative Currency shall be converted into their U.S. Dollar Equivalent.  Such conversions shall be made on the date of each Credit Utilization in an Alternative Currency as to that Credit Utilization and all Credit Utilizations shall be converted into their U.S. Dollar Equivalent as of the last day of each month or at the time of each Credit Utilization should the Agent so elect.  If the last day of a month is not a Business Day, such conversion shall be made as of the next Business Day.  The Agent shall promptly notify the Company of such determination of a U.S. Dollar Equivalent and of the basis therefor.  All Credit Utilizations and interest thereon shall be repaid in the currency in which they were effected.

SECTION 2. 
    INTEREST. 
       Section 2.1.    Base Rate Loans  .  Each Base Rate Loan shall bear interest (which the relevant Borrower promises to pay in arrears at the times herein provided) at the rate per annum determined by adding the Applicable Margin to the Base Rate as in effect from time to time, provided that if a Base Rate Loan is not paid when due (whether by lapse of time, acceleration or otherwise), such Base Rate Loan shall bear interest (which the relevant Borrower promises to pay at the times hereinafter provided), whether before or after judgment, and until payment in full thereof, at the rate per annum specified in Section 1.9 hereof.  Interest on the Base Rate Loans shall be payable in arrears on the last day of each March, June, September and December of each year (beginning on the first of such dates after the date hereof) and at maturity of the Revolving Loans and interest after maturity shall be due and payable upon demand. 
    Section 2.2.    Eurodollar Loans  .  Each Eurodollar Loan shall bear interest (which the relevant Borrower promises to pay in arrears at the times herein provided) on the unpaid principal amount thereof from time to time outstanding from the date of the Borrowing of such Eurodollar Loan until maturity (whether by acceleration or otherwise) at a rate per annum equal to the sum of the Applicable Margin plus Adjusted LIBOR, payable on the last day of the applicable Interest Period and at maturity (whether by acceleration or otherwise), and, if the applicable Interest Period is longer than three months, on the date occurring three months after the date of the Borrowing of such Loan;   provided   that if a Eurodollar Loan is not paid when due (whether by acceleration or otherwise), such Loan shall bear interest (which the relevant Borrower promises to pay at the times herein provided) from the date such payment was due until paid in full, payable on demand, at the rate per annum specified in Section 1.9 hereof. 
    Section 2.3.    Rate Determinations  .  The Agent shall determine each interest rate applicable to the Loans hereunder in accordance herewith, and its determination thereof shall be deemed   prima facie   correct. 
    Section 2.4.    Computation of Interest, Fees and Charges  .  All interest on Base Rate Loans when the Base Rate is not based on the LIBOR Quoted Rate shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, for the actual number of days elapsed.  All interest on Eurodollar Loans, Swing Loans bearing interest at the Quoted Rate, and Base Rate Loans based on the LIBOR Quoted Rate (and unless otherwise stated herein, all fees, charges and commissions due hereunder) shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days for the actual number of days elapsed, except for Eurodollar Loans denominated in Pounds Sterling which shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be. 
    Section 2.5.    Funding Indemnity  .  If any Lender shall incur any loss (other than loss of profits), cost or expense (including, without limitation, any loss, cost or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or re employment of deposits or other funds acquired by such Lender to fund or maintain any Eurodollar Loan or Swing Loan or the relending or reinvesting of such deposits or amounts paid or prepaid to such Lender) as a result of: 
  (i)    any payment or prepayment of a Eurodollar Loan or Swing Loan on a date other than the last day of its Interest Period for any reason, 
  
   -14- 

(ii)    any failure (because of a failure to meet the conditions of Borrowing or otherwise) by a Borrower to borrow or continue a Eurodollar Loan or Swing Loan, or to convert a Base Rate Loan into a Eurodollar Loan or such Swing Loan, in each case on the date specified in a notice given pursuant to this Agreement, 
  (iii)    any failure by a Borrower to make any payment of principal on any Eurodollar Loan or Swing Loan when due (whether by acceleration or otherwise), 
  (iv)    any acceleration of the maturity of a Eurodollar Loan or Swing Loan as a result of the occurrence of any Event of Default hereunder, or 
  (v)    any assignment of a Eurodollar Loan other than on the last of the Interest Period applicable thereto as a result of the request of the Company pursuant to Section 2.11 hereof; 
  then, upon the demand of such Lender, the applicable Borrower shall pay to such Lender such amount as will reimburse such Lender for such loss, cost or expense.  If any Lender makes such a claim for compensation, it shall provide to the Company, with a copy to the Agent, a certificate executed by an officer of such Lender setting forth the amount of such loss, cost or expense in reasonable detail (including an explanation of the basis for and the computation of such loss, cost or expense) and the amounts shown on such certificate shall be deemed   prima facie   correct. 
  Section 2.6.    Change of Law  .  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, if any Change in Law makes it unlawful for any Lender to make or continue to maintain Loans in an Alternative Currency or Eurodollar Loans or to perform its obligations with respect to such Loans, such Lender shall promptly give notice thereof to the Company and such Lender s obligations to make or maintain Eurodollar Loans or Loans in an Alternative Currency (as applicable) under this Agreement shall be suspended until it is no longer unlawful for such Lender to make or maintain such Loans.  The applicable Borrower shall prepay on demand the outstanding principal amount of any such affected Loans, together with all interest accrued thereon and all other amounts then due and payable to such Lender under this Agreement;   provided, however,   subject to all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the applicable Borrower may then elect to borrow the principal amount of the affected Loans (other than Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency) from such Lender by means of Base Rate Loans from such Lender, which Base Rate Loans shall not be made ratably by the Lenders but only from such affected Lender. 

-15- 

Section 2.7.    Unavailability  .  If prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for any Borrowing of Eurodollar Loans: 
  (a)    the Agent determines that deposits in the applicable currency (in the applicable amounts) are not being offered to it in the eurocurrency interbank market for such Interest Period, or that by reason of circumstances affecting the interbank eurocurrency market adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the applicable LIBOR, or 
  (b)    the Required Lenders notify the Agent that (i) LIBOR as determined by the Agent will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding their Eurodollar Loans in the currency in question for such Interest Period or (ii) that the making or funding of Eurodollar Loans in the relevant currency has become impracticable, in either case as a result of an event occurring after the date hereof which in the opinion of such Lenders materially adversely affects such Loans, 
  then and in any such event the Agent shall not less than two days prior to the commencement of such Interest Period, give notice thereof to the Company and the Lenders, whereupon until the Agent notifies the Company that the circumstances giving rise to such suspension no longer exist, the obligations of the Lenders to make Loans in the currency so affected or to make Eurodollar Loans (as applicable) shall be suspended. 
  Section 2.8.    Increased Cost  .      (a)      Increased Costs Generally.    If any Change in Law shall: 
  (i)    impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender (except any reserve requirement reflected in the Adjusted LIBOR) or any Issuer; 
  (ii)    subject any Recipient to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes, (B) Taxes described in clauses (b) through (d) of the definition of Excluded Taxes and (C) Connection Income Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, letters of credit, commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto; or 
  (iii)    impose on any Lender or any Issuer or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense (other than Taxes) affecting this Agreement or Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein; 
  and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender or such other Recipient of making, converting to, continuing or maintaining any Loan or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan, or to increase the cost to such Lender, such Issuer or such other Recipient of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit (or of maintaining its obligation to participate in or to issue any Letter of Credit), or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender, Issuer or other Recipient hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon request of such Lender, Issuer or other Recipient, the Borrower will pay to such Lender, Issuer or other Recipient, as the case may be, such  
  
   -16- 

additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender, Issuer or other Recipient, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered. 
  (b)      Capital Requirements.    If any Lender or Issuer reasonably determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or Issuer or any lending office of such Lender or such Lender s or Issuer s holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender s or Issuer s capital or on the capital of such Lender s or Issuer s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit or Swing Loans held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by any Issuer, to a level below that which such Lender or Issuer or such Lender s or Issuer s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender s or Issuer s policies and the policies of such Lender s or Issuer s holding company with respect to capital adequacy and liquidity), then from time to time the Borrowers will pay to such Lender or Issuer, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or Issuer or such Lender s or Issuer s holding company for any such reduction suffered. 
  (c)      Certificates for Reimbursement.    A certificate of a Lender or Issuer setting forth in reasonable detail the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or Issuer or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in subsection (a) or (b) of this Section and delivered to the Company, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  The Borrowers shall pay such Lender or Issuer, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within fifteen (15) days after receipt thereof. 
  (d)      Delay in Requests.    Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or Issuer to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender s or Issuer s right to demand such compensation;   provided   that the Borrowers shall not be required to compensate a Lender or Issuer pursuant to this Section 2.8 for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than six (6) months prior to the date that such Lender or Issuer, as the case may be, notifies the Company of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions, and of such Lender s or Issuer s intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the six month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof). 
    Section 2.9.    Lending Offices; Mitigation Obligations  .  Each Lender may, at its option, elect to make its Loans hereunder at the branch, office or affiliate specified in its Administrative Questionnaire (each a    Lending Office   ) for each type of Loan available hereunder or at such other of its branches, offices or affiliates as it may from time to time elect and designate in a written notice to the Company and the Agent (but such funds shall in any event be made available to the Company in accordance with Section 1.4(d) hereof);   provided   that the Company shall not be required to reimburse any Lender under any of the provisions of this Section 2 for any cost which such Lender would not have incurred but for changing its Lending Office unless the Company consented in writing to such change or has requested the change pursuant to this Section 2.9.  If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.8, requires the Borrowers to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender  
  
   -17- 

pursuant to Section 11.1, or gives a notice pursuant to Section 2.6, then such Lender shall (at the request of the Company) use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.8 or 11.1, as the case may be, in the future, or eliminate the need for notice pursuant to Section 2.6, and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender.  The Borrowers hereby agree to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.   
    Section 2.10.    Discretion of Lender as to Manner of Funding  .  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each Lender shall be entitled to fund and maintain its funding of all or any part of its Loans in any manner it sees fit, it being understood, however, that for the purposes of this Agreement all determinations under this Agreement shall be made as if each Lender had actually funded and maintained each Eurodollar Loan through the purchase of deposits in the relevant market and in the relevant currency having a maturity corresponding to such Eurodollar Loan s Interest Period and bearing an interest rate equal to Adjusted LIBOR for the currency in question for such Interest Period. 
    Section 2.11.    Replacement of Lenders.    If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.8, if any Borrower is required to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 11.1, or if any Borrower receives notice from any Lender of any illegality pursuant to Section 2.6 hereof for reasons not generally applicable to the other Lenders, and, in each case, such Lender has declined or is unable to designate a different lending office in accordance with Section 2.9, or if any Lender is a Defaulting Lender or a Non Consenting Lender, then the Borrowers may, at their sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in, and consents required by, Section 11.17), all of its interests, rights (other than its existing rights to payments pursuant to Section 2.8 or Section 11.1) and obligations under this Agreement and the related Loan Documents to an Eligible Assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment);   provided   that: 
  (i)    the Borrowers shall have paid to the Agent the assignment fee (if any) specified in Section 11.17; 
  (ii)    such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and funded participations in L/C Obligations, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (including any amounts under Section     2.5 as if the Loans owing to it were prepaid rather than assigned) from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrowers (in the case of all other amounts); 
  
   -18- 

(iii)    in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.8 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 11.1, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments thereafter; 
  (iv)    such assignment does not conflict with applicable law; and 
  (v)    in the case of any assignment resulting from a Lender becoming a Non Consenting Lender, the applicable assignee shall have consented to the applicable amendment, waiver or consent. 
  A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrowers to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply. 
  Section 2.12.    Defaulting Lenders  . (a)   Defaulting Lender Adjustments.    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then, until such time as such Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted by applicable law: 
  (i)      Waivers and Amendments  .  Such Defaulting Lender s right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent with respect to this Agreement shall be restricted as set forth in the definition of Required Lenders.  
  (ii)      Defaulting Lender Waterfall  . Any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts received by the Agent for the account of such Defaulting Lender (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to Section 8 or otherwise) or received by the Agent from a Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 11.27 hereto shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the Agent as follows:   first  , to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Agent hereunder;   second  , to the payment on a pro rata basis of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to any Issuer or the Swing Line Lender hereunder;   third  , to Cash Collateralize such Issuer s Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender in accordance with Section 2.13;   fourth  , as the Company may request (so long as no Default or Event of Default exists), to the funding of any Loan in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by the Agent;   fifth  , if so determined by the Agent and the Company, to be held in a deposit account and released pro rata in order to (x) satisfy such Defaulting Lender s potential future funding obligations with respect to Loans under this Agreement and (y) Cash Collateralize the Issuers  future Fronting Exposure with respect to such Defaulting Lender with respect to future Letters of Credit issued under this Agreement, in accordance with Section 2.13;   sixth  , to the payment of any amounts owing to the Lenders, the Issuers or the Swing Line Lender as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender, any Issuer or the Swing Line Lender against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender s breach of its obligations under this Agreement;   seventh  , so long as no Default or Event of Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to a Borrower as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by such Borrower against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender s breach of its obligations under this Agreement; and  
  
   -19- 

eighth  , to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction;   provided   that if (x) such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Loans or L/C Obligations in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share, and (y) such Loans were made or the related Letters of Credit were issued at a time when the conditions set forth in Section 6.1 were satisfied or waived, such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Loans of, and L/C Obligations owed to, all Non Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being applied to the payment of any Loans of, or L/C Obligations owed to, such Defaulting Lender until such time as all Loans and funded and unfunded participations in L/C Obligations and Swing Loans are held by the Lenders pro rata in accordance with their Percentages of the relevant Commitments without giving effect to Section 2.12(a)(iv) below. Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender or to post Cash Collateral pursuant to this Section 2.12(a)(ii) shall be deemed paid to and redirected by such Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto. 
  (iii)      Certain Fees  .  
  (A)    No Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive any commitment fee for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender (and the Borrowers shall not be required to pay any such fee that otherwise would have been required to have been paid to that Defaulting Lender). 
  (B)    Each Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to receive L/C Participation Fees for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender only to the extent allocable to its Percentage of the stated amount of Letters of Credit for which it has provided Cash Collateral pursuant to Section 2.13. 
  (C)    With respect to any     L/C Participation Fee not required to be paid to any Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (B) above, the Borrowers shall (x) pay to each Non Defaulting Lender that portion of any such fee otherwise payable to such Defaulting Lender with respect to such Defaulting Lender s participation in L/C Obligations or Swing Loans that has been reallocated to such Non Defaulting Lender pursuant to clause (iv) below, (y) pay to each Issuer and Swing Line Lender, as applicable, the amount of any such fee otherwise payable to such Defaulting Lender to the extent allocable to such Issuer s or Swing Line Lender s Fronting Exposure to such Defaulting Lender, and (z) not be required to pay the remaining amount of any such fee.

(iv)      Reallocation of Participations to Reduce Fronting Exposure  .  All or any part of such Defaulting Lender s participation in L/C Obligations and Swing Loans shall be reallocated among the Non Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Percentages of the relevant Commitments (calculated without regard to such Defaulting Lender s Commitments) but only to the extent that (x) the conditions set forth in Section 6.1 are satisfied at the time of such reallocation (and, unless the Borrowers shall have otherwise notified the Agent at such time, the Borrowers shall be deemed to have represented and warranted that such conditions are satisfied at such time), and (y) such reallocation does not cause the aggregate Revolving Loans and interests in L/C Obligations and Swing Loans of any Non Defaulting Lender to exceed such Non Defaulting Lender s Aggregate Revolving Commitment.  Subject to Section 11.31 hereof, no reallocation hereunder shall constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder against a Defaulting Lender arising from that Lender having become a Defaulting Lender, including any claim of a Non Defaulting Lender as a result of such Non Defaulting Lender s increased exposure following such reallocation. 
  (v)      Cash Collateral; Repayment of Swing Loans  .  If the reallocation described in clause (iv) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Borrowers shall, without prejudice to any right or remedy available to them hereunder or under law, (x) first, prepay Swing Loans in an amount equal to the Swing Line Lender s Fronting Exposure and (y) second, Cash Collateralize the Applicable Issuer s Fronting Exposure in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.13. 
  (b)      Defaulting Lender Cure  .  If the Company, the Agent, the Swing Line Lender and each Issuer agree in writing that a Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, the Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject to any conditions set forth therein (which may include arrangements with respect to any Cash Collateral), that Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase at par that portion of outstanding Loans of the other Lenders or take such other actions as the Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Loans and funded and unfunded participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Loans to be held pro rata by the Lenders in accordance with their respective Percentages of the relevant Commitments (without giving effect to Section 2.12(a)(iv)), whereupon such Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender;   provided   that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrower while that Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and   provided  ,   further  , that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lender s having been a Defaulting Lender. 
  (c)      New Swing Loans/Letters of Credit  .  So long as any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, (i) the Swing Line Lender shall not be required to fund any Swing Loans unless it is satisfied that it will have no Fronting Exposure after giving effect to such Swing Loan and (ii) no Issuer shall be required to issue, extend, renew or increase any Letter of Credit unless it is satisfied that it will have no Fronting Exposure after giving effect thereto.

  (a)      Grant of Security Interest  .  The Borrowers, and to the extent provided by any Defaulting Lender, such Defaulting Lender, hereby grant to the Agent, for the benefit of the Issuers, and agree to maintain, a first priority security interest in all such Cash Collateral as security for such Defaulting Lender s obligation to fund participations in respect of L/C Obligations, to be applied pursuant to clause (b) below.  If at any time the Agent determines that Cash Collateral is subject to any right or claim of any Person other than the Agent and the Issuers as herein provided, or that the total amount of such Cash Collateral is less than 105% of the Fronting Exposure, the Borrowers shall, promptly upon demand by the Agent, pay or provide to the Agent additional Cash Collateral in an amount sufficient to eliminate such deficiency (after giving effect to any Cash Collateral provided by the Defaulting Lender). 
  (b)      Application  .  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Cash Collateral provided under this Section 2.13 or Section 2.12 in respect of Letters of Credit shall be applied to the satisfaction of the Defaulting Lender s obligation to fund participations in respect of L/C Obligations (including, as to Cash Collateral provided by a Defaulting Lender, any interest accrued on such obligation) for which the Cash Collateral was so provided, prior to any other application of such property as may otherwise be provided for herein. 
  (c)      Termination of Requirement  .  Cash Collateral (or the appropriate portion thereof) provided to reduce any Issuer s Fronting Exposure shall no longer be required to be held as Cash Collateral pursuant to this Section 2.13(c) following (i) the elimination of the applicable Fronting Exposure (including by the termination of Defaulting Lender status of the applicable Lender), or (ii) the determination by the Agent and each Issuer that there exists excess Cash Collateral;   provided   that, subject to Section 2.13, the Person providing Cash Collateral and each Issuer may agree that Cash Collateral shall be held to support future anticipated Fronting Exposure or other obligations; and   provided further   that to the extent that such Cash Collateral was provided by any Borrower or Guarantor, such Cash Collateral shall remain subject to the security interest granted pursuant to the Loan Documents.

The Borrowers shall, on each date the Multicurrency Commitments are reduced pursuant to Section 3.6, prepay the Multicurrency Revolving Loans by the amount, if any, necessary to reduce the sum of the aggregate principal amount of Multicurrency Revolving Loans then outstanding to the amount to which the Multicurrency Commitments have been so reduced.

No amount of the Term Loans paid or prepaid may be reborrowed, and, in the case of any partial prepayment, such prepayment shall be applied to the remaining payments on the Term Loans on a ratable basis among all such remaining amortization payments based on the principal amounts thereof. 
    Section 3.6.    Commitment Terminations  .   
  (a)      Voluntary Terminations.    The Borrowers shall have the right at any time and from time to time, upon five (5) Business Days prior written notice to the Agent (or such shorter period of time agreed to by the Agent), to terminate the Aggregate Revolving Commitments without premium or penalty and in whole or in part, any partial termination to be in an amount not less than $5,000,000, provided that the Aggregate Revolving Commitments may not be reduced to an amount less than the sum of the Revolving Credit Exposure for all Lenders then outstanding.  Any termination of the Aggregate Revolving Commitments below any Sublimit then in effect shall reduce such Sublimit by a like amount.  The Agent shall give prompt notice to each Lender of any such termination of the Aggregate Revolving Commitments.

Unless the Agent shall have received notice from the Company prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Agent for the account of the Lenders or the Issuers hereunder that the applicable Borrower will not make such payment, the Agent may assume that such Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders or the Issuers, as the case may be, the amount due.  In such event, if such Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the Issuers, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or Issuer, with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Agent, at a rate per annum equal to:  (i) from the date the distribution was made to the date two (2) Business Days after payment by such Lender is due hereunder, at the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation for each such day and (ii) from the date two (2) Business Days after the date such payment is due from such Lender to the date such payment is made by such Lender, the Base Rate in effect for each such day.

  (a)    first, to the payment of any outstanding reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the Agent in monitoring, verifying, protecting, preserving or enforcing the Liens on the Collateral, if any, or by the Agent in protecting, preserving or enforcing rights under the Loan Documents, and in any event all costs and expenses of a character which the Borrowers have agreed to pay under Section 11.5 hereof (such funds to be retained by the Agent for its own account unless the Agent has previously been reimbursed for such costs and expenses by the Lenders, in which event such  
  
   -25- 

amounts shall be remitted to the Lenders to reimburse them for payments theretofore made to the Agent); 
  (b)    second, to the payment of principal and interest on the Swing Loans until paid in full; 
  (c)    third, to the payment of any outstanding interest or other fees or amounts due under the Loan Documents, in each case other than for principal or in reimbursement or Cash Collateralization of L/C Obligations, ratably as among the Agent and the Lenders in accordance with the amount of such interest and other fees or amounts owing each; 
  (d)    fourth, to the payment of the principal of the Loans and any unpaid Reimbursement Obligations and to the Agent to be held as Cash Collateral for any other L/C Obligations (until the Agent is holding an amount of cash equal to the then outstanding amount of all such L/C Obligations), for any principal amounts owing to the Lenders under Section 11.20 hereof, and Hedging Liability, the aggregate amount paid to or held as Cash Collateral for the Lenders and, in the case of Hedging Liability, their Affiliates, to be allocated pro rata in accordance with the then aggregate unpaid amounts owing to each holder thereof; 
  (e)    fifth, to the Agent and the Lenders ratably in accordance with the amounts of any other indebtedness, obligations or liabilities of the Borrowers owing to each of them unless and until all such indebtedness, obligations and liabilities have been fully paid and satisfied; and 
  (f)    sixth, to the Company on behalf of the Borrowers (each Borrower hereby agreeing that its recourse for its share of such payment shall be to the Company and not the Agent or any Lender) or whoever else may be lawfully entitled thereto. 
  Excluded Swap Obligations with respect to any Guarantor shall not be paid with amounts received from such Guarantor or its assets, but appropriate adjustments shall be made with respect to payments from the Borrowers and the other Guarantors to preserve the allocations to the Obligations and Hedging Liability otherwise set forth above in this Section 3.7. 
    Section 3.8.    Evidence of Indebtedness  .  (a) Each Lender shall maintain in accordance with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrowers to such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender from time to time, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder. 
  (b)    The Agent shall also maintain accounts in which it will record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the type thereof, the Interest Period with respect thereto, and the currency in which such Loan is denominated, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrowers to each Lender hereunder, and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Agent hereunder from the Borrowers and each Lender s share thereof. 
  
   -26- 

(c)    Subject to the provisions of Section 11.17(c), the entries maintained in the accounts maintained pursuant to paragraphs (a) and (b) above shall be   prima facie   evidence of the existence and amounts of the Obligations therein recorded;   provided, however,   that the failure of the Agent or any Lender to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrowers to repay the Obligations in accordance with their terms. 
  (d)    Any Lender may request that its Loans be evidenced by a promissory note or notes in the forms of Exhibit A 1 (in the case of its Term Loans and referred to herein as a    Term Note   ), A 2 (in the case of its Revolving Loans and referred to herein as a    Revolving Credit Note   ), or A 3 (in the case of its Swing Loans and referred to herein as a    Swing Note   ), as applicable (the Term Notes, Revolving Credit Notes and Swing Note being hereinafter referred to collectively as the    Notes    and individually as a    Note   ).  In such event, the Borrowers shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a Note payable to such Lender or its registered assigns in the amount of the Term Loan Commitment, Aggregate Revolving Commitment or Swing Line Sublimit, as applicable.  Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such Note or Notes and interest thereon shall at all times (including after any assignment pursuant to Section 11.17) be represented by one or more Notes payable to the payee named therein or any assignee pursuant to Section 11.17, except to the extent that any such Lender or assignee subsequently returns any such Note for cancellation and requests that such Loans once again be evidenced as described in subsections (a) and (b) above. 
    Section 3.9.    Payments Set Aside  . To the extent that any payment by or on behalf of any Borrower or Guarantor is made to the Agent, any Issuer or any Lender, or the Agent, any Issuer or any Lender exercises its right of setoff, and such payment or the proceeds of such setoff or any part thereof is subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by the Agent, such Issuer or such Lender in its discretion) to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party, in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or otherwise, then (a) to the extent of such recovery, the obligation or part thereof originally intended to be satisfied shall be revived and continued in full force and effect as if such payment had not been made or such setoff had not occurred, and (b) each Lender and each Issuer severally agrees to pay to the Agent upon demand its applicable share (without duplication) of any amount so recovered from or repaid by the Agent, plus interest thereon from the date of such demand to the date such payment is made at a rate per annum equal to the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation for each such day.

  (b)    Neither the Agent nor any of its Related Parties shall be liable for any action taken or not taken by the Agent under or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby  (i) with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, or as the Agent shall believe in good faith shall be necessary, under the circumstances as provided in Sections 3.7 (with respect to application of proceeds), 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, and 11.4), or (ii) in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment.  Any such action taken or failure to act pursuant to the foregoing shall be binding on all Lenders.  The Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default or Event of Default unless and until notice describing such Default or Event of Default is given to the Agent in writing by a Borrower, a Lender, or an Issuer. 
  (c)    Neither the Agent nor any of its Related Parties shall be responsible for or have any duty or obligation to any Lender or Issuer or participant or any other Person to ascertain or inquire into (i) any

  Section 10.4.    Reliance by Agent      .  The Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall be fully protected in relying and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice, request, certificate, communication, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing (including any electronic message, Internet or intranet website posting or other distribution) believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed, sent or otherwise authenticated by the proper Person.  The Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by telephone and believed by it to have been made by the proper Person, and shall be fully protected in relying and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon.  In determining compliance with any condition hereunder to the making of a Loan, or the issuance, extension, renewal or increase of a Letter of Credit, that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction of a Lender or an Issuer, the Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender or Issuer unless the Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender or Issuer prior to the making of such Loan or the issuance of such Letter of Credit.  The Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Borrowers), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.

If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within thirty (30) days after the retiring Agent gives notice of its resignation  
  
   -87- 

(or such earlier day as shall be agreed by the Required Lenders) (the    Resignation Effective Date   ), then the retiring Agent may (but shall not be obligated to), on behalf of the Lenders and the Issuers, appoint a successor Agent meeting the qualifications set forth above.  Whether or not a successor has been appointed, such resignation shall become effective in accordance with such notice on the Resignation Effective Date. 
  (b)    With effect from the Resignation Effective Date, (i) the retiring Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, and (ii) except for any indemnity payments owed to the retiring or removed Agent, all payments, communications and determinations provided to be made by, to or through the Agent shall instead be made by or to each Lender and Issuer directly, until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders appoint a successor Agent as provided for above.      If on the Resignation Effective Date no successor has been appointed and accepted such appointment, the Agent s rights in the Collateral Documents shall be assigned without representation, recourse or warranty to the Lenders and Issuer as their interests may appear.  Upon the acceptance of a successor s appointment as Agent hereunder, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Agent (other than any rights to indemnity payments or other amounts owed to the retiring Agent), and the retiring Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents.  The fees payable by the Borrowers to a successor Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Company and such successor.  After the retiring Agent s resignation hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the provisions of this Section 10 and Section 11.5 shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring Agent, its sub agents and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while the retiring Agent was acting as Agent. 
  Section 10.7.    Non Reliance on Agent and Other Lenders  .  Each Lender and Issuer acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement.  Each Lender and Issuer also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Agent or any other Lender or any of their Related Parties and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder. 
    Section 10.8.    Issuers and Swing Line Lender.        Each Issuer shall act on behalf of the Lenders with respect to any Letters of Credit issued by it and the documents associated therewith, and the Swing Line Lender shall act on behalf of the Lenders with respect to the Swing Loans made hereunder.  The Issuers and the Swing Line Lender shall each have all of the benefits and immunities (i) provided to the Agent in this Section 10 with respect to any acts taken or omissions suffered by such Issuer in connection with Letters of Credit issued by it or proposed to be issued by it and the Applications pertaining to such Letters of Credit or by the Swing Line Lender in connection with Swing Loans made or to be made hereunder as fully as if the term  Agent , as used in this Section 10, included the Issuers and the Swing Line Lender with respect to such acts or omissions and (ii) as additionally provided in this Agreement with respect to such Issuer or Swing Line Lender, as applicable.  Any resignation by the Person then acting as Agent pursuant to Section 10.6  
  
   -88- 

shall also constitute its resignation or the resignation of its Affiliate as Issuer and Swing Line Lender except as it may otherwise agree.  If such Person then acting as an Issuer so resigns, it shall retain all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of an Issuer hereunder with respect to all Letters of Credit outstanding that have been issued by such Issuer as of the effective date of its resignation as Issuer and all L/C Obligations with respect thereto, including the right to require the Lenders to make Loans or fund risk participations in Reimbursement Obligations pursuant to Section 1.8.

Upon the appointment by the Company of a successor Issuer or Swing Line Lender hereunder (which successor shall in all cases be a Lender other than a Defaulting Lender), (i) such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Issuer or Swing Line Lender, as applicable (other than any rights to indemnity payments or other amounts that remain owing to the retiring Issuer or Swing Line Lender), and (ii) the retiring Issuer and Swing Line Lender shall be discharged from all of their respective duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents other than with respect to its outstanding Letters of Credit and Swing Loans, and (iii) upon the request of the resigning Issuer, the successor Issuer shall issue letters of credit in substitution for the Letters of Credit, if any, outstanding at the time of such succession or make other arrangements satisfactory to the resigning Issuer to effectively assume the obligations of the resigning Issuer with respect to such Letters of Credit. 
    Section 10.9.    Hedging Liability      .  By virtue of a Lender s execution of this Agreement or an Assignment and Acceptance pursuant to Section 11.17, as the case may be, any Affiliate of such Lender with whom any Borrower or any Subsidiary has entered into an agreement creating Hedging Liability shall be deemed a Lender party hereto for purposes of any reference in a Loan Document to the parties for whom the Agent is acting, it being understood and agreed that the rights and benefits of such Affiliate under the Loan Documents consist exclusively of such Affiliate s right to share in payments and collections out of the Collateral and the Guaranty Agreements as more fully set forth in Section 3.7.  In connection with any such distribution of payments and collections, or any request for the release of the Guaranty Agreements and the Agent s Liens in connection with the termination of the Commitments and the payment in full of the Obligations, the Agent shall be entitled to assume no amounts are due to any Lender or its Affiliate with respect to Hedging Liability unless such Lender has notified the Agent in writing of the amount of any such liability owed to it or its Affiliate prior to such distribution or payment or release of the Guaranty Agreements     and Liens. 
    Section 10.10.    Designation of Additional Agents  .

The Agent is hereby irrevocably authorized by each of the Lenders and the Issuers to execute and deliver the Collateral Documents on behalf of each of the Lenders, the Issuers, and their Affiliates and to take such action and exercise such powers under the Collateral Documents as the Agent considers appropriate;   provided   that subject to the last paragraph of Section 11.4, the Agent shall not amend the Collateral Documents unless such amendment is agreed to in writing by the Required Lenders.  Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, the Agent shall take such action to enforce its Lien on the Collateral and to preserve and protect the Collateral as may be directed by the Required Lenders.  Unless and until the Required Lenders give such direction, the Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take or refrain from taking such actions as it deems appropriate and in the best interest of all the Lenders and Issuers.  Each Lender and Issuer acknowledges and agrees that it will be bound by the terms and conditions of the Collateral Documents upon the execution and delivery thereof by the Agent.  The Agent shall not be responsible for or have a duty to ascertain or inquire into any representation or warranty regarding the existence, value or collectability of the Collateral, the existence, priority or perfection of the Agent s Lien thereon, or any certificate prepared by any Borrower or Restricted Subsidiary in connection therewith, nor shall the Agent be responsible or liable to the Lenders, the Issuers or their Affiliates for any failure to monitor or maintain any portion of the Collateral.  The Lenders and Issuers hereby irrevocably authorize (and each of their Affiliates holding any Hedging Liability entitled to the benefits of the Collateral shall be deemed to authorize) the Agent, based upon the instruction of the Required Lenders, to credit bid and purchase (either directly or through one or more acquisition vehicles) all or any portion of the Collateral at any sale thereof conducted by the Agent (or any security trustee therefore) under the provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code, including pursuant to Sections 9 610 or 9 620 of the Uniform Commercial Code, at any sale thereof conducted under the provisions of the United States Bankruptcy Code, including Section 363 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, or at any sale or foreclosure conducted by the Agent or any security trustee therefore (whether by judicial action or otherwise) in accordance with applicable law.  Except as otherwise specifically provided for herein, no Lender, Issuer, or their Affiliates, other than the Agent, shall have the right to institute any suit, action or proceeding in equity or at law for the foreclosure or other realization upon any Collateral or for the execution of any trust or power in respect of the Collateral or for the appointment of a receiver or for the enforcement of any other remedy under the Collateral Documents; it being understood and intended that no one or more of the Lenders or Issuers or their Affiliates shall have any right in any manner whatsoever to affect, disturb or prejudice the Lien of the Agent (or any security trustee therefor) under the Collateral Documents by its or their action or to enforce any right thereunder, and that all proceedings at law or in equity shall be instituted, had, and maintained by the Agent (or its security trustee) in the manner provided for in the relevant Collateral Documents for the benefit of the Lenders, the Issuers, and their Affiliates.  Each Lender and Issuer is hereby appointed agent for the purpose of perfecting the Agent s security interest in assets which, in accordance with Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code or other applicable law can be perfected only by possession.  Should any Lender or Issuer (other than the Agent) obtain possession of any Collateral, such Lender or Issuer shall notify the Agent thereof, and, promptly upon the Agent s request therefor shall deliver such Collateral to the Agent or in accordance with the Agent s instructions.

Upon the Agent s request, the Required Lenders will confirm in writing the Agent s authority to release or subordinate its interest in particular types or items of Property or to release any Person form its obligations as a Guarantor under the Loan Documents. 
    Section 10.13.    Authorization of Agent to File Proofs of Claim.    In case of the pendency of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law or any other judicial proceeding relative to any Borrower or Material Restricted Subsidiary, the Agent (irrespective of whether the principal of any Loan or L/C Obligation shall then be due and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Agent shall have made any demand on the Borrower) shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise: 
  (a)    to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans, L/C Obligations and all other Obligations that are owing and unpaid and to file such other documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of Lenders, the Issuers and the Agent (including any claim for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Lenders, the Issuers and the Agent and their respective agents and counsel and all other amounts due the Lenders, the Issuers and the Agent under the Loan Documents including, but not limited to, Sections 2.5, 2.8, 3.1, 3.3, and 11.5) allowed in such judicial proceeding; and 
  (b)    to collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same; 
  
   -91- 

and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Lender and Issuer to make such payments to the Agent and, in the event that the Agent shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Lenders and the Issuers, to pay to the Agent any amount due for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Agent and its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Agent under Sections 3.1, 3.3 and 11.5.  Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the Agent to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Lender or Issuer any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Obligations or the rights of any Lender or Issuer or to authorize the Agent to vote in respect of the claim of any Lender or Issuer in any such proceeding.

  (b)      Payments Free of Taxes.    Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any Borrower or Guarantor under any Loan Document shall be made without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by applicable law.  If any applicable law (as determined in the good faith discretion of an applicable Withholding Agent) requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment by a Withholding Agent, then the applicable Withholding Agent shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding and shall timely pay the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law and, if such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, then the sum payable by the applicable Borrower or Guarantor shall be increased as necessary so that after such deduction or withholding has been made (including such deductions and withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the applicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made. 
  (c)      Payment of Other Taxes by the Borrowers and Guarantors.    The Borrowers and Guarantors shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law, or at the option of the Agent timely reimburse it for the payment of, any Other Taxes. 
  (d)      Indemnification by the Borrowers and Guarantors.    The Borrowers and Guarantors shall jointly and severally indemnify each Recipient, within ten (10) days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) payable or paid by such Recipient or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to such Recipient and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.  A certificate setting forth in reasonable detail a description of such Indemnified Taxes and the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Company by a Lender (with a copy to the Agent), or by the Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 
  
   -92- 

(e)      Indemnification by the Lenders.    Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Agent, within ten (10) days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that any Borrower or Guarantor has not already indemnified the Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Borrowers and Guarantors to do so), (ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender s failure to comply with the provisions of Section 11.16 relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.  A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  Each Lender hereby authorizes the Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Loan Document or otherwise payable by the Agent to the Lender from any other source against any amount due to the Agent under this subsection (e). 
  (f)      Evidence of Payments.    As soon as practicable after any payment of Taxes by any Borrower or Guarantor to a Governmental Authority pursuant to this Section, such Borrower or Guarantor shall deliver to the Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Agent.

In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Company or the Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Company or the Agent as will enable the Company or the Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Section 11.1(g)(ii)(A), (ii)(B) and (ii)(D) below) shall not be required if in the Lender s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender, (it being understood that providing any information currently required by any U.S. federal income tax withholding form shall not be considered prejudicial to the position of a Lender). 
  (ii)    Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, 
  (A)    any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Company and the Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Company or the Agent), executed originals of IRS Form W 9 (or successor form) certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup

in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Company or the Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and 
  (D)    if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Company and the Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Company or the Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Company or the Agent as may be necessary for the Company and the Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment.  Solely for purposes of this clause (D),    FATCA    shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement. 
  Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so. 
  (h)      Treatment of Certain Refunds.    If any party determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified pursuant to this Section (including by the payment of additional amounts pursuant to this Section), it shall pay to the indemnifying party an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made under this Section with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out of pocket expenses (including Taxes) of such indemnified party and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund).  Such indemnifying party, upon the request of such indemnified party, shall repay to such indemnified party the amount paid over pursuant to this subsection (h) (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) in the event that such indemnified party is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this subsection (h), in no event will the indemnified party be required to pay any amount to an indemnifying party pursuant to this subsection (h) the payment of which would place the indemnified party in a less favorable net after Tax position than the indemnified party would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts giving rise to such refund had never been paid.  This subsection shall not be construed to require any indemnified party to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the indemnifying party or any other Person.

  (j)      Survival.

   -102- 

Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitments and/or the Loans owing to it);   provided   that (i) such Lender s obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations, and (iii) the Borrowers, the Agent, the Issuers and Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender s rights and obligations under this Agreement.  For the avoidance of doubt, each Lender shall be responsible for the indemnity under Section 10.8 with respect to any payments made by such Lender to its Participant(s). 
  Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement;   provided   that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment, modification or waiver that would reduce the amount of or postpone any fixed date for payment of any Obligation in which such participant has an interest.  The Company agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.5, 2.8, and 11.1 (subject to the requirements and limitations therein, including the requirements under Section 11.1(g) (it being understood that the documentation required under Section 11.1(g) shall be delivered to the participating Lender)) to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to Section 11.17(b);   provided   that such Participant (A) agrees to be subject to the provisions of Sections 1.1, 1.8 and 2.9 as if it were an assignee under Section 11.7(b); and (B) shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Sections 11.1     or 2.8, with respect to any participation, than its participating Lender would have been entitled to receive, except, in the case of a Participant to which the Company has consented, to the extent such entitlement to receive a greater payment results from a Change in Law that occurs after the Participant acquired the applicable participation.  Each Lender that sells a participation agrees, at the Company s request and expense, to use reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Company to effectuate the provisions of Section 2.11 with respect to any Participant.  To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 11.27 (Right of Setoff) as though it were a Lender; provided that such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 11.26 (Sharing of Payments by Lenders) as though it were a Lender.  Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the Borrowers (but subject to Section 11.30 hereof), maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant s interest in the Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the    Participant Register   );   provided   that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant s interest in any commitments, loans, letters of credit or its other obligations under any Loan Document) to any Person except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such commitment, loan, letter of credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103 1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations or as otherwise required under applicable law.  The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Agent (in its capacity as Agent) shall have no responsibility for maintaining a Participant Register.

In connection with any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder, no such assignment shall be effective unless and until, in addition to the other conditions thereto set forth herein, the parties to the assignment shall make such additional payments to the Agent in an aggregate amount sufficient, upon distribution thereof as appropriate (which may be outright payment, purchases by the assignee of participations or subparticipations, or other compensating actions, including funding, with the consent of the Company and the Agent, the applicable pro rata share of Loans previously requested but not funded by the Defaulting Lender, to each of which the applicable assignee and assignor hereby irrevocably consent), to (x) pay and satisfy in full all payment liabilities then owed by such Defaulting Lender to the Agent, each Issuer, the Swing Line Lender and each other Lender hereunder (and interest accrued thereon), and (y) acquire (and fund as appropriate) its full pro rata share of all Loans and participations in Letters of Credit and Swing Loans in accordance with its Percentage.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder shall become effective under applicable law without compliance with the provisions of this paragraph, then the assignee of such interest shall be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender for all purposes of this Agreement until such compliance occurs.

Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this paragraph shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with Section 11.16. 
  (c)      Register.    The Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the Borrowers, shall maintain at one of its offices in Chicago, Illinois a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amounts (and stated interest) of the Loans owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the    Register   ).  The entries in the Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and the Borrowers, the Agent and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement.  The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrowers and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.

    Section 11.18.    Terms of Collateral Documents not Superseded  .  Subject to Section 10.7 hereof, nothing contained herein shall be deemed or construed to permit any act or omission which is prohibited by the terms of any Collateral Document, the covenants and agreements contained herein being in addition to and not in substitution for the covenants and agreements contained in the Collateral Documents.

   -107- 

(c)      Jury Trial Waiver.  The Borrowers, the Agent, and each Lender hereby irrevocably waives any and all right to trial by jury in any legal proceeding arising out of or relating to any Loan Document or the transactions contemplated thereby. 
    Section 11.20.    Currency.    Each reference in this Agreement to U.S. Dollars or to an Alternative Currency (the    relevant currency   ) is of the essence.  To the fullest extent permitted by law, the obligation of each Borrower in respect of any amount due in the relevant currency under this Agreement or any Loan Document shall, notwithstanding any payment in any other currency (whether pursuant to a judgment or otherwise), be discharged only to the extent of the amount in the relevant currency that the Agent, Issuer or Lender entitled to receive such payment may, in accordance with normal banking procedures, purchase with the sum paid in such other currency (after any premium and costs of exchange) on the Business Day immediately following the day on which such party receives such payment.  If the amount in the relevant currency so purchased for any reason falls short of the amount originally due in the relevant currency, the Borrowers shall pay such additional amounts, in the relevant currency, as may be necessary to compensate for the shortfall.  Any obligations of the Borrowers not discharged by such payment shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, be due as a separate and independent obligation and, until discharged as provided herein, shall continue in full force and effect. 
    Section 11.21.    Currency Equivalence.    If for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court it is necessary to convert a sum due from any Borrower on the Obligations in the currency expressed to be payable herein or in an Application or under any other Loan Documents (the    specified currency   ) into another currency, the parties agree that the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the Agent could purchase the specified currency with such other currency on the Business Day preceding that on which final judgment is given.  The obligation of each Borrower in respect of any such sum due to the Agent, any Issuer or any Lender on the Obligations shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency other than the specified currency, be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by the Agent, such Issuer or such Lender, as applicable, of any sum adjudged to be so due in such other currency, the Agent, such Issuers or such Lender, as applicable, may in accordance with normal banking procedures purchase the specified currency with such other currency.  If the amount of the specified currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to the Agent, such Issuers or such Lender in the specified currency, the Borrowers agree, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify the Agent, such Issuers or such Lender, as the case may be, against such loss, and if the amount of the specified currency so purchased exceeds the amount originally due to the Agent, such Issuer or such Lender in the specified currency, the Agent, such Issuer or such Lender, as the case may be, agrees to remit such excess to the Borrowers. 
    Section 11.22.    Change in Currency.    (a) If more than one currency or currency unit are at the same time recognized by the central bank of any country as the lawful currency of that country, (i) any reference in any Loan Documents to, and any obligations arising under any Loan Documents in, the currency of that country shall be translated into, and paid in, the currency or currency unit designated by the Agent, after consultation with the Borrowers and the Lenders and (ii) any translation from one currency or currency unit to another shall be at the official rate of exchange recognized by the central bank of that country for the  
  
   -108- 

conversion of that currency or currency unit into the other, rounded up or down by the Agent, acting reasonably. 
  (b)    If a change in any currency of a country occurs, the Loan Documents will, to the extent the Agent (acting reasonably) specifies is necessary, be amended to comply with any generally accepted conventions and market practice in any relevant interbank market and otherwise to reflect the change in currency and, if there is no generally accepted convention or market practice, or the Agent considers, in its absolute discretion, that there is no generally accepted convention or market practice, in such manner and to such extent as the Agent specifies.  The Agent will notify the other parties to the relevant Loan Documents of any such amendment, which shall be binding on all the parties to that Loan Document. 
  (c)    The Borrowers shall, from time to time immediately on demand by the Agent, pay to the Agent for the account of any Lender the amount of any costs or increased costs incurred by, or of any reduction in any amount payable to or in the effective return on its capital pursuant to, or of interest or other return foregone by, such Lender or any holding company of such Lender as a result of any change in the currency of a country. 
    Section 11.23.    Interest Rate Limitation  .  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if at any time the interest rate applicable to any Loan to any Borrower, together with all fees, charges and other amounts which are treated as interest on such Loan under applicable law (collectively, the    Charges   ), shall exceed the maximum lawful rate permitted by applicable law (the    Maximum Rate   ) which may be contracted for, charged, taken, received or reserved by any one or more of the Lenders holding such Loan in accordance with applicable law, the rate of interest payable in respect of such Loan hereunder, together with all Charges payable in respect thereof, shall be limited to the Maximum Rate and, to the extent lawful, the interest and Charges that would have been payable with respect to such Loan but were not payable as a result of the operation of this Section 11.23 shall be cumulated and the interest and Charges payable to such Lender or Lenders in respect of other Loans shall be increased (but not above the Maximum Rate therefor) until such cumulated amount, together with interest thereon at the rate set out herein, to the date of repayment, shall be have been received by such Lender or Lenders. 
  Section 11.24.    USA Patriot Act  .  Each Lender and Issuer that is subject to the requirements of the USA Patriot Act hereby notifies the Borrowers that pursuant to the requirements of such Act, it is required to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies the Borrowers, which information includes the name and address of the Borrowers and other information that will allow such Lender or Issuer to identify the Borrowers in accordance with the USA Patriot Act. 
    Section 11.25.     Confidentiality  .  Each of the Agent, the Lenders and the Issuers severally agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), except that Information may be disclosed (a) to its and its Affiliates  directors, officers, employees and agents, including accountants, legal counsel and other advisors to the extent any such Person has a need to know such Information (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will first be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential), (b) to the extent requested by any  
  
   -109- 

regulatory authority (including any self regulatory authority, such as the National Association of Insurance Commissioners), (c) to the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process, (d) to any other party hereto, (e) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or under any other Loan Document or any suit, action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or the enforcement of rights hereunder or thereunder, (f) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the same as those of this Section, to (A) any assignee of or participant in, or any prospective assignee of or participant in, any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement;   provided, however,   that under no circumstances shall Information be disclosed to a participant or prospective participant whose primary business is in direct competition with the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries or (B) any actual or prospective counterparty (or its advisors) to any swap or derivative transaction relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiary and its obligations, (g) with the prior written consent of the Company, (h) to the extent such Information (A) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this Section or (B) becomes available to the Agent, any Lender or Issuer on a non confidential basis from a source other than the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their directors, officers, employees or agents, including accountants, legal counsel and other advisors, (i) with the prior consent of the Company, to rating agencies if requested or required by such agencies in connection with a rating relating to the Loans, Aggregate Revolving Commitments, or Term Loan Commitments hereunder, or (j) to entities which compile and publish information about the syndicated loan market,   provided   that only basic information about the pricing and structure of the transaction evidenced hereby may be disclosed pursuant to this subsection (j).  For purposes of this Section,    Information    means all information received from any Borrower or any Subsidiary or from any other Person on behalf of the Borrowers or Subsidiaries relating to any Borrower or Subsidiary or any of their respective businesses, other than any such information that is available to the Agent, any Lender or Issuer on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by any Borrower or Subsidiary or from any other Person on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. 
    Section 11.26.    Sharing of Set Off.    If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Loans or other obligations hereunder resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of its Loans and accrued interest thereon or other such obligations greater than its pro rata share thereof as provided herein, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall (a) notify the Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans and such other obligations of the other Lenders, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans and other amounts owing them;   provided   that: 
  (a)    if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest; and 
  (b)    the provisions of this Section shall not be construed to apply to (x) any payment made by the Borrowers pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement (including the application of funds arising from the existence of a Defaulting Lender), or (y) any  
  
   -110- 

payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans or participations in Obligations to any assignee or participant, other than to any Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary thereof (as to which the provisions of this Section shall apply). 
  Each Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against each Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of each Borrower and Restricted Subsidiary in the amount of such participation. 
  Section 11.27.    Set off   .  In addition to any rights now or hereafter granted under the Loan Documents or applicable law and not by way of limitation of any such rights, if an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each Lender, each Issuer, and each of their respective Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final, in whatever currency) at any time held, and other obligations (in whatever currency) at any time owing, by such Lender, such Issuer or any such Affiliate, to or for the credit or the account of the Borrowers or any other Restricted Subsidiary against any and all of the obligations of the Borrowers or such Restricted Subsidiary now or hereafter existing under this Agreement or any other Loan Document to such Lender or such Issuer or their respective Affiliates, irrespective of whether or not such Lender, Issuer or Affiliate shall have made any demand under this Agreement or any other Loan Document and although such obligations of the Borrowers or such Restricted Subsidiary may be contingent or unmatured or are owed to a branch, office or Affiliate of such Lender or such Issuer different from the branch, office or Affiliate holding such deposit or obligated on such indebtedness;   provided   that in the event that any Defaulting Lender shall exercise any such right of setoff, (x) all amounts so set off shall be paid over immediately to the Agent for further application in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.12 and, pending such payment, shall be segregated by such Defaulting Lender from its other funds and deemed held in trust for the benefit of the Agent, the Issuers, and the Lenders, and (y) the Defaulting Lender shall provide promptly to the Agent a statement describing in reasonable detail the Obligations owing to such Defaulting Lender as to which it exercised such right of setoff.  The rights of each Lender, each Issuer and their respective Affiliates under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) that such Lender, such Issuer or their respective Affiliates may have.  Each Lender and Issuer agrees to notify the Company and the Agent promptly after any such setoff and application;   provided   that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application. 
  Section 11.28.    Amendment and Restatement  .  This Agreement amends and restates the Existing Credit Agreement and is not intended to be or operate as a novation or an accord and satisfaction of the Existing Credit Agreement or the Obligations of the Borrowers evidenced or provided for thereunder.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the requirement of the Debtors to grant any liens or security interests shall remain subject in all respects to the provisions of Section 4.1 of the Credit Agreement.

    Section 3.    Covenants, Agreements, Representations and Warranties.    Each Debtor hereby covenants and agrees with, and represents and warrants to, the Agent and each Secured Creditor that: 
  (a)    Each Debtor is duly organized and validly existing in good standing under the laws of the state of its organization.  No Debtor shall change its state of organization without first providing the Agent 15 days prior written notice.  Each Debtor s chief executive office and principal place of business is at the location listed opposite such Debtor s name under column 2 on Schedule A attached hereto; and such Debtor has no other executive offices or places of business (other than operating job sites in the ordinary course of such Debtor s business) other than those listed opposite such Debtor s name under column 3 on Schedule A attached hereto.  Each Debtor s organizational identification number is set forth under its name in column 1 on Schedule A attached hereto.  The Collateral owned or leased by each Debtor is and shall remain in such Debtor s possession or control at the locations listed opposite such Debtor s name under column 4 on Schedule A attached hereto  
  
   -6- 

opposite such Debtors  name, or is or shall be located at such Debtor s then operating job sites in the ordinary course of its business, or is or shall be in transit to or between any of the foregoing locations (collectively, the    Permitted Collateral Locations   ) in the ordinary course of business.  If for any reason any Collateral is at any time kept or located at a location other than a Permitted Collateral Location, the Agent shall nevertheless have and retain a lien on and security interest in such Collateral.  No Debtor shall move its chief executive office or maintain a place of business at a location other than those specified under columns 2 and/or 3 on Schedule A attached hereto other than temporarily in the ordinary course of business or permit any Collateral in excess of $1,000,000 to be located at a location other than a Permitted Collateral Location other than temporarily in the ordinary course of business or at a job site, in each case without first providing the Agent     15 days     prior     written notice of such Debtor s intent to do so;   provided, however,   that each Debtor shall at all times maintain its chief executive office and places of business in the United States of America and, with respect to any new chief executive office or place of business or location of Collateral, such Debtor shall have taken all action reasonably requested by the Agent or any Secured Creditor to maintain the lien and security interest of the Agent in the Collateral at all times fully perfected and in full force and effect.  The execution and delivery of this Agreement, and the observance and performance of each of the matters and things herein set forth, will not (i) contravene or constitute a default under any provision of law or any judgment, injunction, order or decree binding upon any Debtor or any provision of any Debtor s organizational documents (  e.g.     certificate of incorporation, articles of incorporation, by laws, certificate of formation, limited liability company operating agreement or partnership agreement, as applicable) or any covenant, indenture or agreement of or affecting any Debtor or any of its property or (ii) result in the creation or imposition of any lien or encumbrance on any property of any Debtor except for the lien and security interest granted to the Agent in the Collateral hereunder.  Each Debtor s organizational registration number (if any) is set forth on Schedule A attached hereto. 
  (b)    The Collateral and every part thereof is and shall be free and clear of all security interests, liens (including, without limitation, mechanics , laborers  and statutory liens), attachments, levies and encumbrances of every kind, nature and description and whether voluntary or involuntary, except for the lien and security interest of the Agent therein and other liens permitted by the Credit Agreement (herein, the    Permitted Encumbrances   ). 
  (c)    Subject to Sections 4(a), 6(c) and 7(a) hereof, no Debtor shall without the Agent s prior written consent, sell, assign, mortgage, lease or otherwise dispose of the Collateral or any interest therein, except that (i) until an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and thereafter until notified by the Agent that it intends to foreclose or otherwise realize upon such Collateral, each Debtor may use and lease its Collateral to the extent not prohibited by the terms of the Credit Agreement (including, without limitation, Section 7.13 of the Credit Agreement), and (ii) until an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Debtor may sell or otherwise dispose of Collateral to the extent not prohibited by the terms of the Credit Agreement (including, without limitation, Sections 7.13 and 7.14 of the Credit Agreement), and may grant liens on Collateral to the extent permitted by Sections 4.1 and/or 7.11 of the Credit Agreement, provided that a sale, lease or other  
  
   -7- 

disposition in the ordinary course of business shall not under any circumstance include a transfer, sale or lease in satisfaction, partial or complete, of a debt owing by such Debtor unless the debt so satisfied is secured with a lien on or ownership right in the goods in question which is prior to the security interest of the Agent therein and is a Permitted Encumbrance.   
  (d)    Each Debtor shall at all times insure the Collateral consisting of tangible personal property against such risks and hazards as other persons or entities similarly situated insure against, and including in any event loss or damage by fire, theft, burglary, pilferage, loss in transit and such other hazards as the Agent may reasonably specify, in amounts and under policies containing lenders loss payable clauses to the Agent as its interest may appear (and, if the Agent requests, naming the Agent and the Secured Creditors as additional insureds therein) and by insurers reasonably acceptable to the Agent, it being agreed that the foregoing shall not preclude any Debtor from directly or indirectly self insuring risks as and to the extent prudent and customary for companies similarly situated and then to the extent permitted by the Credit Agreement.  All premiums on such insurance shall be paid by the Debtors and, upon the Agent s request, the policies of such insurance (or certificates therefor) shall be delivered by the Debtors to the Agent.  All insurance required hereby shall provide to the extent commercially reasonably available that any loss shall be payable notwithstanding any act or negligence of the relevant Debtor, shall provide that no cancellation thereof shall be effective until at least 30 days after receipt by the relevant Debtor and the Agent of written notice thereof, and shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Agent in all other respects.  Each Debtor may retain any proceeds of such insurance arising out of the loss, damage or destruction of the Collateral owned or leased by such Debtor so long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing or shall arise and be continuing after giving effect to such loss, damage or destruction.  After the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, each Debtor will immediately pay over such proceeds of insurance to the Agent which shall thereafter be applied to the reduction of the Obligations (whether or not then due) or held as collateral security therefore, as the Agent may then determine.  All insurance proceeds shall be subject to the lien and security interest of the Agent in the Collateral.  Each Debtor hereby authorizes the Agent,     at the Agent s option, to adjust, compromise and settle any losses under any insurance afforded at any time after the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, and such Debtor does hereby irrevocably constitute the Agent, its officers, agents and attorneys, in such case as such Debtor s attorneys-in-fact, with full power and authority     to effect such adjustment, compromise and/or settlement and to endorse any drafts drawn by an insurer of the Collateral or any part thereof and to do everything necessary to carry out such purposes and to receive and receipt for any unearned premiums due under policies of such insurance.   
  (e)    Each Debtor shall, at all reasonable times upon reasonable prior notice, allow the Agent, any Secured Creditor, and their respective representatives free access to and right of inspection of the Collateral during such Debtor s normal business hours.      Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, the Agent shall have the right to verify all or any part of the Collateral in any manner, and through any medium, which the Agent considers appropriate, and each  
  
   -8- 

Debtor agrees to furnish all assistance and information, and perform any acts, which the Agent may reasonably require in connection therewith. 
  (f)    Each Debtor s legal name and state of organization is correctly set forth in Schedule A attached hereto.  No Debtor has transacted business at any time during the immediately preceding five year period, and does not currently transact business, under any other legal names or trade names other than the prior legal names and trade names (if any) set forth on Schedule B attached hereto.  No Debtor shall change its legal name or transact business under any other trade name without first giving 15 days  prior written notice of its intent to do so to the Agent. 
  (g)    Schedule C attached hereto contains a true, complete, and current listing of all copyrights, copyright applications, trademarks, trademark rights, tradenames, patents, patent rights and licenses, patent applications and other intellectual property rights that are owned by the Debtors and are registered with any governmental authority.  The relevant Debtor shall promptly notify the Agent in writing of any such additional intellectual property rights acquired or arising after the date hereof, and shall submit to the Agent a supplement to Schedule C attached hereto to reflect such additional rights (provided such Debtor s failure to do so shall not impair the Agent s security interest therein).  The Debtors own or possess rights to use all franchises, licenses, copyrights, copyright applications, patents, patent rights and licenses, patent applications, trademarks, trademark rights, trade names, trade name rights, copyrights and rights with respect to the foregoing which are required to conduct their business.  To the best of the Debtors  knowledge, no event has occurred which permits, or after notice or lapse of time or both would permit, the revocation or termination of any such rights, and no Debtor is liable to any person for infringement under applicable law with respect to any such rights as a result of its business operations. 
  (h)    Schedule E attached hereto contains a true, complete and current listing of all Commercial Tort Claims held or maintained by the Debtors as of the date hereof for an amount equal to or greater than $10,000,000, each described by reference to the specific incident giving rise to the applicable claim.  Each Debtor agrees to execute and deliver to the Agent a supplement to this Agreement in the form attached hereto as Schedule F, or in such other form reasonably acceptable to the Agent, promptly upon becoming aware of any other Commercial Tort Claim in an amount equal to or greater than $10,000,000 held or maintained by any Debtor arising after the date hereof. 
  (i)    Each Debtor agrees to execute and deliver to the Agent such further agreements, assignments, instruments and documents, and to do all such other things, as the Agent may reasonably deem necessary or appropriate to assure the lien and security interest of the Agent in the Collateral granted hereby, including, without limitation, (i) the execution and delivery of such financing statements and amendments thereof and supplements thereto or other instruments and documents as the Agent may from time to time reasonably require to comply with the UCC and any other applicable law, (ii) the execution and delivery of such patent, trademark and copyright assignment agreements as the Agent may from time to time reasonably require to comply with the filing requirements of the United States Patent and Trademark Office and the United States Copyright  
  
   -9- 

Office, and (iii) the execution and delivery of and the use of commercially reasonable efforts to cause the relevant depository institutions, financial intermediaries and letter of credit issuers to execute and deliver such control agreements with respect to all Letter-of-Credit Rights and electronic Chattel Paper as the Agent may from time to time reasonably require in accordance with the terms hereof.  Each Debtor hereby agrees that a carbon, photographic or other reproduction of this Agreement or any such financing statement is sufficient for filing as a financing statement by the Agent without notice thereof to such Debtor wherever the Agent in its sole discretion desires to file the same. Each Debtor hereby authorizes the Agent to file any and all financing statements covering the Collateral or any part thereof as the Agent may require, including financing statements describing the Collateral as  all assets  or  all personal property  or words of like meaning.  The Agent may order lien searches from time to time against any Debtor and the Collateral, and the Debtors shall promptly reimburse the Agent for all reasonable costs and expenses incurred in connection with such lien searches;   provided, however,   that prior to the occurrence of any Event of Default the Debtors shall not have any obligation to reimburse the Agent for the reasonable costs and expenses of more than one lien search during any calendar year.  In the event for any reason the law of any jurisdiction other than New York becomes or is applicable to the Collateral or any part thereof, or to any of the Obligations, each Debtor agrees to execute and deliver all such instruments and documents and to do all such other things as the Agent reasonably deems necessary or appropriate to preserve, protect and enforce the security interest of the Agent under the law of such other jurisdiction.   
  (j)    Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, on failure of any Debtor to perform any of its covenants and agreements herein contained, the Agent may at its option perform the same and in so doing may expend such sums as the Agent may reasonably deem advisable in the performance thereof, including, without limitation, (i) payment of any insurance premiums, (ii) payment of any taxes, liens and encumbrances, (iii) expenditures made in defending against any adverse claims, and (iv) all other expenditures which the Agent may be compelled to make by operation of law or which the Agent may make by agreement or otherwise for the protection of the Collateral.  All such sums and amounts so expended shall be repayable by such Debtor immediately without notice or demand, shall constitute additional Obligations secured hereunder, and shall bear interest from the date said amounts are expended at the rate per annum (computed on the basis of a 360-day year for the actual number of days elapsed) equal to the sum of 2% plus the rate otherwise applicable to Domestic Rate Loans under the Revolving Facility in effect from time to time (such rate per annum as so determined being hereinafter referred to as the    Reimbursement Rate   ).  No such performance of any covenant or agreement by the Agent on behalf of any Debtor, and no such advancement or expenditure therefor, shall relieve any Debtor of any default under the terms of this Agreement or in any way obligate the Agent or any Secured Creditor to take any further or future action with respect thereto.  The Agent is hereby authorized to charge any depository or other account of any Debtor maintained with the Agent for the amount of such sums and amounts so expended.

Section 4.    Special Provisions Re: Receivables. 
  (a)    So long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, any merchandise or other goods which are returned by a customer or account debtor to any Debtor or are otherwise recovered by such Debtor, may be resold by such Debtor in the ordinary course of its business in accordance with Section 3(c) hereof; and after the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, at the request of the Agent, such merchandise and other goods shall be set aside and held by such Debtor as trustee for the Agent and the Secured Creditors and shall remain part of the Collateral.  So long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each Debtor may settle and adjust disputes and claims with its customers and account debtors, handle returns and recoveries and grant discounts, credits and allowances, in each case in the ordinary course of its business and otherwise for amounts and on terms which such Debtor considers advisable.  However, after the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, at the request of the Agent, each Debtor shall notify the Agent promptly of all returns and recoveries and shall deliver the merchandise or other returned goods to the Agent.  After the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, at the request of the Agent each Debtor shall also notify the Agent promptly of all disputes and claims and settle or adjust them at no expense to the Agent or the Secured Creditors, but no discount, credit or allowance other than on normal trade terms in the ordinary course of business shall be granted to any customer or account debtor and no returns of merchandise or other goods shall be accepted by any Debtor without the Agent s consent.  The Agent may, at all times after the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, settle or adjust disputes and claims directly with customers or account debtors for amounts and upon terms which the Agent considers advisable. 
  (b)    If any Receivable arises out of a contract with the United States of America or any of its departments, agencies or instrumentalities, upon the Agent s request after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, each Debtor agrees to so notify the Agent and execute whatever instruments and documents are reasonably required by the Agent in order that such Receivable shall be assigned to the Agent and that proper notice of such assignment shall be given under the federal Assignment of Claims Act (or any successor statute). 
    Section 5.    Special Provisions Re:  Instrument or Chattel Paper. 
  (a)    To the extent any Pledged Note or other item of Collateral is evidenced by an Instrument or Chattel Paper, the applicable Debtor shall cause such Instrument or Chattel Paper to be pledged and delivered to the Agent;   provided, however,   that, unless (i) an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing and (ii) the Agent or the Required Lenders shall have otherwise required, a Debtor shall not be required to deliver any such Instrument or Chattel Paper if and only so long as (A) the fair market value of any such Instrument or Chattel Paper held by such Debtor is less than $1,000,000 and (B) the aggregate fair market value of all such Instruments or Chattel Paper held by the Borrowers, the Debtors and the other Guarantors and not delivered to the Agent under the Collateral Documents is less than $5,000,000 at any one time outstanding.  
  
   -11- 

(b)    To the extent required to be delivered under Section 5(a) above, the relevant Debtor shall endorse all Instruments and Chattel Paper or other item of Collateral in blank and deliver the same to the Agent in a form sufficient to transfer title thereto and shall also duly execute and deliver such other Instruments and Chattel Paper of transfer or assignment as to any other Collateral granted pursuant hereto, all in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Agent.  To the extent required to be delivered under Section 5(a) above, the relevant Debtor shall deliver to the Agent true and correct copies of all Instruments and Chattel Paper and documents securing each item of Collateral or setting forth terms and conditions applicable thereto.  After the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, upon request by the Agent, all tangible Chattel Paper and Instruments shall, unless delivered to the Agent or its agent, contain a legend reasonably acceptable to the Agent indicating that such Chattel Paper or Instrument is subject to the security interest of the Agent contemplated by this Agreement;   provided, however,   that unless the Agent or the Required Lenders shall have required otherwise, a Debtor shall not be required to so legend any such Instrument or Chattel Paper if and only so long as (i) the fair market value of any such Instrument or Chattel Paper held by such Debtor is less than $1,000,000 and (ii) the aggregate fair market value of all such Instruments or Chattel Paper held by the Borrowers, the Debtors and the other Guarantors and not delivered to the Agent under the Collateral Documents is less than $5,000,000 at any one time outstanding. 
  (c)    After the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default, no Debtor shall, without the prior written consent of the Agent, release any collateral or guarantors of the Instruments or Chattel Paper or amend, modify, waive or otherwise take any action which would materially impair the value or collectability of all or any part thereof.  At the request of the Agent, each Debtor further agrees to promptly deliver to the Agent copies of all statements, reports and other information and data submitted by any obligor of an Instrument or Chattel Paper to such Debtor.   
  (d)    Each Debtor hereby authorizes and directs each obligor of an Instrument or Chattel Paper, upon receipt of notice from the Agent that an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, to make all distributions and payments now due or hereafter to become due to such Debtor in respect of such Instrument or Chattel Paper directly to the Agent, and such Debtor agrees that such payments or distributions to the Agent as aforesaid shall be a good receipt and acquittance to such Debtor to the extent so made. 
    Section 6.    Special Provisions Re:  Investment Property and Deposits. 
  (a)    Unless and until an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and thereafter until notified to the contrary by the Agent pursuant to Section 10(e) hereof: 
  (i)    each Debtor shall be entitled to exercise all voting and/or consensual powers pertaining to the Investment Property or any part thereof owned or held by it, for all purposes not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement, the Credit Agreement, or any other document evidencing or otherwise relating to any Obligations; and 
  (ii)    each Debtor shall be entitled to receive and retain all cash dividends paid upon or in respect of the Investment Property owned or held by it. 
  
   -12- 

(b)    Except for equity interests in direct or indirect Subsidiaries, all Investment Property of each Debtor (including all securities, certificated or uncertificated, securities accounts, and commodity accounts but excluding any split-dollar insurance policies) having a fair market value of $1,000,000 or more maintained by such Debtor on the date hereof is listed and identified on Schedule D attached hereto.  Each Debtor shall promptly notify the Agent of any other such Investment Property with a fair market value of $1,000,000 or more acquired or maintained by such Debtor after the date hereof, and shall submit to the Agent a supplement to Schedule D attached hereto to reflect such additional Investment Property (provided such Debtor s failure to do so shall not impair the Agent s security interest therein).  Certificates     for all certificated securities now or at any time constituting such Investment Property hereunder shall be promptly delivered by the relevant Debtor to the Agent duly endorsed in blank for transfer or accompanied by an appropriate assignment or assignments or an appropriate undated stock power or powers, in every case sufficient to transfer title thereto, and, with respect to any such uncertificated securities or any such Investment Property held by a securities issuer or intermediary, commodity issuer or intermediary, or other issuer or financial intermediary of any kind, the relevant Debtor shall execute and deliver, and shall cause any such issuer or intermediary to execute and deliver, an agreement among such Debtor, the Agent and such issuer or intermediary in form and substance satisfactory to the Agent which provides, among other things, for the issuer s or intermediary s agreement that it will comply with such entitlement orders, and apply any value distributed on account of any such Investment Property, as directed by the Agent without further consent by such Debtor at any time after the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default;   provided, however,   that, unless (i) an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing and (ii) the Agent or the Required Lenders shall have otherwise required, a Debtor shall not be required to deliver any such certificates or cause any such agreement to be entered into with the relevant issuer or financial intermediary with respect to (A) Investment Property having a final maturity date not in excess of 90 days from the date the relevant Debtor obtains such Investment Property or (B) other Investment Property if and so long as (x) the fair market value of any such other Investment Property held by such Debtor is less than $1,000,000 and (y) the aggregate fair market value of all such other Investment Property held by the Borrowers, the Debtors and the other Guarantors and not subject to the control (as such term is defined in the UCC) of the Agent under the Collateral Documents is less than $5,000,000 at any one time outstanding.  The Agent may at any time after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default cause to be transferred into its name or the name of its nominee or nominees any and all of the Investment Property hereunder.   
  (c)    Unless and until an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, each Debtor may sell or otherwise dispose of any Investment Property to the extent permitted by the Credit Agreement.  During the existence of any Event of Default, no Debtor shall sell or otherwise dispose of all or any part of the Investment Property without the prior written consent of the Agent. 
  (d)    Each Debtor represents that on the date of this Agreement, to the best of its knowledge, none of the Investment Property consists of margin stock (as such term is defined in Regulation U of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System) except to the extent such Debtor has delivered to the Agent a duly executed and completed Form U 1 with respect to such margin stock.  If at any time the Investment Property or any part thereof consists of margin stock and the relevant Debtor has knowledge of the same, such Debtor shall promptly so notify the Agent and deliver to the Agent a duly executed and completed  
  
   -13- 

Form U 1 and such other instruments and documents as (i) are necessary to satisfy the applicable requirements of Regulations T, U and X of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System with respect to such margin stock and (ii) are reasonably requested by the Agent in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Agent. 
  (e)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in the event any Investment Property is subject to the terms of a separate security agreement (including, without limitation, the Fifth Amended and Restated Pledge Agreement bearing even date herewith relating to the stock of certain of the Debtors hereunder) in favor of the Agent, the terms of such separate security agreement shall govern and control unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the Agent and the Secured Creditors. 
  (f)    All Deposit Accounts of the Debtors on the date hereof are listed and identified (by account number and depository institution) in the Side Letter (other than Deposit Accounts constituting payroll accounts).  Each Debtor shall promptly notify the Agent of any other Deposit Account opened or maintained by such Debtor after the date hereof (other than Deposit Accounts constituting payroll accounts) and shall submit to the Agent a supplement to the Side Letter to reflect such additional accounts (provided any Debtor s failure to do so shall not impair the Agent s security interest therein).  With respect to any Deposit Account maintained by a depository institution other than the Agent, and as a condition to the establishment and maintenance of any such Deposit Account except as otherwise permitted by the Credit Agreement, such Debtor, the depository institution, and the Agent shall execute and deliver an account control agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Agent which provides, among other things, for the depository institution s agreement that it will comply with instructions originated by the Agent directing the disposition of the funds in the Deposit Account without further consent by such Debtor. 
    Section 7.    Collection of Receivables Instruments and Chattel Paper.  
  (a)    Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each Debtor shall make collection of all Receivables, Instruments and Chattel Paper and may use the same to carry on its business in accordance with sound business practice and otherwise subject to the terms hereof. 
  (b)    If any Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, in the event the Agent requests a Debtor to do so:  (i) all Instruments and Chattel Paper at any time constituting part of the Collateral (including any postdated checks) shall, upon receipt by the relevant Debtor, be immediately endorsed to and deposited with Agent; and/or (ii) such Debtor shall instruct all customers and account debtors and any other obligor of any of the Collateral to remit all payments in respect of the Collateral to a lockbox or lockboxes under the sole custody and control of Agent and which are maintained at post offices selected by the Agent. 
  (c)    If any Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Agent or its designee may notify each Debtor s customers or account debtors or any other obligor at any time that the Collateral has been assigned to the Agent or that the Agent has a security interest therein, and either in its own name, or such Debtor s name, or both, demand, collect (including, without limitation, through a lockbox analogous to that described in Section 7(b)(ii) hereof), receive, receipt for, sue for, compound and give acquittance for any or all amounts due or to become due on the Collateral, and in the Agent s discretion file any claim or take any  
  
   -14- 

other action or proceeding which the Agent may deem reasonably necessary or appropriate to protect and realize upon the security interest of the Agent in the Collateral or any part thereof. 
  (d)    Any proceeds of Collateral transmitted to or otherwise received by the Agent pursuant to any of the provisions of Sections 7(b) or 7(c) hereof may be handled and administered by the Agent in and through a remittance account or accounts maintained at the Agent or by the Agent at a commercial bank or banks selected by the Agent (each a    Depositary Bank   ), and each Debtor acknowledges that the maintenance of such remittance accounts by the Agent is solely for the Agent s convenience.  The Agent need not apply or give credit for any item included in proceeds of Receivables, Instruments, Chattel Paper or other Collateral until the relevant Depositary Bank has received final payment therefor at its office in cash or final solvent credits current at the site of deposit acceptable to the Agent and the relevant Depositary Bank as such.  However, if the Agent does permit credit to be given for any item prior to a Depositary Bank receiving final payment therefor and such Depositary Bank fails to receive such final payment or an item is charged back to the Agent or any Depositary Bank for any reason, the Agent may at its election in either instance charge the amount of such item back against any such remittance account or any depository account of a Debtor maintained with the Agent.  Each Debtor hereby indemnifies the Agent and the Secured Creditors from and against all liabilities, damages, losses, actions, claims, judgments, costs, expenses, charges and attorneys  fees suffered or incurred by the Agent or any Secured Creditor because of the maintenance of the foregoing arrangements;   provided, however,   that no Debtor shall be required to indemnify the Agent or any Secured Creditor for any of the foregoing to the extent they arise from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the person seeking to be indemnified.  The Agent and the Secured Creditors shall have no liability or responsibility to any Debtor for the Agent or any other Depositary Bank accepting any check, draft or other order for payment of money bearing the legend  payment in full  or words of similar import or any other restrictive legend or endorsement whatsoever or be responsible for determining the correctness of any remittance. 
  Section 8.    Special Provisions Re:  Inventory and Equipment. 
  (a)    Each Debtor shall at its own cost and expense maintain, keep and preserve all material portions of the Inventory in good and merchantable condition and keep and preserve all material portions of the Equipment in good repair, working order and condition, ordinary wear and tear excepted, and, without limiting the foregoing, will from time to time make all necessary and proper repairs, replacements and additions to the Equipment so that the overall efficiency of the Equipment taken as a whole shall be fully preserved and maintained. 
  (b)    Each Debtor warrants and agrees that no Inventory is or will be consigned to any other person or entity without the Agent s prior written consent. 
  (c)    At the Agent s request, each Debtor shall at its own cost and expense cause the lien of the Agent in and to any portion of the Collateral subject to a certificate of title law to be duly noted on such certificate of title or to be otherwise filed in such manner as is prescribed by law in order to perfect such lien and will cause all such certificates of title and evidences of lien to be deposited with the Agent. 
  
   -15- 

(d)    In the event the Equipment, or any part thereof, is or may be attached to real estate in such a manner that the same may become a fixture, at the Agent s request after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, the relevant Debtor shall take all action reasonably requested by the Agent to maintain the lien and security interest of the Agent in such Collateral at all times fully perfected and in full force and effect, including, without limitation, such fixture financing statements as the Agent may require and, in the event any other person has any right, title or interest in, or lien upon, any such real estate, such Debtor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such person to enter an agreement (i) pursuant to which such person disclaims any right, title and interest in, or lien on, such Equipment, (ii) which allows for the removal of such Equipment by the Agent and (iii) which is otherwise in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Agent. 
  (e)    If any of the Inventory is at any time evidenced by a negotiable document of title, at the Agent s request after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, such document shall be promptly delivered by the relevant Debtor to the Agent. 
    Section 9.        Power of Attorney.    In addition to any other powers of attorney contained herein, each Debtor hereby appoints the Agent, its nominee, or any other person whom the Agent may designate as such Debtor s attorney-in-fact, with full power after the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default:  (i) to sign such Debtor s name on verifications of Receivables and other Collateral; (ii) to send requests for verification of Collateral to such Debtor s customers, account debtors and other obligors; (iii) to endorse such Debtor s name on any checks, notes, acceptances, money orders, drafts and any other forms of payment or security that may come into the Agent s possession; (iv) to endorse the Collateral in blank or to the order of the Agent or its nominee; (v) to sign such Debtor s name on any invoice or bill of lading relating to any Collateral, on claims to enforce collection of any Collateral, on notices to and drafts against customers and account debtors and other obligors, on schedules and assignments of Collateral, on notices of assignment and on public records; (vi) to notify the post office authorities to change the address for delivery of such Debtor s mail to an address designated by the Agent; (vii) to receive and open all mail addressed to such Debtor; and (viii) to do all things necessary to carry out this Agreement.  Each Debtor hereby ratifies and approves all acts of any such attorney and agrees that neither the Agent nor any such attorney will be liable for any acts or omissions nor for any error of judgment or mistake of fact or law other than such person s gross negligence or willful misconduct.  The Agent may file one or more financing statements disclosing its security interest in any or all of the Collateral without any Debtor s signature appearing thereon.  Each Debtor also hereby grants the Agent a power of attorney to execute any such financing statements, or amendments and supplements to financing statements, on behalf of such Debtor without prior notice thereof to any Debtor.  The foregoing powers of attorney, being coupled with an interest, are irrevocable until the Obligations have been fully paid and satisfied and the commitments of the Secured Creditors to extend credit to or for the account of the Borrowers have expired or otherwise been terminated (including Cash Collateralization of Letters of Credit). 
  
   -16- 

Section 10.    Defaults and Remedies. 
  (a)    The occurrence of any event or the existence of any condition specified as an    Event of Default    under the Credit Agreement shall constitute an    Event of Default    hereunder. 
  (b)    During the existence of any Event of Default, the Agent shall have, in addition to all other rights provided herein or by law, the rights and remedies of a secured party under the UCC (regardless of whether the UCC is the law of the jurisdiction where the rights or remedies are asserted and regardless of whether the UCC applies to the affected Collateral), and further the Agent may, without demand and without advertisement, notice, hearing or process of law to the extent permitted by law, all of which each Debtor hereby waives to the extent permitted by law, at any time or times, sell and deliver any or all Collateral held by or for it at public or private sale, at any securities exchange or broker s board or at any of the Agent s offices or elsewhere, for cash, upon credit or otherwise, at such prices and upon such terms as the Agent deems advisable, in its sole discretion.  Also, if less than all the Collateral is sold, the Agent shall have no duty to marshall or apportion the part of the Collateral sold as between the Debtors, or any of them, but may sell and deliver any or all of the Collateral without regard to which of the Debtors are the owners thereof.  In the exercise of any such remedies, the Agent may sell all the Collateral as a unit even though the sales price thereof may be in excess of the amount remaining unpaid on the Obligations.  The Agent is authorized at any sale or other disposition of the Collateral or any part thereof, if it deems it advisable so to do, to restrict the prospective bidders or purchasers to persons who will represent and agree that they are purchasing for their own account for investment, and not with a view to the distribution or resale of any of the Collateral.  In addition to all other sums due the Agent or any Secured Creditor hereunder, each Debtor shall pay the Agent and the Secured Creditors all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the Agent and such Secured Creditors, including reasonable attorneys  fees and court costs, in obtaining, liquidating or enforcing payment of Collateral or the Obligations or in the prosecution or defense of any action or proceeding by or against the Agent, such Secured Creditor or any Debtor concerning any matter arising out of or connected with this Agreement or the Collateral or the Obligations, including, without limitation, any of the foregoing arising in, arising under or related to a case under the United States Bankruptcy Code (or any successor statute).  Any requirement of reasonable notice shall be met if such notice is personally served on or mailed, postage prepaid, to the Debtors in accordance with Section 16(b) hereof at least 10 days before the time of sale or other event giving rise to the requirement of such notice;   provided however,   that during the existence of any Event of Default, no notification need be given to a Debtor if such Debtor has signed, after the occurrence of such Event of Default, a statement renouncing any right to notification of sale or other intended disposition.  The Agent shall not be obligated to make any sale or other disposition of the Collateral regardless of notice having been given.  The Agent or any Secured Creditor may be the purchaser at any such sale.  Each Debtor hereby waives to the extent permitted by law all of its rights of redemption from any such sale.  The Agent may postpone or cause the postponement of the sale of all or any portion of the Collateral by announcement at the time and place of such sale, and such sale may, without further notice, be made at the time and place to which the sale was postponed or the Agent may further postpone such sale by announcement made at such time and place.  The Agent has no obligation to prepare the Collateral for sale.  The Agent may sell or otherwise dispose of the Collateral without giving any warranties as to the Collateral or any part thereof,  
  
   -17- 

including disclaimers of any warranties of title or the like, and each Debtor acknowledges and agrees that the absence of such warranties shall not render the disposition commercially unreasonable. 
  (c)    Without in any way limiting the foregoing, if any Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Agent shall have the right, in addition to all other rights provided herein or by law, to take physical possession of any and all of the Collateral and anything found therein, the right for that purpose to enter without legal process any premises where the Collateral may be found (provided such entry be done lawfully), and the right to maintain such possession on each Debtor s premises (the Debtors hereby agreeing to lease such premises without cost or expense to the Agent or its designee if the Agent so requests) or to remove the Collateral or any part thereof to such other places as the Agent may desire.  If any Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Agent shall have the right to exercise any and all rights with respect to all Deposit Accounts of each Debtor, the right to direct the disposition of the funds in each Deposit Account and to collect, withdraw and receive all amounts due or to become due or payable under each such Deposit Account.  If any Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, each Debtor shall, upon the Agent s demand, assemble the Collateral and make it available to the Agent at a place designated by the Agent.  If the Agent exercises its right to take possession of the Collateral, each Debtor shall also at its expense perform any and all other steps requested by the Agent to preserve and protect the security interest hereby granted in the Collateral, such as placing and maintaining signs indicating the security interest of the Agent, appointing overseers for the Collateral and maintaining Collateral records. 
  (d)    Without in any way limiting the foregoing, if any Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, each Debtor hereby grants to the Agent and the Secured Creditors a royalty-free irrevocable license and right to use all of such Debtor s patents, patent applications, patent licenses, trademarks, trademark registrations, trademark licenses, trade names, trade styles, and similar intangibles in connection with any foreclosure or other realization by the Agent or the Secured Creditors on all or any part of the Collateral, provided that the license granted hereunder shall not include any rights in any license agreement under which the relevant Debtor is licensee which, by its terms, prohibits the license contemplated by this Section 10(d).  The license and right granted the Agent and the Secured Creditors hereby shall be without any royalty or fee or charge whatsoever. 
  (e)    Without in any way limiting the foregoing, if any Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, all rights of a Debtor to exercise the voting and/or consensual powers which it is entitled to exercise pursuant to Section 6(a)(i) hereof and/or to receive and retain the distributions which it is entitled to receive and retain pursuant to Section 6(a)(ii) hereof, shall, at the option of the Agent, cease and thereupon become vested in the Agent, which, in addition to all other rights provided herein or by law, shall then be entitled solely and exclusively to exercise all voting and other consensual powers pertaining to the Investment Property (including, without limitation, the right to deliver notice of control with respect to any Investment Property held in a securities account or commodity account and deliver all entitlement orders with respect thereto) and/or to receive and retain the distributions which such Debtor would otherwise have been authorized to retain pursuant to Section 6(a)(ii) hereof and shall then be entitled solely and exclusively to exercise any and all rights of conversion, exchange or subscription or any other rights, privileges or options pertaining to any Investment Property as if the Agent were the     absolute owner thereof including, without  
  
   -18- 

limitation, the rights to exchange, at its discretion, any and all of the Investment Property upon the merger, consolidation, reorganization, recapitalization or other readjustment of the respective issuer thereof or upon the exercise by or on behalf of any such issuer or the Agent of any right, privilege or option pertaining to any Investment Property and, in connection therewith, to deposit and deliver any and all of the Investment Property with any committee, depositary, transfer agent, registrar or other designated agency upon such terms and conditions as the Agent may determine.  In the event any of the Collateral shall constitute restricted securities within the meaning of any applicable securities laws, any disposition thereof in compliance with such laws shall not render the disposition commercially unreasonable. 
  (f)    The powers conferred upon the Agent hereunder are solely to protect its interest in the Collateral and shall not impose on it any duty to exercise such powers.  The Agent shall be deemed to have exercised reasonable care in the custody and preservation of the Collateral in its possession or control if such Collateral is accorded treatment substantially equivalent to that which the Agent accords its own property, consisting of similar type assets, it being understood, however, that the Agent shall have no responsibility for ascertaining or taking any action with respect to calls, conversions, exchanges, maturities, tenders or other matters relating to any such Collateral, whether or not the Agent has or is deemed to have knowledge of such matters.  This Agreement constitutes an assignment of rights only and not an assignment of any duties or obligations of the Debtors in any way related to the Collateral, and the Agent shall have no duty or obligation to discharge any such duty or obligation.  The Agent shall have no responsibility for taking any necessary steps to preserve rights against any parties with respect to any Collateral or initiating any action to protect the Collateral against the possibility of a decline in market value.  Neither the Agent nor any party acting as attorney for the Agent shall be liable for any acts or omissions or for any error of judgment or mistake of fact or law other than their gross negligence or willful misconduct, as determined by a non appealable court of competent jurisdiction. 
  (g)    Failure by the Agent to exercise any right, remedy or option under this Agreement or any other agreement between any Debtor and the Agent or provided by law, or delay by the Agent in exercising the same, shall not operate as a waiver; and no waiver shall be effective unless it is in writing, signed by the party against whom such waiver is sought to be enforced and then only to the extent specifically stated.  Neither the Agent or any Secured Creditor, nor any party acting as attorney for the Agent or any Secured Creditor, shall be liable hereunder for any acts or omissions or for any error of judgment or mistake of fact or law other than such person s gross negligence or willful misconduct, as determined by a non appealable court of competent jurisdiction.  The rights and remedies of the Agent and the Secured Creditors under this Agreement shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any other right or remedy which the Agent or the Secured Creditors may have.  For purposes of this Agreement, an Event of Default shall be construed as continuing after its occurrence until the same is waived or cured in writing by the Required Lenders in accordance with the Credit Agreement. 
  Section 11.        Application of Proceeds  .  The proceeds and avails of the Collateral at any time received by the Agent during the existence of any Event of Default hereunder shall, when received by the Agent in cash or its equivalent, be applied by the Agent in reduction of, or as collateral security for, the Obligations in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement.  Each Debtor shall remain liable to the Agent and the  
  
   -19- 

Secured Creditors for any deficiency.  Any surplus remaining after the full payment and satisfaction of the Obligations shall be returned to the Debtors or to whomsoever the Agent reasonably determines is lawfully entitled thereto. 
    Section 12.    Continuing Agreement.    This Agreement shall be a continuing agreement in every respect and shall remain in full force and effect until all of the Obligations, both for principal and interest, have been fully paid and satisfied and the commitments of the Secured Creditors to extend credit or otherwise make financial accommodations available to the Borrowers under the Credit Agreement have expired or otherwise been terminated (including Cash Collateralization of Letters of Credit).  Upon each such termination of this Agreement, the Agent shall, upon the request and at the expense of the Debtors, forthwith release its security interest hereunder. 
    Section 13.    Primary Security; Obligations Absolute.    The lien and security herein created and provided for stand as direct and primary security for the Obligations.  No application of any sums received by the Agent in respect of the Collateral or any disposition thereof to the reduction of the Obligations or any portion thereof shall in any manner entitle any Debtor to any right, title or interest in or to the Obligations or any collateral security therefor, whether by subrogation or otherwise, unless and until all Obligations have been fully paid and satisfied and the commitments of the Secured Creditors to extend credit or otherwise make financial accommodations available to the Borrowers, or any one of them, under the Credit Agreement have expired or otherwise have been terminated (including Cash Collateralization of Letters of Credit).  Each Debtor acknowledges and agrees that the lien and security hereby created and provided for are absolute and unconditional and shall not in any manner be affected or impaired by any acts or omissions whatsoever of the Agent, any Secured Creditor or any other holder of any of the Obligations, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the lien and security hereof shall not be impaired by any acceptance by the Agent, any Secured Creditor or any holder of any of the Obligations of any other security for or guarantors upon any of the Obligations or by any failure, neglect or omission on the part of the Agent, any Secured Creditor or any other holder of any of the Obligations to realize upon or protect any of the Obligations or any collateral security therefor.  The lien and security hereof shall not in any manner be impaired or affected by (and the Agent and the Secured Creditors, without notice to anyone, are hereby authorized to make from time to time) any sale, pledge, surrender, compromise, settlement, release, renewal, extension, indulgence, alteration, substitution, exchange, change in, modification or disposition of any of the Obligations, or of any collateral security therefor, or of any guaranty thereof or of any obligor thereon.  The Secured Creditors may at their discretion at any time grant credit to the Borrowers, or any of them individually, without notice to any Debtor in such amounts and on such terms as the Secured Creditors may elect without in any manner impairing the lien and security hereby created and provided for.  No release, compromise or discharge of any Debtor hereunder or with respect to any of the Obligations or any Collateral provided by such Debtor shall release or discharge, or impair the agreements of, any other Debtor hereunder or in any manner impair the liens and security interests granted by any other Debtor hereunder; and the Agent may proceed against the Collateral provided hereunder by any one or more of the Debtors without proceeding against the other Debtors, their respective properties or any other security or guaranty whatsoever.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the requisite number of Secured Creditors (as determined in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement) may at any time or from time to time release any Debtor from its obligations hereunder  
  
   -20- 

or release any Collateral or effect any compromise with any Debtor, and no such release or compromise shall in any manner impair or otherwise effect the liens granted by, or the obligations of, the other Debtors hereunder.  In order to foreclose or otherwise realize hereon and to exercise the rights granted the Agent hereunder and under applicable law, there shall be no obligation on the part of the Agent, any Secured Creditor or any other holder of any of the Obligations at any time to first resort for payment to any Borrower or any other obligor on any of the Obligations or to any guaranty of the Obligations or any portion thereof or to resort to any other collateral security, property, liens or any other rights or remedies whatsoever, and the Agent shall have the right to enforce this instrument irrespective of whether or not other proceedings or steps are pending seeking resort to or realization upon or from any of the foregoing.

  (a)    This Agreement cannot be changed or terminated orally.  This Agreement shall create a continuing lien on and security interest in the Collateral to the extent set forth herein and shall be binding upon each Debtor and its successors and assigns and shall inure, together with the rights and remedies of the Agent and the Secured Creditors hereunder, to the benefit of the Agent, the Secured Creditors and their successors and assigns;   provided,     however  , that no Debtor may assign its rights or delegate its duties hereunder without the prior written consent of the Agent and the Secured Creditors.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject to the provisions of the Credit Agreement any Secured Creditor as a lender may assign or otherwise transfer any indebtedness held by it secured by this Agreement to any other person or entity, and such other person or entity shall thereupon become vested with all the benefits in respect thereof granted to such Secured Creditor herein or otherwise. 
  (b)    Except as otherwise specified herein, all notices hereunder shall be in writing (including, without limitation, notice by telecopy) and shall be given to the relevant party, and shall be deemed to have been made when given to the relevant party, in accordance with Section 11.9 of the Credit Agreement.  All notices to the Debtors hereunder shall be made to the Company, as their agent, in accordance with Section 11.9 of the Credit Agreement. 
  (c)    No Secured Creditor shall have the right to institute any suit, action or proceeding in equity or at law for the foreclosure or other realization upon any Collateral subject to this Agreement or for the execution of any trust or power hereof or for the appointment of a receiver, or for the enforcement of any other remedy under or upon this Agreement; it being understood and intended that no one or more of the Secured Creditors shall have any right in any manner whatsoever to affect, disturb or prejudice the lien and security interest of this Agreement by its or their action or to enforce any right hereunder, and that all proceedings at law or in equity shall be instituted, had and maintained by the Agent in the manner herein provided for the benefit of the Secured Creditors. 
  (d)    In the event that any provision hereof shall be deemed to be invalid or unenforceable by reason of the operation of any law or by reason of the interpretation placed thereon by any court, this Agreement shall be construed as not containing such provision, but only as to such jurisdictions where such law or interpretation is operative, and the invalidity or unenforceability of such provision shall not affect the validity of any remaining provisions hereof, and any and all other provisions hereof which are otherwise lawful and valid shall remain in full force and effect. 
  (e)    This Agreement shall be deemed to have been made in the State of New York and shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York (including Section 5 1401 and Section 5 1402 of the General Obligations law of the State of New York) without regard to principles  
  
   -22- 

of conflicts of law.  The headings in this Agreement are for convenience of reference only and shall not limit or otherwise affect the meaning of any provision hereof.

  (g)    In the event the Secured Creditors shall at any time in their discretion permit a substitution of Debtors hereunder or a party shall wish to become Debtor hereunder, such substituted or additional Debtor shall, upon executing an agreement in the form attached hereto as Schedule G, become a party hereto and be bound by all the terms and conditions hereof to the same extent as though such Debtor had originally executed this Agreement and in the case of a substitution, in lieu of the Debtor being replaced.  No such substitution shall be effective absent the written consent of the Secured Creditors nor shall it in any manner affect the obligations of the other Debtors hereunder. 
  (h)    This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and by different parties hereto on separate counterpart signature pages, each constituting an original, but all together one and the same agreement. 
  (i)    EACH DEBTOR, THE AGENT, AND EACH SECURED CREDITOR HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. 
  (j)    In the event of any inconsistency between this Agreement or the Credit Agreement, the terms of the Credit Agreement, as applicable, shall govern. 
  (k)    Upon the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company, the other Debtors and the Agent, this Agreement shall supersede all provisions of the Prior Security Agreement as of such date.  Each Debtor hereby agrees that, notwithstanding the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the liens and security interests created and provided for under the Prior Security Agreement continue in effect under and pursuant to the terms of this Agreement for the benefit of all of the Obligations secured hereby.  Nothing herein contained shall in any manner affect or impair the priority of the liens and security interests created and provided for by the Prior Security Agreement as to the indebtedness and obligations which would otherwise be secured thereby prior to giving effect to this Agreement.

           SECTION 1. 
    TERMS DEFINED IN CREDIT AGREEMENT. 
     All capitalized terms used herein without definition shall have the same meanings herein as such terms have in the Credit Agreement, except terms which are defined in the Uniform Commercial Code of the State of New York as in effect from time to time (   UCC   ) shall have the same meanings herein as such terms are defined in the UCC, unless this Agreement shall otherwise specifically provide.  The term  Pledgor  and  Pledgors  as used herein shall mean and include the Pledgors collectively and also each individually, with all grants, representations, warranties and covenants of and by the Pledgors, or any of them, herein contained to constitute joint and several grants, representations, warranties and covenants of and by the Pledgors;   provided, however,   that unless the context in which the same is used shall otherwise require, any grant, representation, warranty or covenant contained herein related to the Pledged Securities shall be made by each Pledgor only with respect to the Pledged Securities owned by it or represented by such Pledgor as owned by it. 
  Section 2.    Grant of Security Interest in the Pledged Securities; Obligations Secured.  
  (a)    Subject to the terms of the Credit Agreement, each Pledgor hereby pledges and deposits with the Agent, and grants to the Agent a security interest in, in each case for the benefit of the Secured Creditors, and acknowledges and agrees that the Agent has and shall continue to have for the benefit of the Secured Creditors a continuing security interest in, any and all right, title and interest of such Pledgor, whether now existing or hereafter acquired or arising, in and to (i) all shares of the capital stock or other equity interests of each Restricted Subsidiary owned or held by such Pledgor, whether now existing or hereafter formed or acquired (those of such shares delivered to and deposited with the Agent concurrently herewith being listed  
  
   -2- 

and described on Schedule A as of the date hereof), (ii) all substitutions and additions to such shares or other equity interests, (iii) all dividends, distributions and sums distributable or payable from, upon or in respect of such shares or other equity interests, (iv) all other rights or privileges incident to such shares or other equity interests, and (v) all proceeds and products of any of the foregoing (such shares, equity interests and all other of the foregoing being hereinafter sometimes referred to as the    Pledged Securities   );   provided, however,   that the Pledged Securities hereunder shall not include any interest held by a Pledgor in the capital stock of any of its Unrestricted Subsidiaries, any of its Foreign Subsidiaries or any Excess Stock Collateral;   provided further   however that the pledge and security interest created hereby shall remain subject in all respects to the provisions of Section 4.1 of the Credit Agreement. 
  (b)    This Agreement is made and given to secure, and shall secure, the prompt payment and performance of (i) all  Obligations,  and  Hedging Liability,  as such terms are defined in the Credit Agreement, including, without limitation, all obligations with respect to Loans made and to be made under the Credit Agreement (whether or not evidenced by Notes issued thereunder), all obligations of the Borrowers to reimburse the Secured Creditors for the amount of all drawings on all Letters of Credit issued pursuant to the Credit Agreement and all other obligations of the Borrowers under all Applications for Letters of Credit, all other obligations of the Borrowers and the other Pledgors under the Loan Documents, all obligations of the Borrowers and the other Pledgors, and of any of them individually, with respect to any Hedging Liability and the agreements relating thereto, and all obligations of the Pledgors, and of any of them individually, arising under any guaranty issued by it relating to the foregoing or any part thereof, in each case whether now existing or hereafter arising (and whether arising before or after the filing of a petition in bankruptcy and including all interest, costs, fees, and charges after the entry of an order for relief against a Pledgor in a case under Title 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code or any similar proceeding, whether or not such interest, costs, fees and charges would be an allowed claim against such Pledgor in such proceeding), due or to become due, direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, and howsoever evidenced, held or acquired, and owing in any currency and (ii) any and all expenses and charges, legal or otherwise, suffered or incurred by the Agent or the Secured Creditors, and any of them individually, in collecting or enforcing any of such indebtedness, obligations, and liabilities or in realizing on or protecting or preserving any security therefor, including, without limitation, the lien and security interest granted to the Agent in the Pledged Securities hereby (all of the indebtedness, obligations, liabilities, expenses, and charges described above being hereinafter referred to as the    Obligations   ).  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the right of recovery against any Pledgor under this Agreement shall not exceed $1.00 less than the lowest amount which would render such Pledgor s obligations under this Agreement void or voidable under applicable law, including fraudulent conveyance law. 
           SECTION 3. 
    COVENANTS, REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.  
     Subject to the terms of the Credit Agreement, each Pledgor hereby covenants and agrees with, and represents and warrants to, the Agent and the Secured Creditors as follows: 
  (a)    The certificates for all shares of stock, equity interests and other securities owned by each Pledgor (other than securities evidencing an ownership interest in any entity whose total  
  
   -3- 

assets are less than or equal to $5,000,000) in each case to the extent certificated now or at any time constituting the Pledged Securities shall be delivered to the Agent duly endorsed in blank for transfer or accompanied by an appropriate assignment or assignments or an appropriate undated stock power or powers, in every case sufficient to transfer title thereto.  The Agent may at any time after the occurrence of an Event of Default and during the continuance thereof cause to be transferred into its name or the name of its nominee or nominees any and all of the Pledged Securities hereunder.  The Agent shall at all times have the right to exchange the certificates representing the Pledged Securities for certificates of smaller or larger denominations. 
  (b)    Each Pledgor is and will be the sole and lawful legal and beneficial owner of all of the Pledged Securities deposited by such Pledgor hereunder.  Each Pledgor agrees not to sell, assign, pledge or otherwise dispose of any of such Pledgor s Pledged Securities or any interest therein except for the security interest granted to the Agent hereunder and liens permitted by Sections 4.1 and 7.11 of the Credit Agreement and except for the sale or other disposition of Pledged Securities permitted by the Credit Agreement (including, without limitation, Sections 7.13 of the Credit Agreement).  In the case of such permitted sale, disposition or dissolution, the Agent shall release the lien upon such Pledged Securities and deliver such Pledged Securities to the relevant Pledgor.  The Pledged Securities are and will be free and clear of all security interests, Liens, rights, claims, attachments, levies and encumbrances of every kind, nature and description and whether voluntary or involuntary except for the pledge to the Agent hereunder and for other Liens permitted by the Credit Agreement, and each Pledgor will warrant and defend all Pledged Securities which such Pledgor has deposited with the Agent against any claims and demands of all other persons at any time claiming the same or any interest therein adverse to the Agent and the Secured Creditors.  Each Pledgor has the right to vote the Pledged Securities (except as set forth herein) and there are no restrictions upon the voting rights associated with, or the transfer of, any of the Pledged Securities, except as provided by any law applicable to the sale of securities generally or the terms and provisions of this Agreement. 
  (c)    The Pledged Securities have been validly issued and are fully paid and non-assessable (except for the provisions of Section 630 of the Business Corporation Law of the State of New York as to New York corporations).  There are no outstanding commitments or other obligations of the issuers of the Pledged Securities to issue, and no options, warrants or other rights of any individual or entity to acquire, any share of any class or series of capital stock or other equity interests of such issuers.  Except otherwise indicated on Schedule A, the Pledged Securities listed and described on Schedule A attached hereto constitute all of the issued and outstanding capital stock or other equity interests of every series and class of each issuer thereof.  Each Pledgor further agrees that in the event any such issuer shall issue any additional capital stock of any series or class, each Pledgor will forthwith pledge and deposit hereunder, or cause to be pledged and deposited hereunder, all such additional shares of such capital stock. 
  (d)    On failure of any Pledgor to perform any of the agreements and covenants herein contained, the Agent may perform the same and in so doing may expend such sums as the Agent may deem advisable in the performance thereof, including without limitation the payment of any  
  
   -4- 

taxes, liens and encumbrances, expenditures made in defending against any adverse claim or demand and all other expenditures which the Agent may be compelled to make by operation of law or which Agent may make by agreement or otherwise for the protection of the security hereof.  All such sums and amounts so expended shall be due and payable, immediately without notice or demand, shall constitute additional Obligations hereby secured together with interest thereon at the rate per annum (computed on the basis of a year of 360 days) determined by adding 2% to the interest rate otherwise applicable to Base Rate Loans under the Revolving Facility from time to time in effect (such rate per annum as so determined being hereinafter referred to as the    Reimbursement Rate   ).  No such performance of any covenant or agreement by the Agent on behalf of such Pledgor, and no such advancement or expenditure therefor, shall relieve such Pledgor of any default under the terms of this Agreement or in any way obligate the Agent or any Secured Creditor to take any further or future action with respect thereto.  The Agent is authorized to charge any depository account of any Pledgor maintained with the Agent for the amount of such sums and amounts so expended. 
  (e)    Each Pledgor represents that this Agreement, together with its delivery to the Agent of the certificates evidencing the Pledged Securities and stock powers therefor, creates a valid security interest securing payment and performance of the Obligations and that no other action is necessary to perfect such security interest.  Each Pledgor agrees to execute and deliver to the Agent such further agreements and assignments or other instruments and to do all such other things as the Agent may deem reasonably necessary or appropriate to assure the Agent of such Pledgor s pledge of the Pledged Securities hereunder. 
  (f)    If, as and when any Pledgor delivers any securities for pledge hereunder in addition to those listed on Schedule A hereto, the Pledgors shall furnish the Agent a duly completed and executed amendment to such Schedule in substantially the form (with appropriate insertions) of Schedule B hereto reflecting the securities pledged hereunder after giving effect to such addition. 
           SECTION 4. 
    VOTING RIGHTS AND DIVIDENDS. 
     Unless and until an Event of Default hereunder has occurred and is continuing: 
  (a)    Each Pledgor shall be entitled to exercise all voting and/or consensual powers pertaining to such Pledgor s Pledged Securities or any part thereof, for all purposes not inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement, the Credit Agreement, or any other document evidencing or otherwise relating to any Obligations. 
  (b)    To the extent not prohibited by the terms of the Credit Agreement, each Pledgor shall be entitled to receive and retain all dividends and distributions in respect of the Pledged Securities which are paid in cash or other property of whatsoever nature.   
  (c)    In order to permit each Pledgor to exercise such voting and/or consensual powers which he is entitled to exercise under clause (a) above and to receive such distributions which such  
  
   -5- 

Pledgor is entitled to receive and retain under clause (b) above, the Agent shall, if necessary, upon the written request of such Pledgor, from time to time execute and deliver to such Pledgor appropriate proxies and dividend orders. 
           SECTION 5. 
    POWER OF ATTORNEY.   
     In addition to any other powers of attorney contained herein, each Pledgor hereby appoints the Agent, its nominee, or any other person whom the Agent may designate as such Pledgor s attorney in fact, with full power and authority upon the occurrence and during the continuation of any Event of Default to ask, demand, collect, receive, receipt for, sue for, compound and give acquittance for any and all sums or properties which may be or become due, payable or distributable in respect of the Pledged Securities or any part thereof, with full power to settle, adjust or compromise any claim thereunder or therefor as fully as such Pledgor could itself do, to exercise all voting rights with respect to the Pledged Securities or any part thereof, to endorse or sign the Pledgor s name on any assignments, stock powers or other instruments of transfer and on any checks, notes, acceptances, money orders, drafts, and any other forms of payment or security that may come into the Agent s possession and on all documents of satisfaction, discharge or receipt required or requested in connection therewith, and, in its discretion, to file any claim or take any other action or proceeding, either in its own name or in the name of such Pledgor, or otherwise, which the Agent deems necessary or appropriate to collect or otherwise realize upon all or any part of the Pledged Securities, or effect a transfer thereof, or which may be necessary or appropriate to protect and preserve the right, title, and interest of the Agent in and to such Pledged Securities and the security intended to be afforded hereby.  Each Pledgor hereby ratifies and approves all acts of any such attorney and agrees that neither the Agent nor any such attorney will be liable for any such acts or omissions nor for any error of judgment or mistake of fact or law other than such person s gross negligence or willful misconduct as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction; provided that, in no event shall they be liable for any punitive, exemplary, indirect or consequential damages.  The foregoing powers of attorney, being coupled with an interest, are irrevocable until the Obligations have been fully paid and satisfied and all commitments of the Lenders to extend credit to or for the account of the Borrowers under the Credit Agreement have expired or otherwise terminated (including Cash Collateralization of Letters of Credit). 
           SECTION 6. 
    DEFAULTS AND REMEDIES. 
     (a)     The occurrence of any event or the existence of any condition which is specified as an  Event of Default  under the Credit Agreement shall constitute an    Event of Default    hereunder. 
  (b)    Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default hereunder, all rights of the Pledgors to exercise the voting and/or consensual powers which they are entitled to exercise pursuant to Section 4(a) hereof and/or to receive and retain the distributions which they are entitled to receive and retain pursuant to Section 4(b) hereof, shall, at the option of the Agent, cease and thereupon become vested in the Agent, which, in addition to all other rights provided herein or by law, shall then be entitled solely and exclusively to exercise all voting and other consensual powers pertaining to the Pledged Securities and/or to receive and retain the distributions which the Pledgors would otherwise have been authorized to retain  
  
   -6- 

pursuant to Section 4(b) hereof and shall then be entitled solely and exclusively to exercise any and all rights of conversion, exchange or subscription or any other rights, privileges or options pertaining to the Pledged Securities as if the Agent were the absolute owner thereof including, without limitation, the rights to exchange, at its discretion, any and all of the Pledged Securities upon the merger, consolidation, reorganization, recapitalization or other readjustment of the respective issuer thereof or upon the exercise by or on behalf of any such issuer or the Agent of any right, privilege or option pertaining to the Pledged Securities and, in connection therewith, to deposit and deliver any and all of the Pledged Securities with any committee, depositary, transfer agent, registrar or other designated agency upon such terms and conditions as the Agent may determine. 
  (c)    Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default hereunder, the Agent shall have, in addition to all other rights provided herein or by law, the rights and remedies of a secured party under the Uniform Commercial Code of New York in respect to the Pledged Securities (regardless of whether such Uniform Commercial Code is the law of the jurisdiction where the rights or remedies are asserted and regardless of whether such Code applies to the affected Pledged Securities) and further the Agent may, without demand and without advertisement or notice, all of which the Pledgors waive to the extent permitted by law, at any time or times, sell and deliver any or all of the Pledged Securities held by or for it at public or private sale, at any securities exchange or broker s board or at any of the Agent s offices or elsewhere, for cash, upon credit or otherwise, at such prices and upon such terms as the Agent deems advisable, in its sole discretion.  In the exercise of any such remedies, the Agent may sell all the Pledged Securities as a unit even though the sales price thereof may be in excess of the amount remaining unpaid on the Obligations.  Also, if less than all the Pledged Securities are sold, the Agent shall have no duty to marshal or apportion the part of the Pledged Securities so sold as between the Pledgors, or any of them, but may sell and deliver any or all of the Pledged Securities without regard to which of the Pledgors are the owners thereof.  The Agent is authorized at any sale or other disposition of the Pledged Securities, if it deems it advisable so to do, to restrict the prospective bidders or purchasers to persons who will represent and agree that they are purchasing for their own account for investment, and not with a view to the distribution or resale of any of the Pledged Securities.  The Agent or any Secured Creditor may be the purchaser at any sale or other disposition of the Pledged Securities.  The Pledgors hereby waive all of their rights of redemption from any sale or other disposition of the Pledged Securities.  Any requirement of reasonable notice shall be met if such notice is personally served on or mailed, postage prepaid, to the Pledgors in accordance with Section 11(h) hereof at least ten (10) days before the time of sale or other event giving rise to the requirement of such notice;   provided, however,   no notification need be given to a Pledgor if such Pledgor has signed, after an Event of Default hereunder has occurred, a statement renouncing any right to notification of sale or other intended disposition.  The Agent shall not be obligated to make any sale or other disposition of the Pledged Securities regardless of notice having been given.  The Agent may postpone or cause the postponement of the sale of all or any portion of the Pledged Securities by announcement at the time and place of such sale, and such sale may, without further notice, be made at the time and place to which the sale was postponed or the Agent may further postpone such sale by announcement made at such time and place.  The proceeds of sale shall be applied first to all costs and expenses of sale, including attorney s fees and court costs, and second to the payment of the Obligations in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.   
  
   -7- 

(d)    No delay or omission on the part of the Agent in the exercise of any right or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver of such right or remedy, nor shall the exercise of any such right or remedy preclude the later or further exercise thereof.  All rights or remedies of the Agent on account of the collateral or on account of any of the indebtedness hereby secured, whether arising under this Agreement, any other instrument or document, or at law or in equity, shall be cumulative and not exclusive of each other, and may be exercised by the Agent at such times and in such order as the Agent may determine.  The Pledgors agree to pay all costs and expenses (including court costs and reasonable attorney s fees) incurred by the Agent in enforcing or collecting any of the Obligations secured hereunder, in enforcing any of the terms hereof or in retaking, holding, preparing for sale, selling, collecting or otherwise realizing upon any Pledged Securities, including, without limitation, any of the foregoing arising in, arising under or related to a case under the United States Bankruptcy Code or any successor statute(s) thereto; and all such costs and expenses shall constitute additional Obligations hereby secured which shall be payable on demand together with interest thereon at the Reimbursement Rate.  Neither the Agent nor any Secured Creditor, nor any party acting as its attorney, shall be liable for any acts or omissions or for any error of judgment or mistake of fact or law other than such person s gross negligence or willful misconduct as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction. 
  (e)    EACH PLEDGOR HEREBY IRREVOCABLY CONSTITUTES AND APPOINTS THE AGENT AS ITS PROXY AND ATTORNEY-IN-FACT WITH RESPECT TO ITS PLEDGED SECURITIES, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO VOTE SUCH PLEDGED SECURITIES, WITH FULL POWER OF SUBSTITUTION TO DO SO. IN ADDITION TO THE RIGHT TO VOTE ANY SUCH PLEDGED SECURITIES, THE APPOINTMENT OF THE AGENT AS PROXY AND ATTORNEY-IN-FACT SHALL INCLUDE THE RIGHT TO EXERCISE ALL OTHER RIGHTS, POWERS, PRIVILEGES AND REMEDIES TO WHICH A HOLDER OF SUCH PLEDGED SECURITIES WOULD BE ENTITLED (INCLUDING GIVING OR WITHHOLDING WRITTEN CONSENTS OF SHAREHOLDERS OR OTHER EQUITY HOLDERS, CALLING SPECIAL MEETINGS OF SHAREHOLDERS OR OTHER EQUITY HOLDERS AND VOTING AT SUCH MEETINGS). SUCH PROXY SHALL BE EFFECTIVE, AUTOMATICALLY AND WITHOUT THE NECESSITY OF ANY ACTION (INCLUDING ANY TRANSFER OF ANY SUCH PLEDGED SECURITIES ON THE RECORD BOOKS OF THE ISSUER THEREOF) BY ANY PERSON (INCLUDING THE ISSUER OF SUCH PLEDGED SECURITIES OR ANY OFFICER OR AGENT THEREOF), UPON THE OCCURRENCE AND DURING THE CONTINUANCE OF AN EVENT OF DEFAULT.  EACH PLEDGOR HEREBY RATIFIES AND APPROVES ALL ACTS OF ANY SUCH ATTORNEY AND AGREES THAT NEITHER THE AGENT NOR ANY SUCH ATTORNEY WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY SUCH ACTS OR OMISSIONS NOR FOR ANY ERROR OF JUDGMENT OR MISTAKE OF FACT OR LAW OTHER THAN SUCH PERSON S GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT AS FINALLY DETERMINED BY A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION;   PROVIDED   THAT, IN NO EVENT SHALL THEY BE LIABLE FOR ANY PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES.  THE FOREGOING POWERS OF ATTORNEY AND PROXY, BEING COUPLED WITH AN INTEREST, ARE IRREVOCABLE UNTIL THE OBLIGATIONS HAVE BEEN FULLY PAID AND SATISFIED AND ALL COMMITMENTS OF THE LENDERS TO EXTEND CREDIT TO OR FOR THE ACCOUNT OF THE  
  
   -8- 

BORROWERS UNDER THE CREDIT AGREEMENT HAVE EXPIRED OR OTHERWISE TERMINATED (INCLUDING CASH COLLATERALIZATION OF LETTERS OF CREDIT). 
           SECTION 7. 
    PRIMARY SECURITY; OBLIGATIONS ABSOLUTE. 
     The pledge and security herein created and provided for stand as direct and primary security for the Obligations.  No application of any sums received by the Agent in respect of the Pledged Securities or any disposition thereof to the reduction of the Obligations or any portion thereof shall in any manner entitle any Pledgor to any right, title or interest in or to the Obligations or any collateral security therefor, whether by subrogation or otherwise, unless and until all Obligations have been fully paid and satisfied and each of the commitments of the Secured Creditors to extend credit or otherwise make financial accommodations available to the Borrowers, or any one of them, under the Credit Agreement have expired or otherwise have been terminated (including Cash Collateralization of Letters of Credit).  The Pledgors acknowledge and agree that the pledge and security hereby created and provided for are absolute and unconditional and shall not in any manner be affected or impaired by any acts or omissions whatsoever of the Agent, the Secured Creditors or any other holder of any Obligations, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the pledge and security hereof shall not be impaired by any acceptance by the Agent, the Secured Creditors or any other holder of any Obligations of any other security for or guarantors upon any Obligations or by any failure, neglect or omission on the part of the Agent, any Secured Creditor or any other holder of any Obligations to realize upon or protect any Obligations or any collateral security therefor.  The pledge and security hereof shall not in any manner be impaired or affected by (and the Agent and the Secured Creditors, without notice to anyone, are hereby authorized to make from time to time) any sale, pledge, surrender, compromise, settlement, release, renewal, extension, indulgence, alteration, substitution, exchange, change in, modification or disposition of any Obligations, or of any collateral security therefor, or of any guaranty thereof, or of the Credit Agreement, or any other instrument or document delivered in connection therewith.  The Secured Creditors may at their discretion at any time grant credit to the Borrowers, or any of them, without notice to the Pledgors in such amounts and on such terms as the Secured Creditors may elect without in any manner impairing the pledge and security hereby created and provided for.  In order to foreclose or otherwise realize hereon and to exercise the rights granted the Agent hereunder and under applicable law, there shall be no obligation on the part of the Agent or the Secured Creditors or any other holder of any Obligations at any time to first resort for payment to the Borrowers or to any other obligor on any Obligations or to any guaranty of the Obligations or any portion thereof or to resort to any other collateral security, property, liens or any other rights or remedies whatsoever, and the Agent shall have the right to enforce this instrument irrespective of whether or not other proceedings or steps are pending seeking resort to or realization upon or from any of the foregoing. 
           SECTION 8. 
    APPLICATION OF PROCEEDS. 
     The proceeds and avails of the Pledged Securities at any time received by the Agent after the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default hereunder shall, when received by the Agent in cash or its equivalent, be applied by the Agent in reduction of the Obligations as set forth in the Credit Agreement.  The Pledgors shall remain liable to the Agent and the Secured Creditors for any deficiency.  Any surplus remaining after the full payment and satisfaction of the Obligations shall be returned to the  
  
   -9- 

Borrowers on behalf of the Pledgors or to whomsoever a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine to be entitled thereto. 
           SECTION 9. 
    CONTINUING AGREEMENT. 
     This Agreement shall be a continuing agreement in every respect and shall remain in full force and effect until all of the Obligations, both for principal and interest, have been fully paid and satisfied and each of the commitments by the Secured Creditors to extend credit or otherwise make financial accommodations available to the Borrowers under the Credit Agreement have expired or otherwise have been terminated (including Cash Collateralization of Letters of Credit).  Upon such termination of this Agreement, the Agent shall, upon the request and at the expense of the Pledgors, forthwith release all its liens and security interests hereunder. 
   In acting under or by virtue of this Agreement, the Agent shall be entitled to all the rights, authority, privileges and immunities provided in the Credit Agreement, all of which provisions of the Credit Agreement (including, without limitation, Section 10 of the Credit Agreement) are incorporated by reference herein with the same force and effect as if set forth herein.  The Agent hereby disclaims any representation or warranty to the Secured Creditors concerning the perfection of the security interest granted hereunder or the value of the Pledged Securities. 
           SECTION 11. 
    MISCELLANEOUS. 
     (a)    Each Pledgor agrees to pay to the Agent upon demand the cost and expenses incurred by the Agent in connection with the filing of any financing statements or any other steps taken by the Agent in connection with the perfection or protection of such Pledgor s Pledged Securities hereunder and in connection with releasing such pledge and security interest herein granted and provided for upon termination hereof. 
  (b)    No waiver or modification or amendment to the terms of this Agreement shall be effective as against the Agent and the Secured Creditors unless the same is in writing and signed by an officer of the Agent.  No such waiver, modification or amendment shall in any way affect any of the rights or remedies of the Agent and the Secured Creditors hereunder except to the extent that such waiver, modification or amendment specifically provides. 
  (c)    This Agreement and all of the rights, privileges, remedies and options given to the Agent and the Secured Creditors hereunder and in and to any of the Pledged Securities hereunder shall inure to the benefit of the Agent and the Secured Creditors and their successors and assigns; and all the terms, conditions, promises, covenants, representations and warranties of and in this Agreement shall bind each Pledgor and its successors and assigns, provided that no Pledgor may assign its rights or delegate its duties hereunder without the Agent s prior written consent. 
  
   -10- 

(d)    In the event that any provision hereof shall be deemed to be invalid by reason of the operation of any law or by reason of the interpretation placed thereon by any court, this Agreement shall be construed as not containing such provision, but only as to such locations where such law or interpretation is operative, and the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of any remaining provision hereof, and any and all other provisions hereof which are otherwise lawful and valid shall remain in full force and effect. 
  (e)    No Secured Creditor shall have the right to institute any suit, action or proceeding in equity or at law for the enforcement of any remedy under or upon this Agreement; it being understood and intended that no one or more of the Secured Creditors shall have any right in any manner whatsoever to affect, disturb or prejudice the lien of this Agreement by its or their action or to enforce any right hereunder, and that all proceedings at law or in equity shall be instituted, had and maintained by the Agent in the manner herein provided and for the benefit of the Secured Creditors. 
  (f)    This Agreement shall be deemed to have been made in the State of New York.  This Agreement and all rights and obligations hereunder, including matters of construction, validity and performance shall be governed by the internal laws of the State of New York (including Section 5 1401 and Section 5 1402 of the General Obligations law of the State of New York) without regard to principles of conflicts of law.  All terms which are used in this Agreement which are defined in the Uniform Commercial Code of New York shall have the same meanings herein as said terms do in such Uniform Commercial Code unless this Agreement shall otherwise specifically provide.  The headings in this instrument are for convenience of reference only and shall not limit or otherwise affect the meaning of any provision hereof. 
  (g)    This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each constituting an original, but all together one and the same instrument.  Each Pledgor acknowledges that this Agreement is and shall be effective upon its execution and delivery by such Pledgor to the Agent, and it shall not be necessary for the Agent to execute this Agreement or any other acceptance hereof or otherwise to signify or express its acceptance hereof. 
  (h)    Except as otherwise specified herein, all notices hereunder shall be in writing (including, without limitation, notice by telecopy) and shall be given to the relevant party.  All notices to the Pledgors hereunder shall be made to the Company, as their agent, in accordance with Section 11.9 of the Credit Agreement. 
  (i)    In the event the Secured Creditors shall at any time in their discretion permit a substitution of Pledgors hereunder or a party shall wish to become a Pledgor hereunder, such substituted or additional Pledgor shall, upon executing an agreement in the form attached hereto as Schedule C, become a party hereto and be bound by all the terms and conditions hereof to the same extent as though such Pledgor had originally executed this Agreement and, in the case of a substitution, in lieu of the Pledgor being replaced.  No such substitution shall be effective absent the written consent of Secured Creditors nor shall it in any manner affect the obligations of the other Debtors hereunder. 
  (j)      JURY TRIAL WAIVER.    EACH PLEDGOR, THE AGENT, AND EACH SECURED CREDITOR HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY  
  
   -11- 

LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. 
  (k)      PERSONAL JURISDICTION  .  (i)   EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION.    EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN SUBSECTION (ii), EACH PLEDGOR, THE AGENT AND THE SECURED CREDITORS AGREE THAT ALL DISPUTES BETWEEN THEM ARISING OUT OF, CONNECTED WITH, RELATED TO, OR INCIDENTAL TO THE RELATIONSHIP ESTABLISHED BETWEEN THEM IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT, AND WHETHER ARISING IN CONTRACT, TORT, EQUITY, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL BE RESOLVED ONLY BY STATE OR FEDERAL COURTS LOCATED IN NEW YORK COUNTY, IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK, BUT EACH OF THE PLEDGORS, THE AGENT AND THE SECURED CREDITORS ACKNOWLEDGE THAT ANY APPEALS FROM THOSE COURTS MAY HAVE TO BE HEARD BY A COURT LOCATED OUTSIDE OF NEW YORK COUNTY, NEW YORK.  EACH PLEDGOR WAIVES IN ALL DISPUTES ANY OBJECTION THAT IT MAY HAVE TO THE LOCATION OF THE COURT CONSIDERING THE DISPUTE. 
  (ii)      OTHER JURISDICTIONS.    EACH PLEDGOR AGREES THAT THE AGENT AND THE SECURED CREDITORS SHALL HAVE THE RIGHT TO PROCEED AGAINST SUCH PLEDGOR OR ITS PROPERTY IN A COURT IN ANY LOCATION TO ENABLE THE AGENT OR ANY SECURED CREDITOR TO REALIZE ON SUCH PROPERTY, OR TO ENFORCE A JUDGMENT OR OTHER COURT ORDER ENTERED IN FAVOR OF THE AGENT OR ANY SECURED CREDITOR.  EACH PLEDGOR AGREES THAT IT SHALL NOT ASSERT ANY PERMISSIVE COUNTERCLAIMS IN ANY PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS PROVISION BY THE AGENT TO REALIZE ON SUCH PROPERTY, OR TO ENFORCE A JUDGMENT OR OTHER COURT ORDER IN FAVOR OF THE AGENT OR ANY SECURED CREDITOR.  EACH PLEDGOR WAIVES ANY OBJECTION THAT IT MAY HAVE TO THE LOCATION OF THE COURT IN WHICH THE AGENT OR ANY SECURED CREDITOR HAS COMMENCED A PROCEEDING DESCRIBED IN THIS SUBSECTION. 
  (l)    In the event of any inconsistency between this Agreement or the Credit Agreement, the terms of the Credit Agreement shall govern. 
  (m)    Upon the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company, the other Pledgors and the Agent, this Agreement shall supersede all provisions of the Prior Pledge Agreement as of such date.  Each Pledgor hereby agrees that, notwithstanding the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the liens and security interests created and provided for under the Prior Pledge Agreement continue in effect under and pursuant to the terms of this Agreement for the benefit of all of the Obligations secured hereby.  Nothing herein contained shall in any manner affect or impair the priority of the liens and security interests created and provided for by the Prior Pledge Agreement as to the indebtedness and obligations which would otherwise be secured thereby prior to giving effect to this Agreement.

SCHEDULE B 
  AMENDMENT TO FIFTH AMENDED AND RESTATED PLEDGE AGREEMENT 
  Reference is hereby made to that certain Fifth Amended and Restated Pledge Agreement dated as of August 3, 2016, as heretofore amended (the    Pledge Agreement   ), from the Pledgors signatory thereto to Bank of Montreal (   BMO   ), as administrative agent for the Secured Creditors (BMO acting as such administrative agent and any successor or successors to BMO in such capacity being hereinafter referred to as the    Agent   ).  Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meaning set forth in the Pledge Agreement.   
  Subsequent to the Pledgors  delivery of the Pledge Agreement, certain shares of stock have been added as Pledged Securities under the Pledge Agreement.  As a result of such addition, Schedule A of the Pledge Agreement does not accurately describe the shares of capital stock currently held by the Agent as collateral under the Pledge Agreement. 
  The Pledgors now desire to amend Schedule A to the Pledge Agreement to reflect such addition, and this instrument shall constitute an agreement between the Pledgors and the Agent amending the Pledge Agreement in the respects, but only in the respects, hereinafter set forth:  
  1.    Schedule A of the Pledge Agreement shall be and hereby is amended and as so amended shall be restated in its entirety to read as Annex A attached hereto.   
  2.    As collateral security for the Obligations, each Pledgor hereby grants to the Agent a continuing security interest in, and acknowledges and agrees that the Agent has and shall continue to have a continuing security interest in, all the shares of capital stock of each issuer listed and described on Annex A attached hereto and all the other properties, rights, interests and privileges comprising the Pledged Securities (as such term is defined in the Pledge Agreement after giving effect to this Amendment), to the same extent and with the same force and effect as if the shares of stock described on Annex A had originally been included on Schedule A to the Pledge Agreement.  The foregoing granting clause is in addition to and supplemental of and not in substitution for the granting clause contained in the Pledge Agreement.  Neither the Pledgors nor the Agent intend by this Amendment to in any way impair or otherwise affect the lien of the Pledge Agreement on such of the Pledged Securities which were subject to the Pledge Agreement prior to giving effect to this Amendment. 
  3.    Each Pledgor hereby repeats and reaffirms all of its covenants, agreements, representations and warranties contained in the Pledge Agreement, each and all of which shall be applicable to all of the stock and other properties, rights, interests and privileges subject to the lien of the Pledge Agreement after giving effect to this Amendment.  Each Pledgor hereby certifies that no Event of Default or event which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute an Event of Default exists under the Pledge Agreement after giving effect to this Amendment. 

4.    No reference to this Amendment need be made in any note, instrument or other document at any time referring to the Pledge Agreement, any reference in any of such to the Pledge Agreement to be deemed to reference to the Pledge Agreement as modified hereby.  All references in the Pledge Agreement to the term  Pledged Securities  shall be deemed a reference to such term as defined in the Pledge Agreement after giving effect to this Amendment. 
  5.    Except as specifically modified hereby, all the terms and conditions of the Pledge Agreement shall stand and remain unchanged and in full force and effect.  This Amendment shall be effective upon the Pledgors  execution and delivery thereof to the Agent, no acceptance by the Agent being required.

  1.    The New Pledgor acknowledges and agrees that it shall become a  Pledgor  party to the Pledge Agreement effective upon the date the New Pledgor s execution of this Agreement and the delivery of this Agreement to the Agent, and that upon such execution and delivery, all references in the Pledge Agreement to the terms  Pledgor  or  Pledgors  shall be deemed to include the New Pledgor.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the New Pledgor hereby repeats and reaffirms all grants (including the grant of a lien and security interest), covenants, agreements, representations and warranties contained in the Pledge Agreement as amended hereby, each and all of which are and shall remain applicable to the Pledged Securities from time to time owned by the New Pledgor or in which the New Pledgor from time to time has any rights.  Without limiting the foregoing, in order to secure payment of the Obligations, whether now existing or hereafter arising, the New Pledgor does hereby grant to the Agent for the benefit of the Secured Creditors,  

and hereby agrees that the Agent has and shall continue to have for the benefit of the Secured Creditors a continuing security interest in, among other things, all of the New Pledgor s Pledged Securities (as such term is defined in the Pledge Agreement) described in, and subject to the limitations set forth in, Section 2 of the Pledge Agreement, each and all of such granting clauses being incorporated herein by reference with the same force and effect as if set forth in their entirety except that all references in such clauses to the Existing Pledgor or any of them shall be deemed to include references to the New Pledgor.  Nothing contained herein shall in any manner impair the priority of the liens and security interests heretofore granted in favor of the Agent under the Pledge Agreement. 
  2.    The New Pledgor hereby acknowledges and agrees that the Obligations are secured by all of the Pledged Securities according to, and otherwise on and subject to, the terms and conditions of the Pledge Agreement to the same extent and with the same force and effect as if the New Pledgor had originally been one of the Existing Pledgors under the Pledge Agreement and had originally executed the same as such an Existing Pledgor. 
  3.    All capitalized terms used in this Agreement without definition shall have the same meaning herein as such terms have in the Pledge Agreement, except that any reference to the term  Pledgor  or  Pledgors  and any provision of the Pledge Agreement providing meaning to such term shall be deemed a reference to the Existing Pledgors and the New Pledgor.  Except as specifically modified hereby, all of the terms and conditions of the Pledge Agreement shall stand and remain unchanged and in full force and effect. 
  4.    The New Pledgor agrees to execute and deliver such further instruments and documents and do such further acts and things as the Agent may reasonably deem necessary or proper to carry out more effectively the purposes of this Agreement. 
  5.    No reference to this Agreement need be made in the Pledge Agreement or in any other document or instrument making reference to the Pledge Agreement, any reference to the Pledge Agreement in any of such to be deemed a reference to the Pledge Agreement as modified hereby. 
  6.    This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the State of New York (including Section 5 1401 and Section 5 1402 of the General Obligations law of the State of New York) without regard to principles of conflicts of law.

  NOW, THEREFORE, FOR VALUE RECEIVED, and in consideration of advances made or to be made, or credit accommodations given or to be given, to the Borrowers by the Lenders from time to time, each Guarantor hereby makes the following representations and warranties to the Guaranteed Creditors, and hereby covenants and agrees with the Guaranteed Creditors, as follows: 
  1.    All capitalized terms used herein without definition shall have the same meanings herein as such terms have in the Credit Agreement.  
  2.    Each Guarantor hereby jointly and severally guarantees to the Guaranteed Creditors, the due and punctual payment of all present and future Obligations and Hedging Liability, including, but not limited to, the due and punctual payment of principal of and interest on the Loans, the Reimbursement Obligations, and the due and punctual payment of all other Obligations now or hereafter owed by the Borrowers under the Loan Documents and the due and punctual payment of all Hedging Liability, in each case as and when the same shall become due and payable, whether at stated maturity, by acceleration, or otherwise, according to the terms hereof and thereof (including all interest, costs, fees, and charges after the entry of an order for relief against a Borrower or such other obligor in a case under the United States Bankruptcy Code or any similar proceeding, whether or not such interest, costs, fees and charges would be an allowed claim against the Borrower or any such obligor in any such proceeding);   provided, however,   that, with respect to any Guarantor, Hedging Liability guaranteed by such Guarantor shall exclude all Excluded Swap Obligations (all of the foregoing hereinafter referred to as the    indebtedness hereby guaranteed   ) and provided further that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the requirements of the Guarantors to guarantee the Guaranteed Creditors as provided herein shall remain subject in all respects to the provisions of Section 4.2 of the Credit Agreement.

  3.    Each Guarantor further jointly and severally agrees to pay all expenses, legal and/or otherwise (including court costs and reasonable attorneys  fees), paid or incurred by any Guaranteed Creditor in endeavoring to collect the indebtedness hereby guaranteed, or any part thereof, and in protecting, defending or enforcing this Guaranty in any litigation, bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings or otherwise. 
  
   -2- 

4.    Each Guarantor hereby agrees that this Guaranty is a guaranty of payment and not collection, and until the indebtedness hereby guaranteed is paid and satisfied in full and each of the commitments by the Guaranteed Creditors to extend any indebtedness hereby guaranteed have expired or otherwise have terminated, each Guarantor agrees that, upon demand, such Guarantor will then pay to the Agent for the benefit of the Guaranteed Creditors the full amount of the indebtedness hereby guaranteed whether or not any proceedings or steps are pending seeking payment of the indebtedness hereby guaranteed from any one or more of the other Guarantors.   
  5.    Each Guarantor agrees that such Guarantor will not exercise or enforce any right of exoneration, contribution, reimbursement, recourse or subrogation available to such Guarantor against any person liable for payment of the indebtedness hereby guaranteed, or as to any security therefor, unless and until the full amount owing to the Guaranteed Creditors of the indebtedness hereby guaranteed has been fully paid and satisfied and each of the commitments by the Guaranteed Creditors to extend any indebtedness hereby guaranteed to the Borrowers shall have expired or otherwise shall have terminated.  The payment by any Guarantor of any amount or amounts to the Guaranteed Creditors pursuant hereto shall not in any way entitle any such Guarantor, either at law, in equity or otherwise, to any right, title or interest (whether by way of subrogation or otherwise) in and to the indebtedness hereby guaranteed or any part thereof or any collateral security therefor or any other rights or remedies in any way relating thereto or in and to any amounts theretofore, then or thereafter paid or applicable to the payment thereof howsoever such payment may be made and from whatsoever source such payment may be derived unless and until all of the indebtedness hereby guaranteed and all costs and expenses suffered or incurred by the Guaranteed Creditors in enforcing this Guaranty have been paid and satisfied in full and each of the commitments by the Guaranteed Creditors to extend any indebtedness hereby guaranteed to the Borrowers shall have expired or otherwise shall have terminated and unless and until such payment in full and termination, any payments made by any Guarantor hereunder and any other payments from whatsoever source derived on account of or applicable to the indebtedness hereby guaranteed or any part thereof shall be held and taken to be merely payments in gross to the Guaranteed Creditors reducing pro tanto the indebtedness hereby guaranteed. 
  6.    To the extent permitted by the Credit Agreement, each Guaranteed Creditor may, without any notice whatsoever to any of the Guarantors, sell, assign, or transfer all of the indebtedness hereby guaranteed, or any part thereof, or grant participations therein, and in that event each and every immediate and successive assignee, transferee, or holder of all or any part of the indebtedness hereby guaranteed, shall have the right through the Agent pursuant to Section 20 hereof to enforce this Guaranty, by suit or otherwise, for the benefit of such assignee, transferee, or holder as fully as if such assignee, transferee, or holder were herein by name specifically given such rights, powers and benefits; but each Guaranteed Creditor through the Agent pursuant to Section 20 hereof shall have an unimpaired right to enforce this Guaranty for its own benefit, as to so much of the indebtedness hereby guaranteed that it has not sold, assigned or transferred.

7.    This Guaranty is a continuing, absolute and unconditional Guaranty, and shall remain in full force and effect until written notice of its discontinuance executed by the Borrowers and all the Guarantors shall be actually received by the Guaranteed Creditors, and also until any and all of the indebtedness hereby guaranteed which was created or existing before receipt of such notice shall be fully paid and satisfied and each of the commitments by the Guaranteed Creditors to extend any indebtedness hereby guaranteed to the Borrowers shall have expired or otherwise shall have terminated.  The dissolution of any Guarantor shall not terminate this Guaranty as to such Guarantor until notice of such dissolution shall have been actually received by the Guaranteed Creditors, nor until all of the indebtedness hereby guaranteed, created or existing or committed to be extended in each case before receipt of such notice shall be fully paid and satisfied.  The Guaranteed Creditors may at any time or from time to time release any Guarantor from its obligations hereunder or effect any compromise with any Guarantor and no such release or compromise shall in any manner impair or otherwise affect the obligations hereunder of the other Guarantors.  The Guaranteed Creditors shall release a Guarantor from its obligations hereunder upon a sale of all the outstanding capital stock owned by the Company and any Subsidiary as permitted by Sections 7.13 or 7.14 of the Credit Agreement.  No release, compromise, or discharge of any one or more of the Guarantors shall release, compromise or discharge the obligations of the other Guarantors hereunder. 
  8.    In case of the dissolution, liquidation (except as permitted by the Credit Agreement) or insolvency (howsoever evidenced) of, or the institution of bankruptcy or receivership proceedings against, any Borrower or any Material Restricted Subsidiary, all of the indebtedness hereby guaranteed which is then existing shall, at the option of the Lenders (as determined in accordance with the terms of the Credit Agreement), immediately become due or accrued and payable from the Material Restricted Subsidiary.  All payments received from any Borrower or on account of the indebtedness hereby guaranteed from whatsoever source, shall be taken and applied as payment in gross, and this Guaranty shall apply to and secure any ultimate balance that shall remain owing to the Guaranteed Creditors. 
  9.    The liability hereunder shall in no way be affected or impaired by (and the Guaranteed Creditors are hereby expressly authorized to make from time to time, without notice to any of the Guarantors) any sale, pledge, surrender, compromise, settlement, release, renewal, extension, indulgence, alteration, substitution, exchange, change in, modification or other disposition of any of the indebtedness hereby guaranteed, either express or implied, or of any Loan Document or any other contract or contracts evidencing any thereof, or of any security or collateral therefor or any guaranty thereof.  The liability hereunder shall in no way be affected or impaired by any acceptance by the Guaranteed Creditors of any security for or other guarantors upon any of the indebtedness hereby guaranteed, or by any failure, neglect or omission on the part of the Guaranteed Creditors to realize upon or protect any of the indebtedness hereby guaranteed, or any collateral or security therefor, or to exercise any lien upon or right of appropriation of any moneys, credits or property of any Borrower, possessed by the Guaranteed Creditors, toward the liquidation of the indebtedness hereby guaranteed, or by any application of payments or credits thereon.  The Guaranteed Creditors shall have the exclusive right to determine how, when and what application of payments and credits, if any, shall be made on said indebtedness hereby guaranteed, or any part of same.  In order to hold any Guarantor liable hereunder, there shall be no obligation on the part of the Guaranteed Creditors at any time, to resort for payment to the Borrowers or to any other Guarantor, or to any other person or entity, their  
  
   -4- 

properties or estate, or resort to any collateral, security, property, liens or other rights or remedies whatsoever, and the Guaranteed Creditors shall have the right to enforce this Guaranty against any Guarantor irrespective of whether or not other proceedings or steps are pending seeking resort to or realization upon or from any of the foregoing. 
  10.    In the event the Guaranteed Creditors shall at any time in their discretion permit a substitution of Guarantors hereunder or a party shall wish to become Guarantor hereunder, such substituted or additional Guarantor shall, upon executing an agreement in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A, become a party hereto and be bound by all the terms and conditions hereof to the same extent as though such Guarantor had originally executed this Guaranty and, in the case of a substitution, in lieu of the Guarantor being replaced.  No such substitution shall be effective absent the written consent of the Guaranteed Creditors nor shall it in any manner affect the obligations of the other Guarantors hereunder. 
  11.    All diligence in collection or protection, and all presentment, demand, protest and/or notice, as to any and everyone, whether or not the Borrowers or the Guarantors or others, of dishonor and of default and of non-payment and of the creation and existence of any and all of said indebtedness hereby guaranteed, and of any security and collateral therefor, and of the acceptance of this Guaranty, and of any and all extensions of credit and indulgence hereunder, are expressly waived. 
  12.    No act of commission or omission of any kind, or at any time, upon the part of the Guaranteed Creditors in respect to any matter whatsoever, shall in any way affect or impair this Guaranty. 
  13.    The Guarantors waive any and all defenses, claims and discharges of the Borrowers, or any other obligor, pertaining to the indebtedness hereby guaranteed, except the defense of discharge by payment in full.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Guarantors will not assert, plead or enforce against the Guaranteed Creditors any defense of waiver, release, discharge in bankruptcy, statute of limitations, res judicata, statute of frauds, anti deficiency statute, fraud, incapacity, minority, usury, illegality or unenforceability which may be available to the Borrowers or any other person liable in respect of any of the indebtedness hereby guaranteed, or any set-off available against the Guaranteed Creditors to the Borrowers or any such other person, whether or not on account of a related transaction.  The Guarantors agree that the Guarantors shall be and remain jointly and severally liable for any deficiency remaining after foreclosure or other realization on any lien or security interest securing the indebtedness hereby guaranteed, whether or not the liability of the Borrowers or any other obligor for such deficiency is discharged pursuant to statute or judicial decision. 
  14.    If any payment applied by the Guaranteed Creditors to the indebtedness hereby guaranteed is thereafter set aside, recovered, rescinded or required to be returned for any reason (including, without limitation, the bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of any Borrower or any other obligor), the indebtedness hereby guaranteed to which such payment was applied shall for the purposes of this Guaranty be deemed to have continued in existence, notwithstanding such application, and this Guaranty shall be enforceable as to such of the indebtedness hereby guaranteed as fully as if such application had never been made. 
  
   -5- 

15.    The liability of the Guarantors under this Guaranty is in addition to and shall be cumulative with all other liabilities of the Guarantors after the date hereof to the Guaranteed Creditors as a Guarantor of the indebtedness hereby guaranteed, without any limitation as to amount, unless the instrument or agreement evidencing or creating such other liability specifically provides to the contrary. 
  16.    Each Qualified ECP Guarantor (as hereinafter defined) hereby jointly and severally absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably undertakes to provide such funds or other support as may be needed from time to time by each  other Guarantor to honor all of its obligations under this Guaranty in respect of Swap Obligations (provided, however, that each Qualified ECP Guarantor shall only be liable under this Section for the maximum amount of such liability that can be hereby incurred without rendering its obligations under this Section, or otherwise under this Guaranty, voidable under applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer, and not for any greater amount).  The obligations of each Qualified ECP Guarantor under this Section shall remain in full force and effect until the indebtedness hereby guaranteed is paid in full and each of the Commitments by the Guaranteed Creditors to extend any indebtedness hereby guaranteed to the Borrowers shall have expired or otherwise shall have terminated.

  17.    Any invalidity or unenforceability of any provision or application of this Guaranty shall not affect other lawful provisions and applications hereof, and to this end the provisions of this Guaranty are declared to be severable.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, any invalidity or unenforceability against any Guarantor of any provision or application of the Guaranty shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the provisions or application of this Guaranty as against the other Guarantors.  
  18.    Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the right of recovery against any Guarantor under this Guaranty shall not exceed $l less than the lowest amount which would render such Guarantor s obligations under this Guaranty void or voidable under applicable law, including fraudulent conveyance law.   
  19.    Any demand for payment on this Guaranty or any other notice required or desired to be given hereunder to any Guarantor shall be deemed to have been validly served, given or delivered to such Guarantor when given to such Guarantor or when given to the Company in accordance with the Credit Agreement.

Any obligation of the Guarantors not discharged by such payment shall, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, be due as a separate and independent obligation and, until discharged as provided herein, shall continue in full force and effect. 
  22.      JURY TRIAL WAIVER.    EACH GUARANTOR AND EACH GUARANTEED CREDITOR HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS GUARANTY OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

EACH GUARANTOR AGREES THAT IT WILL NOT ASSERT ANY PERMISSIVE COUNTERCLAIMS IN ANY PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS PROVISION BY THE GUARANTEED CREDITORS TO REALIZE ON PROPERTY, OR TO ENFORCE A JUDGMENT OR OTHER COURT ORDER IN FAVOR OF THE GUARANTEED CREDITORS.  EACH GUARANTOR WAIVES ANY OBJECTION THAT IT MAY HAVE TO THE LOCATION OF THE COURT IN WHICH THE GUARANTEED CREDITORS HAS COMMENCED A PROCEEDING DESCRIBED IN THIS SUBSECTION.

THIS GUARANTY SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED ACCORDING TO THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK (including Section 5 1401 and Section 5 1402 of the General Obligations law of the State of New York without regard to principles of conflicts of law) in which state it shall be performed by the Guarantors and may not be waived, amended, released or otherwise changed except by a writing signed by the Agent on behalf of the Guaranteed Creditors.

 SEVERENCE AGREEMENT BETWEEN EMCOR AND MAURICIO

Exhibit 

EXHIBIT 10(l-1) 
  SEVERANCE AGREEMENT 
  THIS AGREEMENT dated as of October __, 2016, is made by and between EMCOR Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and Maxine L. Mauricio ("Executive"). 
  WHEREAS the Company considers it essential to the best interests of its stockholders to foster the continuous employment of key management personnel; and 
  WHEREAS the Board has determined that appropriate steps should be taken to reinforce and encourage the continued attention and dedication of Executive to her assigned duties; 
  NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual covenants herein contained, the Company and Executive hereby agree as follows: 
  1.  Defined Terms  .  The definitions of capitalized terms used in this Agreement are provided in Article 20 hereof. 
  2.      Company's Covenants Summarized  .  In order to induce Executive to remain in the employ of the Company and its consideration of Executive's covenants set forth in Article 6 hereof, the Company agrees, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, to pay Executive the "Severance Payments" described in Article 3 hereof and the other payments and benefits described herein in the event Executive's employment with the Company is terminated under certain circumstances.  No amount or benefit shall be payable under this Agreement unless there shall have been a termination of Executive's employment with the Company, as described in Articles 3, 4 or 5 hereof.  This Agreement shall not be construed as creating an express or implied contract of employment, and, except as otherwise agreed in writing between Executive and the Company, Executive shall not have any right to be retained in the employ of the Company and the Company may terminate Executive's employment at any time and Executive may terminate her employment at any time. 
  3.      Severance Payments  .    3.01.    Subject to Sections 6.04 and 6.05 hereof, the Company shall pay Executive the amounts, and provide the benefits, described in this Article 3 (the "Severance Payments") upon the termination of Executive's employment with the Company, unless such termination is by the Company for Cause, by reason of death or Permanent Disability of Executive, or by Executive without Good Reason.    3.02.    In lieu of any further salary payments or bonuses to Executive for periods subsequent to the Date of Termination and in lieu of any severance benefit otherwise payable to Executive (except as provided for in the Company s Long Term Incentive Plan), the Company shall pay to Executive (A) two times Executive s Base Salary in effect immediately prior to the occurrence of the event or circumstance upon which the Notice of Termination is based, (B) an amount equal to Executive s target Non-Plan Award for the calendar year in which her employment terminates, multiplied by a fraction (the  Applicable Fraction ), the numerator of which is the number of days in such calendar year Executive was an employee of the Company, and the denominator of which is 365, and (C) an amount equal to the payment, if any, that Executive would have been paid in respect of her Plan Award for the calendar year in which her employment terminates had Executive been employed by  

the Company for the entire calendar year, multiplied by the Applicable Fraction; provided, however, that the amount payable to Executive under clauses (B) and (C) of this sentence shall not exceed, in the aggregate, the Applicable Fraction multiplied by the maximum aggregate annual incentive award that could have been payable to her for the year in which her employment terminates had she been employed by the Company for the entire calendar year.  Subject to the provisions of Sections 6.04 and 6.05, the amount set forth in clause (A) of the immediately preceding sentence shall be payable in advance in 8 equal quarterly installments commencing with the Date of Termination and on each succeeding 90   th    day thereafter, subject to Section 21(a); the amount set forth in clause (B) of the immediately preceding sentence shall be payable in accordance with Section 21(a); and the amount set forth in clause (C) of the immediately preceding sentence shall be payable, if at all, on the later of the date six months after the date of Executive s separation from service and the date when similar annual incentive awards under the Company s Key Executive Incentive Bonus Plan, or if not then in effect, granted under any similar plan, (the  Plan) are paid to the other senior executives of the Company who have remained in its employ throughout such calendar year.  For purposes of the foregoing,  Plan Award  shall mean the award opportunity, if any, granted under the Plan (which award opportunity is intended, to the extent applicable, to qualify for the performance-based compensation exception under Section 162(m) of the Code), and  Non-Plan Award  shall mean any other annual cash performance based incentive award opportunity or opportunities to Executive (other than, for the avoidance of doubt, under the Company Long Term Incentive Plan) for the calendar year in which her employment terminates.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Executive s employment terminates in a termination described in this Section 3.01 during a calendar year before the terms of annual award opportunities for such year shall have been established under the Plan or any other annual incentive program for the year of termination, then for purposes of this Section 3.02 (a) her target Non-Plan Award for such year of termination shall be deemed to be her target Non-Plan Award for the immediately preceding calendar year, and (b) her Plan Award for such year of termination shall be determined by assuming the same dollar pay-out opportunities (expressed as a percentage of her then salary) as Executive had under her Plan Award for the immediately preceding calendar year, but with performance based on the Company performance goals established under the Plan for the year of termination.    3.03.    In addition to the amounts described in Section 3.02 above, Executive shall be entitled to receive:        (a)    until 18 months from the Date of Termination, Executive (and, to the extent applicable, Executive's dependents) shall continue to be covered, at the Company's expense, under the Company's medical, dental and hospitalization insurance plans and until 12 months from the Date of Termination, Executive shall continue to be covered, at the Company's expense, under the Company's group life and accidental death and dismemberment insurance plans; provided that if Executive is provided with comparable coverage by a successor employer any such coverage by the Company shall cease;         (b)    all payments to which Executive has vested rights as of the Date of Termination under any employee benefit, disability, insurance and similar plans which provide for payments beyond the period of employment; and   
  
   2 

(c)    all unpaid amounts, as of the Date of Termination, in respect of any bonus for any calendar year ending before the calendar year in which the Date of Termination occurs, which would have been payable had Executive remained in the Company's employ until such bonus would have been paid. 
  4.      Permanent Disability  .      4.01.    The Company may terminate Executive's employment by reason of her Permanent Disability, and in such case the compensation to which Executive is entitled shall be paid through the last day of the month in which the notice is given.  In addition, in such case Executive shall be entitled to receive: 
  (a)    all unpaid amounts, as of the Date of Termination, in respect of any annual incentive awards for any calendar year ending before the calendar year in which such termination occurs, which would have been payable had Executive remained in the Company s employ until the date such annual incentive awards would otherwise have been paid, plus an amount equal to Executive s target annual incentive awards for the calendar year in which her employment terminates multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in such calendar year Executive was an employee of the Company and the denominator of which is 365.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Executive s employment terminates in a termination described in this Section 4.01 during a calendar year before the terms of the annual award opportunities for such year shall have been established for the year of termination, then for purposes of this Section 4.01 such target annual incentive awards shall be deemed to be those for the immediately preceding calendar year; 
  (b)    for 18 months from the Date of Termination , Executive (and, to the extent applicable, Executive's dependents) shall continue to be covered, at the Company's expense, under the Company's medical, dental, hospitalization insurance plans, and until 12 months from the Date of Termination Executive shall continue to be covered, at the Company's expense, under the Company's group life and accidental death and dismemberment insurance plans; provided that if Executive is provided with comparable coverage by a successor employer any such coverage by the Company shall cease; and 
  (c)    all amounts payable under the Company's disability plans, in accordance with their terms.    4.02.    Nothing herein contained shall affect Executive's right to any benefits that may accrue under the terms of any other Company benefit plans by reason of Executive's Permanent Disability. 
  5.      Death  .   5.01.    In the event of Executive s death while an employee of the Company, Executive s estate or designated beneficiaries shall receive (i) payments of Executive s Base Salary for a period of three months after the date of death; (ii) all unpaid amounts, as of the date of death, in respect of any annual incentive awards for any calendar year ending before the calendar year in which such death occurs, which would have been payable had Executive remained in the Company s employ until the date such annual incentive awards would otherwise have been paid, plus an amount equal to (i) Executive s target annual incentive awards for the calendar year in which her death occurs multiplied  
  
   3 

by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in such calendar year Executive was an employee of the Company, and the denominator of which is 365; and (iii) any death benefits provided under the employee benefit programs, in accordance with their terms.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Executive s employment terminates in a termination described in this Section 5.01 during a calendar year before the terms of annual award opportunities for such year shall have been established for the year of termination, then for purposes of this Section 5.01, such target annual award opportunities shall be deemed to be those for the immediately preceding calendar year.    5.02.    Nothing herein contained shall affect Executive's rights to any benefits that may accrue under the terms of any other Company death benefit plan or life insurance policy or programs by reason of Executive's death. 
  6.      Confidential Information, Non-Competition, Non-Solicitation, etc.    
  6.01.    Executive hereby acknowledges and agrees that all personal property, including, without limitation, all books, manuals, records, reports, notes, contracts, lists, and other documents, equipment and other Confidential Information furnished to or prepared by Executive in the course of or incident to her employment, belong to the Company and shall be promptly returned to the Company upon termination of her employment with the Company.  Executive agrees not to disclose to any person (other than an employee or agent of the Company or any affiliate of the Company entitled to receive the same) any Confidential Information relating to the business of the Company and obtained by her while providing services to the Company, without the consent of the Board, or until such information ceases to be confidential. Nothing in this Agreement limits, restricts or in any other way affects Executive s communicating with any governmental agency or entity, or communicating with any official or staff person of a governmental agency or entity, concerning matters relevant to the governmental agency or entity that do not constitute attorney-client privileged information of the Company.  Executive cannot be held criminally or civilly liable under any federal or state trade secret law for disclosing a trade secret (1) in confidence to a federal, state, or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney, solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law, or (2) in a complaint or other document filed under seal in a lawsuit or other proceeding.  Notwithstanding this immunity from liability, Executive may be held liable if the Executive unlawfully accesses trade secrets by unauthorized means. 
  (a)    Upon termination of her employment by the Company, Executive shall be deemed to have resigned from all offices and directorships then held with the Company or any subsidiary or affiliate thereof. 
  (b)    Executive and the Company shall not (except as required by law) directly or indirectly make any statement or release any information, or encourage others to make any statement or release any information that is designed to embarrass or criticize the other (or their respective employees, directors or shareholders). 

4 

6.02.    During the period of Executive's employment by the Company and for two years following the Date of Termination, Executive shall not, in any state in the United States where a member of the Restricted Group conducts business, directly or indirectly own, manage, operate, conduct, control or participate as a director, officer, employee, consultant, partner, or equity owner or otherwise, in the ownership, management, operation, conduct or control, or accept employment with, or be connected in any other manner with, any business (a  "Business") that is in competition with any member of the Restricted Group, except for ownership of no more than 2% of the debt or equity securities of corporations listed on a registered securities exchange, provided, however, that a Business shall not be deemed to be in competition with any members of the Restricted Group if (i) no more than 20% of the annual consolidated revenues of such Business (based upon its most recently completed fiscal year) are attributable to one or more business activities ("Incidental Competitive Activity") that are in competition with any member of the Restricted Group and (ii) Executive is not engaged, directly or indirectly, in such Incidental Competitive Activity and has no direct or indirect responsibility for, or oversight of, such Incidental Competitive Activity.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of this Section 6.02 shall not apply if (A) in the case of any Notice of Termination given by Executive for Good Reason or (B) in the case of any Notice of Termination given by the Company without Cause, Executive prior to the receipt of any Severance Payments or portion thereof irrevocably and unconditionally waives in writing the right to receive any Severance Payments and accompanies such waiver with an executed form of release attached hereto as Appendix A which release is not thereafter revoked. 
  6.03.    For one year following the Date of Termination, Executive shall not (without the prior written consent of the Company), either on her own behalf or on behalf of any person, firm or company, directly or indirectly (a) solicit, encourage or participate in soliciting or encouraging any customer or supplier of any member of the Restricted Group, or any other person or entity to terminate (or otherwise adversely alter) such person or entity's customer, supplier or other relationship with such member of the Restricted Group, and/or (b) hire any person who is at the time of the offer of employment, or within six months prior to such offer was, an employee of any member of the Restricted Group or encourage or participate in soliciting or encouraging any employee of any member of the Restricted Group to terminate (or otherwise adversely alter) such person's employment relationship with such member of the Restricted Group. 
  6.04.    As a condition of receiving payments and benefits under this Agreement, Executive agrees to sign the form of release attached hereto as Appendix A.    6.05.    Executive and the Company agree that the covenants set forth in this Article 6 are reasonable covenants under the circumstances, and further agree that, if in the opinion of any court of competent jurisdiction, such restraint is not reasonable in any respect, this Agreement shall be deemed modified to the least degree necessary to make the Agreement reasonable and fully enforceable.  Executive agrees that any breach of the covenants contained in this Article 6 would irreparably injure the Company.  Accordingly, Executive agrees that the Company may, in addition to pursuing any other remedies it may have in law or in equity, cease making any payments and/or providing benefits otherwise required by this Agreement, including those provided for in Article 3 hereof, and obtain an injunction against Executive from any court having jurisdiction over the matter restraining any further violation of this Agreement by Executive.

7.      Termination Procedures  . 
  7.01.    Any purported termination of Executive's employment with the Company (other than by reason of death) shall be communicated by written Notice of Termination from one party hereto to the other party hereto in accordance with Article 9 hereof.  For purposes of this Agreement a "Notice of Termination", in the case of termination for Cause, shall mean delivery to Executive of a copy of a resolution duly adopted by the Board at a meeting of the Board called and held for that purpose (after not less than 10 days notice to Executive ("Preliminary Notice") and reasonable opportunity for Executive, together with Executive's counsel, to be heard before the Board prior to such vote) finding, that in good faith opinion of the Board, Executive was guilty of conduct constituting Cause and specifying the particulars thereof in detail.  The Board shall not later than 30 days after the receipt of the Preliminary Notice by Executive communicate its findings to Executive.  A failure by the Board to make its finding of Cause or to communicate its conclusions within such 30-day period shall be deemed to be a finding that Executive was not guilty of conduct constituting Cause. 
  7.02.    "Date of Termination", with respect to any purported termination of Executive's employment, shall mean (a) if Executive's employment is terminated for Permanent Disability, thirty (30) days after the Company shall have given Executive a Notice of Termination for disability; provided that Executive shall not have returned, within such 30-day period, to the full-time performance of Executive s duties, and (b) if Executive's employment is terminated for any other reason, the date specified in the Notice of Termination (which, in the case of a termination by the Company, shall not be less than thirty (30) days (except in the case of a termination for Cause) and, in the case of a termination by Executive, shall not be less than thirty (30) days nor more than sixty (60) days, respectively, from the date such Notice of Termination is given). 
  8.      No Mitigation; Generally No Offset  .  The Company agrees that, if Executive's employment is terminated, Executive is not required to seek other employment or to attempt in any way to reduce any amounts payable to Executive by the Company pursuant to Article 3.  Further, the amount of any payment or benefit provided for in Article 4 (other than as provided in Sections 3.03(a) and 4.01(b)) shall not be reduced by any compensation earned by Executive as the result of employment by another employer, by retirement benefits, by offset against any amount claimed to be owed by Executive to the Company or any of its subsidiaries, or otherwise.

  10.      Agreement to Perform Necessary Acts  .  Each party agrees to perform any further acts and to execute and deliver any further documents that may be reasonably necessary to carry out the provisions of this Agreement. 
  11.      Separability; Legal Actions; Legal Fees  .

Any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the breach of this Agreement that cannot be resolved by Executive and the Company, including any dispute as to the calculation of Executive's benefits or any payments hereunder, shall be submitted to arbitration in New York, New York in accordance with the laws of the State of New York and the procedures of the American Arbitration Association, except that if Executive institutes an action relating to this Agreement, Executive may, at Executive's option, bring that action in any court of competent jurisdiction.  Judgment may be entered on an arbitrator(s) award in any court having jurisdiction. 
  In addition to all other amounts payable to Executive under this Agreement, the Company shall pay or reimburse Executive for legal fees (including without limitation, any and all court costs and attorneys' fees and expenses) incurred by Executive in connection with or as a result of any claim, action or proceeding brought by the Company or Executive with respect to or arising out of this Agreement or any provision hereof, unless, in the case of an action brought by Executive, it is determined by an arbitrator or by a court of competent jurisdiction that such action was frivolous and was not brought in good faith.  Such legal fees shall be paid or reimbursed by the Company to Executive from time to time within five business days following receipt by the Company of copies of bills for such fees and if the Company fails to make such payment within such five day period, the Company shall pay Executive interest thereon at the rate of 5% per annum.

  12.      Assignment  .

  13.      Amendment; Waiver  .  The Agreement may be amended at any time, but only by mutual written agreement of the parties hereto. Any party may waive compliance by the other party with any provision hereof, but only by an instrument in writing executed by the party granting such waiver. 
  14.      Entire Agreement  .

  16.      Survivorship  . The respective rights and obligations of the parties hereunder shall survive any termination of this Agreement to the extent necessary to the intended preservation of such rights and obligations.  The provisions of this Article are in addition to the survivorship provisions of any other Article of this Agreement.

For purposes of this Agreement, all references to termination of employment, retirement, separation from service and similar or correlative terms shall mean a "separation from service" (as defined at Section 1.409A-1(h) of the Treasury Regulations) from the Company and from all other corporations and trades or businesses, if any, that would be treated as a single "service recipient" with the Company under Section 1.409A-1(h)(3) of the Treasury Regulations; and the term "specified employee" shall mean an individual who is determined by the Company to be a specified employee as defined in subsection (a)(2)(B)(i) of Section 409A.  The Company may, but need not, elect in writing, subject to the applicable limitations under Section 409A of the Code, any of the special elective rules prescribed in Section 1.409A-1(i) of the Treasury Regulations for purposes of determining "specified employee" status.  Any such written election shall be deemed part of this Agreement."   
  (b)      Continuation of Certain Coverage  .  In any case where the Company is obligated to provide coverage under Section 3.03(a) or Section 4.01(b), the Company at its option may provide such coverage directly under its own plans, and, for the avoidance of doubt, shall provide such coverage on a basis that to the extent permitted by applicable law is, in whole or in part, taxable or nontaxable, provided, that any such coverage that can be provided on a nontaxable basis shall be so provided unless the Company determines that to do so would result in adverse tax consequences to Executive, to other current or former employees of the Company or to the Company.  If in the Company s good faith determination continued coverage under its own plans would be impracticable notwithstanding diligent effort by the Company or would result in adverse tax consequences to Executive, to other current or former employees of the Company or to the Company, the Company may instead provide Executive with cash in an amount such that Executive may obtain coverage under other insurance policies providing coverage that is at least equivalent to the coverage under the Company s plans, including deductibles, co-payment percentages or amounts, and maximum coverage amounts.  Any provision of coverage, including cash payments as herein provided, shall be accomplished in a manner that to the Company s satisfaction either complies with Section 409A or with the requirements for exemption from Section 409A.         IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this amended and restated employment agreement as of the date first above written.

 CONTINUITY AGREEMENT BETWEEN EMCOR AND MAURICIO

Exhibit 

EXHIBIT 10(l-2) 
  CONTINUITY AGREEMENT 
    
  This Agreement ("Agreement") dated as of October __, 2016 by and between the EMCOR GROUP, INC., a Delaware corporation (the "Company"), and MAXINE L. MAURICIO ("Executive"). 
    
  WHEREAS, the Company's Board of Directors (the "Board") considers the continued services of key executives of the Company to be in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders; and 
    
  WHEREAS, the Board desires to assure, and has determined that it is appropriate and in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders to reinforce and encourage the continued attention and dedication of key executives of the Company to their duties of employment without personal distraction or conflict of interest in circumstances arising from the possibility or occurrence of a change of control of the Company; and 
    
  WHEREAS, the Board has authorized the Company to enter into continuity agreements with those key executives of the Company who are designated by the Compensation and Personnel Committee of the Board of Directors ("Committee"), such agreements to set forth the severance compensation which the Company agrees under certain circumstances to pay such executives; and 
    
  WHEREAS, Executive is a key executive of the Company and has been designated by the Committee as an executive to be offered such a continuity compensation agreement with the Company. 
    
  NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the promises and the mutual covenants and agreements contained herein and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the Company and Executive agree as follows: 
    
  1.       Term of Agreement  .  On the date on which a Change of Control occurs (the "Effective Date"), this Agreement shall become effective.  If Executive ceases to be employed by reason of an Anticipatory Termination (as defined in Section 3 (c)) prior to the Effective Date, then Executive shall receive the severance benefits provided herein and the Effective Date of this Agreement shall be deemed to be the date immediately preceding the occurrence of an Anticipatory Termination.  If Executive ceases to be employed for any reason other than an Anticipatory Termination prior to a Change of Control (as hereafter defined), this Agreement shall terminate and have no effect and Executive shall receive such severance payments as are provided in any existing agreement between Executive and the Company. 
    
  If a Change of Control occurs, Executive's employment shall be continued hereunder for the period (the "Employment Period") commencing on the Effective Date and ending on the second anniversary of the date on which a Change of Control occurs, subject to the termination of Executive's employment as described hereinafter. 

For purposes of this Agreement, a "Change of Control" shall be deemed to have occurred when: 
    
  (i)     any person or persons acting in concert (excluding Company benefit plans) becomes the beneficial owner of securities of the Company having at least 25% of the voting power of the Company's then outstanding securities; or 
    
  (ii)     the stockholders of the Company shall approve any merger or other business combination of the Company, sale or lease of the Company's assets or combination of the foregoing transactions (the "Transactions") other than a Transaction immediately following which the stockholders of the Company and any trustee or fiduciary of any Company employee benefit plan immediately prior to the Transaction own at least 65% of the voting power, directly or indirectly, of (A) the surviving corporation in any such merger or other business combination; (B) the purchaser or lessee of the Company's assets; or (C) both the surviving corporation and the purchaser or lessee in the event of any combination of Transactions; or 
    
  (iii)     within any 24 month period, the persons who were directors immediately before the beginning of such period (the "Incumbent Directors") shall cease (for any reason other than death) to constitute at least a majority of the Board or the board of directors of a successor to the Company.  For this purpose, any director who was not a director at the beginning of such period shall be deemed to be an Incumbent Director if such director was elected to the Board by, or on the recommendation of or with the approval of, at least two-thirds of the directors who then qualified as Incumbent Directors (so long as such director was not nominated by a person who has expressed an intent to effect a Change of Control or engage in a proxy or other control contest). 
    
  2.      Employment following Change of Control  .  Executive shall have at least the same titles and responsibilities as those in effect immediately prior to the Change of Control.  Executive shall receive an annual base salary which is not less than that in effect immediately prior to the Change of Control and the Company shall review the salary annually with a view to increasing it; provided any such increase shall be in the sole discretion of the Board.  Once increased, base salary can not be decreased.  Executive shall also be paid an annual bonus (the "Bonus") which shall be no less than the higher of (i) the aggregate bonuses paid or payable in respect of the year prior to the Change of Control, or (ii) the average of the annual aggregate bonuses paid or payable in respect of the three years prior to the Change of Control.  In addition, Executive shall be provided with incentive compensation, pension, general insurance and fringe benefits and perquisites that are commensurate with the benefits and perquisites provided to Executive immediately prior to the Change of Control or, if more favorable to Executive, at the level made available to other similarly situated executive officers of the Company after the Change of Control. Upon the Change of Control, the Company shall also cause Executive's outstanding options to become immediately exercisable. 

2 

3.      Termination Following Change of Control  . 
    
  (a)    Executive shall be entitled to the severance benefits provided in Section 4 hereof in the event Executive's employment is terminated (A) within two years following a Change of Control (i) by the Company without Cause or (ii) by Executive for Good Reason or (B) prior to a Change of Control, as a result of an Anticipatory Termination. 
    
  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Executive shall not be entitled to severance benefits in the event of a termination of employment on account of death, Disability or Retirement, but excluding any such termination which is coincident with a termination which would otherwise give rise to severance benefits or subsequent to an event constituting Good Reason.  For purposes of this Agreement: 
    
  (i) "Disability" shall mean an illness or injury preventing Executive from performing her duties, as they existed immediately prior to the illness or injury, on a full time basis for 180 consecutive business days. 
    
  (ii) "Retirement" shall mean a termination of employment by Executive pursuant to late, normal or early retirement under a pension plan sponsored by the Company, as defined in such plan. 
    
  (b)      Cause  .  For purposes of this Agreement, "Cause" shall mean: 
    
  (i)     the willful and continued failure of Executive to perform substantially Executive's duties with the Company (other than any such failure resulting from incapacity due to physical or mental illness), after a written demand for substantial performance is delivered to Executive by the Board or an officer of the Company which specifically identifies the manner in which the Board or the officer believes that Executive has not substantially performed Executive's duties; or 
    
  (ii)    (A) the conviction of, or plea of guilty or nolo contendere to, a felony or (B) the willful engaging by Executive in gross misconduct which is materially and demonstrably injurious to the Company. 
    
  In each case above, for a termination of employment to be for Cause: (a) Executive must be provided with a Notice of Termination (as described in Section 3 (d)); (b) Executive must be provided with an opportunity to be heard by the Board no earlier than 30 days following the Notice of Termination (during which notice period Executive has failed to cure or resolve the behavior in question); and (c) there must be a good faith determination of Cause by at least 3/4 of the non-employee outside directors of the Company. 

3 

(c)      Good Reason and Anticipatory Termination  . For purposes of this Agreement, "Good Reason" shall mean: 
    
  (i)    Executive's annual salary is reduced below the higher of (A) the amount in effect on the Effective Date, or (B) the highest amount in effect at any time thereafter; 
    
  (ii)    Executive's annual aggregate bonuses are reduced below the Bonus; 
    
  (iii)    Executive's duties and responsibilities or the program of incentive compensation and retirement and general insurance benefits offered to Executive are materially and adversely diminished in comparison to the duties and responsibilities or the program of benefits enjoyed by Executive on the Effective Date;  
    
  (iv)    Executive is required to be based at a location more than 50 miles from the location where Executive was based and performed services on the Effective Date; or 
    
  (v)    failure to provide for and obtain the assumption of this Agreement by any successor entity; 
    
  provided, however, that any diminution of duties or responsibilities that occurs solely as a result of the fact that the Company ceases to be a public company shall not, in and of itself, constitute Good Reason.   
    
  Any event or condition described in clauses (i) through (v) or a termination without Cause, either of which occurs prior to a Change of Control but which Executive reasonably demonstrates (A) was at the request of a third party who has indicated an intention or taken steps reasonably calculated to effect a Change of Control (a "Third Party"), or (B) otherwise arose in connection with, or in anticipation of a Change of Control, shall constitute Good Reason for purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding that it occurred prior to a Change of Control ("Anticipatory Termination"). 
    
  Executive shall give the Company written notice of any event which she claims is the basis for Good Reason and the Company shall have 30 days within which to cure or resolve the behavior in question before Executive can terminate for Good Reason. 
    
  (d)      Notice of Termination  .  Any purported termination of Executive's employment with the Company shall be communicated by a Notice of Termination to Executive, if such termination is by the Company, or to the Company, if such termination is by Executive.  For purposes of this Agreement, "Notice of Termination" shall mean a written notice which shall indicate the specific termination provision in this Agreement relied upon and shall set forth in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances claimed to provide a basis for termination of Executive's employment under the provisions so indicated.  For purposes of this Agreement, no purported termination of Executive's employment with the Company shall be effective without such a Notice of Termination having been given. 

4 

(e)      Dispute Resolution  .  Disputes arising from the operation of this Agreement, including, but not necessarily being limited to, the manner of giving the Notice of Termination, the reasons or cause for Executive's termination or the amount of severance compensation due to Executive subsequent to Executive's termination, may be resolved, at Executive's discretion, by arbitration; provided, however, that disputes arising under Section 11 of this Agreement shall not be resolved under this Section 3 (e).  In the event that any such dispute which Executive elects to be resolved by arbitration, after notice thereof is given to the other party in writing, is not able to be resolved by mutual agreement of the parties within sixty (60) calendar days of the giving of such notice, Executive and the Company hereby agree to promptly submit such a dispute to binding arbitration in New York, New York in accordance with New York law and the rules and procedures of the American Arbitration Association.  During any period in which a dispute between the Company and Executive is pending, Executive shall continue to receive her salary (including any Bonus), as provided in Section 2 hereof, and benefits as if her employment with the Company had continued through the date of the final determination thereof (i.e. after decision following any trial or arbitration proceeding and after all appeals therefrom has run), and any such payments or benefits shall not be offset against any severance, either under this Agreement or otherwise, to which Executive may be entitled. 
    
  4.      Compensation Upon Termination After a Change of Control  . 
    
  If within two (2) years after the Effective Date, Executive's employment by the Company shall be terminated in accordance with Section 3 (a) (the "Termination"), Executive shall be entitled to the following payments and benefits: 
    
  (a)       Severance  .  As soon as practicable after the Termination, but in any event no later than 10 business days following such Termination, the Company shall pay or cause to be paid to Executive, a lump sum cash amount equal to three (3) times the sum of (i) Executive's annual base salary on the Effective Date (the "Base Salary"), (ii) the Bonus, and (iii) the value of the perquisites (e.g., car allowance, club dues, etc., including any ordinary tax gross-ups for perquisites) provided to Executive in respect of the year prior to the Change of Control and, if greater, the year in respect of which the Change of Control occurs.  In addition, at the time of the above payment, Executive shall be entitled to an additional lump sum cash payment equal to the sum of (A) Executive's annual salary through the date of termination, (B) an amount equal to Executive s annual aggregate bonuses, for any calendar year ending before such termination occurs, which would have been payable had Executive remained employed until the date such bonus would otherwise have been paid, (C) a pro rata portion of the Bonus (calculated through the date of termination); and (D) an amount, if any, equal to compensation previously deferred (excluding any qualified plan deferral) and any accrued vacation pay, in each case, in full satisfaction of Executive's rights thereto.  If payment of the amounts referred to herein is not made by the Company to Executive within such 10 day period, the Company shall pay Executive interest thereon at the rate of 10% per annum.   

5 

(b)      Additional Benefits  .  Executive shall be entitled to continued medical, dental and life insurance coverage for Executive and Executive's eligible dependents on the same basis as in effect prior to the Change of Control or Executive's Termination of employment, whichever is deemed to provide for more substantial benefits, until the earlier of (A) thirty-six (36) months (the "Separation Period") after Executive's Termination or (B) the commencement of comparable coverage with a subsequent employer; provided, however, that such continued coverage shall not count against any continued coverage required by law. 
    
  (c)      Outplacement  .  If so requested by Executive, outplacement services shall be provided by a professional outplacement provider at a cost to the Company of not more than 20% of Executive's Base Salary. 
    
  (d)      Withholding  .  Payments and benefits provided pursuant to this Section 4 shall be subject to any applicable payroll and other taxes required to be withheld. 
    
  5.         Certain Adjustments  : 
    
  (a)     Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, if any payment or distribution by the Company to or for the benefit of Executive, whether paid or payable or distributed or distributable pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or otherwise pursuant to or by reason of any other agreement, policy, plan, program or arrangement, including without limitation any stock option, stock appreciation right or similar right, or the lapse or termination of any restriction on or the vesting or exercisability of any of the foregoing (a "Payment"), would (but for this Section 5) be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code (including any successor provision, the  Code ) or to any similar tax imposed by state or local law (collectively, the "Excise Tax") and if the aggregate amount of all Payments, after reduction for all taxes (including but not limited to the Excise Tax) with respect thereto would be increased by the limitation or elimination of any Payment, including by an adjustment to the vesting of any equity-based or other awards that would otherwise vest on an accelerated basis in connection with the Change of Control, then the Payments shall be reduced (including by an adjustment to vesting where applicable) to the extent, and only to the extent, necessary to maximize Executive s total after-tax Payments.  Any reduction or adjustment required by the immediately preceding sentence shall be applied to the Payments as follows:  (i) first, by reducing any outplacement services required to be taken into account under Section 280G of the Code and the regulations thereunder ( Section 280G  (ii) second, by reducing the severance payable under Section 4(a) above; (iii) third, by adjusting the acceleration of the vesting of any awards to which the rules of Treasury Regulations Section 1.280G-1, Q/A-24(a) apply; (iv) by reducing the benefits under Section 4(b) above to the extent such benefits are required to be taken into account under Section 280G; and (v) fifth, by adjusting the acceleration of the vesting of any awards to which the rules of Treasury Regulations Section 1.280G-1, Q/A-24(c) apply.  In the case of any category of reductions or adjustments described in the preceding sentence that includes both Payments that are includible in income and Payments that are not, any reduction or adjustment shall first be made to Payments within that category that are includible in income; and in the case of any category of reductions or adjustments described in the preceding sentence that includes amounts that are to be paid or provided in installments, any  
  
   6 

reduction or adjustment shall first be made in the reverse of the order in which such installments are scheduled to be paid. 
    
  (b)    All determinations required to be made under this Section 5 shall be made by the nationally recognized firm of certified public accountants (the "Accounting Firm") used by the Company prior to the Change of Control (or, if such Accounting Firm declines to serve, the Accounting Firm shall be a nationally recognized firm of certified public accountants selected by Executive). The Accounting Firm shall be directed by the Company or Executive to submit its determination and detailed supporting calculations to both the Company and Executive within 15 calendar days after the Termination Date, if applicable, and any other such time or times as may be requested by the Company or Executive.  The Accounting Firm shall, at the same time as it makes such determination, furnish Executive with an opinion that, after taking into account any adjustments under Section 5(a) above, she has substantial authority not to report any Excise Tax. 
    
  (c)    The Company and Executive shall each provide the Accounting Firm access to and copies of any books, records and documents in the possession of the Company or Executive, as the case may be, reasonably requested by the Accounting Firm, and otherwise cooperate with the Accounting Firm in connection with the preparation and issuance of the determination contemplated by Section 5(b) hereof. 
    
  (d)    The federal, state and local income or other tax returns filed by Executive and the Company (or any filing made by a consolidated tax group which includes the Company) shall be prepared and filed on a consistent basis with the determination of the Accounting Firm hereunder.  If, after an initial determination by the Accounting Firm under Section 5(b) above (an  Initial Determination ), it is determined by a competent tax authority or by the Accounting Firm (a  Later Determination ) that, notwithstanding such Initial Determination and any related reductions or adjustments under Section 5(a) above, any reduced or adjusted Payments were subject to the Excise Tax, the Payments shall be further and automatically reduced and adjusted to the extent (but only to the extent) required to eliminate exposure to the Excise Tax, but only if the resulting Payments would, on an after-tax basis, be greater than without such further reduction or adjustment.  If as a result of a Later Determination it is determined that Executive has already been paid any Payment that should not have been paid (any such amount, an  Excess Payment ), Executive shall forthwith and in all events within thirty (30) days of such Later Determination refund such Excess Payment to the Company, with interest at the applicable federal rate provided for in Section 7872(f)(2) of the Code. If, after an Initial Determination, a Later Determination determines that Executive s Benefits were reduced or adjusted more than was required under Section 5(a), such reductions and adjustments shall be automatically corrected and the Company shall forthwith and in all events within thirty (30) days of such Later Determination pay or provide to Executive, with interest at the applicable federal rate provided for in Section 7872(f)(2) of the Code, any Payments that should earlier have been made but were not made because of the Initial Determination.  Executive and the Company shall cooperate in good faith, including by prompt notice by each to the other with respect to any relevant audit or determination by a competent tax authority, to effectuate the purposes of this Section 5(d). 

7 

(e)    The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm for its services in connection with the determinations and calculations contemplated by Sections 5(b) and (d) hereof shall be borne by the Company.  If such fees and expenses are initially advanced by Executive, the Company shall reimburse Executive the full amount of such fees and expenses within five business days after receipt from Executive of a statement therefor and reasonable evidence of her payment thereof.  If such amounts are not reimbursed to Executive by the Company within such five day period, the Company shall pay Executive interest thereon at the rate of 10% per annum. 
    
  (f)    In the event of any claim by a competent tax authority asserting that, notwithstanding the application of this Section 5, Executive may be subject to the Excise Tax, Executive shall notify the Company in writing as promptly as practicable but no later than 10 business days after Executive actually receives notice of such claim and at the request of the Company shall: 
    
  (i)    provide the Company with any written records or documents in her possession relating to such claim reasonably requested by the Company; 
    
  (ii)    take such action in connection with contesting such claim as the Company shall reasonably request in writing from time to time, including without limitation accepting legal representation with respect to such claim by an attorney competent in respect of the subject matter and reasonably selected by the Company; 
    
            (iii)    cooperate with the Company in good faith in order effectively to contest such claim; and 
    
            (iv)    permit the Company to participate in any proceedings relating to such claim;  
    
  provided, however, that the Company shall bear and pay directly all costs and expenses (including interest and penalties) incurred in connection with such claim and shall indemnify and hold harmless Executive, on an after-tax basis, for and against any Excise Tax or income tax, including interest and penalties with respect thereto, imposed as a result of such claim, representation and payment of costs and expenses.  Without limiting the foregoing provisions of this Section 5(f), the Company shall control all proceedings taken in connection with the contest of any claim contemplated by this Section 5(f) and, at its sole option, may pursue or forego any and all administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings and conferences with the taxing authority in respect of such claim (provided however, that Executive may participate therein at her cost and expense) and may, at its option, either direct Executive to pay the tax claimed and sue for a refund or contest the claim in any permissible manner, and Executive agrees to prosecute such contest to a determination before any administrative tribunal, in a court of initial jurisdiction and in one or more appellate courts, as the Company shall determine; provided, however, that if the Company directs Executive to pay the tax claimed and sue for a refund, the Company shall, to the extent consistent with applicable law, advance the amount of such payment to Executive on an interest-free basis and shall indemnify and hold Executive harmless, on an after-tax basis, from any Excise Tax or income tax, including interest or penalties with respect thereto, imposed with respect to such advance; and provided further, however, that any extension of the statute of limitations relating to payment of taxes for the taxable  
  
   8 

year of Executive with respect to which the contested amount is claimed to be due is limited solely to such contested amount.  Furthermore, the Company's control of any such contested claim shall be limited to issues with respect to which the Company would have an indemnity obligation hereunder and Executive shall be entitled to settle or contest, as the case may be, any other issue raised by the Internal Revenue Service or any other taxing authority.  
    
  (g)    If, after the receipt by Executive of an amount advanced by the Company pursuant to Section 5(f) hereof, Executive receives any refund with respect to such claim, Executive shall (subject to the Company's complying with the requirements of Section 5(f) hereof) promptly pay to the Company the amount of such refund (together with any interest paid or credited thereon after any taxes applicable thereto). If, after the receipt by Executive of an amount advanced by the Company pursuant to Section 5(f) hereof, a determination is made that Executive is not entitled to any refund with respect to such claim and the Company does not notify Executive in writing of its intent to contest such denial or refund prior to the expiration of 30 calendar days after such determination, then such advance shall be forgiven and shall not be required to be repaid. 
    
  6.       Obligations Absolute; No Mitigation; No Effect On Other Rights. 
    
  (a)    The obligations of the Company to make the payment to Executive, and to make the arrangements, provided for herein are absolute and unconditional and may not be reduced by any circumstances, including without limitation any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right which the Company may have against Executive or any third party at any time. 
    
  (b)    Executive shall not be required to mitigate the amount of any payment provided for in this Agreement by seeking other employment or otherwise and no such payment shall be offset or reduced by the amount of any compensation or benefits provided to Executive in any subsequent employment. 
    
  (c)    The provisions of this Agreement, and any payment provided for herein, shall not supersede or in any way limit the rights, benefits, duties or obligations which Executive may now or in the future have under any benefit, incentive or other plan or arrangement of the Company or any other agreement with the Company. 
    
  7.      Not an Employment Agreement  .  Subject to the terms of this or any other agreement or arrangement between the Company and Executive that may then be in effect, nothing herein shall prevent the Company from terminating Executive's employment. 

9 

8.      Successors; Binding Agreement, Assignment. 
    
  (a)    The Company shall require any successor (whether direct or indirect, by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business of the Company, by agreement to expressly, absolutely and unconditionally assume and agree to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that the Company would be required to perform it if no such succession had taken place. Failure of the Company to obtain such agreement prior to the effectiveness of any such succession shall be a material breach of this Agreement and shall entitle Executive to terminate Executive's employment with the Company or such successor for Good Reason immediately prior to or at any time after such succession. As used in this Agreement, "Company" shall mean (i) the Company as hereinbefore defined, and (ii) any successor to all or substantially all of the Company's business or assets which executes and delivers an agreement provided for in this Section 8(a) or which otherwise becomes bound by all the terms and provisions of this Agreement by operation of law, including any parent or subsidiary of such a successor. 
    
  (b)    This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by Executive's personal or legal representatives, executors, administrators, successors, heirs, distributees, devisees and legatees.  If Executive should die while any amount would be payable to Executive hereunder if Executive had continued to live, all such amounts, unless otherwise provided herein, shall be paid in accordance with the terms of this Agreement to Executive's estate or designated beneficiary.   Neither this Agreement nor any right arising hereunder may be assigned or pledged by Executive. 
    
  9.          Notice  . For purposes of this Agreement, notices and all other communications provided for in this Agreement or contemplated hereby shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given when personally delivered or when mailed United States certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, or by nationally recognized overnight courier service, and addressed, in the case of the Company, to the Company at:

  and in the case of Executive, to Executive at the most current address shown on Executive's employment records. Either party may designate a different address by giving notice of change of address in the manner provided above, except that notices of change of address shall be effective only upon receipt.

10.      Expenses  .  In addition to all other amounts payable to Executive under this Agreement, the Company shall pay or reimburse Executive for legal fees (including without limitation, any and all court costs, arbitration costs, and attorneys' fees and expenses), incurred by Executive in connection with or as a result of any claim, action or proceeding brought by the Company or Executive with respect to or arising out of this Agreement or any provision hereof, unless, in the case of an action brought by Executive, it is determined by an arbitrator or by a court of competent jurisdiction that such action was frivolous and was not brought in good faith.  Such legal fees shall be paid or reimbursed by the Company from time to time within five business days following receipt by the Company of copies of bills for such fees and if the Company fails to make such payment within such five day period, the Company shall pay Executive interest thereon at the rate of 10% per annum. 
    
  11.      Confidentiality.     Executive shall retain in confidence any and all confidential information concerning the Company and its respective business which is now known or hereafter becomes known to Executive, except as otherwise required by law and except information (i) ascertainable or obtained from public information, (ii) received by Executive at any time after Executive's employment by the Company shall have terminated, from a third party not employed by or otherwise affiliated with the Company or (iii) which is or becomes known to the public by any means other than a breach of this Section 11.  Upon any termination of Executive's employment, Executive shall not take or keep any proprietary information or documentation belonging to the Company.  Nothing in this Agreement limits, restricts or in any other way affects Executive s communicating with any governmental agency or entity, or communicating with any official or staff person of a governmental agency or entity, concerning matters relevant to the governmental agency or entity that do not constitute attorney-client privileged information of the Company.  Executive cannot be held criminally or civilly liable under any federal or state trade secret law for disclosing a trade secret (1) in confidence to a federal, state, or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney, solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law, or (2) in a complaint or other document filed under seal in a lawsuit or other proceeding.  Notwithstanding this immunity from liability, Executive may be held liable if the Executive unlawfully accesses trade secrets by unauthorized means. 
    
  12.      Miscellaneous.     No provision of this Agreement may be amended, altered, modified, waived or discharged unless such amendment, alteration, modification, waiver or discharge is agreed to in writing signed by Executive and such officer of the Company as shall be specifically designated by the Committee or by the Board. No waiver by either party, at any time, of any breach by the other party of, or of compliance by the other party with, any condition or provision of this Agreement to be performed or complied with by such other party shall be deemed a waiver of any similar or dissimilar provision or condition of this Agreement or any other breach of or failure to comply with the same condition or provision at the same time or at any prior or subsequent time. No agreements or representations, oral or otherwise, express or implied, with respect to the subject matter hereof have been made by either party which are not expressly set forth in this Agreement. The validity, interpretation, construction and performance of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York without giving effect to its conflict of laws rules. Any action brought by Executive or the Company shall be brought and maintained in a court of competent jurisdiction in the State of New York. 
  
   11 

13.      Severability  . If any one or more of the provisions of this Agreement shall be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall not be affected thereby. To the extent permitted by applicable law, each party hereto waives any provision of law which renders any provision of this Agreement invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect. 
    
  14.      Counterparts  .  This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be an original and all of which shall be deemed to constitute one and the same instrument. 
    
  15.      Entire Agreement  . This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior oral or written agreements, commitments or understanding with respect to the matters provided for herein. 
    
  16.      Certain Tax Matters  .  The provisions of this Section 16 shall apply, where applicable, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary.  References herein to  Section 409A  shall mean Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, (the  Code ) together with the regulations and other applicable guidance thereunder. 
    
  (a)  Section 409A  .   
    
           a. 
    Delay in payment; other forms of payment  .  Subject to the following sentence, any payments payable under Section 4(a) shall be paid in a lump sum six months following Executive s separation from service, unless at the relevant time Executive is no longer a specified employee.  Any payments payable under Section 4(a), if payable other than within the two-year period following a  change in control event  as that term is defined in the Treasury Regulations under Section 409A, shall be paid in the same form (e.g., a lump sum or installments), and at the same time or over the same period as in that certain Severance Agreement between the Company and Executive dated the date hereof.  The responsibility for determining whether a Change of Control is a  change in control event  as defined above shall rest with the Committee; provided, that in the absence of an express and reasonable determination to the contrary with respect to a Change of Control and to the extent consistent with Section 409A, the Compensation Committee shall be deemed to have determined that the Change of Control is a  change in control event  as so defined.  

12 

b. 
    Certain in-kind benefits and reimbursements  .  All in-kind benefits required to be provided hereunder, and all reimbursements provided for herein, shall be subject to and paid in accordance with the reimbursement/in-kind benefit rules under Section 409A, including any related policies of the Company.  
       
           c. 
    Good Reason  .  In any case where Executive terminates employment for  Good Reason  under Section 3(a), she shall give notice of the act or omission asserted to be the basis for such termination within ninety (90) days after Executive becomes aware or such act or omission, and if the Company fails to cure within the thirty (30)-day period specified in Section 3(a), Executive s date of termination shall be not later than sixty (60) days following the end of such thirty (30)-day period. 
       
           d. 
    Adjustments  .  The additional payment or payments described in Section 5(f) shall be paid as soon as practicable after any amounts referred to therein are paid by Executive and in all events within 30 days such payment.   
       
           e. 
    Compliance with Section 409A  .  It is the mutual intent of the parties that the payment terms under this Agreement comply with the requirements of Section 409A, and that they be construed accordingly.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing and for the avoidance of doubt, any lump-sum payment of deferred compensation pursuant to Section 4(a)(D) shall be made in such form only to the extent consistent with Section 409A, taking into account the provisions of the underlying deferral plan or agreement or any termination thereof accomplished in a manner consistent with Section 409A, and otherwise such deferred compensation shall be paid as provided in the underlying deferral plan or agreement. 
       
           f. 
    Definitions.    For purposes of this Agreement, all references to termination of employment, retirement, separation from service and similar or correlative terms shall mean a  separation from service  (as defined in Section 1.409A-1(h) of the Treasury Regulations) from the Company and from all other corporations and trades or businesses, if any, that would be treated as a single  service recipient  with the Company under Section 1.409A-1(h)(3) of the Treasury Regulations; and the term  specified employee  shall mean an individual who is determined by the Company to be a specified employee as defined in subsection (a)(2)(B)(i) of Section 409A.  The Company may, but need not, elect in writing, subject to the applicable limitations under Section 409A of the Code, any of the special elective rules prescribed in Section 1.409A-1(i) of the Treasury Regulations for purposes of determining  specified employee  status.  Any such written election shall be deemed part of this Agreement. 

13 

(b) 
    Continuation of Certain Coverage  .  In any case where the Company is obligated to provide coverage under Section 3(a) or Section 4(b), the Company at its option may provide such coverage directly under its own plans, and, for the avoidance of doubt, shall provide such coverage on a basis that to the extent permitted by applicable law is, in whole or in part, taxable or nontaxable;   provided  , that any such coverage that can be provided on a nontaxable basis shall be so provided unless the Company determines that to do so would result in adverse tax consequences to Executive, to other current or former employees of the Company, or to the Company.  If in the Company s good faith determination continued coverage under its own plans, would be impracticable notwithstanding diligent effort by the Company or would result in adverse tax consequences to Executive, to other current or former employees of the Company or to the Company, the Company may instead provide Executive with cash in an amount such that the Executive may obtain coverage under other insurance policies providing coverage that is at least equivalent to the coverage under the Company s plans, including deductibles, co-pay percentages or amounts, and maximum coverage amounts. Any provision of coverage, including cash payments as herein provided, as well as provision of the benefits under Section 4(c), shall be accomplished in a manner that to the Company s satisfaction either complies with Section 409A or with the requirements for exemption from Section 409A. 
        
  IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Agreement as of the date first above written.
