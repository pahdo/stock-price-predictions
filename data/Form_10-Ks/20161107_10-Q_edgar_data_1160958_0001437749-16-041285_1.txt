1. Organization and Basis of Presentation   
     
            Inphi Corporation (the  Company ), a Delaware corporation, was incorporated in November 2000. The Company is a fabless provider of high-speed analog and mixed signal semiconductor solutions for the communications and data center markets. The Company s semiconductor solutions are designed to address bandwidth bottlenecks in networks, maximize throughput and minimize latency in computing environments and enable the rollout of next generation communications, data center and computing infrastructures. In addition, the semiconductor solutions provide a vital high-speed interface between analog signals and digital information in high-performance systems such as telecommunications transport systems, enterprise networking equipment, data center and enterprise servers and storage platforms.  
     
  The interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ), for interim financial information and with the instructions to Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ), Form 10-Q and Article 10 of SEC Regulation S-X. They do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. Therefore, these financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2015, included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 29, 2016.  
     
            The interim condensed consolidated financial statements included herein are unaudited; however, they contain all normal recurring accruals and adjustments that, in the opinion of management, are necessary to state fairly the Company s consolidated financial position at September 30, 2016, and its consolidated results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 and cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for future quarters or the full year.  
     
  On June 29, 2016, the Company signed a definitive agreement to sell the memory product business to Rambus Inc. for $90,000 in cash inclusive of $11,250 which was placed into escrow for a period of twelve months following the closing as security for the Company s indemnification obligations pursuant to the agreement. The sale was completed on August 4, 2016. The Company's condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes for current and prior periods have been restated to present the results of operations of the memory product business as discontinued operations. In addition, the assets and liabilities that were sold have been treated and classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2015. For more information on discontinued operations, see Note 3.  
     
   2. Recent Accounting Pronouncements    
     
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance on  Revenue from Contracts with Customers.  The new revenue recognition guidance provides a five-step analysis of transactions to determine when and how revenue is recognized. The guidance requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The new guidance was initially effective for the Company on January 1, 2017. The new guidance permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. The Company is evaluating the effect that the new revenue recognition guidance will have on the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. The Company has not yet selected a transition method nor determined the effect of the standard on the ongoing financial reporting. In July 2015, the FASB voted to defer the effective date of the new revenue recognition standard by one year. The guidance may be adopted as early as January 1, 2017, the effective date of the original guidance.  
     
  In July 2015, the FASB issued guidance applying to inventory measured using any other method other than last-in, last-out method. Under this guidance inventory is measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. The net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. The guidance is applied prospectively and is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.  
     
  In September 2015, the FASB issued guidance that requires an acquirer in a business combination to recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. The guidance also requires disclosure of the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization or other income effects, if any, as a result of the adjustment to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. This guidance is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2016. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

   Notes to   Unaudited Condensed   Consolidated Financial Statements   
   (Dollars in thousands except share and per share amounts)   
   
  In January 2016, the FASB issued guidance that requires equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. However, an entity may choose to measure equity investments that do not have readily determinable fair values at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. The guidance simplifies the impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values by requiring a qualitative assessment to identify impairment. When a qualitative assessment indicates that impairment exists, an entity is required to measure the investment at fair value. The guidance eliminates the requirement for public business entities to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet, and requires public business entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes. The guidance also requires an entity to present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk when the entity has elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments. Separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset (that is, securities or loans and receivables) on the balance sheet or the accompanying notes to the financial statements is required under this guidance. The guidance further clarifies that an entity should evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset related to available-for-sale securities in combination with the entity s other deferred tax assets. The guidance is applied by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption and is effective for the Company in its first quarter of fiscal 2018. Early adoption is permitted only if certain criteria is met. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this new guidance on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.  
     
  In February 2016, the FASB issued guidance that requires companies that lease assets (lessees) to recognize on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by the leases with lease terms of more than 12 months. This guidance is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this new guidance on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.  
     
  In March 2016, the FASB issued a guidance that eliminate the requirement that when an investment qualifies for use of the equity method as a result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence, an investor must adjust the investment, results of operations, and retained earnings retroactively on a step-by-step basis as if the equity method had been in effect during all previous periods that the investment had been held. The guidance require that the equity method investor add the cost of acquiring the additional interest in the investee to the current basis of the investor s previously held interest and adopt the equity method of accounting as of the date the investment becomes qualified for equity method accounting. Therefore, upon qualifying for the equity method of accounting, no retroactive adjustment of the investment is required. The guidance also requires that an entity that has an available-for-sale equity security that becomes qualified for the equity method of accounting recognize through earnings the unrealized holding gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive income at the date the investment becomes qualified for use of the equity method. The guidance is effective for the Company beginning after January 1, 2017. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this new guidance on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.  
     
  In March 2016, the FASB issued a guidance in the assessment whether an entity is a principal or an agent in the new revenue standard (gross versus net revenue presentation). The guidance has the same effective date and transition requirements as the new revenue standard, which is effective for calendar year-end public companies in 2018 with early adoption permitted in 2017.  
     
  In March 2016, the FASB issued a guidance that will change certain aspects of accounting for share-based payments to employees. The new guidance requires all income tax effects of awards to be recognized in the income statement when the awards vest or are settled. It also allows an employer to repurchase more of an employee s shares than the minimum for tax withholding purposes without triggering liability accounting and to make a policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur. The new guidance allows entities to estimate forfeiture or recognize forfeitures when they occur. It also requires presentation of excess tax benefits as an operating activity and cash paid by employer to taxing authorities on the employees  behalf for withheld shares as financing activity on the statement of cash flows. The Company early adopted this standard at the beginning of 2016 and the effect of adoption is discussed in Note 13 of the condensed consolidated financial statements.  
     
  In April 2016, the FASB issued a guidance which amends the revenue guidance on identifying performance obligations and accounting for licenses of intellectual property. The guidance changed the previous proposals on renewals of right-of-use licenses and contractual restrictions. The guidance has the same effective date and transition requirements as the new revenue standard, which is effective for calendar year-end public companies in 2018 with early adoption permitted in 2017.

  In August 2016, the FASB issued guidance related to the classification of certain transactions on the statement of cash flows. The guidance will be effective for calendar year-end public companies in 2018, however early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements.  
     
  In October 2016, the FASB issued a guidance which amends the financial reporting for the income tax consequences of intra-entity transfers other than inventory. The guidance requires an entity to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset (with the exception of inventory) when the transfer occurs. The guidance will be effective for calendar year-end public companies in 2018, however early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements.  
     
   3. Discontinued Operations   
       
  In June 2016, the Company announced the sale of its memory product business (the  Business ) to Rambus Inc. for $90,000 in cash, $11,250 of which was placed into escrow for a period of the twelve months following the closing as security for the Company s indemnification obligations pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement dated June 29, 2016  . The sale was completed on August 4, 2016. The divestiture of the Business was part of a strategic plan to focus on and increase investments in the Company s communication business. The Company recorded a gain of $78,531 in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. The assets and liabilities of the Business as of December 31, 2015 have been classified as held for sale and the results of operations are shown in net income from discontinued operations. The Company s condensed consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes for current and prior periods have been restated to reflect the discontinued operations presentation.  
     
  The carrying amounts of the major classes of assets and liabilities that are classified as held for sale on the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 were as follows:

4. Investments   
     
  The following table summarizes the investments by investment category:  

As of September 30, 2016, the Company had 54 investments that were in an unrealized loss position. The gross unrealized losses on these investments at September 30, 2016 of $70 were determined to be temporary in nature. The Company reviews the investments to identify and evaluate investments that have an indication of possible other-than-temporary impairment. Factors considered in determining whether a loss is other-than-temporary include the length of time and extent to which fair value has been less than the cost basis, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the investee, and the intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value.  
     
  The realized gain related to the Company s available-for-sale investment which was reclassified from other comprehensive income was included in other income in the condensed consolidated statements of income.

   9. Convertible debt    
       
  In December 2015, the Company issued $230,000 of 1.125% convertible senior notes due 2020 (Convertible Notes 2015).

Interest on the Convertible Notes 2015 is payable on June 1 and December 1 of each year, beginning on June 1, 2016. The initial conversion rate is 24.8988 shares of common stock per $1 principal amount of Convertible Notes 2015, which represents an initial conversion price of approximately $40.16 per share.  The total interest expense recognized for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $3,249, which consists of $650 of contractual interest expense, $2,384 of amortization of debt discount and $215 of amortization of debt issuance costs. The total interest expense recognized for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $9,552, which consists of $1,926 of contractual interest expense, $6,997 of amortization of debt discount and $629 of amortization of debt issuance costs.  
     
  In connection with the issuance of the Convertible Notes 2015, the Company entered into capped call transactions (Capped Call 2015) in private transactions. Under the Capped Call 2015, the Company purchased capped call options that in aggregate relate to 100% of the total number of shares of the Company's common stock underlying the Convertible Notes 2015, with a strike price approximately equal to the conversion price of the Convertible Notes 2015 and with a cap price equal to approximately $52.06 per share.  
     
  In September 2016, the Company issued $287,500 of 0.75% convertible senior notes due 2021 (Convertible Notes 2016). The Convertible Notes 2016 will mature September 1, 2021, unless earlier converted or repurchased. Interest on the Convertible Notes 2016 is payable on March 1 and September 1 of each year, beginning on March 1, 2017. The initial conversion rate is 17.7508 shares of common stock per $1 principal amount of Convertible Notes 2016, which represents an initial conversion price of approximately $56.34 per share.  The Convertible Notes 2016 will be subject to repurchase at the option of the holders following certain fundamental corporate changes, at a fundamental change repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date. The conversion rate will be subject to adjustment in some events but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid interest. Certain corporate events that occur prior to the stated maturity date can cause the Company to increase the conversion rate for a holder.  
     
  Prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding March 1, 2021, holders may convert all or any portion of their Convertible Notes 2016 only under the following circumstances: (i) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on December 31, 2016 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of the Company s common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (ii) during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period (the  measurement period ) in which the  trading price  per $1 principal amount of notes, as determined following a request by a holder of notes in accordance with procedures specified in the indenture governing the Convertible Notes 2016, for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of the common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day.; or (iii) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. On or after March 1, 2021, until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert their notes at any time, regardless of the foregoing circumstances. Upon conversion, the Company will pay or deliver, as the case may be, cash, shares of common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, at the Company s election. The Company's current intent is to settle the principal amount of the Convertible Notes 2016 in cash upon conversion. If the conversion value exceeds the principal amount, the Company would deliver shares of its common stock in respect to the remainder of its conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount (conversion spread).  
     
  The Convertible Notes 2016 are not redeemable at the Company s option prior to maturity.  
     
  The Convertible Notes 2016 are governed by the terms of indenture (Indenture). The Indenture does not contain any financial or operating covenants,   or restrictions on the payments of dividends,   the incurrence of indebtedness or the issuance or repurchase of securities by the Company or any of its subsidiaries. The Indenture contains customary terms and covenants in events of default. If an event of default   (other than certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization involving the Company) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee by notice to the Company, or the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Convertible Notes 2016 by notice to the Company and the Trustee under the Indenture, may, and the Trustee at the request of such holders shall, declare 100% of the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all the Convertible Notes 2016 to be due and payable. Upon the occurrence of certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization involving the Company, 100% of the principal of and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on all of the Convertible Notes 2016 will become due and payable automatically. Upon such a declaration of acceleration, such principal and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, will be due and payable immediately. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indenture provides that, to the extent the Company elects, the sole remedy for an event of default relating to certain failures by the Company to comply with certain reporting covenants in the Indenture consists exclusively of the right to receive additional interest on the Convertible Notes 2016. As of September 30, 2016, none of the conditions allowing holders of the Notes to convert had been met.

  In accounting for the issuance of the Convertible Notes 2016, the Company separated the Convertible Notes 2016 into liability and equity components. The carrying amount of the liability component was calculated by measuring the estimated fair value of a similar liability that does not have an associated convertible feature. The carrying amount of the equity component representing the conversion option was determined by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the face value of the Convertible Notes 2016 as a whole. The excess of the face amount of the liability component over its carrying amount is amortized to interest expense over the term of the Convertible Notes 2016 using the effective interest method. The gross proceeds of $287,500 were accordingly allocated between long-term debt for $216,775 and stockholders' equity for $70,725. Issuance costs of $7,689, of which $7,187 were paid as of September 30, 2016, were allocated between long-term debt ($5,798) and equity ($1,891). The total interest expense recognized for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $738, which consists of $106 of contractual interest expense, $584 of amortization of debt discount and $48 of amortization of debt issuance costs. The issuance costs allocated to long-term debt is presented in the balance sheet as offset against long-term debt as of September 30, 2016.  
     
  In connection with the issuance of the Convertible Notes 2016, the Company entered into capped call transactions (Capped Call 2016) in private transactions. Under the Capped Call 2016, the Company purchased capped call options that in aggregate relate to 100% of the total number of shares of the Company's common stock underlying the Convertible Notes 2016, with a strike price approximately equal to the conversion price of the Convertible Notes 2016 and with a cap price equal to approximately $73.03 per share. The capped calls were purchased for $22,540 and recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in-capital in accordance with ASC 815-40, Contracts in Entity s Own Equity.  
     
  The purchased Capped Call 2016 allows the Company to receive shares of its common stock and/or cash from counterparties equal to the amounts of common stock and/or cash related to the excess of the market price per share of the common stock, as measured under the terms of the Capped Call 2016 over the strike price of the Capped Call 2016 during the relevant valuation period. The purchased Capped Call 2016 is intended to reduce the potential dilution to common stock upon future conversion of the Convertible Notes 2016 by effectively increasing the initial conversion price to approximately $73.03 as well as to offset potential cash payments the Company is required to make in excess of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes 2016 in applicable events.  
     
  The Capped Call 2016 is a separate transaction entered into by the Company with the option counterparties, are not part of the terms of the Convertible Notes 2016 and will not change the holders' rights under the Convertible Notes 2016.  
     
   10. Other long-term liabilities    
       
  Other long-term liabilities consist of the following:   

11. Income Taxes    
     
  The Company determined its interim provision using an estimated single annual effective tax rate for all tax jurisdictions for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company determined its interim tax provision applying a separate estimated annual effective tax rate to its loss jurisdictions. ASC 740 provides that when an entity operates in a jurisdiction that has generated ordinary losses on a year-to-date basis or on the basis of the results anticipated for the full fiscal year and no benefit can be recognized on those losses, a separate effective tax rate should be computed and applied to ordinary income (or loss) in that jurisdiction. The Company incurred pretax loss during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 from the Singapore operation and did not recognize tax benefit of the losses due to full valuation allowance established against deferred tax assets. Thus, a separate effective tax rate was applied to the Singapore jurisdiction to compute the Company s interim tax expense.

   Notes to   Unaudited Condensed   Consolidated Financial Statements   
   (Dollars in thousands except share and per share amounts)   
   
  The Company recorded an income tax provision from continuing operations of $1,530 and $1,501 in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. The effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was 19% and 17%, respectively. The difference between the effective tax rates and the 34% federal statutory rate was primarily due to the change in valuation allowance, foreign income taxes provided at lower rates, geographic mix in operating results, unrecognized tax benefits, recognition of federal and state research and development credits and windfall tax benefits from stock-based compensation from early adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2016-09. The Company recorded an income tax provision from continuing operations of $223 and $2,092 in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. The effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 was (13%) and (18%), respectively. The difference between the effective tax rates and the 34% federal statutory rate was primarily due to the change in valuation allowance, foreign income taxes provided at lower rates, geographic mix in operating results, unrecognized tax benefits, stock-based compensation adjustments and recognition of state research and development credits.   
     
  During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the gross amount of the Company s unrecognized tax benefits increased by approximately $4,889 and $3,300, respectively, primarily due to the results of tax positions taken during the current year, offset by a state tax audit settlement and expiration of the statute of limitations on certain foreign income taxes. Substantially all of the unrecognized tax benefits as of September 30, 2016, if recognized, would affect the Company s effective tax rate. The Company believes that in the next twelve months, it is reasonably possible that the gross unrecognized tax benefit may decrease by approximately $100 due to the expiration of statute of limitations on certain foreign income taxes.  
     
  The Company does not provide for U.S. income taxes on undistributed earnings of its controlled foreign corporations that are intended to be invested indefinitely outside the United States.  

12. Earnings Per Share    
     
  The following shows the reconciliation of weighted average shares used in the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share:   

The following securities were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share as inclusion would have been anti-dilutive:   

As discussed in Note 2, the Company early adopted ASU 2016-09. Based on the new guidance, the excess tax benefit is no longer included in the weighted diluted common stock calculation under the treasury stock method and therefore, increased the total weighted diluted common stock by 1,061,027 and 1,008,887 in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. This change was applied prospectively.

   13. Stock Based Compensation   
     
  In June 2010, the Board of Directors (the  Board ) approved the Company s 2010 Stock Incentive Plan (the  2010 Plan ), which became effective in November 2010. The 2010 Plan provides for the grants of restricted stock, stock appreciation rights and stock unit awards to employees, non-employee directors, advisors and consultants. The Compensation Committee administers the 2010 Plan, including the determination of the recipient of an award, the number of shares subject to each award, whether an option is to be classified as an incentive stock option or nonstatutory option, and the terms and conditions of each award, including the exercise and purchase prices and the vesting or duration of the award. Options granted under the 2010 Plan are exercisable only upon vesting. At September 30, 2016, 3,512,725 shares of common stock have been reserved for future grants under the 2010 Plan.   
     
    Stock Option Awards       
     
  The Company did not grant any stock options during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  
     
  The following table summarizes information regarding options outstanding:   

The intrinsic value of options outstanding, exercisable and vested and expected to vest is calculated based on the difference between the exercise price and the fair value of the Company s common stock as of the respective balance sheet dates.   
     
  The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $13,401 and $8,471, respectively. The intrinsic value of exercised options is calculated based on the difference between the exercise price and the fair value of the Company s common stock as of the exercise date. Cash received from the exercise of stock options was $5,108 and $4,780, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.   
     
    Restricted Stock Units and Awards    
     
  The Company granted restricted stock units ( RSUs ) to members of the Board and employees. Most of the Company s outstanding RSUs vest over four years with vesting contingent upon continuous service. The Company estimates the fair value of RSUs using the market price of the common stock on the date of the grant. The fair value of these awards is amortized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.

   (Dollars in thousands except share and per share amounts)   
   
  The following table summarizes information regarding outstanding restricted stock units  :   

The RSUs include performance-based stock units subject to achievement of pre-established revenue goal and earnings per share on non-GAAP basis. Once the goals are met, the performance-based stock units are subject to four years of vesting from the original grant date, contingent upon continuous service. The total performance-based units that vested for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was 36,036. As of September 30, 2016, the total performance-based units outstanding was 285,356.  
     
    Employee Stock Purchase Plan    
     
  In December 2011, the Company adopted the Employee Stock Purchase Plan ( ESPP ). Participants purchase the Company's stock using payroll deductions, which may not exceed 15% of their total cash compensation. Pursuant to the terms of the ESPP, the "look-back" period for the stock purchase price is six months. Offering and purchase periods will begin on February 10 and August 10 of each year. Participants will be granted the right to purchase common stock at a price per share that is 85% of the lesser of the fair market value of the Company's common stock at the beginning or the end of each six-month period.   
     
  The ESPP imposes certain limitations upon an employee s right to acquire common stock, including the following: (i) no employee shall be granted a right to participate if such employee immediately after the election to purchase common stock, would own stock possessing 5% or more of the total combined voting power or value of all classes of stock of the Company, and (ii) no employee may be granted rights to purchase more than $25 fair value of common stock for each calendar year. The maximum aggregate number of shares of common stock available for purchase under the ESPP is 1,750,000 shares. The total common stock issued under the ESPP during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was 285,101 and 326,724, respectively.  
     
  The fair value of the ESPP is estimated at the start of offering period using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions:   

Stock-Based Compensation Expense    
     
  Stock-based compensation expense is included in the Company s results of operations as follows:

Table Of Contents 

Inphi Corporation   
   Notes to   Unaudited Condensed   Consolidated Financial Statements   
   (Dollars in thousands except share and per share amounts)   
   
  Total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock options, restricted stock units and awards at September 30, 2016, prior to the consideration of expected forfeitures, is approximately $64,354 and is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.64 years.   
     
  The Company early adopted Accounting Standards Update 2016-09. The effect of adoption resulted to a net credit of $5,261 on the beginning balance of accumulated deficit from previously unrecorded deferred tax assets for net operating loss carryover generated by windfall tax benefit. The adoption increased weighted average diluted common stock by 1,061,027 and 1,008,887 in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. In addition, the current period s excess tax benefit related to stock-based compensation is presented as operating activity in the statement of cash flows. The change in the cash flow was adopted retrospectively and the Company reclassified $1,233 of excess tax benefit for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 from financing activity to operating activity.  

14. Fair Value Measurements    
     
  The guidance on fair value measurements requires fair value measurements to be classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:   
     
   Level 1 : Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities;   
     
   Level 2 : Quoted prices in markets that are not active, or inputs which are observable, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability, or   
     
   Level 3 : Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (i.e., supported by little or no market activity).   
     
  The Company measures its investments in marketable securities at fair value using the market approach, which uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. The Company has cash equivalents which consist of money market funds valued using the amortized cost method, in accordance with Rule 2a-7 under the 1940 Act, which approximates fair value.  
     
  The Company determines the amount of transfers between Levels 1 and 2 or transfers into or out of Level 3 by using the end-of-period fair value. The Company had no transfers among the fair value hierarchy during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016.  
     
  The following table presents information about assets required to be carried at fair value on a recurring basis:

Table Of Contents 

Inphi Corporation   
   Notes to   Unaudited Condensed   Consolidated Financial Statements   
   (Dollars in thousands except share and per share amounts)   

The convertible notes are carried on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at their original issuance value including accreted interest, net of unamortized debt discount and issuance cost. The convertible notes are not marked to fair value at the end of each reporting period. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the fair value of convertible notes was determined on the basis of market prices observable for similar instruments and is considered Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.   
       
   15. Segment and Geographic Information    
     
  The Company operates in one reportable segment. The Company s Chief Executive Officer, who is considered to be the chief operating decision maker, manages the Company s operations as a whole and reviews consolidated financial information for purposes of evaluating financial performance and allocating resources. Revenue by region is classified based on the locations to which the product is transported, which may differ from the customer s principal offices.   
     
  The following table sets forth the Company s revenue by geographic region:   

As of September 30, 2016, $6,577 of long-lived tangible assets are located outside the United States, of which $4,873 are located in Taiwan. As of December 31, 2015, $5,054 of long-lived tangible assets are located outside the United States of which $4,372 are located in Taiwan.  
       
   16. Commitments and Contingencies    
     
   Leases    
     
  The Company leases its facility under noncancelable lease agreements expiring in various years through 2026. The Company also licenses certain software used in its research and development activities under a term license subscription and maintenance arrangement.

Table Of Contents 

Inphi Corporation   
   Notes to   Unaudited Condensed   Consolidated Financial Statements   
   (Dollars in thousands except share and per share amounts)   
   
   As of September 30, 2016, future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases having initial terms in excess of one year are as follows:   

For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, lease operating expense was $3,753 and $10,657, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, lease operating expense was $2,900 and $8,917, respectively.  
     
   Noncancelable Purchase Obligations    
     
     The Company depends upon third party subcontractors to manufacture its wafers. These subcontractor relationships typically allow for the cancellation of outstanding purchase orders, but require payment of all expenses incurred through the date of cancellation. As of September 30, 2016, the total value of open purchase orders for wafers was approximately $6,559. As of September 30, 2016, the Company has a noncancelable inventory purchase commitment of $4,102.  
     
   Legal Proceedings    
     
   Netlist, Inc. v. Inphi Corporation, Case No. 09-cv-6900 (C.D. Cal.)    
     
  On September 22, 2009, Netlist filed suit in the United States District Court, Central District of California, or the Court, asserting that the Company infringes U.S. Patent No. 7,532,537. Netlist filed an amended complaint on December 22, 2009, further asserting that the Company infringes U.S. Patent Nos. 7,619,912 and 7,636,274, collectively with U.S. Patent No. 7,532,537, the patents-in-suit, and seeking both unspecified monetary damages to be determined and an injunction to prevent further infringement. These infringement claims allege that the iMB  and certain other memory module components infringe the patents-in-suit. The Company answered the amended complaint on February 11, 2010 and asserted that the Company does not infringe the patents-in-suit and that the patents-in-suit are invalid. In 2010, the Company filed  inter partes  requests for reexamination with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (the  USPTO ), asserting that the patents-in-suit are invalid. As a result of the proceedings at the USPTO, the Court has stayed the litigation, with the parties advising the Court on status every 120 days.   
     
  As to the proceeding at the USPTO, reexamination has been ordered for all of the patents that were alleged to infringe, and at present, the USPTO has determined that almost all of the originally filed claims are not valid, with certain amended claims being determined patentable. The Reexamination Certificate for U.S. Patent No. 7,532,537 was issued on August 2, 2016 based upon amended claims, and the parties continue to assert their respective positions with respect to the reexamination proceedings for U.S. Patent Nos. 7,619,912 and 7,636,274.  
     
  While the Company intends to defend the foregoing USPTO proceedings and lawsuit vigorously, the USPTO proceedings and litigation, whether or not determined in the Company s favor or settled, could be costly and time-consuming and could divert management s attention and resources, which could adversely affect the Company s business.   
     
  Based on the nature of USPTO proceedings and litigation, the Company is currently unable to predict the final outcome of this lawsuit and therefore, cannot determine the likelihood of loss nor estimate a range of possible loss. However, because of the nature and inherent uncertainties of litigation, should the outcome of these actions be unfavorable, the Company s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.

   Indemnifications    
     
  In the ordinary course of business, the Company may provide indemnifications of varying scope and terms to customers, vendors, lessors, investors, directors, officers, employees and other parties with respect to certain matters, including, but not limited to, losses arising out of the Company s breach of such agreements, services to be provided by the Company, or from intellectual property infringement claims made by third-parties. These indemnifications may survive termination of the underlying agreement and the maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these indemnification provisions may not be subject to maximum loss clauses. The Company has not incurred material costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnifications. Accordingly, the Company has no liabilities recorded for these agreements as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.   
       
   17.    Subsequent Events    
     
  On November 1, 2016, the Company signed a definitive agreement to acquire ClariPhy Communications Inc. for $275 million in cash as well as the assumption of certain liabilities at the close, net of cash currently estimated at $25 million. A portion of the consideration will be placed in an escrow fund for up to 24 months following the closing for the satisfaction of certain indemnification obligations. The completion of the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including, but not limited to, expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and other regulatory approvals. The acquisition is expected to close in December 2016.

We recorded a gain from the sale of memory product business of $78.5 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. The assets and liabilities of the memory product business have classified as held for sale and the results of operations are shown in net income from discontinued operations.

In the third quarter of 2016, we announced the industry s first 400GbE platform solution for next-generation 400G CFP8 modules. The platform solution includes our highly integrated, lowest power 4-level Pulse Amplitude Modulation (PAM4) digital signal processing (DSP) IC that supports IEEE P802.3bs 400G/s Ethernet standard alongside its companion market leading linear transimpedance amplifiers (  TIA) and linear drivers for client based cloud interconnects. With the introduction of these new products, we are offering customers an end-to-end platform solution for moving data faster within and between data centers. We also announced the production availability of a new product in the 32GBaud Linear Coherent Product Family. The IN3217SZ, a quad linear Mach-Zehnder Modulator Driver in a Surface Mount Technology (SMT) package, extends the product portfolio by utilizing cost effective packaging for the 100G/200G coherent long haul and metro optical interconnect applications. We also announced the sampling of IN6450TA, the world s first 64GBaud dual channel linear TIA/VGA amplifier. The IN6450TA supports data rates of 400Gbps to 600Gbps on a single wavelength for long haul, metro, and data center interconnect networks using coherent technology.  
     
  On November 1, 2016, we signed a definitive agreement to acquire ClariPhy Communications Inc. (ClariPhy) for $275 million in cash as well as the assumption of certain liabilities at the close, net of cash currently estimated at $25 million. A portion of the consideration will be placed in an escrow fund for up to 24 months following the closing for the satisfaction of certain indemnification obligations. The completion of the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including, but not limited to, expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and other regulatory approvals. The acquisition is expected to close in December 2016.  
     
  A detailed discussion of our business may be found in Part I, Item 1,  Business,  of our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  
     
   Quarterly Update   

As discussed in more detail below, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, we delivered the following financial performance:  

The increase in our revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was a result of the increase in consumption of our dual linear TIAs, quad linear driver products and complementary metal oxide semiconductor based 100G physical layers (iPHY) products.  
     
  The increase in gross margin was due to increase in sale of high margin products as discussed above and lower product cost from the inventory fair value step-up related to the acquired Cortina inventories for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016.  
     
  Total operating expenses increased due primarily to an increase in headcount and stock-based compensation expense. Our expenses primarily consist of personnel costs, which include compensation, benefits, payroll related taxes and stock-based compensation. From October 2015 to September 2016, our headcount increased by 34 new employees, primarily in the engineering department. We expect expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest resources to develop more products and to support the growth of our business. Our diluted earnings per share increased primarily due to increase in revenue partially offset by increase in operating expenses.

Our cash and cash equivalents were $448.0 million at September 30, 2016, compared with $283.0 million at December 31, 2015. Cash provided by operating activities was $50.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $46.7 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $136.7 million primarily due to purchases of marketable securities of $277.8 million, purchases of property and equipment of $16.3 million and purchase of cost method investment of $2.0 million offset by sales and maturities of marketable securities of $74.3 million, proceeds from sale of discontinued operations of $78.8 million and proceeds from sale of cost method investment of $6.3 million. Cash provided by financing activities of $251.3 million was primarily due to net proceeds from issuance of convertible debt of $280 million, proceeds from the exercise of stock options and employee stock purchase plan of $10.6 million, offset by purchase of capped call options of $22.5 million, minimum tax withholding paid on behalf of employees of $16.0 million and loan to supplier of $0.7 million.   

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates   
     
  The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenue and expenses in the reporting period. We regularly evaluate our estimates and assumptions related to allowances for doubtful accounts, warranty reserves, inventory reserves, stock-based compensation expense, goodwill and intangible assets valuation, deferred income tax asset valuation allowances, uncertain tax positions, litigation, other loss contingencies and business combinations. We base our estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the recording of revenue, costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by us may differ materially and adversely from our estimates. To the extent there are material differences between our estimates and the actual results, our future results of operations will be affected. For a description of our critical accounting policies and estimates, please refer to the  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  section of our Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. There have been no material changes in any of our critical accounting policies during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. We early adopted Accounting Standards Update 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting as of January 1, 2016. The effect of adoption is discussed in Note 13 of Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.  
       
   Results of Operations   
     
  The following table sets forth a summary of our statement of operations as a percentage of each line item to the revenue:

Comparison of Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015     
     
    Revenue     

Total revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased compared to corresponding 2015 periods due to changes in average selling price and number of units sold. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the average selling price increased by 13% and 16%, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the number of units sold increased by 32% and 14%, respectively. The increases in number of units sold and average selling price were mainly   due to increased sales and mix of our higher priced products, including dual linear TIA,   quad linear driver products and iPHY products.  
         
    Cost of Revenue and Gross Margin     

Cost of revenue and gross margin for the three months ended September 30, 2016, increased compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015 primarily due to increased sales and mix of our higher priced products, including dual linear TIA, quad linear driver products and iPHY products. Cost of revenue and gross margin increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015 primarily due to increased sales of high margin products as discussed above offset by lower product cost from an inventory fair value step-up related to the acquired Cortina inventories by $7.5 million, sold during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.

Research and Development     

Research and development expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased compared to the corresponding 2015 periods primarily due to the increase in research and development headcount, salaries and equity awards, which resulted in a $2.4 million and a $6.3 million increase in personnel costs and stock-based compensation expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. Reimbursement from customers related to research and development contracts decreased by $2.6 million and $7.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. These increases were partially offset by the decrease in pre-production engineering mask cost of $2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and abandonment of the project related to in-process research and development costs which resulted in an impairment charge of $1.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in research and development expense was primarily driven by our strategy to expand our product offerings and enhance our existing product offerings.   
     
    Sales and Marketing     

Sales and marketing expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased compared to the corresponding 2015 periods primarily due to increase an in personnel costs, including stock-based compensation expense of $1.0 million and $1.1 million, respectively. Commission expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased by $0.1 million and $0.5 million, respectively, due to an increase in revenue. Marketing product samples also increased by $0.2 million and $0.3 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively due to new product offerings.   

General and Administrative     

General and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015 mainly from an increase in legal fees of $0.3 million in connection with the litigation matters described in Note 16 of the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements and an increase in salary expense by $0.3 million due to bonus accrual.  

25

Table Of Contents 

General and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015 mainly from a decrease in stock-based compensation by $0.9 million in connection with the vesting of a grant to an officer  . In addition, in the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we incurred a loss of $0.5 million from the disposal of certain property and equipment from the Cortina acquisition. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in salary expense by $0.4 million due to bonus accrual.  

Provision (benefit) for Income Taxes     

We determined the interim provision using an estimated single annual effective tax rate for all tax jurisdictions for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, we determined our interim tax provision applying a separate estimated annual effective tax rate to its loss jurisdictions. ASC 740 provides that when an entity operates in a jurisdiction that has generated ordinary losses on a year-to-date basis or on the basis of the results anticipated for the full fiscal year and no benefit can be recognized on those losses, a separate effective tax rate should be computed and applied to ordinary income (or loss) in that jurisdiction. We incurred pretax loss during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 for the Singapore operations and will not recognize tax benefit of the losses due to full valuation allowance established against deferred tax assets. Thus, a separate effective tax rate was applied to the Singapore jurisdiction to compute the interim tax expense.  
     
  The income tax provision from continuing operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 reflects an effective tax rate of 19% and 17%, respectively. The effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 differs from the statutory rate of 34% primarily due to the change in valuation allowance, foreign income taxes provided at lower rates, geographic mix in operating results, unrecognized tax benefits, recognition of federal and state research and development credits and windfall tax benefits from stock-based compensation from early adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2016-09.   
     
  The income tax provision from continuing operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 reflects an effective tax rate of (13%) and (18%), respectively. The effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 differs from the statutory rate of 34% primarily due to the change in valuation allowance, foreign income taxes provided at lower rates, geographic mix in operating results, unrecognized tax benefits and recognition of state research and development credits.   

Liquidity and Capital Resources    
     
  As of September 30, 2016, we had cash, cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities of $693.5 million. Our primary uses of cash are to fund operating expenses, purchase inventory and acquire property and equipment. Cash used to fund operating expenses is impacted by the timing of when we pay these expenses, as reflected in the changes in our outstanding accounts payable and accrued expenses. The cash will also be used to fund the acquisition of Clariphy as discussed above. Our primary sources of cash are cash receipts on accounts receivable from our revenue. In 2016 and 2015, we issued convertible debt, which resulted in an increase in cash, cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities. Aside from the growth in amounts billed to our customers, net cash collections of accounts receivable are impacted by the efficiency of our cash collections process, which can vary from period to period, depending on the payment cycles of our major customers.   
     
  The following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated:

Table Of Contents 

Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities     
     
  Net cash provided by operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 primarily reflected net income of $80.3 million, depreciation and amortization of $22.3 million, stock-based compensation expense of $22.2 million, accretion of convertible debt of $8.3 million, an increase in accounts payable of $5.2 million, a change in income tax payable/receivable of $1.9 million and an increase in other liabilities of $2.4 million partially offset by a gain from the sale of discontinued operations and cost method investment of $79.7 million, increases in accounts receivable of $11.0 million and inventories of $2.9 million. Our accounts payable increased due to increased production volume. Our other liabilities increased due to payable to Rambus for receipts received on their behalf during the transition period. Our accounts receivable increased due to higher product shipments to customers. Our inventories increased as a result of growing production for expected delivery to customers in the fourth quarter of 2016.  
     
  Net cash provided by operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 primarily reflected depreciation and amortization of $20.1 million, stock-based compensation of $20.9 million, impairment of in-process research and development costs of $1.8 million, abandonment of asset of $1.3 million, decreases in accounts receivable of $3.7 million, inventories of $5.8 million and prepaid expenses of $2.3 million, and a change in income tax payable/receivable of $2.0 million, partially offset by net loss of $10.8 million and a decrease in accounts payable by $1.7 million. Our receivables decreased due to collections from customers. Our inventories decreased due to shipments to customers. Our prepaid expenses and other current assets decreased due to settlement of a non-trade receivable. Our accounts payable decreased due to payment to vendors.  

Net Cash Used in Investing Activities     
     
  Net cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 consisted of cash used to purchase property and equipment of $16.3 million, purchases of marketable securities of $277.8 million and cost method investment of $2.0 million, partially offset by sales and maturities of marketable securities of $74.3 million and proceeds from the sale of discontinued operations and cost method investment of $85.1 million.  
     
  Net cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2015, consisted of cash used to purchase property and equipment of $12.2 million, purchase of minority interest in an early stage private company for $2.0 million and purchases of marketable securities of $11.3 million, partially offset by sales and maturities of marketable securities of $12.8 million.  
     
    Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities     
     
  Net cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 consisted of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and employee stock purchase plan of $10.6 million and net proceeds from issuance of convertible debt of $280.0 million, partially offset by minimum tax withholding paid on behalf of employees for restricted stock units of $16.0 million, the purchase of capped call options of $22.5 million and a loan to a supplier of $0.7 million.  
     
  Net cash provided by financing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 consisted of proceeds from exercises of stock options and employee stock purchase plan of $9.4 million, partially offset by minimum tax withholding paid on behalf of employees for restricted stock units of $9.1 million.  

Operating and Capital Expenditure Requirements     
     
  Our principal sources of liquidity as of September 30, 2016 consisted of $693.5 million of cash, cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities, of which $94.9 million is held by our foreign subsidiaries. Based on our current operating plan, we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents from operations will be sufficient to finance our operational cash needs through at least the next 12 months. In the future, we expect our operating and capital expenditures to increase as we increase headcount, expand our business activities and grow our end customer base which will result in higher needs for working capital. Our ability to generate cash from operations is also subject to substantial risks described in Part II, Item 1A, Risk Factors  . If any of these risks occur, we may be unable to generate or sustain positive cash flow from operating activities. We would then be required to use existing cash and cash equivalents to support our working capital and other cash requirements. If additional funds are required to support our working capital requirements, acquisitions or other purposes, we may seek to raise funds through equity or debt financing or from other sources. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities, the percentage ownership of our stockholders could be significantly diluted, and these newly-issued securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing stockholders. If we raise additional funds by obtaining loans from third parties, the terms of those financing arrangements may include negative covenants or other restrictions on our business that could impair our operating flexibility, and would also require us to incur interest expense. We can provide no assurance that additional financing will be available at all or, if available, that we would be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us.

We do not plan to repatriate cash balances from foreign subsidiaries to fund our operations in the United States. There may be adverse tax effects upon repatriation of these funds to the United States.   
     
      Contractual Payment Obligations    
     
  Our contractual obligations for 2016 and beyond are included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed with the SEC on February 29, 2016. See note 16 of the notes to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for information regarding obligations as of September 30, 2016.

    Interest Rate Sensitivity     
     
  We had cash and cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities of $693.5 million and $326.7 million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, which was held for working capital purposes. Our exposure to market interest-rate risk relates primarily to our investment portfolio. We do not use derivative financial instruments to hedge the market risks of our investments. We manage our total portfolio to encompass a diversified pool of investment-grade securities to preserve principal and maintain liquidity. We place our investments with high-quality issuers, money market funds and debt securities. Our investment portfolio as of September 30, 2016 consisted of money market funds, U.S. Treasuries, municipal bonds/demand notes, corporate/government agency bonds, commercial papers and asset backed securities. Investments in both fixed rate and floating rate instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk. Fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to an increase in interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall. Due in part to these factors, our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair value of our publicly traded debt investments is judged to be other-than-temporary. We may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates. However, because any debt securities we hold are classified as available-for-sale, no gains or losses are realized in the income statement due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or unless declines in value are determined to be other-than-temporary. These securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses, net of applicable taxes, included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), reported in a separate component of stockholders' equity. Although, we currently expect that our ability to access or liquidate these investments as needed to support our business activities will continue, we cannot ensure that this will not change.         
         
  In a low interest rate environment, as short-term investments mature, reinvestment may occur at less favorable market rates. Given the short-term nature of certain investments, the current interest rate environment may negatively impact our investment income.   
                
    Foreign Currency Risk     
     
  To date, our international customer and vendor agreements have been denominated almost exclusively in United States dollars. Accordingly, we have limited exposure to foreign currency exchange rates and currently enter into immaterial foreign currency hedging transactions.

Item      4.                   Controls and Procedures   
     
    Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures    
     
  We maintain  disclosure controls and procedures,  as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act 1934, or the Exchange Act, that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer (our principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (our principal financial officer), as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that such controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Our disclosure controls and procedures have been designed to meet reasonable assurance standards, but management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent or detect all error and all fraud. Additionally, in designing disclosure controls and procedures, our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible disclosure controls and procedures. The design of any disclosure controls and procedures is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.   
     
  Based on their evaluation as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our Chief Executive Officer (our principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (our principal financial officer) have concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.  
     
    Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting    
     
  There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during our most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  
     
    PART      II. OTHER INFORMATION   
    Item      1.    Legal Proceedings    
         
  The information required by this Item 1 is set forth under Note 16 of Notes to Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Part I, Item 1 of this Report, and is hereby incorporated by reference herein. For an additional discussion of certain risks associated with legal proceedings, see Item 1A. Risk Factors, below.  
       
    Item      1A.    Risk Factors    
     
  You should carefully consider the risks described in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, which are incorporated by reference herein, as our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by any of the risks and uncertainties described therein.   
            
    We may sell one or more of our product lines, from time to time, as a result of our evaluation of our products and markets, and any divestiture could adversely affect our continuing business and our expenses, revenues, results of operation, cash flows and financial position.    
         
  We periodically evaluate our various product lines and may, as a result, consider the divestiture of one or more of those product lines. For example, in June 2016, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with Rambus Inc. pursuant to which we agreed to sell our memory product business for $90 million in cash, and the transaction closed on August 4, 2016. Any divestiture could adversely affect our continuing business and expenses, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial position.  
     
  Divestitures of product lines have inherent risks, including the expense of selling the product line, the possibility that any anticipated sale will not occur, delays in closing any sale, the risk of lower-than-expected proceeds from the sale of the divested business, unexpected costs associated with the separation of the business to be sold from the seller s information technology and other operating systems, and potential post-closing claims for indemnification or breach of transition services obligations of the seller. For example, $11.25 million of the purchase price for the sale of our memory product business to Rambus is being held in escrow for a period of 12 months as security for our indemnification obligation obligations pursuant to the asset purchase agreement. Expected cost savings, which are offset by revenue losses from divested businesses, may also be difficult to achieve or maximize due to the seller s fixed cost structure, and a seller may experience varying success in reducing fixed costs or transferring liabilities previously associated with the divested business.  

We may acquire other businesses, form joint ventures or make investments in other companies or technologies that disrupt our business, be difficult to integrate, impair our operating results, dilute our stockholders  ownership, increase our debt, divert management resources or cause us to incur significant expense.

Table Of Contents 

As part of our business strategy, we have pursued and may continue to pursue in the future acquisitions of businesses and assets, as well as technology licensing arrangements that we believe will complement our business, semiconductor solutions or technologies. We also may pursue strategic alliances that leverage our core technology and industry experience to expand our product offerings or distribution, or make investments in other companies. Any acquisition involves a number of risks, many of which could harm our business, including:  

difficulty in integrating the operations, technologies, products, existing contracts, accounting and personnel of the target company or business;     

realizing the anticipated benefits of any acquisition;     

difficulty in transitioning and supporting customers, if any, of the target company;     

diversion of financial and management resources from existing operations;     

the risk that the price we pay or other resources that we devote may exceed the value we realize, or the value we could have realized if we had allocated the purchase price or other resources to another opportunity;     

potential loss of key employees, customers and strategic alliances from either our current business or the target company s business;     

assumption of unanticipated problems or latent liabilities, such as problems with the quality of the acquired products;     

inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition costs;     

dilutive effect on our stock as a result of any equity-based acquisitions;     

inability to successfully complete transactions with a suitable acquisition candidate; and     

in the event of international acquisitions, risks associated with accounting and business practices that are different from applicable U.S. practices and requirements.     
     
  Acquisitions also frequently result in the recording of goodwill and other intangible assets that are subject to potential impairments, which could harm our financial results. As a result, if we fail to properly evaluate acquisitions or investments, it may impair our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of any such acquisitions or investments, and we may incur costs in excess of what we anticipate.   
     
  The failure to successfully evaluate and execute acquisitions or investments or otherwise adequately address these risks could materially harm our business and financial results. We may not achieve all of the anticipated benefits of any of our acquisitions, including our acquisition of Cortina and our pending acquisition of ClariPhy, due to a number of factors including: unanticipated costs or liabilities associated with the acquisitions, incurrence of acquisition-related costs, harm to our relationships with existing customers as a result of the acquisitions, harm to our brands and reputation, the loss of key employees of the acquired companies, significant impairments of anticipated goodwill and other intangible assets and the use of resources that are needed in other parts of our business.  
     
  To finance any acquisitions or investments, we may choose to issue shares of our common stock or convertible debt as consideration, which could dilute the ownership of our stockholders. If the price of our common stock is low or volatile, we may not be able to acquire other companies for stock. In addition, newly-issued securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing stockholders. If we raise additional funds by obtaining loans from third parties, the terms of those financing arrangements may include negative covenants or other restrictions on our business that could impair our operating flexibility, and would also require us to incur interest expense. Additional funds may not be available on terms that are favorable to us, or at all.

Item 5.    Other Information    

(a)  
     
  On November 2, 2016, we entered into agreements to amend the Company s Severance and Change of Control Agreements with Richard Ogawa (General Counsel), Charlie Roach (Vice President of Worldwide Sales) and Dr. Ron Torten (Senior Vice President of Operations and Information Technology) (collectively, the  Amendments ). The terms and conditions of these Severance and Change of Control Agreements as in effect prior to the Amendments are described in the Company s proxy statement dated April 26, 2016 for its 2016 annual meeting of stockholders (the  Proxy Statement ). Each of the Amendments modifies the amount of equity award vesting acceleration provided to the respective officer from 50% to 100% in the event the officer is involuntarily terminated within the period beginning three months prior to a  change of control  (as that term is described in the Proxy Statement) and ending twelve months following a change of control. Each of the Amendments modifies the eligibility conditions for severance benefits (subject to all other conditions in the Severance and Change of Control Agreements) to exclude resignations by reason of unilateral changes to the officer s title and exclude resignations by reason of unilateral changes to the officer s duties and responsibilities so long as the changed duties and responsibilities are consistent with the officer s education and experience.   
     
  The foregoing is a summary of the terms of the Amendments only, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the terms of the Amendments, which are filed as exhibits to this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

Exhibit 10.1  
   INPHI CORPORATION   
     
   2010 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN   
     
   STOCK UNIT AGREEMENT   U.S. AND NON-U.S. EMPLOYEES AND CONSULTANTS   
     
  Capitalized terms that are used herein but not defined shall have the meanings set forth in the Inphi Corporation 2010 Stock Incentive Plan (the  Plan ).  

Payment for  Stock Units    

No cash payment is required for the Stock Units you receive. You are receiving the Stock Units in consideration for Services rendered by you.    

Vesting    

The Stock Units that you are receiving will vest in installments, as shown in the Notice of Stock Unit Award   U.S. and Non-U.S. Employees and Consultants (the  Notice ). No additional Stock Units vest after your Service as an Employee or a Consultant has terminated for any reason. For purposes of this stock unit, Service shall terminate if and when you cease to provide Service, notwithstanding that you may be subject to a period of notice or garden leave protection that arises under statute, contract or at common law in the jurisdiction in which you reside or under the terms of an employment agreement, if any.  The Company determines when your Service terminates for this purpose and all purposes under the Plan and its determinations are conclusive and binding on all persons.    

Forfeiture    

If your Service terminates for any reason, your Award expires immediately as to the number of Stock Units that have not vested before the termination date and do not vest as a result of termination. This means that the unvested Stock Units will immediately be cancelled. You receive no payment for Stock Units that are forfeited.    

Leaves of   
   Absence    

For purposes of this Award, your Service does not terminate when you go on a military leave, a sick leave or another  bona fide  leave of absence, if the leave of absence was approved by the Company in writing and if continued crediting of Service is required by the terms of the leave. But your Service will terminate when the approved leave ends, unless you immediately return to work.  
  If you go on a leave of absence, the vesting schedule specified in the Notice may be adjusted in accordance with the Company's leave of absence policy or the terms of your leave. If you commence working on a part-time basis, the vesting schedule specified in the Notice of Stock Unit Award   U.S. and Non-U.S. Employees and Consultants may be adjusted in accordance with the Company's part-time work policy or the terms of an agreement between you and the Company pertaining to your part-time schedule.    

Nature of      Stock Units    

Your Stock Units are mere bookkeeping entries. They represent only the Company's unfunded and unsecured promise to issue Shares on a future date. As a holder of Stock Units, you have no rights other than the rights of a general creditor of the Company.    

No Voting Rights   
   or Dividends    

Your Stock Units carry neither voting rights nor rights to dividends. You, or your estate or heirs, have no rights as a stockholder of the Company unless and until your Stock Units are settled by issuing Shares. No adjustments will be made for dividends or other rights if the applicable record date occurs before your Shares are issued, except as described in the Plan.    

Stock Units   
   Nontransferable    

You may not sell, transfer, assign, pledge or otherwise dispose of any Stock Units. For instance, you may not use your Stock Units as security for a loan. If you attempt to do any of these things, your Stock Units will immediately become invalid.    

Settlement of    
   Stock Units    

Each of your vested Stock Units will be settled when it vests.  
     
  At the time of settlement, you will receive one Share for each vested Stock Unit; provided, however, that no fractional Shares will be issued or delivered pursuant to the Plan or this Agreement, and the Committee will determine whether cash will be paid in lieu of any fractional Share or whether such fractional Share and any rights thereto will be canceled, terminated or otherwise eliminated. In addition, the Shares are issued to you subject to the condition that the issuance of the Shares not violate any law or regulation concerning Share issuance. Further, the Shares are issued to you subject to the condition that all Tax-Related Items (as defined in the Responsibility for Taxes Section below) are paid.     
   
     STOCK UNIT AGREEMENT - U.S. AND NON-U.S. EMPLOYEES AND CONSULTANTS  

-1-

Responsibility      for     Taxes    

You acknowledge that, regardless of any action taken by the Company or, if different, the Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate retaining you, the ultimate liability for all income tax, social insurance, payroll tax, fringe benefits tax, payment on account or other tax related items related to your participation in the Plan and legally applicable to you ( Tax-Related Items ), is and remains your responsibility and may exceed the amount actually withheld by the Company or the Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate. You further acknowledge that the Company and/or the Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate (i) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the Stock Units, including, but not limited to, the grant, vesting or settlement of the Stock Unit, the subsequent sale of Shares acquired pursuant to such issuance and the receipt of any dividends; and (ii) do not commit to and are under no obligation to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the Stock Units to reduce or eliminate your liability for Tax-Related Items or achieve any particular tax result. Further, if you are subject to Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction between the Date of Grant and the date of any relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, you acknowledge that the Company and/or the Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate may be required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction.  
     
  Prior to the relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, you agree to make adequate arrangements satisfactory to the Company and/or the Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate to satisfy all Tax-Related Items. In this regard, you authorize the Company and/or the Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate, or their respective agents, at their discretion, to satisfy the obligations with regard to all Tax-Related Items by one or a combination of the following:   
     
  (1)     withholding from your wages or other cash compensation paid to you by the Company and/or the Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate;   
     
  (2)     withholding from proceeds of the sale of Shares acquired upon settlement of the Stock Units either through a voluntary sale or through a mandatory sale arranged by the Company (on your behalf pursuant to this authorization) without further consent; or  
     
  (3)     withholding in Shares to be issued upon settlement of the Stock Units.    

Depending on the withholding method, the Company may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering applicable minimum statutory withholding amounts or other applicable withholding rates, including maximum applicable rates, in which case you will receive a refund of any over-withheld amount in cash and will have no entitlement to the common stock equivalent. If the obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied by withholding in Shares, for tax purposes, you are deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares subject to the vested Stock Unit, notwithstanding that a number of the Shares are held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items.  
     
  Finally, you agree to pay to the Company or the Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate any amount of Tax-Related Items that it may be required to withhold or account for as a result of your participation in the Plan that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described. The Company may refuse to issue or deliver the Shares or the proceeds of the sale of Shares, if you fail to comply with your obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items.  
     
  Notwithstanding the above, if you are classified as a Section 16 officer of the Company under the U.S. Securities Act of 1934, as amended, you shall be restricted to alternative (3) above for purposes of satisfying all Tax-Related Items, unless this withholding method is not permissible under the applicable laws of the country in which you reside, or the Company has authorized an alternative method for the relative taxable event..

Data Privacy     

Y    ou hereby explicitly and unambiguously consent to the collection, use and transfer, in electronic or other form, of your personal data as described in this Agreement and any other Stock Unit grant materials by and among, as applicable, the Company, the Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate retaining your Services or any other Subsidiaries and Affiliates for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing your participation in the Plan    .     
         
    You understand that the Company and the Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate retaining your Services may hold certain personal information about you, including, but not limited to, your name, home address and telephone number, date of birth, social insurance number or other identification number, salary, nationality, job title, any shares of stock or directorships held in the Company, details of all Stock Units or any other entitlement to shares of stock awarded, canceled, exercised, vested, unvested or outstanding in your favor, for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing the Plan ( Data )    .     
         
    You understand that Data will be transferred to E*TRADE     Financial Corporate Services, Inc. ( E*TRADE )     or such other stock plan service provider as may be selected by the Company in the future, which is assisting the Company with the implementation, administration and management of the Plan    .     You understand that the recipients of the Data may be located in the United States or elsewhere, and that the recipient s country (e.g., the United States) may have different data privacy laws and protections than your country    .     You understand that if you reside outside the United States, you may request a list with the names and addresses of any potential recipients of the Data by contacting your local human resources representative    .     You authorize the Company, E*TRADE and any other possible recipients which may assist the Company (presently or in the future) with implementing, administering and managing the Plan to receive, possess, use, retain and transfer the Data, in electronic or other form, for the sole purposes of implementing, administering and managing your participation in the Plan    .     You understand that Data will be held only as long as is necessary to implement, administer and manage your participation in the Plan    .     You understand that if you reside outside the United States, you may, at any time, view Data, request additional information about the storage and processing of Data, require any necessary amendments to Data or refuse or withdraw the consents herein, in any case without cost, by contacting in writing your local human resources representative    .     Further, you understand that you are providing the consents herein on a purely voluntary basis    .     If you do not consent, or if you later seek to revoke you    r     consent, your Service relationship and career with the Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate will not be adversely affected; the only adverse consequence of refusing or withdrawing your consent is that the Company would not be able to grant you Stock Units or other equity awards or administer or maintain such awards    .     Therefore, you understand that refusing or withdrawing your consent may affect your ability to participate in the Plan    .     For more information on the consequences of your refusal to consent or withdrawal of consent, you understand that you may contact your local human resources representative.      

Restrictions      on Resale    

You agree not to sell any Shares at a time when applicable securities laws, the Company policies or an agreement between the Company and its underwriters prohibit a sale. This restriction will apply as long as your active Service continues and for such period of time after the termination of your active Service as the Company may specify.    

Insider Trading   
   Restrictions   and   
     Market Abuse   
   Laws    

You acknowledge that, depending on your country, you may be subject to insider trading restrictions and/or market abuse laws, which may affect your ability to acquire or sell Shares or rights to Shares under the Plan during such times as you are considered to have  inside information  regarding the Company (as defined by the laws in your country). Any restrictions under these laws or regulations are separate from and in addition to any restrictions that may be imposed under any applicable Company insider trading policy. You acknowledge that it is your responsibility to comply with any applicable restrictions, and you are advised to speak to your personal advisor on this matter.

Adjustments    

In the event of a stock split, a stock dividend or a similar change in Company Shares, the number of Stock Units covered by this Award shall be adjusted pursuant to the Plan.    

Nature of Grant    

In accepting the Award, you acknowledge, understand and agree that: (a) the Plan is established voluntarily by the Company, it is discretionary in nature, and may be amended, suspended or terminated by the Company at any time, to the extent permitted by the Plan; (b) the grant of the Stock Units is voluntary and occasional and does not create any contractual or other right to receive future grants of stock units, or benefits in lieu of stock units, even if stock units have been granted in the past; (c) all decisions with respect to future Awards or other grants, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the Company; (d) the Award and your participation in the Plan shall not create a right to employment or be interpreted as forming an employment or service contract with the Company, the Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate retaining your Services or any Subsidiary or Affiliate, and shall not interfere with the ability of the Company, the Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate retaining your Services or any other Subsidiary or Affiliate, as applicable, to terminate your employment or service relationship (if any); (e) you are voluntarily participating in the Plan; (f) the Award and any Shares acquired under the Plan are not intended to replace any pension rights or compensation; (g) the Award and any Shares acquired under the Plan and the income and value of same, are not part of normal or expected compensation for purposes of calculating any severance, resignation, termination, redundancy, dismissal, end-of-service payments, bonuses, long-service awards, pension or retirement or welfare benefits or similar payments; (h) the future value of the Shares underlying the Stock Units is unknown, indeterminable, and cannot be predicted with certainty; (j) no claim or entitlement to compensation or damages shall arise from forfeiture of the Stock Units resulting from your ceasing to provide Services to the Company or any Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate (for any reason whatsoever, whether or not later found to be invalid or in breach of employment laws in the jurisdiction where you are employed or the terms of your service or employment agreement, if any), and in consideration of the grant of the Stock Units to which you are otherwise not entitled, you irrevocably agree never to institute any claim against the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates, waive your ability, if any, to bring any such claim, and release the Company, its Subsidiaries and Affiliates from any such claim; if, notwithstanding the foregoing, any such claim is allowed by a court of competent jurisdiction, then, by participating in the Plan, you shall be deemed irrevocably to have agreed not to pursue such claim and agree to execute any and all documents necessary to request dismissal or withdrawal of such claim; (k) unless otherwise provided in Section 17(b) of the Plan or by the Company in its discretion, the Award and the benefits evidenced by this Agreement do not create any entitlement to have the Stock Units or any such benefits transferred to, or assumed by, another company nor to be exchanged, cashed out or substituted for, in connection with any corporate transaction affecting the Shares; and (l) the following provisions apply only if you are providing Services outside the United States: (1) the Stock Units and the Shares subject to the Stock Units are not part of normal or expected compensation or salary for any purpose; (2) you acknowledge and agree that neither the Company, the Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate shall be liable for any foreign exchange rate fluctuation between your local currency and the United States Dollar that may affect the value of the Stock Units or of any amounts due to you pursuant to the vesting of the Stock Units or the subsequent sale of any Shares acquired upon vesting.    

Successors and    
   Assigns    

Except as otherwise provided in the Plan or this Agreement, every term of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective heirs, legatees, legal representatives, successors, transferees and assigns.

You understand that the Company is under no obligation to register or qualify the Shares with the SEC or any state or foreign securities commission or to seek approval or clearance from any governmental authority for the issuance or sale of the Shares. Further, you agree that the Company shall have unilateral authority to amend the Plan and the Agreement without your consent to the extent necessary to comply with securities or other laws applicable to issuance of Shares.

Any notice required or permitted under this Agreement shall be given in writing and shall be deemed effectively given upon the earliest of personal delivery, receipt or the third full day following mailing with postage and fees prepaid, addressed to the other party hereto at the address last known in the Company's records or at such other address as such party may designate by ten (10) days' advance written notice to the other party hereto.    

Electronic

The Company may, in its sole discretion, decide to deliver any documents related to current or future participation in the Plan by electronic means. You hereby consent to receive such documents by electronic delivery and agree to participate in the Plan through an on-line or electronic system established and maintained by the Company or a third party designated by the Company.

  Capitalized terms that are used herein but not defined shall have the meanings set forth in the Inphi Corporation 2010 Stock Incentive Plan (the  Plan ).  

Tax Treatment    

This Option is intended to be an incentive stock option under Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code or a nonstatutory option, if indicated in the Notice of Stock Option Grant   U.S. and Non-U.S. Employees and Consultants (the  Notice ). For U.S. taxpayers, even if this Option is designated as an incentive stock option, it shall be deemed to be a nonstatutory option to the extent required by the US$100,000 annual limitation under Section 422(d) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code.    

Vesting    

This Option becomes vested and exercisable in installments, as shown in the Notice. This Option will in no event become vested and exercisable for additional Shares after your Service as an Employee or a Consultant has terminated for any reason. For purposes of this Option, Service shall terminate if and when you cease to provide active Services, notwithstanding that you may be subject to a period of notice or garden leave protection that arises under statute, contract or at common law in the jurisdiction in which you reside or under the terms of an employment agreement, if any.  The Company determines when your active Service terminates for this purpose and all purposes under the Plan and its determinations are conclusive and binding on all persons.    

Term    

This Option expires in any event at the close of business at Company headquarters on the day before the 10th anniversary of the Grant Date, as shown on the Notice (fifth anniversary for a more than 10% stockholder as provided under the Plan if this is an incentive stock option and you are a U.S. taxpayer). This Option may expire earlier if your Service terminates, as described below.    

Regular   
   Termination    

If your Service terminates for any reason except death or Total and Permanent Disability, this Option will expire at the close of business at Company headquarters on the date three (3) months after the date your Service terminates (or, if earlier, the Expiration Date).     

Death    

If your Service terminates because of death, this Option will expire at the close of business at Company headquarters on the date 12 months after the date your Service terminates (or, if earlier, the Expiration Date). During that period of up to 12 months, your estate or heirs may exercise the Option.    

Disability    

If your Service terminates because of your Total and Permanent Disability, this Option will expire at the close of business at Company headquarters on the date 12 months after the date your Service terminates (or, if earlier, the Expiration Date).    

Date of   
   Termination of   
   Service    

If you are an Employee and your Service terminates (for any reason whatsoever, whether or not later found invalid or in breach of employment laws in the jurisdiction where you are providing Services or the terms of your employment agreement, if any), unless otherwise provided in this Stock Option Agreement   U.S. and Non-U.S. Employees and Consultants   (including any applicable country-specific provisions in the Appendix attached hereto) (together, the  Agreement ) or determined by the Company, your right to exercise the Option after termination of Service, if any, will be measured by the date of termination of your Services and will not be extended by any notice period mandated under employment laws in the jurisdiction where you are providing Services or terms of your employment agreement, if any; the Committee shall have the exclusive discretion to determine when you are no longer actively providing Services for purposes of your Option.

Leaves of Absence    

For purposes of this Option, your Service does not terminate when you go on a military leave, a sick leave or another bona fide leave of absence, if the leave was approved by the Company in writing and if continued crediting of Service is required by the terms of the leave. But your Service will terminate when the approved leave ends, unless you immediately return to work. If you go on a leave of absence, then the vesting schedule specified in the Notice may be adjusted in accordance with the Company s leave of absence policy or the terms of your leave. If you commence working on a part-time basis, then the vesting schedule specified in the Notice may be adjusted in accordance with the Company s part-time work policy or the terms of an agreement between you and the Company pertaining to your part-time schedule.    

Restrictions on   
   Exercise    

The Company will not permit you to exercise this Option if the issuance of Shares at that time would violate any law or regulation concerning Share issuance. The inability of the Company to obtain approval from any regulatory body having authority deemed by the Company to be necessary to the lawful issuance and sale of the Company Stock pursuant to this Option shall relieve the Company of any liability with respect to the non-issuance or sale of the Company Stock as to which such approval shall not have been obtained.    

Notice of Exercise    

When you wish to exercise this Option, you must provide a notice of exercise form in accordance with such procedures as are established by the Company and communicated to you from time to time. Any notice of exercise must specify how many Shares you wish to purchase and how your Shares should be registered. The notice of exercise will be effective when it is received by the Company. If someone else wants to exercise this Option after your death, that person must prove to the Company s satisfaction that he or she is entitled to do so.    

Form of Payment    

When you submit your notice of exercise, you must include payment of the Exercise Price and any Tax-Related Items (as defined in the Responsibility for Taxes Section below) for the Shares you are purchasing.

Responsibility for   
   Taxes

You further acknowledge that the Company and/or the Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate (i) make no representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of the Option, including, but not limited to, the grant, vesting or exercise of the Option, the subsequent sale of Shares acquired pursuant to such exercise and the receipt of any dividends; and (ii) do not commit to and are under no obligation to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the Option to reduce or eliminate your liability for Tax-Related Items or achieve any particular tax result. Further, if you are subject to Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction between the Grant Date and the date of any relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, you acknowledge that the Company and/or the Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate may be required to withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction.  
     
  Prior to the relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, you agree to make adequate arrangements satisfactory to the Company and/or the Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate to satisfy all Tax-Related Items. In this regard, you authorize the Company and/or the Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate, or their respective agents, at their discretion, to satisfy the obligations with regard to all Tax-Related Items by one or a combination of the following:   
     
  (1) withholding from your wages or other cash compensation paid to you by the Company and/or the Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate; or  
     
  (2) withholding from proceeds of the sale of Shares acquired at exercise of the Option either through a voluntary sale or through a mandatory sale arranged by the Company (on your behalf pursuant to this authorization) without further consent.  
     
  Depending upon the withholding method, the Company may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering applicable minimum statutory withholding amounts or other withholding rates, including maximum applicable rates, in which case you will receive a refund of any other withheld amount in cash and will have no entitlement to the Shares equivalent.  
     
  Finally, you agree to pay to the Company or the Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate any amount of Tax-Related Items that it may be required to withhold or account for as a result of your participation in the Plan that cannot be satisfied by the means previously described. The Company may refuse to issue or deliver the Shares or the proceeds of the sale of Shares, if you fail to comply with your obligations in connection with the Tax-Related Items.

Responsibility for Taxe    s   .  This provision supplements the Responsibility for Taxes section of the Agreement:  
     
  If payment or withholding of the income tax owed on the exercise of the Option is not made within ninety (90) days of the end of the U.K. tax year in which the tax event occurs or such other period specified in Section 222(1)(c) of the U.K. Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003 (the  Due Date ), the amount that should have been withheld from or paid by you shall constitute a loan owed by you to the Company or the Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate retaining your Services, effective on the Due Date. You agree that the loan will bear interest at the then-current Official Rate of Her Majesty s Revenue and Customs ( HMRC ), it will be immediately due and repayable, and the Company or the Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate retaining your Services may recover it at any time thereafter by any of the means referred to in the Responsibility for Taxes section of the Agreement.  
     
  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you are a director or executive officer of the Company (within the meaning of Section 13(k) of the Exchange Act), you will not be eligible for such a loan to cover the income taxes. In the event that you are a director or executive officer and the income taxes are not collected from or paid by you by the Due Date, the amount of any uncollected tax will constitute a benefit to you on which additional income tax and National Insurance Contributions ( NICs ) (including Employer NICs, as defined below) will be payable. You will be responsible for reporting and paying any income tax due on this additional benefit directly to HMRC under the self-assessment regime, and for reimbursing the Company and/or the Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate retaining your Services (as appropriate) for the value of employee NICs due on this additional benefit which the Company and/or the Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate retaining your Services may recover from you by any of the means set forth in the Responsibility for Taxes section of the Agreement.

  Without limitation to the foregoing, you agree to execute a joint election with the Company and/or the Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate retaining your Services (the  Joint Election ), the form of such Joint Election being formally approved by HMRC, and any other consent or election required to accomplish the transfer of the Employer NICs to you. You further agree to execute such other joint elections as may be required with any successor to the Company and/or the Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate retaining your Services. If you do not enter into a Joint Election prior to the first applicable exercise date, the right to obtain Shares under the Plan shall become null and void without any liability to the Company and/or the Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate retaining your Services. You further agree that the Company and/or the Parent, Subsidiary or Affiliate retaining your Services may collect the Employer NICs from you in accordance with the Responsibility for Taxes section and the supplement thereto above.

Exhibit 10.5                      
     
   INPHI CORPORATION   
     
   CHANGE OF CONTROL SEVERANCE AGREEMENT   
       
  This Change of Control Severance Agreement (this "Agreement") is made and entered into effective as of April 22, 2013 (the "Effective Date"), by and between Richard Ogawa ("Executive") and Inphi Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"). Certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined in Section 1 below.  
     
    RECITALS    
     
  A.       It is expected that the Company from time to time will consider the possibility of a Change of Control. The Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") recognizes that such consideration can be a distraction to Executive and can cause Executive to consider alternative employment opportunities.  
     
  B.       The Board believes that it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to provide Executive with an incentive to continue his employment and to maximize the value of the Company upon a Change of Control for the benefit of its shareholders.  
     
  C.       In order to provide Executive with enhanced financial security and sufficient encouragement to remain with the Company notwithstanding the possibility of a Change of Control, the Board believes that it is imperative to provide Executive with certain severance and other benefits upon Executive's termination of employment in connection with a Change of Control.  
     
   AGREEMENT   
     
  In consideration of the mutual covenants herein contained and the continued employment of Executive by the Company, the parties agree as follows:  
     
  1.        Definition of Terms . The following terms referred to in this Agreement shall have the following meanings:  
     
  (a)        Cause . "Cause" shall mean (i) commission of a felony, an act involving moral turpitude, or an act constituting common law fraud, and which has a material adverse effect on the business or affairs of the Company or its affiliates or stockholders; (ii) intentional or willful misconduct or refusal to follow the lawful instructions of the Board that is not cured within thirty (30) days following written notice from the Board; or (iii) intentional breach of Company confidential information obligations which has an adverse effect on the Company or  
  its affiliates or stockholders. For these purposes, no act or failure to act shall be considered "intentional or willful" unless it is done, or omitted to be done, in bad faith without a reasonable belief that the action or omission is in the best interests of the Company.  
     
  (b)        Change of Control . "Change of Control" shall mean the occurrence of any of the following events:  

(i)       the approval by the shareholders of the Company of a plan of complete liquidation or dissolution of the Company or the closing of a sale or disposition by the Company of all or substantially all of the Company's assets, other than a sale or disposition to a subsidiary of the Company or to an entity, the voting securities of which are owned by the stockholders of the Company in substantially the same proportions as their ownership of the Company's voting securities immediately prior to such sale or disposition;  
     
  (ii)       a merger or consolidation of the Company with any other corporation, other than a merger or consolidation which would result in the voting securities of the Company outstanding immediately prior thereto continuing to represent directly or indirectly (either by remaining outstanding or by being converted into voting securities of the surviving entity) more than fifty percent (50%) of the total voting power represented by the voting securities of the Company or such surviving entity outstanding immediately after such merger or consolidation;  
     
  (iii)       any "person" (as such term is used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) becoming the "beneficial owner" (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under said Act), directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company representing fifty percent (50%) or more of the total voting power represented by the Company's then outstanding voting securities; or  
     
  (iv)       a change in the composition of the Board, as a result of which fewer than a majority of the directors are Incumbent Directors. "Incumbent Directors" shall mean directors who either (A) are directors of the Company as of the date hereof or (B) are elected, or nominated for election, to the Board with the affirmative votes of at least a majority of those directors whose election or nomination was not in connection with any transactions described in subsections (i), (ii) or (iii), or in connection with an actual or threatened proxy contest relating to the election of directors of the Company.  
     
  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the term "Change of Control" shall not be deemed to have occurred if the Company files for bankruptcy protection, or if a petition for involuntary relief is filed against the Company.  

(c)       
 
     Involuntary Termination . "Involuntary Termination" shall mean:     
     
  (i)       without Executive's express written consent, a material reduction in Executive's title, authority, duties or responsibilities relative to Executive's title, authority, duties or responsibilities in effect immediately prior to the Change of Control or a material reduction in the title, authority, duties, or responsibilities of the supervisor to whom the service provider is required to report relative to the supervisor's title, authority, duties or responsibilities in effect immediately prior to the Change of Control;  
     
  (ii)       without Executive's express written consent, a reduction by the Company of Executive's base compensation of more than ten percent (10%) as in effect immediately prior to the Change of Control, unless such reduction in base compensation is part of a general reduction in compensation applicable to senior executives of the Company;  

2

(iii)       without Executive's express written consent, the relocation of Executive's principal place of employment to a facility or a location more than fifty (50) miles from its location immediately prior to the Change of Control;  
     
  (iv)           any termination of Executive by the Company which is not   effected for Cause; or  
     
  (v)       the failure of the Company to obtain the assumption of this Agreement or any other agreement between the Company and Executive by any successors contemplated in Section 7 below.  
     
  A termination shall not be considered an "Involuntary Termination" unless Executive provides notice to the Company of the existence of the condition described in subsections (i), (ii), (iii) or (v) above within ninety (90) days of the initial existence of such condition, the Company fails to remedy the condition within thirty (30) days following the receipt of such notice, and Executive terminates employment within one-hundred eighty (180) days following the initial existence of such condition. A termination due to death or disability shall not be considered an Involuntary Termination.  
     
  (d)        Termination Date . "Termination Date" shall mean Executive's "separation from service" within the meaning of that term under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").  
     
  2.        Term of Agreement . This Agreement shall terminate upon the date that all obligations of the parties hereto under this Agreement have been satisfied.  
     
  3.        At-Will Employment . The Company and Executive acknowledge that Executive's employment is and shall continue to be at-will, as defined under applicable law.  
     
  4.        Severance Benefits   .  
     
  (a)        Involuntary Termination in Connection with a Change of Control . If Executive's employment with the Company terminates as a result of an Involuntary Termination on or at any time within twelve months (12) months after a Change of Control, or within three   (3) months prior to a Change of Control, and Executive signs and does not revoke a standard release of claims with the Company in a form acceptable to the Company (the "Release") within fifty (50) days following the later of the Change of Control or the Termination Date (or such shorter period as the Company may require), then Executive shall be entitled to the following severance benefits:  
     
  (i)       50% of the sum of Executive's annual base salary (as in effect prior to any reduction that constitutes a basis for Involuntary Termination pursuant to this Agreement) as in effect on the Termination Date, payable in a lump sum on the date on which the Release becomes irrevocable (provided, however, that if any portion of such amount is subject to Section 409A of the Code as nonqualified deferred compensation, then payment shall be made on the sixtieth (60th) day following the later of the Termination Date or the Change of Control, subject to Section 6 below);  

3

(ii)       any earned but unpaid annual bonus for any annual bonus period which had ended prior to the Termination Date, which amount shall be paid at such time as annual bonuses are paid to other senior executives of the Company;  
     
  (iii)       acceleration of the vesting and exercisability of 50% of Executive's options, stock appreciation rights, restricted shares and stock units with respect to the Company or its successor, or the parent of either, to the extent outstanding on the Termination Date, or of any deferred compensation into which Executive's stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted shares or stock units were converted upon the Change of Control (the "Equity Awards"); provided, however, that notwithstanding any contrary term of the Equity Award agreement, if Executive is entitled to accelerated vesting as a result of an Involuntary Termination within three (3) months prior to a Change of Control: (x) the portion of the Equity Award subject to such accelerated vesting shall not be forfeited or terminated upon the Termination Date pending the Change of Control, (x) the accelerated vesting shall be deemed to take place immediately prior to the effective date of the Change of Control, and (y) the period within which the Equity Award may be exercised following the Termination Date, if applicable, will expire no less than one (1)     month following the effective date of the Change in Control (but no later than the expiration of the term of the Equity Award); and  
     
  (iv)       if Executive so elects and pays to continue health insurance under Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended, or corresponding provision of state law ("COBRA"), then beginning in the month following the Termination Date (or if later, the date the Release becomes irrevocable, with a catch-up payment for reimbursements deferred pending the irrevocability of the Release), Executive will be reimbursed on a monthly basis in an amount equal to the monthly amount the Company was paying as the employer-portion of premium contributions for health coverage for Executive and Executive's eligible dependents immediately before the Termination Date, until the earlier of: (i) the end of the 6-month period following Termination Date or (ii) the date Executive or Executive's eligible dependents lose eligibility for COBRA continuation coverage. The period of such employer-reimbursed COBRA continuation coverage shall be considered part of Executive's (and Executive's eligible dependents') COBRA coverage entitlement period. Executive will be solely responsible for timely electing such continuation coverage for Executive and Executive's eligible dependents. Any increase in the premium contribution and/or in the number of covered dependents by Executive during the period that Executive continues in the Company's health insurance benefit plans or receives company-paid reimbursement of COBRA premiums will be at Executive's own expense.  
     
  (b)        Termination Apart from a Change of Control .   If   Executive's employment with the Company terminates other than as a result of an Involuntary Termination on or at any time within twelve months (12) months after a Change of Control, or within three (3) months prior to a Change of Control, then Executive shall not be entitled to receive severance or other benefits hereunder.  
     
  (c)        Accrued Wages and Vacation; Expenses . Without regard to the reason for, or the timing of, Executive's termination of employment: (i) the Company shall pay Executive any unpaid wages due for periods prior to the Termination Date; (ii) the Company shall pay Executive all of Executive's accrued and unused vacation through the Termination  Date ; and (iii) following submission of proper expense reports by Executive, the Company shall reimburse Executive for all expenses reasonably and necessarily incurred by Executive in connection with the business of the Company prior to the Termination Date. These payments shall be made promptly upon termination and within the period of time mandated by law.  

4

5.        Limitation on Payments . In the event that the severance and other benefits provided for in this Agreement or otherwise payable to Executive (i) constitute "parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and (ii) would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code (the "Excise Tax"), then Executive's benefits under this Agreement shall be either:  
     
  (a)       delivered in full or  
     
  (b)       delivered as to such lesser extent which would result in no portion of such benefits being subject to the Excise Tax,  
     
  whichever of the foregoing amounts, taking into account the applicable federal, state and local income taxes and the Excise Tax, results in the receipt by Executive on an after-tax basis, of the greatest amount of benefits, notwithstanding that all or some portion of such benefits may be taxable under Section 4999 of the Code.  
     
  Unless the Company and Executive otherwise agree in writing, any determination required under this Section 5 shall be made in writing by the Company's independent public accountants (the "Accountants"), whose determination shall be conclusive and binding upon Executive and the Company for all purposes. For purposes of making the calculations required by this Section 5, the Accountants may make reasonable assumptions and approximations concerning applicable taxes and may rely on reasonable, good faith interpretations concerning the application of Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code. The Company and Executive shall furnish to the Accountants such information and documents as the Accountants may reasonably request in order to make a determination under this Section 5. The Company shall bear all costs the Accountants may reasonably incur in connection with any calculations contemplated by this Section 5. In the event that a reduction is required, the reduction shall be applied first to any benefits that are not subject to Section 409A of the Code, and then shall be applied to benefits (if any) that are subject to Section 409A of the Code, with the benefits payable latest in time subject to reduction first.  
     
  6.        Section 409A; Delayed Commencement of Benefits . Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Agreement, no cash severance and no Company-paid health care coverage to which Executive otherwise becomes entitled under this Agreement shall be made or provided to Executive prior to the earlier of (i) the expiration of the six (6)-month period measured from the Termination Date or (ii) the date of Executive's death, if Executive is deemed on the Termination Date to be a "specified employee" within the meaning of that term under Code Section 409A and such delayed commencement is otherwise required in order to avoid a prohibited distribution under Code Section 409A(a)(2). Upon the expiration of the applicable Code Section 409A(a)(2) deferral period, all payments and benefits deferred pursuant to this Section 6 (whether they would have otherwise been payable in a single sum or in installments in the absence of such deferral) shall be paid or reimbursed to Executive in a lump sum, and any     remaining payments and benefits due under this Agreement shall be paid or provided in accordance with the normal payment dates specified for them herein. Executive shall be entitled to interest on the deferred benefits and payments for the period the commencement of those benefits and payments is delayed by reason of Code Section 409A(a)(2), with such interest to accrue at the prime rate in effect from time to time during that period and to be paid in a lump sum upon the expiration of the deferral period. Each installment payment under Section 4 shall be considered a separate payment for purposes of Code Section 409A.  
     
  7.                Successors   .  
     
  (a)       Company's Successors. Any successor to the Company (whether direct or indirect and whether by purchase, lease, merger, consolidation, liquidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the Company's business and/or assets shall assume the Company's obligations under this Agreement and agree expressly to perform the Company's obligations under this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent as the Company would be required to perform such obligations in the absence of a succession. For all purposes under this Agreement, the term "Company" shall include any successor to the Company's business and/or assets which executes and delivers the assumption agreement described in this subsection (a) or which becomes bound by the terms of this Agreement by operation of law.  
     
  (b)        Executive's Successors . Without the written consent of the Company, Executive shall not assign or transfer this Agreement or any right or obligation under this Agreement to any other person or entity. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the terms of this Agreement and all rights of Executive hereunder shall inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, Executive's personal or legal representatives, executors, administrators, successors, heirs, distributees, devisees and legatees.  

5 

8.        N    otices   .  
     
  (a)        General . Notices and all other communications contemplated by this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given when personally delivered or when mailed by U.S. registered or certified mail, return receipt requested and postage prepaid. In the case of Executive, mailed notices shall be addressed to him at the home address which he most recently communicated to the Company in writing. In the case of the Company, mailed notices shall be addressed to its corporate headquarters, and all notices shall be directed to the attention of its Secretary.  
     
  (b)        Notice of Termination . Any termination by the Company for Cause or by Executive as a result of an Involuntary Termination shall be communicated by a notice of termination to the other party hereto given in accordance with this Section 8. Such notice shall indicate the specific termination provision in this Agreement relied upon, shall set forth in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances claimed to provide a basis for termination under the provision so indicated, and shall specify the Termination Date (which shall be not more than thirty (30) days after the giving of such notice). The failure by Executive to include in the notice any fact or circumstance which contributes to a showing of Involuntary Termination shall not waive any right of Executive hereunder or preclude Executive from asserting such fact or circumstance in enforcing his rights hereunder, subject to the requirements of Section 1(c).  
        
  9.        Arbitration . Any controversy involving the construction or application of any terms, covenants or conditions of this Agreement, or any claims arising out of any alleged breach of this Agreement, will be governed by the rules of the American Arbitration Association and submitted to and settled by final and binding arbitration in Santa Clara County, California, except that any alleged breach of Executive's confidential information obligations shall not be submitted to arbitration and instead the Company may seek all legal and equitable remedies, including without limitation, injunctive relief.  
     
  10.     Miscellaneous Provisions   .  
     
  (a)        No Duty to Mitigate . Executive shall not be required to mitigate the amount of any payment contemplated by this Agreement, nor shall any such payment be reduced by any earnings that Executive may receive from any other source.  
     
  (b)        Waiver . No provision of this Agreement may be modified, waived or discharged unless the modification, waiver or discharge is agreed to in writing and signed by Executive and by an authorized officer of the Company (other than Executive). No waiver by either party of any breach of, or of compliance with, any condition or provision of this Agreement by the other party shall be considered a waiver of any other condition or provision or of the same condition or provision at another time.  
     
  (c)        Integration . This Agreement represents the entire agreement and understanding between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.  
     
  (d)        Choice     of     Law   . The validity, interpretation, construction and performance of this Agreement shall be governed by the internal substantive laws, but not the conflicts of law rules, of the State of California.  
     
  (e)        Severability . The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision or provisions of this Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision hereof, which shall remain in full force and effect.  
     
  (f)        Employment Taxes . All payments made pursuant to this Agreement shall be subject to withholding of applicable income and employment taxes.  
     
  (g)        Counterparts . This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together will constitute one and the same instrument.

Exhibit 10.7  
     
   INPHI CORPORATION   
       
   CHANGE OF CONTROL SEVERANCE AGREEMENT   
       
  This Change of Control Severance Agreement (this "Agreement") is made and entered into effective as of January 22, 2014 (the "Effective Date"), by and between Ron Torten ("Executive") and Inphi Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company"). Certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined in Section 1 below.  
     
    RECITALS    
       
  A.     It is expected that the Company from time to time will consider the possibility of a Change of Control. The Board of Directors of the Company (the "Board") recognizes that such consideration can be a distraction to Executive and can cause Executive to consider alternative employment opportunities.  
     
  B.     The Board believes that it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to provide Executive with an incentive to continue his employment and to maximize the value of the Company upon a Change of Control for the benefit of its shareholders.  
     
  C.     In order to provide Executive with enhanced financial security and sufficient encouragement to remain with the Company notwithstanding the possibility of a Change of Control, the Board believes that it is imperative to provide Executive with certain severance and other benefits upon Executive's termination of employment in connection with a Change of Control.  
     
   AGREEMENT   
       
  In consideration of the mutual covenants herein contained and the continued employment of Executive by the Company, the parties agree as follows:  
     
  I.        Definition of Terms . The following terms referred to in this Agreement shall have the following meanings:  
     
  (a)        Cause . "Cause" shall mean (i) commission of a felony, an act involving moral turpitude, or an act constituting common law fraud, and which has a material adverse effect on the business or affairs of the Company or its affiliates or stockholders; (ii) intentional or willful misconduct or refusal to follow the lawful instructions of the Board that is not cured within thirty (30) days following written notice from the Board; or (iii) intentional breach of Company confidential information obligations which has an adverse effect on the Company or its affiliates or stockholders. For these purposes, no act or failure to act shall be considered "intentional or willful" unless it is done, or omitted to be done, in bad faith without a reasonable belief that the action or omission is in the best interests of the Company.  
     
  (b)        Change of Control . "Change of Control" shall mean the occurrence of any of the following events:  

(i)       the approval by the shareholders of the Company of a plan of complete liquidation or dissolution of the Company or the closing of a sale or disposition by the Company of all or substantially all of the Company's assets, other than a sale or disposition to a subsidiary of the Company or to an entity, the voting securities of which are owned by the stockholders of the Company in substantially the same proportions as their ownership of the Company's voting securities immediately prior to such sale or disposition;  
     
  (ii)       a merger or consolidation of the Company with any other corporation, other than a merger or consolidation which would result in the voting securities of the Company outstanding immediately prior thereto continuing to represent directly or indirectly (either by remaining outstanding or by being converted into voting securities of the surviving entity) more than fifty percent (50%) of the total voting power represented by the voting securities of the Company or such surviving entity outstanding immediately after such merger or consolidation;  

(iii)       any "person" (as such term is used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) becoming the "beneficial owner" (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under said Act), directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company representing fifty percent (50%) or more of the total voting power represented by the Company's then outstanding voting securities; or  
     
  (iv)       a change in the composition of the Board, as a result of which fewer than a majority of the directors are Incumbent Directors. "Incumbent Directors" shall mean directors who either (A) are directors of the Company as of the date hereof or (B) are elected, or nominated for election, to the Board with the affirmative votes of at least a majority of those directors whose election or nomination was not in connection with any transactions described in subsections (i), (ii) or (iii), or in connection with an actual or threatened proxy contest relating to the election of directors of the Company.  
     
  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the term "Change of Control" shall not be deemed to have occurred if the Company files for bankruptcy protection, or if a petition for involuntary relief is filed against the Company.  

(c)       
 
     Involuntary Termination.  "Involuntary Termination" shall mean:     
     
  (i)       without Executive's express written consent, a material reduction in Executive's title, authority, duties or responsibilities relative to Executive's title, authority, duties or responsibilities in effect immediately prior to the Change of Control or a material reduction in the title, authority, duties, or responsibilities of the supervisor to whom the service provider is required to report relative to the supervisor's title, authority, duties or responsibilities in effect immediately prior to the Change of Control;  
     
  (ii)       without Executive's express written consent, a reduction by the Company of Executive's base compensation of more than ten percent (10%) as in effect immediately prior to the Change of Control, unless such reduction in base compensation is part of a general reduction in compensation applicable to senior executives of the Company;  

2

(iii)       without Executive's express written consent, the relocation of Executive's principal place of employment to a facility or a location more than fifty (50) miles from its location immediately prior to the Change of Control;  
     
  (iv)       any termination of Executive by the Company which is not  effected for Cause; or 
     
  (v)       the failure of the Company to obtain the assumption of this Agreement or any other agreement between the Company and Executive by any successors contemplated in Section 7 below.  
     
  A termination shall not be considered an "Involuntary Termination" unless Executive provides notice to the Company of the existence of the condition described in subsections (i), (ii), (iii) or (v) above within ninety (90) days of the initial existence of such condition, the Company fails to remedy the condition within thirty (30) days following the receipt of such notice, and Executive terminates employment within one-hundred eighty (180) days following the initial existence of such condition. A termination due to death or disability shall not be considered an Involuntary Termination.  
     
  (d)        Termination Date . "Termination Date" shall mean Executive's "separation from service" within the meaning of that term under Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code").  
     
  2.        Te  rm   of Agreement . This Agreement shall terminate upon the date that all obligations of the parties hereto under this Agreement have been satisfied.  
     
  3.        At-Will Employment . The Company and Executive acknowledge that Executive's employment is and shall continue to be at-will, as defined under applicable law.  
     
  4.                      S  everance     Benefits   .  
     
  (a)        Involuntary Termination in Connection with a Change of Control .

  (i)       50% of the sum of Executive's annual base salary (as in effect prior to any reduction that constitutes a basis for Involuntary Termination pursuant to this Agreement) as in effect on the Termination Date, payable in a lump sum on the date on which the Release becomes irrevocable (provided, however, that if any portion of such amount is subject to Section 409A of the Code as nonqualified deferred compensation, then payment shall be made on the sixtieth (60th) day following the later of the Termination Date or the Change of Control, subject to Section 6 below);

(ii)       any earned but unpaid annual bonus for any annual bonus period which had ended prior to the Termination Date, which amount shall be paid at such time as annual bonuses are paid to other senior executives of the Company;  
     
  (iii)       acceleration of the vesting and exercisability of 50% of Executive's options, stock appreciation rights, restricted shares and stock units with respect to the Company or its successor, or the parent of either, to the extent outstanding on the Termination Date, or of any deferred compensation into which Executive's stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted shares or stock units were converted upon the Change of Control (the "Equity Awards"); provided, however, that notwithstanding any contrary term of the Equity Award agreement, if Executive is entitled to accelerated vesting as a result of an Involuntary Termination within three (3) months prior to a Change of Control: (x) the portion of the Equity Award subject to such accelerated vesting shall not be forfeited or terminated upon the Termination Date pending the Change of Control, (x) the accelerated vesting shall be deemed to take place immediately prior to the effective date of the Change of Control, and (y) the period within which the Equity Award may be exercised following the Termination Date, if applicable, will expire no less than one (I) month following the effective date of the Change in Control (but no later than the expiration of the term of the Equity Award); and  
     
  (iv)       if Executive so elects and pays to continue health insurance under Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended, or corresponding provision of state law ("COBRA"), then beginning in the month following the Termination Date (or if later, the date the Release becomes irrevocable, with a catch-up payment for reimbursements deferred pending the irrevocability of the Release), Executive will be reimbursed on a monthly basis in an amount equal to the monthly amount the Company was paying as the employer-portion of premium contributions for health coverage for Executive and Executive's eligible dependents immediately before the Termination Date, until the earlier of: (i) the end of the 6-month period following Termination Date or (ii) the date Executive or   Executive's eligible dependents lose eligibility for COBRA continuation coverage. The period of such employer-reimbursed COBRA continuation coverage shall be considered part of Executive's (and Executive's eligible dependents') COBRA coverage entitlement period.   Executive will be solely responsible for timely electing such continuation coverage for Executive and Executive's eligible dependents. Any increase in the premium contribution and/or in the number of covered dependents by Executive during the period that Executive continues in the Company's health insurance benefit plans or receives company-paid reimbursement of COBRA premiums will be at Executive's own expense.  
     
  (b)        Termination Apart from a Change of Control .   If   Executive's employment with the Company terminates other than as a result of an Involuntary Termination on or at any time within twelve months (12) months after a Change of Control, or within three (3) months prior to a Change of Control, then Executive shall not be entitled to receive severance or other benefits hereunder.  
     
  (c)        Accrued Wages and Vacation; Expenses . Without regard to the reason for, or the timing of, Executive's termination of employment: (i) the Company shall pay Executive any unpaid wages due for periods prior to the Termination Date; (ii) the Company shall pay Executive all of Executive's accrued and unused vacation through the Termination   Date; and (iii) following submission of proper expense reports by Executive, the Company shall reimburse Executive for all expenses reasonably and necessarily incurred by Executive in connection with the business of the Company prior to the Termination Date. These payments shall be made promptly upon termination and within the period of time mandated by law.  

4

5.        Limitation on Payments . In the event that the severance and other benefits provided for in this Agreement or otherwise payable to Executive (i) constitute "parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code and (ii) would be subject to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Code (the "Excise Tax"), then Executive's benefits under this Agreement shall be either:  
     
  (a)       delivered in full or  
     
  (b)       delivered as to such lesser extent which would result in no portion of such benefits being subject to the Excise Tax,  
     
  whichever of the foregoing amounts, taking into account the applicable federal, state and local income taxes and the Excise Tax, results in the receipt by Executive on an after-tax basis, of the greatest amount of benefits, notwithstanding that all or some portion of such benefits may be taxable under Section 4999 of the Code.  
     
  Unless the Company and Executive otherwise agree in writing, any determination required under this Section 5 shall be made in writing by the Company's independent public accountants (the "Accountants"), whose determination shall be conclusive and binding upon Executive and the Company for all purposes. For purposes of making the calculations required by this Section 5, the Accountants may make reasonable assumptions and approximations concerning applicable taxes and may rely on reasonable, good faith interpretations concerning the application of Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code. The Company and Executive shall furnish to the Accountants such information and documents as the Accountants may reasonably request in order to make a determination under this Section 5. The Company shall bear all costs the Accountants may reasonably incur in connection with any calculations contemplated by this Section 5. In the event that a reduction is required, the reduction shall be applied first to any benefits that are not subject to Section 409A of the Code, and then shall be applied to benefits (if any) that are subject to Section 409A of the Code, with the benefits payable latest in time subject to reduction first.  
     
  6.        Section 409A; Delayed Commencement of Benefits . Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Agreement, no cash severance and no Company-paid health care coverage to which Executive otherwise becomes entitled under this Agreement shall be made or provided to Executive prior to the earlier of (i) the expiration of the six (6)-month period measured from the Termination Date or (ii) the date of Executive's death, if Executive is deemed on the Termination Date to be a "specified employee" within the meaning of that term under Code Section 409A and such delayed commencement is otherwise required in order to avoid a prohibited distribution under Code Section 409A(a)(2). Upon the expiration of the applicable Code Section 409A(a)(2) deferral period, all payments and benefits deferred pursuant to this Section 6 (whether they would have otherwise been payable in a single sum or in installments in the absence of such deferral) shall be paid or reimbursed to Executive in a lump sum, and any   remaining payments and benefits due under this Agreement shall be paid or provided in accordance with the normal payment dates specified for them herein. Executive shall be entitled to interest on the deferred benefits and payments for the period the commencement of those benefits and payments is delayed by reason of Code Section 409A(a)(2), with such interest to accrue at the prime rate in effect from time to time during that period and to be paid in a lump sum upon the expiration of the deferral period. Each installment payment under Section 4 shall be considered a separate payment for purposes of Code Section 409A.

7.                Successors   .  
     
  (a)       Company's Successors. Any successor to the Company (whether direct or indirect and whether by purchase, lease, merger, consolidation, liquidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the Company's business and/or assets shall assume the Company's obligations under this Agreement and agree expressly to perform the Company's obligations under this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent as the Company would be required to perform such obligations in the absence of a succession. For all purposes under this Agreement, the term "Company" shall include any successor to the Company's business and/or assets which executes and delivers the assumption agreement described in this subsection (a) or which becomes bound by the terms of this Agreement by operation of law.  
     
  (b)        Executive's Successors   . Without the written consent of the Company, Executive shall not assign or transfer this Agreement or any right or obligation under this Agreement to any other person or entity. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the terms of this Agreement and all rights of Executive hereunder shall inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, Executive's personal or legal representatives, executors, administrators, successors, heirs, distributees, devisees and legatees.  
     
  8.                Notices   .  
     
  (a)        General    .  Notices and all other communications contemplated by this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given when personally delivered or when mailed by U.S. registered or certified mail, return receipt requested and postage prepaid. In the case of Executive, mailed notices shall be addressed to him at the home address which he most recently communicated to the Company in writing. In the case of the Company, mailed notices shall be addressed to its corporate headquarters, and all notices shall be directed to the attention of its Secretary.  
     
  (b)        Notice of Termination . Any termination by the Company for Cause or by Executive as a result of an Involuntary Termination shall be communicated by a notice of termination to the other party hereto given in accordance with this Section 8. Such notice shall indicate the specific termination provision in this Agreement relied upon, shall set forth in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances claimed to provide a basis for termination under the provision so indicated, and shall specify the Termination Date (which shall be not more than thirty (30) days after the giving of such notice). The failure by Executive to include in the notice any fact or circumstance which contributes to a showing of Involuntary Termination shall not waive any right of Executive hereunder or preclude Executive from asserting such fact or circumstance in enforcing his rights hereunder, subject to the requirements of Section 1(c).    

6

9.        Arbitration.  Any controversy involving the construction or application of any terms, covenants or conditions of this Agreement, or any claims arising out of any alleged breach of this Agreement, will be governed by the rules of the American Arbitration Association and submitted to and settled by final and binding arbitration in Santa Clara County, California, except that any alleged breach of Executive's confidential information obligations shall not be submitted to arbitration and instead the Company may seek all legal and equitable remedies, including without limitation, injunctive relief.  
     
  10.                  Miscellaneous     Provisions   .  
     
  (a)        No Duty to Mitigate . Executive shall not be required to mitigate the amount of any payment contemplated by this Agreement, nor shall any such payment be reduced by any earnings that Executive may receive from any other source.  
     
  (b)        Waiver . No provision of this Agreement may be modified, waived or discharged unless the modification, waiver or discharge is agreed to in writing and signed by Executive and by an authorized officer of the Company (other than Executive). No waiver by either patty of any breach of, or of compliance with, any condition or provision of this Agreement by the other party shall be considered a waiver of any other condition or provision or of the same condition or provision at another time.  
     
  (c)        Integration . This Agreement represents the entire agreement and understanding between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.  
     
  (d)        Choice of Law . The validity, interpretation, construction and performance of this Agreement shall be governed by the internal substantive laws, but not the conflicts of law rules, of the State of California.  
     
  (e)        Severability . The invalidity unenforceability of any provision or provisions of this Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other provision hereof, which shall remain in full force and effect.  
     
  (f)        Employment Taxes . All payments made pursuant to this Agreement shall be subject to withholding of applicable income and employment taxes.  
     
  (g)        Counterparts . This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together will constitute one and the same instrument.
