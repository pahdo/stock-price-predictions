NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

  (UNAUDITED)  

NOTE 1    BASIS OF
PRESENTATION  

The consolidated financial statements of The
Community Financial Corporation (the  Company ) and its wholly owned subsidiary, Community Bank of the Chesapeake (the
 Bank ), and the Bank s wholly owned subsidiary, Community Mortgage Corporation of Tri-County, included herein
are unaudited. 

The consolidated financial statements reflect
all adjustments consisting only of normal recurring accruals that, in the opinion of management, are necessary to present fairly
the Company s financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows for the periods presented. Certain information and
note disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission. The Company believes that the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. The balances
as of December 31, 2015 have been derived from audited financial statements. There have been no significant changes to the Company s
accounting policies as disclosed in the 2015 Annual Report. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations to be expected for the remainder of the year or any other
period. Certain previously reported amounts have been restated to conform to the 2016 presentation. 

These consolidated financial statements should
be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included in the Company s 2015 Annual Report. 

NOTE 2     NATURE OF
BUSINESS  

The Company provides a variety of financial
services to individuals and businesses through its offices in Southern Maryland and Fredericksburg, Virginia. Its primary deposit
products are demand, savings and time deposits, and its primary lending products are commercial and residential mortgage loans,
commercial loans, construction and land development loans, home equity and second mortgages and commercial equipment loans. 

The Bank conducts business through its main
office in Waldorf, Maryland, and eleven branch offices in Waldorf, Bryans Road, Dunkirk, Leonardtown, La Plata, Charlotte Hall,
Prince Frederick, Lusby, California, Maryland; and Fredericksburg, Virginia. The Company maintains five loan production offices
( LPOs ) in Annapolis, La Plata, Prince Frederick and Leonardtown, Maryland; and Fredericksburg, Virginia. The Leonardtown
and Fredericksburg LPOs are co-located with branches. The Company s second branch in Fredericksburg opened in April 2016. 

The Company sold its King George, Virginia
branch building and equipment to a credit union. The Company s 2015 third quarter operating results reflect the financial
impact of the transaction. The Company recorded an impairment of $426,000 during the third quarter of 2015. The transaction closed
on January 28, 2016. 

NOTE 3     INCOME TAXES  

The Company files a consolidated federal income
tax return with its subsidiaries. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined using the liability (or balance sheet) method.
Under this method, the net deferred tax asset or liability is determined based on the tax effects of the temporary differences
between the book and tax bases of the various balance sheet assets and liabilities and gives current recognition to changes in
tax rates and laws and when it is considered more likely than not that deferred tax assets will be realized. It is the Company s
policy to recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of tax expense. 

NOTE 4    ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE GAIN
(LOSS)  

The following tables present the components of comprehensive gain
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The Company s  other comprehensive  gain was
solely related to securities for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

The following table presents the changes in
each component of accumulated other comprehensive gain (loss), net of tax, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015. 

NOTE 5    EARNINGS PER SHARE
( EPS )  

Basic earnings per common share represent income
available to common shareholders, divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted
earnings per share reflect additional common shares that would have been outstanding if dilutive potential common shares had been
issued. Potential common shares that may be issued by the Company relate to outstanding stock options and are determined using
the treasury stock method. At September 30, 2016 and 2015, there were 20,911 and 87,436 options, respectively, which were excluded
from the calculation as their effect would be anti-dilutive, because the exercise price of the options were greater than the average
market price of the common shares. The Company has not granted any stock options since 2007 and all options outstanding at September
30, 2016 were anti-dilutive. Unvested restricted stock is excluded from the calculation of basic earnings per share. At September
30, 2016 and 2015 there were 47,881 and 37,048 unvested shares of restricted stock. 

Basic and diluted earnings per share have been
computed based on weighted-average common and common equivalent shares outstanding as follows: 

NOTE 6    STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION  

The Company has stock-based incentive arrangements
to attract and retain key personnel. In May 2015, the 2015 Equity Compensation Plan (the  Plan ) was approved by shareholders,
which authorizes the issuance of restricted stock, stock appreciation rights, stock units and stock options to the Board of Directors
and key employees. Compensation expense for service-based awards is recognized over the vesting period. Performance-based awards
are recognized based on a vesting schedule and the probability of achieving goals specified at the time of the grant. The 2015
Plan replaced the 2005 Equity Compensation Plan. 

Stock-based compensation expense totaled $80,000
and $240,000 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and $61,000 and $182,000 for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2015. Stock-based compensation expense consisted of the vesting of grants of restricted stock. 

All outstanding options are fully vested and
the Company has not granted any stock options since 2007. All outstanding options as of September 30, 2016 expire on July 17, 2017.
The fair value of the Company s outstanding employee stock options is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes
option pricing model. The Company estimates expected market price volatility and expected term of the options based on historical
data and other factors. 

The exercise price for options granted is set
at the discretion of the committee administering the Plan, but is not less than the market value of the shares as of the date of
grant. An option s maximum term is 10 years and the options vest at the discretion of the committee.   

The following tables below summarize outstanding and exercisable
options at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

Options outstanding are all currently exercisable
and are summarized as follows:  

The aggregate intrinsic value of outstanding
stock options and exercisable stock options was $0 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively because all options
outstanding were anti-dilutive. 

The Company granted restricted stock and stock
units in accordance with the Plan. The vesting period for outstanding granted restricted stock is between three and five years.
As of September 30, 2016, unrecognized stock compensation expense was $1.1 million. The following tables summarize the unvested
restricted stock awards outstanding at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 

NOTE 7   GUARANTEED PREFERRED BENEFICIAL INTEREST IN
JUNIOR SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES ( TRUPs )  

On June 15, 2005, Tri-County Capital Trust
II ( Capital Trust II ), a Delaware business trust formed, funded and wholly owned by the Company, issued $5.0 million
of variable-rate capital securities in a private pooled transaction. The variable rate is based on the 90-day LIBOR rate plus 1.70%.
The Trust used the proceeds from this issuance, along with the $155,000 for Capital Trust II s common securities, to purchase
$5.2 million of the Company s junior subordinated debentures. The interest rate on the debentures and the trust preferred
securities is variable and adjusts quarterly. These capital securities qualify as Tier I capital and are presented in the Consolidated
Balance Sheets as  Guaranteed Preferred Beneficial Interests in Junior Subordinated Debentures.  Both the capital securities
of Capital Trust II and the junior subordinated debentures are scheduled to mature on June 15, 2035, unless called by the Company. 

On July 22, 2004, Tri-County Capital Trust
I ( Capital Trust I ), a Delaware business trust formed, funded and wholly owned by the Company, issued $7.0 million
of variable-rate capital securities in a private pooled transaction. The variable rate is based on the 90-day LIBOR rate plus 2.60%.
The Trust used the proceeds from this issuance, along with the Company s $217,000 capital contribution for Capital Trust
I s common securities, to purchase $7.2 million of the Company s junior subordinated debentures. The interest rate
on the debentures and the trust preferred securities is variable and adjusts quarterly. These debentures qualify as Tier I capital
and are presented in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as  Guaranteed Preferred Beneficial Interests in Junior Subordinated
Debentures.  Both the capital securities of Capital Trust I and the junior subordinated debentures are scheduled to mature
on July 22, 2034, unless called by the Company. 

NOTE 8    SUBORDINATED NOTES  

On February 6, 2015 the Company issued $23.0
million of unsecured 6.25% fixed to floating rate subordinated notes due February 15, 2025 ( subordinated notes ).
On February 13, 2015, the Company used proceeds of the offering to redeem all $20 million of the Company s outstanding preferred
stock issued under the Small Business Lending Fund ( SBLF ) program. The subordinated notes qualify as Tier 2 regulatory
capital and replaced SBLF Tier 1 capital. The subordinated notes are not listed on any securities exchange or included in any automated
dealer quotation system and there is no market for the notes. The notes are unsecured obligations and are subordinated in right
of payment to all existing and future senior debt, whether secured or unsecured. The notes are not guaranteed obligations of any
of the Company s subsidiaries. 

Interest will accrue at a fixed per annum
rate of 6.25% from and including the issue date to but excluding February 15, 2020. From and including February 15, 2020 to but
excluding the maturity date interest will accrue at a floating rate equal to the three-month LIBOR plus 479 basis points.
Interest is payable on the notes on February 15 and August 15 of each year, commencing August 15, 2015, through February 15, 2020,
and thereafter February 15, May 15, August 15 and November 15 of each year through the maturity date or earlier redemption date. 

The subordinated notes may be redeemed in whole
or in part on February 15, 2020 or on any scheduled interest payment date thereafter and upon the occurrence of certain special
events. The redemption price is equal to 100% of the principal amount of the subordinated notes to be redeemed plus accrued and
unpaid interest to the date of redemption. Any partial redemption will be made pro rata among all holders of the subordinated notes.
The subordinated notes are not subject to repayment at the option of the holders. The subordinated notes may be redeemed at any
time, if (1) a change or prospective change in law occurs that could prevent the Company from deducting interest payable on the
notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (2) a subsequent event occurs that precludes the notes from being recognized as Tier
2 Capital for regulatory capital purposes, or (3) the Company is required to register as an investment company under the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended. 

NOTE 9   OTHER REAL ESTATE OWNED
( OREO )  

OREO assets are presented net of valuation
allowances. The Company considers OREO as classified assets for regulatory and financial reporting. An analysis of OREO activity
follows. 

During the nine months ended September 30,
2016, additions of $3.1 million consisted of $977,000 for three residential properties and $2.1 million for a deed in lieu of foreclosure
on an improved commercial office building with multiple tenants. The commercial office building was taken into OREO at fair value
of the loan during the three months ended March 31, 2016 and had a ratified contract for its sale. That contract was voided during
the second quarter of 2016. The Company plans to manage the property until its sale and will recognize miscellaneous rental income
during the ownership and management of the property. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, additions of $1.9 million
consisted of $784,000 for five residential properties, $372,000 for three residential lots and $790,000 for commercial buildings. 

The Company recognized net losses on OREO disposals
of $440,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Disposals for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 consisted of properties
with the following carrying values; $106,000 for three residential lots, $166,000 for one residential property, $875,000 for three
commercial properties, $138,000 for a commercial lot and $2.2 million for an apartment and condominium property. The Bank provided
financing for the apartment and condominium purchase which was transferred from OREO to loans during the second quarter of 2015.
The transaction qualified for full accrual sales treatment under ASC Topic 360-20-40  Property Plant and Equipment  
Derecognition . The Company disposed of three residential properties and three finished residential lots at a loss of $20,000
for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

Additions to the valuation allowances of $366,000
and $447,000 were taken to adjust properties to current appraised values for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively. OREO carrying amounts reflect management s estimate of the realizable value of these properties incorporating
current appraised values, local real estate market conditions and related costs. Expenses applicable to OREO assets include the
following. 

NOTE 10   SECURITIES  

At September 30, 2016, certain asset-backed
securities with an amortized cost of $34.1 million were pledged to secure certain customer deposits. At September 30, 2016, asset-backed
securities with an amortized cost of $1.7 million were pledged as collateral for advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank ( FHLB )
of Atlanta. 

At September 30, 2016, 99% of the asset-backed
securities and agency bond portfolio was rated AAA by Standard   Poor s or the equivalent credit rating from another
major rating agency. AFS asset-backed securities issued by GSEs and U.S. Agencies had an average life of 4.14 years and average
duration of 3.84 years and are guaranteed by their issuer as to credit risk. HTM asset-backed securities issued by GSEs and U.S.
Agencies had an average life of 4.17 years and average duration of 3.84 years and are guaranteed by their issuer as to credit risk. 

At December 31, 2015, certain asset-backed
securities with an amortized cost of $21.4 million were pledged to secure certain deposits. At December 31, 2015, asset-backed
securities with an amortized cost of $1.9 million were pledged as collateral for advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank ( FHLB )
of Atlanta. 

At December 31, 2015, 99% of the asset-backed
securities and agency bond portfolio was rated AAA by Standard   Poor s or the equivalent credit rating from another
major rating agency. AFS asset-backed securities issued by GSEs and U.S. Agencies had an average life of 4.39 years and average
duration of 4.04 years and are guaranteed by their issuer as to credit risk. HTM asset-backed securities issued by GSEs and U.S.
Agencies and U.S. Agencies had an average life of 5.07 years and average duration of 4.58 years and are guaranteed by their issuer
as to credit risk. 

Management believes that AFS securities with
unrealized losses will either recover in market value or be paid off as agreed. The Company intends to, and has the ability to,
hold these securities to maturity. Management believes that the losses are the result of general perceptions of safety and creditworthiness
of the entire sector and a general disruption of orderly markets in the asset class. 

Management has the ability and intent to hold
the HTM securities with unrealized losses until they mature, at which time the Company will receive full value for the securities.
Because management s intention is not to sell the investments and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be
required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost basis, which may be maturity, management considers the
unrealized losses in the held-to-maturity portfolio to be temporary. 

No charges related to other-than-temporary
impairment were made during for the six months ended September 30, 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2015. 

During the nine months ended September 30,
2016 the Company recognized net gains on the sale of securities of $39,000. The Company sold three AFS securities with aggregate
carrying values of $2.4 million and one HTM security with a carrying value of $698,000, recognizing gains of $31,000 and $8,000,
respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company sold one HTM security with a carrying value of $68,000
and recognized a loss of $1,000. 

The sale of HTM securities was permitted under
ASC 320  Investments - Debt and Equity Securities.  ASC 320 permits the sale of HTM securities for certain changes
in circumstances. The Company will dispose of HTM securities using the safe harbor rule that allows for the sale of HTM securities
that have principal payments paid down to less than 15% of original purchased par. ASC 320 10-25-15 indicates that a sale of a
debt security after a substantial portion of the principal has been collected is equivalent to holding the security to maturity.
In addition, the Company may dispose of HTM securities under ASC 320-10-25-6 due to a significant deterioration in the issues 
creditworthiness. 

AFS Securities   

Gross unrealized losses and estimated fair
value by length of time that the individual AFS securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position at September 30,
2016 were as follows: 

At September 30, 2016, the AFS investment portfolio

asset-backed securities issued by GSEs and U.S. Agencies with unrealized losses had an average life of 4.19 years and an average
duration of 3.87 years. Management believes that the securities will either recover in market value or be paid off as agreed.

were as follows:

were asset-backed securities issued by others. 

HTM asset-backed securities issued by GSEs
are guaranteed by the issuer and HTM U.S. government agency securities and bonds are guaranteed by the full faith and credit of
the U.S. government. Total unrealized losses on the portfolio were $67,000 of the portfolio amortized cost of $102.0 million. The
securities with unrealized losses had an average life of 3.67 years and an average duration of 3.49 years. Management believes
that the securities will either recover in market value or be paid off as agreed. The Company intends to, and has the ability to,
hold these securities to maturity. 

HTM asset-backed securities issued by others
are collateralized mortgage obligation securities. The securities have credit support tranches that absorb losses prior to the
tranches that the Company owns. The Company reviews credit support positions on its securities regularly. Total unrealized losses
on the asset-backed securities issued by others were $85,000 of the portfolio amortized cost of $931,000. HTM asset-backed securities

are guaranteed by the issuer and HTM U.S. government agency securities and bonds are guaranteed by the full faith and credit of
the U.S. government. Total unrealized losses on the asset-backed securities issued by GSEs were $841,000 of the portfolio amortized
cost of $107.6 million. HTM asset-backed securities issued by GSEs and U.S. Agencies with unrealized losses had an average life
of 5.42 years and an average duration of 4.78 years. Management believes that the securities will either recover in market value
or be paid off as agreed. The Company intends to, and has the ability to, hold these securities to maturity. 

HTM asset-backed securities issued by others
are collateralized mortgage obligation securities. The securities have credit support tranches that absorb losses prior to the
tranches that the Company owns. The Company reviews credit support positions on its securities regularly. Total unrealized losses
on the asset-backed securities issued by others were $100,000 of the portfolio amortized cost of $1.1 million. HTM asset-backed
securities issued by others with unrealized losses have an average life of 4.04 years and an average duration of 3.29 years. 

Credit Quality of Asset-Backed Securities
and Agency Bonds   

The tables below present the Standard  
Poor s ( S P ) or equivalent credit rating from other major rating agencies for AFS and HTM asset-backed
securities issued by GSEs and U.S. Agencies and others or bonds issued by GSEs or U.S. government agencies at September 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015 by carrying value. The Company considers noninvestment grade securities rated BB+ or lower as classified
assets for regulatory and financial reporting. GSE asset-backed securities and GSE agency bonds with S P AA+ ratings were treated
as AAA based on regulatory guidance. 

NOTE 11   LOANS  

Loans consist of the following: 

At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015,
the Bank s allowance for loan losses totaled $9.7 million and $8.5 million, respectively or 0.92% and 0.93%, respectively,
of loan balances. Management s determination of the adequacy of the allowance is based on a periodic evaluation of the portfolio
with consideration given to the overall loss experience, current economic conditions, size, growth and composition of the loan
portfolio, financial condition of the borrowers and other relevant factors that, in management s judgment, warrant recognition
in providing an adequate allowance. 

Deferred loan fees and premiums include net
deferred fees paid by customers of $2.6 million and $2.6 million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. These
were offset by net deferred premiums paid for the purchase of residential first mortgages and deferred costs of $2.8 million and
$1.4 million, respectively, at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

The Company separated residential rentals into
a new loan portfolio segment beginning in the second quarter of 2016. Residential rentals include income producing properties secured
by 1-4 family units and apartment buildings. The Company s decision to segregate the residential rental portfolio for financial
reporting and valuation purposes was based on the growth and size of the portfolio and risk characteristics unique to residential
rental properties. 

Risk Characteristics of Portfolio Segments   

The Company manages its credit products and
exposure to credit losses (credit risk) by the following specific portfolio segments (classes), which are levels at which the Company
develops and documents its allowance for loan loss methodology. These segments are: 

Commercial Real Estate ( CRE )  

Commercial and other real estate projects include
office buildings, retail locations, churches, other special purpose buildings and commercial construction. Commercial construction
balances were 8.6% and 6.1% of the CRE portfolio at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The Bank offers both
fixed-rate and adjustable-rate loans under these product lines. The primary security on a commercial real estate loan is the real
property and the leases that produce income for the real property. Loans secured by commercial real estate are generally limited
to 80% of the lower of the appraised value or sales price at origination and have an initial contractual loan payment period ranging
from three to 20 years. 

Loans secured by commercial real estate are larger and involve greater
risks than one-to four-family residential mortgage loans. Because payments on loans secured by such properties are often dependent
on the successful operation or management of the properties, repayment of such loans may be subject to a greater extent to adverse
conditions in the real estate market or the economy. 

Residential First Mortgages  

Residential first mortgage loans are generally
long-term loans, amortized on a monthly basis, with principal and interest due each month. The contractual loan payment period
for residential loans typically ranges from ten to 30 years. The Bank s experience indicates that real estate loans remain
outstanding for significantly shorter time periods than their contractual terms. Borrowers may refinance or prepay loans at their
option, without penalty. The Bank s residential portfolio has both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate residential first mortgages. 

The annual and lifetime limitations on interest
rate adjustments may limit the increases in interest rates on these loans. There are also credit risks resulting from potential
increased costs to the borrower as a result of repricing of adjustable-rate mortgage loans. During periods of rising interest rates,
the risk of default on adjustable-rate mortgage loans may increase due to the upward adjustment of interest cost to the borrower.
The Bank s adjustable rate residential first mortgage portfolio was $41.4 million or 3.9% of total gross loans of $1.1 billion
at September 30, 2016 compared to $18.9 million or 2.1% of gross loans of $918.9 million at December 31, 2015. 

Residential Rentals  

Residential rental mortgage loans are amortizing,
with principal and interest due each month. The loans are secured by income-producing 1-4 family units and apartments. As of September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, $83.3 million and $80.8 million, respectively, were 1-4 family units and $16.0 million and $12.4
million, respectively, were apartment buildings. Loans secured by residential rental properties are generally limited to 80% of
the lower of the appraised value or sales price at origination and have an initial contractual loan payment period ranging from
three to 20 years. The primary security on a residential rental loan is the property and the leases that produce income. 

Loans secured by residential rental properties
involve greater risks than 1-4 family residential mortgage loans. Although, there are similar risk characteristics shared with
commercial real estate loans, the balances for the loans secured by residential rental properties are generally smaller. Because
payments on loans secured residential rental properties are often dependent on the successful operation or management of the properties,
repayment of these loans may be subject to a greater extent to adverse conditions in the rental real estate market or the economy
than similar owner occupied properties. 

Construction and Land Development  

The Bank offers loans for the construction
of one-to-four family dwellings. Generally, these loans are secured by the real estate under construction as well as by guarantees
of the principals involved. In addition, the Bank offers loans to acquire and develop land, as well as loans on undeveloped, subdivided
lots for home building. 

A decline in demand for new housing might adversely
affect the ability of borrowers to repay these loans. Construction and land development loans are inherently riskier than providing
financing on owner-occupied real estate. The Bank s risk of loss is affected by the accuracy of the initial estimate of the
market value of the completed project as well as the accuracy of the cost estimates made to complete the project. In addition,
the volatility of the real estate market has made it increasingly difficult to ensure that the valuation of land associated with
these loans is accurate. During the construction phase, a number of factors could result in delays and cost overruns. If the estimate
of construction costs proves to be inaccurate, the Bank may be required to advance funds beyond the amount originally committed
to permit completion of the development. If the estimate of value proves to be inaccurate, a project s value might be insufficient
to assure full repayment. As a result of these factors, construction lending often involves the disbursement of substantial funds
with repayment dependent, in part, on the success of the project rather than the ability of the borrower or guarantor to repay
principal and interest. If the Bank forecloses on a project, there can be no assurance that the Bank will be able to recover all
of the unpaid balance of, and accrued interest on, the loan as well as related foreclosure and holding costs. 

Home Equity and Second Mortgage Loans  

The Bank maintains a portfolio of home equity
and second mortgage loans. These products contain a higher risk of default than residential first mortgages as in the event of
foreclosure, the first mortgage would need to be paid off prior to collection of the second mortgage. This risk has been heightened
as the market value of residential property has declined. 

Commercial Loans  

The Bank offers commercial loans to its business
customers. The Bank offers a variety of commercial loan products including term loans and lines of credit. Such loans are generally
made for terms of five years or less. The Bank offers both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate loans under these product lines. When
making commercial business loans, the Bank considers the financial condition of the borrower, the borrower s payment history
of both corporate and personal debt, the projected cash flows of the business, the viability of the industry in which the consumer
operates, the value of the collateral, and the borrower s ability to service the debt from income. These loans are primarily
secured by equipment, real property, accounts receivable, or other security as determined by the Bank. 

Commercial loans are made on the basis of the
borrower s ability to make repayment from the cash flows of the borrower s business. As a result, the availability
of funds for the repayment of commercial loans may depend substantially on the success of the business itself. 

Consumer Loans  

Consumer loans consist of loans secured by
automobiles, boats, recreational vehicles and trucks. The Bank also makes home improvement loans and offers both secured and unsecured
personal lines of credit. Consumer loans entail greater risk from other loan types due to being secured by rapidly depreciating
assets or the reliance on the borrower s continuing financial stability. 

Commercial Equipment Loans  

These loans consist primarily of fixed-rate,
short-term loans collateralized by a commercial customer s equipment. When making commercial equipment loans, the Bank considers
the same factors it considers when underwriting a commercial business loan. Commercial loans are of higher risk and typically are
made on the basis of the borrower s ability to make repayment from the cash flows of the borrower s business. As a
result, the availability of funds for the repayment of commercial loans may depend substantially on the success of the business
itself. In the case of business failure, collateral would need to be liquidated to provide repayment for the loan. In many cases,
the highly specialized nature of collateral equipment would make full recovery from the sale of collateral problematic. 

Non-accrual and Past Due Loans   

Non-accrual loans as of September 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015 were as follows:  

Non-accrual loans (90 days or greater delinquent
and non-accrual only loans) decreased $3.0 million from $11.4 million or 1.24% of total loans at December 31, 2015 to $8.5 million
or 0.80% of total loans at September 30, 2016. Non-accrual only loans are loans classified as non-accrual due to customer operating
results or payment history. In accordance with the Company s policy, interest income is recognized on a cash basis for these
loans. 

The Company had 28 non-accrual loans at September
30, 2016 compared to 38 non-accrual loans at December 31, 2015. Non-accrual loans at September 30, 2016 included $7.0 million,
or 83% of non-accrual loans, attributed to 16 loans representing six customer relationships classified as substandard. Non-accrual
loans at December 31, 2015 included $8.1 million, or 71% of non-accrual loans, attributed to 19 loans representing six customer
relationships classified as substandard. Of these loans at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, $3.6 million and $3.8 million,
respectively, represented a residential development project. During the second quarter of 2014, the Company deferred the collection
of principal and interest on this project. The project is currently being continued with the support of non-bank investment, which
has been used for vertical construction that has significantly improved the collateral value and the viability of the project.
The loans remain classified as troubled debt restructures ( TDRs ) and non-accrual. In addition, at September 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015, the Company had three TDR loans totaling $1.6 million and $1.7 million, respectively, classified as non-accrual.
These loans are classified solely as non-accrual loans for the calculation of financial ratios. 

Non-accrual loans on which the recognition
of interest has been discontinued, which did not have a specific allowance for impairment, amounted to $4.5 million and $10.5 million
at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Interest due but not recognized on these balances September 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015 was $318,000 and $953,000, respectively. Non-accrual loans with a specific allowance for impairment on which
the recognition of interest has been discontinued amounted to $4.0 million and $902,000 at September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015, respectively. Interest due but not recognized on these balances at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was $683,000
and $34,000, respectively. 

Past due loans as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were
as follows: 

Impaired Loans and Troubled Debt Restructures
( TDRs )   

 Impaired loans, including TDRs, at September
30, 2016 and 2015 and at December 31, 2015 were as follows: 

TDRs, included in the impaired loan schedules above, as of September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were as follows: 

At
September 30, 2016, the Company had 17 accruing TDRs totaling $10.6 million compared to 23 accruing TDRs totaling $13.1 million
as of December 31, 2015. The Company had specific reserves of $929,000 on seven TDRs totaling $6.2 million at September 30, 2016
and specific reserves of $1.3 million on nine TDRs totaling $3.6 million at December 31, 2015.   At
September 30, 2016, $8.0 million or 76% of accruing TDRs related to one customer relationship. The $8.0 million in TDRs is for
eight loans with two construction and land development loans totaling $724,000, one residential rental property of $228,000, and
five commercial real estate loans totaling $7.1 million. The loans in this relationship have been classified as TDRs since the
fourth quarter of 2014 and have performed according to the terms of their restructured agreements with all required payments made
timely. They presently remain classified as TDRs due to below market rates of interest negotiated at the time the loans were restructured
to obtain additional collateral. The Company has a strong collateral position in this relationship and as of September 30, 2016
has specific reserves of $426,000 on the relationship.   

At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015,
non-accrual TDRs included $3.6 million and $3.8 million, respectively, related to a residential development project. During the
second quarter of 2014, the Company deferred the collection of principal and interest on this project. The project is currently
being continued with the support of non-bank investment, which has been used for vertical construction that has significantly improved
the collateral value and the viability of the project. In addition, at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had
three TDR loans totaling $1.6 million and $1.7 million, respectively, classified as non-accrual. These loans are classified solely
as non-accrual loans for the calculation of financial ratios. There was one TDR of $196,000 added during the nine months ended
September 30, 2016. 

Interest income in the amount of $252,000 and
$508,000 was recognized on TDR loans for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2015, respectively. 

Allowance for Loan Losses   

 The following tables detail activity in the
allowance for loan losses at and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. An allocation of
the allowance to one category of loans does not prevent the Company from using that allowance to absorb losses in a different category. 

The following tables detail loan receivable
and allowance balances disaggregated on the basis of the Company s impairment methodology at September 30, 2016 and 2015
and December 31, 2015. 

Credit Quality Indicators   

 Credit quality indicators as of September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015 were as follows: 

Credit
Risk Profile by Internally Assigned Grade    

Credit Risk Profile Based on Payment Activity   

Summary
of Total Classified Loans    

Management uses a risk scale to assign grades to commercial real estate, residential rentals, construction
and land development, commercial loans and commercial equipment loans. Commercial loan relationships with an aggregate exposure
to the Bank of $750,000 or greater are risk rated. Residential first mortgages, home equity and second mortgages and consumer
loans are monitored on an ongoing basis based on borrower payment history. Consumer loans and residential real estate loans are
classified as unrated unless they are part of a larger commercial relationship that requires grading or are troubled debt restructures
or nonperforming loans with an Other Assets Especially Mentioned or higher risk rating due to a delinquent payment history 

Home equity and second mortgages and consumer
loans are evaluated for creditworthiness in underwriting and are monitored based on borrower payment history. Residential first
mortgages are evaluated for creditworthiness during credit due diligence before being purchased. Residential first mortgages, home
equity and second mortgages and consumer loans are classified as unrated unless they are part of a larger commercial relationship
that requires grading or are troubled debt restructures or nonperforming loans with an Other Assets Especially Mentioned ( OAEM )
or higher risk rating due to a delinquent payment history. 

Management regularly reviews credit quality
indicators as part of its individual loan reviews and on a monthly and quarterly basis. The overall quality of the Bank s
loan portfolio is assessed using the Bank s risk grading scale, the level and trends of net charge-offs, nonperforming loans
and delinquencies, the performance of troubled debt restructured loans and the general economic conditions in the Company s
geographical market. This review process is assisted by frequent internal reporting of loan production, loan quality, concentrations
of credit, loan delinquencies and nonperforming and potential problem loans. Credit quality indicators and allowance factors are
adjusted based on management s judgment during the monthly and quarterly review process. Loans subject to risk ratings are
graded on a scale of one to ten. The Company considers loans classified substandard, doubtful and loss as classified assets for
regulatory and financial reporting. 

Ratings 1 thru 6 - Pass  

 Ratings 1 thru 6 have asset risks ranging from
excellent low risk to adequate. The specific rating assigned considers customer history of earnings, cash flows, liquidity, leverage,
capitalization, consistency of debt service coverage, the nature and extent of customer relationship and other relevant specific
business factors such as the stability of the industry or market area, changes to management, litigation or unexpected events that
could have an impact on risks. 

Rating 7 - OAEM (Other Assets Especially
Mentioned)     Special Mention  

 These credits, while protected by the financial
strength of the borrowers, guarantors or collateral, have reduced quality due to economic conditions, less than adequate earnings
performance or other factors which require the lending officer to direct more than normal attention to the credit. Financing alternatives
may be limited and/or command higher risk interest rates. OAEM loans are the first adversely classified assets on the Bank s
watch list. These relationships will be reviewed at least quarterly. 

Rating 8 - Substandard  

 Substandard assets are assets that are inadequately
protected by the sound worth or paying capacity of the borrower or of the collateral pledged. These assets have a well-defined
weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the possibility that the Bank will
sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Loss potential, while existing in the aggregate amount of substandard
assets, does not have to exist in individual assets classified substandard. The loans may have a delinquent history or combination
of weak collateral, weak guarantor strength or operating losses. When a loan is assigned to this category the Bank may estimate
a specific reserve in the loan loss allowance analysis. These assets listed may include assets with histories of repossessions
or some that are non-performing bankruptcies. These relationships will be reviewed at least quarterly. 

Rating 9 - Doubtful  

 Doubtful assets have many of the same characteristics
of Substandard with the exception that the Bank has determined that loss is not only possible but is probable and the risk is close
to certain that loss will occur. When a loan is assigned to this category the Bank will identify the probable loss and the loan
will receive a specific reserve in the loan loss allowance analysis. These relationships will be reviewed at least quarterly. 

Rating 10   Loss  

 Once an asset is identified as a definite loss
to the Bank, it will receive the classification of  loss . There may be some future potential recovery; however it
is more practical to write off the loan at the time of classification. Losses will be taken in the period in which they are determined
to be uncollectable. 

NOTE 12   REGULATORY  

As of December 31, 2015, the Bank was a
member of the Federal Reserve System and its primary federal regulator was the Federal Reserve Board. On April 18, 2016,
Community Bank of the Chesapeake, cancelled its stock in the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond. This terminated its status as
a member of the Federal Reserve System. As of that date, the Bank s primary regulator became the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) and is subject to regulation, supervision and regular examination by the Maryland
Commissioner of Financial Regulation (the  Commissioner ) and the FDIC. 

The Company will continue to be subject to
regulation, examination and supervision by the Federal Reserve Board under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the
 BHCA ), and the regulations of the Federal Reserve Board. 

On January 1, 2015, the Company and Bank became
subject to the new Basel III Capital Rules with full compliance with all of the final rule's requirements phased in over a multi-year
schedule, to be fully phased-in by January 1, 2019. In July 2013, the final rules were published (the  Basel III Capital
Rules ) establishing a new comprehensive capital framework for U.S. banking organizations. The rules implement the Basel
Committee s December 2010 framework known as  Basel III  for strengthening international capital standards as
well as certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Basel III Capital Rules substantially revise the risk-based capital requirements
applicable to bank holding companies and depository institutions compared to the previous U.S. risk-based capital rules. The Basel
III Capital Rules define the components of capital and address other issues affecting the numerator in banking institutions 
regulatory capital ratios. The Basel III Capital Rules also address risk weights and other issues affecting the denominator in
banking institutions  regulatory capital ratios and replace the existing risk-weighting approach with a more risk-sensitive
approach. The Basel III Capital Rules also implement the requirements of Section 939A of the Dodd-Frank Act to remove references
to credit ratings from the federal banking agencies  rules. 

The rules include a new common equity Tier
1 capital to risk-weighted assets minimum ratio of 4.5%, raise the minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets from
4.0% to 6.0%, require a minimum ratio ( Min. Ratio ) of Total Capital to risk-weighted assets of 8.0%, and require
a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4.0%. A new capital conservation buffer ( CCB ) is also established above the regulatory
minimum capital requirements. This capital conservation buffer will be phased-in beginning January 1, 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted
assets and increase each subsequent year by an additional 0.625% until reaching its final level of 2.5% on January 1, 2019. Strict
eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments were also implemented under the final rules. The final rules also revise
the definition and calculation of Tier 1 capital, Total Capital, and risk-weighted assets. 

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015,
the Company and Bank were well-capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action under the new Basel III
Capital Rules. Management believes, as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, that the Company and the Bank met all capital
adequacy requirements to which they were subject. 

The Company s and the Bank s actual
regulatory capital amounts and ratios are presented in the following table. 

(1)     These are the fully phased-in ratios
as of January 1, 2019 that include the minimum capital ratio ( Min. Ratio ) + the capital conservation buffer ( CCB ).
The phase-in period is more fully described in the footnote above. 

(2)     The Common Tier 1 ratio became
effective for regulatory reporting purposes when the Company and the Bank became subject to the new Basel III Capital Rules during
the three months ended March 31, 2015. 

NOTE 13   FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS  

The Company adopted FASB ASC Topic 820,   Fair
Value Measurements   and FASB ASC Topic 825,   The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  ,
which provides a framework for measuring and disclosing fair value under generally accepted accounting principles. FASB ASC Topic
820 requires disclosures about the fair value of assets and liabilities recognized in the balance sheet in periods subsequent to
initial recognition, whether the measurements are made on a recurring basis (for example, available for sale investment securities)
or on a nonrecurring basis (for example, impaired loans). 

FASB ASC Topic 820 defines fair value as the
exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous
market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. FASB ASC Topic
820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the
use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. 

The Company utilizes fair value measurements
to record fair value adjustments to certain assets and to determine fair value disclosures. Securities available for sale are recorded
at fair value on a recurring basis. Additionally, from time to time, the Company may be required to record at fair value other
assets on a nonrecurring basis such as loans held for investment and certain other assets. These nonrecurring fair value adjustments
typically involve application of lower of cost or market accounting or write-downs of individual assets. 

Under FASB ASC Topic 820, the Company groups
assets and liabilities at fair value in three levels, based on the markets in which the assets and liabilities are traded and the
reliability of the assumptions used to determine the fair value. These hierarchy levels are: 

Level 1 inputs - Unadjusted quoted prices in
active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity has the ability to access at the measurement date. 

Level 2 inputs - Inputs other than quoted prices
included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. These might include quoted prices
for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or
liability, such as interest rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals. 

Level 3 inputs - Unobservable inputs for determining
the fair values of assets or liabilities that reflect an entity s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants
would use in pricing the assets or liabilities. 

Transfers between levels of the fair value
hierarchy are recognized on the actual date of the event or circumstances that caused the transfer, which generally coincides with
the Company s monthly or quarterly valuation process. 

There were no transfers between levels of the
fair value hierarchy and the Company had no Level 3 fair value assets or liabilities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016
and the year ended December 31, 2015, respectively. 

Following is a description of valuation methodologies
used for assets and liabilities recorded at fair value: 

Securities Available for Sale   

 Investment securities available for sale are
recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Fair value measurement is based upon quoted prices, if available. If quoted prices
are not available, fair values are measured using independent pricing models or other model-based valuation techniques such as
the present value of future cash flows, adjusted for the security s credit rating, prepayment assumptions and other factors
such as credit loss assumptions. Level 1 securities include those traded on an active exchange, such as the New York Stock Exchange,
Treasury securities that are traded by dealers or brokers in active over-the-counter markets and money market funds. Level 2 securities
include mortgage-backed securities issued by GSEs, municipal bonds and corporate debt securities. Securities classified as Level
3 include asset-backed securities in less liquid markets. 

Loans Receivable   

 The Company does not record loans at fair value
on a recurring basis, however, from time to time, a loan is considered impaired and an allowance for loan loss is established.
Loans for which it is probable that payment of interest and principal will not be made in accordance with the contractual terms
of the loan are considered impaired. Management estimates the fair value of impaired loans using one of several methods, including
the collateral value, market value of similar debt, enterprise value, liquidation value and discounted cash flows. Impaired loans
not requiring a specific allowance represent loans for which the fair value of expected repayments or collateral exceed the recorded
investment in such loans. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, substantially all of the impaired loans were evaluated based
upon the fair value of the collateral. In accordance with FASB ASC 820, impaired loans where an allowance is established based
on the fair value of collateral (loans with impairment) require classification in the fair value hierarchy. When the fair value
of the collateral is based on an observable market price or a current appraised value, the Company records the loan as nonrecurring
Level 2. When an appraised value is not available or management determines the fair value of the collateral is further impaired
below the appraised value and there is no observable market price, the Company records the loan as nonrecurring Level 3. 

Premises and Equipment Held For Sale   

 Premises and equipment are adjusted to fair
value upon transfer of the assets to held for sale. Subsequently, premises and equipment held for sale are carried at the lower
of carrying value or fair value. Fair value is based upon independent market prices, appraised value of the collateral or management s
estimation of the value of the collateral. When the fair value of the collateral is based on an observable market price (e.g.,
contracted sales price) or a current appraised value, the Company records the assets as nonrecurring Level 2. When an appraised
value is not available or management determines the fair value of the collateral is further impaired below the appraised value
and there is no observable market price, the Company records the asset at nonrecurring Level 3. 

Other Real Estate Owned    

 OREO is adjusted to fair value upon transfer
of the loans to foreclosed assets. Subsequently, OREO is carried at the lower of carrying value and fair value. Fair value is based
upon independent market prices, appraised value of the collateral or management s estimation of the value of the collateral.
When the fair value of the collateral is based on an observable market price or a current appraised value, the Company records
the foreclosed asset as nonrecurring Level 2. When an appraised value is not available or management determines the fair value
of the collateral is further impaired below the appraised value and there is no observable market price, the Company records the
foreclosed asset at nonrecurring Level 3. 

Assets and Liabilities Recorded at Fair
Value on a Recurring Basis   

 The tables below present the recorded amount
of assets as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 measured at fair value on a recurring basis. 

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair
Value on a Nonrecurring Basis   

 The Company may be required to measure certain
assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These include assets that are measured at the lower
of cost or market that were recognized at fair value below cost at the end of the period. Assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring
basis as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were included in the tables below. 

Loans with impairment had unpaid principal
balances of $7.3 million and $4.0 million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, and include impaired loans
with a specific allowance. 

NOTE
14   FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS   

The estimated fair value amounts have been
determined by the Company using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies. However, considerable judgment
is required to interpret market data to develop the estimates of fair value. Accordingly, the estimates presented herein are not
necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company could realize in a current market exchange. The use of different market assumptions
and/or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts. Therefore, any aggregate unrealized
gains or losses should not be interpreted as a forecast of future earnings or cash flows. Furthermore, the fair values disclosed
should not be interpreted as the aggregate current value of the Company. 

Valuation Methodology  

  Investment securities  - Fair values
are based on quoted market prices or dealer quotes. If a quoted market price is not available, fair value is estimated using quoted
market prices for similar securities. 

FHLB and FRB stock -  Fair values are
at cost, which is the carrying value of the securities. 

Investment in bank owned life insurance
( BOLI )    Fair values are at cash surrender value. 

Loans receivable  - For conforming residential
first-mortgage loans, the market price for loans with similar coupons and maturities was used. For nonconforming loans with maturities
similar to conforming loans, the coupon was adjusted for credit risk. Loans that did not have quoted market prices were priced
using the discounted cash flow method. The discount rate used was the rate currently offered on similar products. Loans priced
using the discounted cash flow method included residential construction loans, commercial real estate loans and consumer loans. 

Loans held for sale    Fair values
are derived from secondary market quotations for similar instruments or the estimated fair value of loans held for sale based on
the terms of the related sale commitments. There were no loans held for sale at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

Savings, NOW and money market deposits  -
The fair value of checking accounts, saving accounts and money market accounts were the amount payable on demand at the reporting
date. 

Time deposits  - The fair value was determined
using the discounted cash flow method. The discount rate was equal to the rate currently offered on similar products. 

Long-term debt and short-term borrowings
 - These were valued using the discounted cash flow method. The discount rate was equal to the rate currently offered on similar
borrowings. 

Guaranteed preferred beneficial interest
in junior subordinated securities ( TRUPs ) -  These were valued using discounted cash flows. The discount rate
was equal to the rate currently offered on similar borrowings. 

Subordinated notes -  These were valued
using discounted cash flows. The discount rate was equal to the rate currently offered on similar borrowings. 

Off-balance sheet instruments  - The
Company charges fees for commitments to extend credit. Interest rates on loans for which these commitments are extended are normally
committed for periods of less than one month. Fees charged on standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees are deemed
to be immaterial and these guarantees are expected to be settled at face amount or expire unused. It is impractical to assign any
fair value to these commitments. 

The Company s estimated fair values of
financial instruments are presented in the following tables. 

At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015,
the Company had outstanding loan commitments and standby letters of credit of $85.3 million and $73.5 million, respectively and
 $19.4  million and $21.4 million, respectively. Additionally, customers had $135.4
million and $128.1 million available and unused on lines of credit at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Based
on the short-term lives of these instruments, the Company does not believe that the fair value of these instruments differs significantly
from their carrying values. 

The fair value estimates presented herein are
based on pertinent information available to management as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Although management
is not aware of any factors that would significantly affect the estimated fair value amounts, such amounts have not been comprehensively
revalued for purposes of these financial statements since that date and, therefore, current estimates of fair value may differ
significantly from the amount presented herein. 

NOTE 15   NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS  

 Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB )
Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ). ASU 2014-09 -  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606);  ASU 2016-08
-  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net);
 ASU No. 2016-10 -  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing.
 ASU 2014-09 states that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers
in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.
This update affects entities that enter into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enter into contracts for
the transfer of nonfinancial assets, unless those contracts are within the scope of other standards. ASU 2016-08 was issued
to clarify certain principal versus agent considerations within the implementation guidance of ASC Topic 606. ASU 2016-10
was issued to clarify ASC Topic 606   related to (i) identifying performance obligations; and (ii) the licensing
implementation guidance. The effective date for the ASUs is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal
years, beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted, but not before the original effective date of December 15,
2016. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 

ASU 2015-05 -  Customer s Accounting
for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement . ASU 2015-05 provides guidance to customers about whether a cloud computing
arrangement includes a software license. If a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, the customer should account
for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses. If a cloud computing
arrangement does not include a software license, the customer should account for the arrangement as a service contract. The new
guidance does not change the accounting for a customer s accounting for service contracts. ASU No. 2015-05 is effective for
interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015 and did not have a material impact on the Company s
consolidated financial statements. 

ASU
2015-16 -  Business Combinations (Topic 805)   Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments . ASU 2015-16
requires that an acquirer recognize adjustments to estimated amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting
period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. The amendments require that the acquirer record, in the same period's financial
statements, the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result of the
change to the estimated amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. The amendments also
require an entity to present separately on the face of the income statement or disclose in the notes the portion of the amount
recorded in current-period earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment
to the estimated amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date. The amendments should be applied prospectively to adjustments
to provisional amounts that occur after the effective date with earlier application permitted for financial statements that have
not been issued.   ASU 2015-16 was effective January 1, 2016 and
did not have an impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.   

ASU 2016-01  - Financial Instruments  
Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities . ASU 2016-1, among other
things, (i) requires equity investments, with certain exceptions, to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized
in net income, (ii) simplifies the impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values by requiring
a qualitative assessment to identify impairment, (iii) eliminates the requirement for public business entities to disclose the
methods and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments
measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet, (iv) requires public business entities to use the exit price notion when measuring
the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes, (v) requires an entity to present separately in other comprehensive
income the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit
risk when the entity has elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial
instruments, (vi) requires separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form
of financial asset on the balance sheet or the accompanying notes to the financial statements and (viii) clarifies that an entity
should evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset related to available-for-sale. ASU 2016-1 will be effective
on January 1, 2018 and the Company is evaluating its impact on the consolidated financial statements and will monitor developments
and additional guidance. 

ASU 2016-02 -  Leases (Topic 842 ). ASU
2016-02 requires lessees to recognize a lease liability, which is a lessee s obligation to make lease payments arising from
a lease, measured on a discounted basis; and a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee s right to
use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. ASU 2016-02 does not significantly change lease accounting requirements
applicable to lessors; however, certain changes were made to align, where necessary, lessor accounting with the lessee accounting
model and ASC Topic 606,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers.  ASU 2016-02 will be effective on January 1, 2019
and will require transition using a modified retrospective approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning
of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. The Company is evaluating the potential impact of ASU
2016-02 on the consolidated financial statements. 

ASU 2016-05 -  Derivatives and Hedging (Topic
815) Effect of Derivative Contract Novations on Existing Hedge Accounting Relationships.  ASU 2016-05 clarifies that a
change in the counterparty to a derivative instrument that has been designated as the hedging instrument under ASC Topic 815
does not, in and of itself, require dedesignation of that hedging relationship provided that all other hedge accounting criteria
continue to be met. ASU 2016-05 will be effective on January 1, 2017 and is not expected to have a significant impact
on the consolidated financial statements. 

ASU 2016-09 -  Improvements
to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.  ASU 2016-09 is intended to simplify how share-based payments are accounted for
and presented in the financial statements. The key provisions include: (i) a company will no longer record excess tax benefits
and certain tax deficiencies in additional paid-in capital ( APIC ). Instead all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies
will be reported as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement, and APIC pools will be eliminated. The guidance also
eliminates the requirement that excess tax benefits be realized before companies can recognize them. In addition, the guidance
requires companies to present excess tax benefits as an operating activity on the statement of cash flows rather than as a financing
activity; (ii) a company can increase the amount of withholding to cover income taxes on awards and still qualify for the exception
to liability classification for shares used to satisfy the employer s statutory income tax withholding obligation. The new
guidance will also require an employer to classify the cash paid to a tax authority when shares are withheld to satisfy its statutory
income tax withholding obligation as a financing activity on its statement of cash flows (current guidance did not specify how
these cash flows should be classified); and (iii) a company can elect an accounting policy election for the impact of forfeitures
on the recognition of expense for share-based payment awards. Forfeitures can be estimated, as required today, or recognized when
they occur. ASU No. 2016-09 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption
is permitted, but all of the guidance must be adopted in the same period. The Company is evaluating the potential impact of ASU
2016-09 on the consolidated financial statements. 

ASU 2016-13 -  Measurement of Credit Losses
on Financial Instruments.  ASU No. 2016-13 significantly changes how entities will measure credit losses for most financial
assets and certain other instruments that aren t measured at fair value through net income. The standard will replace today s
 incurred loss  approach with an  expected loss  model. The new model, referred to as the current expected
credit loss ( CECL ) model, will apply to: (1) financial assets subject to credit losses and measured at amortized
cost, and (2) certain off-balance sheet credit exposures. This includes, but is not limited to, loans, leases, held-to-maturity
securities, loan commitments, and financial guarantees. The CECL model does not apply to available-for-sale ( AFS )
debt securities. For AFS debt securities with unrealized losses, entities will measure credit losses in a manner similar to what
they do today, except that the losses will be recognized as allowances rather than reductions in the amortized cost of the securities.
As a result, entities will recognize improvements to estimated credit losses immediately in earnings rather than as interest income
over time, as they do today. The ASU also simplifies the accounting model for purchased credit-impaired debt securities and loans.
ASU 2016-13 also expands the disclosure requirements regarding an entity s assumptions, models, and methods for estimating
the allowance for loan and lease losses. In addition, entities will need to disclose the amortized cost balance for each class
of financial asset by credit quality indicator, disaggregated by the year of origination. ASU No. 2016-13 is effective for interim
and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019; early adoption is permitted for interim and annual reporting periods
beginning after December 15, 2018. Entities will apply the standard s provisions as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained
earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective (i.e., modified retrospective approach).
The Company is currently evaluating the provisions of ASU No. 2016-13 to determine the potential impact the new standard will have
on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. 

ASU 2016-15 -  Classification of Certain
Cash Receipts and Cash Payments . ASU 2016-15 is intended to reduce diversity in practice in how eight particular transactions
are classified in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after
December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted, provided that all of the amendments are adopted in the same period. Entities will
be required to apply the guidance retrospectively. If it is impracticable to apply the guidance retrospectively for an issue, the
amendments related to that issue would be applied prospectively. As this guidance only affects the classification within the statement
of cash flows, ASU 2016-15 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements 

Item 2 - Management's Discussion and Analysis ( MD A )
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  

   FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS    

 This report contains forward-looking statements
that are based on assumptions and may describe future plans, strategies and expectations of The Community Financial Corporation
(the  Company ) and Community Bank of the Chesapeake (the  Bank ). These forward-looking statements are
generally identified by use of the words  believe,   expect,   intend,   anticipate, 
 estimate,   project  or similar expressions. 

The Company and the Bank s ability to
predict results or the actual effect of future plans or strategies is inherently uncertain. Factors that could have a material
adverse effect on the operations of the Company and its subsidiaries include, but are not limited to, changes in interest rates,
national and regional economic conditions, legislative and regulatory changes, monetary and fiscal policies of the U.S. government,
including policies of the U.S. Treasury and the Federal Reserve Board, the quality and composition of the loan or investment portfolios,
demand for loan products, deposit flows, competition, demand for financial services in the Company and the Bank s market
area, changes in real estate market values in the Company and the Bank s market area, changes in relevant accounting principles
and guidelines and cyber security risks. These risks and uncertainties should be considered in evaluating forward-looking statements
and undue reliance should not be placed on such statements. Except as required by applicable law or regulation, the Company does
not undertake, and specifically disclaims any obligation, to release publicly the result of any revisions that may be made to any
forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of the statements or to reflect the occurrence of
anticipated or unanticipated events. 

Additional factors that may affect the Company s
results are discussed in Part I of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 (the  Form
10-K ) that was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

Critical
Accounting Policies    

 Critical accounting policies are defined as
those that involve significant judgments and uncertainties and could potentially result in materially different results under different
assumptions and conditions. The Company considers its determination of the allowance for loan losses, the valuation of foreclosed
real estate (OREO) and the valuation of deferred tax assets to be critical accounting policies. 

The Company s Consolidated Financial
Statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and the general
practices of the United States banking industry. Application of these principles requires management to make estimates, assumptions
and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates, assumptions
and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements. Accordingly, as this information changes,
the financial statements could reflect different estimates, assumptions and judgments. Certain policies inherently have a greater
reliance on the use of estimates, assumptions and judgments and, as such, have a greater possibility of producing results that
could be materially different than originally reported. 

Estimates, assumptions and judgments are necessary
when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value, when a decline in the value of an asset not carried on the
financial statements at fair value warrants an impairment write-down or valuation reserve to be established or when an asset or
liability needs to be recorded contingent upon a future event. Carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results
in more financial statement volatility. The fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets
and liabilities are based either on quoted market prices or are provided by other third-party sources, when available. When these
sources are not available, management makes estimates based upon what it considers to be the best available information. 

Allowance for Loan Losses   

 The allowance for loan losses is an estimate
of the losses that exist in the loan portfolio. The allowance is based on two principles of accounting: (1) Financial Accounting
Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 450  Contingencies, 
which requires that losses be accrued when they are probable of occurring and are estimable and (2) FASB ASC 310  Receivables, 
which requires that losses be accrued when it is probable that the Company will not collect all principal and interest payments
according to the contractual terms of the loan. The loss, if any, is determined by the difference between the loan balance and
the value of collateral, the present value of expected future cash flows and values observable in the secondary markets. 

The allowance for loan loss balance is an estimate
based upon management s evaluation of the loan portfolio. The allowance is comprised of a specific and a general component.
The specific component consists of management s evaluation of certain classified and non-accrual loans and their underlying
collateral. Management assesses the ability of the borrower to repay the loan based upon all information available. Loans are examined
to determine a specific allowance based upon the borrower s payment history, economic conditions specific to the loan or
borrower and other factors that would impact the borrower s ability to repay the loan on its contractual basis. Depending
on the assessment of the borrower s ability to pay and the type, condition and value of collateral, management will establish
an allowance amount specific to the loan. 

Management uses a risk scale to assign grades
to commercial real estate, residential rentals, construction and land development, commercial loans and commercial equipment loans.
Commercial loan relationships with an aggregate exposure to the Bank of $750,000 or greater are risk rated. Residential first mortgages,
home equity and second mortgages and consumer loans are monitored on an ongoing basis based on borrower payment history. Consumer
loans and residential real estate loans are classified as unrated unless they are part of a larger commercial relationship that
requires grading or are troubled debt restructures or nonperforming loans with an Other Assets Especially Mentioned or higher risk
rating due to a delinquent payment history. 

The Company s commercial loan portfolio
is periodically reviewed by regulators and independent consultants engaged by management. 

In establishing the general component of the
allowance, management analyzes non-impaired loans in the portfolio including changes in the amount and type of loans. This analysis
reviews trends by portfolio segment in charge-offs, delinquency, classified loans, loan concentrations and the rate of portfolio
segment growth. Qualitative factors also include an assessment of the current regulatory environment, the quality of credit administration
and loan portfolio management and national and local economic trends. Based upon this analysis a loss factor is applied to each
loan category and the Bank adjusts the loan loss allowance by increasing or decreasing the provision for loan losses. 

Management has significant discretion in making
the judgments inherent in the determination of the allowance for loan losses, including the valuation of collateral, assessing
a borrower s prospects of repayment and in establishing loss factors on the general component of the allowance. Changes in
loss factors have a direct impact on the amount of the provision and on net income. Errors in management s assessment of
the global factors and their impact on the portfolio could result in the allowance not being adequate to cover losses in the portfolio,
and may result in additional provisions. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the allowance for loan losses was $9.7 million
and $8.5 million, respectively, or 0.92% and 0.93%, respectively, of total loans. An increase or decrease in the allowance could
result in a charge or credit to income before income taxes that materially impacts earnings. 

For additional information regarding the allowance
for loan losses, refer to Notes 1 and 6 of the Consolidated Financial Statements as presented in the Company s Form 10-K
for the year ended December 31, 2015 and the discussion in this MD A. 

Other Real Estate Owned ( OREO )   

 The Company maintains a valuation allowance
on its other real estate owned. As with the allowance for loan losses, the valuation allowance on OREO is based on FASB ASC 450
 Contingencies,  as well as the accounting guidance on impairment of long-lived assets. These statements require that
the Company establish a valuation allowance when it has determined that the carrying amount of a foreclosed asset exceeds its fair
value. Fair value of a foreclosed asset is measured by the cash flows expected to be realized from its subsequent disposition.
These cash flows are reduced for the costs of selling or otherwise disposing of the asset. 

Management must make significant assumptions
in estimating the timing and amount of cash flows from the sale of OREO. For example, in cases where the real estate acquired is
undeveloped land, management must gather the best available evidence regarding the market value of the property, including appraisals,
cost estimates of development and broker opinions. Due to the highly subjective nature of this evidence, as well as the limited
market, long time periods involved and substantial risks, cash flow estimates are subject to change. Errors regarding any aspect
of the costs or proceeds of developing, selling or otherwise disposing of foreclosed real estate could result in the allowance
being inadequate to reduce carrying costs to fair value and may require an additional provision for valuation allowances. 

For additional information regarding OREO,
refer to Notes 1 and 8 of the Consolidated Financial Statements as presented in the Company s Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2015. 

Deferred Tax Assets   

 The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance
with FASB ASC 740,  Income Taxes,  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted
tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. FASB ASC 740
requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or the entire
deferred tax asset will not be realized. 

The Company periodically evaluates the ability
of the Company to realize the value of its deferred tax assets.  If the Company were to determine that it was not more likely
than not that the Company would realize the full amount of the deferred tax assets, it would establish a valuation allowance to
reduce the carrying value of the deferred tax asset to the amount it believes would be realized. The factors used to assess the
likelihood of realization are the Company s forecast of future taxable income and available tax-planning strategies that
could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets. 

Failure to achieve forecasted taxable income
might affect the ultimate realization of the net deferred tax assets.  Factors that may affect the Company s ability
to achieve sufficient forecasted taxable income include, but are not limited to, the following: increased competition, a decline
in net interest margin, a loss of market share, decreased demand for financial services and national and regional economic conditions.  

The Company s provision for income taxes
and the determination of the resulting deferred tax assets and liabilities involve a significant amount of management judgment
and are based on the best information available at the time. The Company operates within federal and state taxing jurisdictions
and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions. 

For additional information regarding income
taxes and deferred tax assets, refer to Notes 1 and 12 in the Consolidated Financial Statements as presented in the Company s
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

OVERVIEW   

  Community
Bank of the Chesapeake (the  Bank ) is headquartered in Southern Maryland with branches located in Maryland and Virginia.
The Bank is a wholly owned subsidiary of The Community Financial Corporation. The Bank conducts business through its main office
in Waldorf, Maryland, and 11 branch offices in Waldorf, Bryans Road, Dunkirk, Leonardtown, La Plata, Charlotte Hall, Prince Frederick,
Lusby, California, Maryland; and Central Park and downtown Fredericksburg, Virginia. The Company opened its second branch in downtown
Fredericksburg, Virginia in April 2016.   In addition,
the Company maintains five loan production offices ( LPOs ) in La Plata, Prince Frederick, Leonardtown and Annapolis,
Maryland; and Fredericksburg, Virginia. The Leonardtown and Fredericksburg LPOs are co-located with branches.  

During 2015, the Company made a number of strategic
decisions to meet its longer-term objectives of increased profitability and increased shareholder value. The Company continued to
execute its plans to improve asset quality and to increase transaction deposits, which consist of savings, money market, interest-bearing
demand and noninterest bearing demand accounts. For additional information regarding 2015 strategic initiatives and results see
the overview section and the operations discussion in the MD A as presented in the Company s Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2015. 

In 2016, the Company s initiatives are
to grow the loan portfolio by at least 10% and control expenses. Due to the low interest rate environment and the effects on net
interest margin, the Company continues its restructuring of operations to reduce costs. In the first quarter of 2016, the Company
completed a redesign of the entire branch system. This redesign, combined with the closure of the King George facility allowed
the Company to reduce branch employees by 15% from 73 at March 31, 2015 to 62 at March 31, 2016. The Company is focused on reducing
expenses by streamlining internal processes and FTEs as well as by reviewing vendor relationships. The Company is cautiously optimistic
that these cost control efforts and its continued asset growth will create operating leverage and increase both its return on average
assets and return on equity over the next year. During the first quarter of 2016, the Company identified annualized savings of
$1.2 million, primarily from reductions in staffing due to employee attrition and retirement. 

The current year initiative to control costs
began to pick up momentum during the second quarter of 2016. The Company s efficiency ratio improved to 68.33% during the
second quarter from 70.68% for the first quarter. The rate of expense growth was controlled at 0.7% compared to the prior quarter.
During the third quarter of 2016, the Company s efficiency ratio improved to 66.55% and expense growth was controlled at
0.3% compared to the second quarter of 2016. 

In the first nine months of 2016, loan growth
was very strong with end of period gross loans increasing $132.5 million, or 19.2% on an annualized basis, from $918.9 million
at December 31, 2015 to $1,051.4 million at September 30, 2016. The significant increase in loan volume resulted net interest income
growing faster than operating expenses. The Company has a strong pipeline and is optimistic that continued loan growth, paired
with the expense control, should continue to increase operating leverage during the fourth quarter of 2016. Net operating expense
to average assets has decreased from 2.38% for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to 2.06% for the three months ended September
30, 2016. 

Economy   

 The U.S. economy continued to grow slowly throughout
2015 and 2014. Gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of one percent during the fourth quarter of 2015, which was half of
the growth posted during the third quarter of 2015. The Federal Reserve had indicated through its survey of the Board of Governors
that up to four rate increases were planned for 2016. During the first half of 2016, due to a number of world events and market
disruptions, many economists reduced their forecasts for 2016 rate hikes from four down to two. The Federal Reserve signaled during
the second quarter that two rate hikes were likely, but as of late October 2016, rthe Federal Funds rate remained at 0.50%. 

Medium-term interest rates have fallen since the fourth quarter
of 2015, with the ten year U.S. Treasury rate as of October 11, 2016 ending at 1.77%. Although the ten year rate has seen some
slight increases recently it has been as low as 1.37% (July 8, 2016) in 2016. This is down from 2.27% at December 31, 2015. The
five year U.S. Treasury rate as of October 11, 2016 was 1.30%. This is down from 1.76% at December 31, 2015. Assuming treasury
rates remain at current rates in the 5 to 10 year range, there will be more negative pressure on the re-pricing of the loan portfolio
and the pricing of new loans. The downward trend in treasury rates had a positive impact on local deposit pricing through the second
quarter of 2016. The Company is optimistic that interest-earning asset growth will continue to offset the negative impacts of lower
asset yields in the current interest rate environment during the fourth quarter of 2016. 

The impact of slow economic growth on the Southern
Maryland, Annapolis, Maryland and Fredericksburg, Virginia areas has been moderated by the presence of federal government agencies
and defense facilities. Further, the private sector that supports the Bank s footprint has continued to grow at a pace faster
than other parts of the country. In addition, the Bank s market expansion has enabled the Company to grow the loan portfolio
and has produced sustainable organic growth in deposits during the last several years. Even through the difficult economic environment,
the Bank s capital levels and asset quality have remained strong.

economy and its impact on the Company s business refer to the Business Section in the Company s Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2015 under the caption  Market Area  ( Part I. Item 1. Business Section   Market Area).

(a)   Non-accrual loans include all loans that are
90 days or more delinquent and loans that are non-accrual due to the operating results or cash flows of a customer. Non-accrual
loans can include loans that are current with all loan payments. Interest and principal are recognized on a cash-basis in accordance
with the Bank's policy if the loans are not impaired or there is no impairment. 

(b)   At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the
Bank had total TDRs of $15.8 million and $18.6 million, respectively, with three TDR relationships totaling $5.2 million and $5.4
million, respectively, in non-accrual status. These loans are classified as non-accrual loans for the calculation of financial
ratios. 

COMPARISON OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR
THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 AND 2015   

Earnings Summary   

 Consolidated net income available to common
shareholders of $2.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased $680,000 compared to the three months ended
September 30, 2015. Earnings per common share (diluted) at $0.42 increased $0.15 from $0.27 per common share (diluted) for the
three months ended September 30, 2015. Third quarter 2015 operating results reflected a $0.05 impact to earnings per share for
the loss on the sale of the Company s King George branch. The $680,000 increase in earnings was attributable to increased
net interest income of $1.1 million and noninterest income of $376,000, partially offset by increases to the provision for loan
losses of $197,000, noninterest expense of $280,000 and income tax expense of $279,000. 

The Company s return on average assets
was 0.63% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 0.46% for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The Company s
return on average common stockholders' equity was 7.48% compared to 5.09% for the same comparative period. 

Net Interest Income   

 The primary component of the Company s
net income is its net interest income, which is the difference between income earned on assets and interest paid on the deposits
and borrowings used to fund them. Net interest income is affected by the difference between the yields earned on the Company s
interest-earning assets and the rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities, as well as the relative amounts of such assets and
liabilities. Net interest income, divided by average interest-earning assets, represents the Company s net interest margin. 

Net interest income increased $1.1 million
to $10.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $9.1 million for the three months ended September 30,
2015. The net interest margin was 3.47% for the three months ended September 30, 2016, an eight basis point decrease from 3.55%
for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in net interest margin was largely the result of lower yields on loans
partially offset on a lower cost of funds. 

The following table shows the components of
net interest income and the dollar and percentage changes for the periods presented. 

Interest and dividend income increased by $1.2
million to $12.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $11.0 million for the three months ended September
30, 2015, primarily due to increased income from the growth in the average balance of loans. Interest and dividend income also
increased due to moderate growth in the average balance of investments and increased investment yields. Interest and dividend income
on loans increased $1.5 million due to growth of $136.7 million in the average balance of loans from $879.7 million for the three
months ended September 30, 2015 to $1,016.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016. Interest and dividend income
on investments increased $97,000 during the third quarter of 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year as average interest-earning
investment balances increased $8.3 million and average yields increased from 1.84% to 1.99%. Average loan yields declined 19 basis
points from 4.70% for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to 4.51% for the three months ended September 30, 2016, which resulted
in a decrease in interest and dividend income of $417,000. 

Interest expense increased $161,000 to $2.1
million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $1.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, due
to an increase in the average balances of interest-bearing liabilities and a slight change in the composition of interest-bearing
liabilities between the comparable periods. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, interest expense increased $153,000
due to larger average balances of interest-bearing transaction deposit accounts, time deposits and short-term borrowings compared
to the same quarter of 2015. Additionally, interest expense increased $51,000 due to increased rates on certificates of deposits
and debt. These increases to interest expense were partially offset by a reduction in interest expense of $30,000 due to a $5.1
million decrease in average long-term debt balances from the comparable period to $65.6 million for the three months ended September
30, 2016. As a result of the change in the composition of debt, the average rate paid on debt declined from 3.06% for the three
months ended September 30, 2015 to 2.63% for the comparable period in 2016. 

The Company continued to make progress in controlling
overall deposit costs by increasing transaction deposits as a percentage of overall deposits. Average transaction accounts as a
percentage of average total deposits increased from 57.0% for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to 59.1% for the three
months ended September 30, 2016. Deposit costs at 0.48% were the same for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. Average
transaction deposits, which include savings, money market, interest-bearing demand and noninterest bearing demand accounts, for
the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased $91.9 million or 18.3% to $595.4 million compared to $503.5 million for the
comparable period in 2015. The increase in average transaction deposits included growth in average noninterest bearing demand deposits
of $21.7 million from $123.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $144.8 million for the three months ended
September 30, 2016. 

The following table presents information on
average balances and rates for deposits. 

The following table presents information on
the average balances of the Company s interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and interest earned or paid
thereon for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. There are no tax equivalency adjustments. 

(1) Average balance includes non-accrual loans 

The following table sets forth certain information
regarding changes in interest income and interest expense of the Bank for the periods indicated. For each category of interest-earning
asset and interest-bearing liability, information is provided on changes attributable to (1) changes in volume (changes in volume
multiplied by old rate); and (2) changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by old volume). Changes in rate-volume (changes in
rate multiplied by the change in volume) have been allocated to changes due to volume.

Provision for Loan Losses   

 The following table shows the dollar and percentage
changes for the provision for loan losses for the periods presented. 

The provision for loan losses increased $197,000
to $698,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $501,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Net
charge-offs for the quarter decreased $741,000 from $883,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $142,000 for the
three months ended September 30, 2016. Improvements to baseline charge-off factors for the periods used to evaluate the adequacy
of the allowance as well as improvements in some qualitative factors, such as reductions in classified assets and delinquency,
were offset by increases in other qualitative factors, such as increased loan growth. Overall, these changes resulted in a higher
provision for loan losses for the comparable periods. The specific allowance is based on management s estimate of realizable
value for particular loans and has decreased as specific credits have been resolved through a return to performance, charge-offs
or additions to OREO. 

See further discussion of the provision under
the caption  Asset Quality  in the Comparison of Financial Condition section of Management s Discussion and Analysis. 

Noninterest Income   

 The following table shows the components of
noninterest income and the dollar and percentage changes for the periods presented. 

Noninterest income increased by $376,000 to
$842,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $466,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. During
the third quarter of 2015, noninterest income was adversely affected by a one-time expense to record a $426,000 provision for the
loss on the sale of the King George, Virginia branch building and equipment, which settled during the first quarter of 2016. Third
quarter 2016 and 2015 noninterest income were comparable after adjustment for 2015 branch building and equipment sale. 

Noninterest Expense   

 The following tables show the components of
noninterest expense and the dollar and percentage changes for the periods presented. 

For the three months ended September 30, 2016,
noninterest expense increased 4.0%, or $280,000, to $7.3 million from $7.0 million for the comparable period in 2015. The Company s
2015 total growth in salary and benefit costs was 3.2% compared to 2014. Salary and benefit costs have increased from the comparable
period as incentive compensation has increased due to interest-earning asset growth as well as higher self-insured health insurance
claims. Additionally, the current quarter increase was impacted by the timing of planned advertising campaigns. The Company s
efficiency ratio, noninterest expense as a percentage of average assets and net operating expense as a percentage of average assets
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were 66.55%, 2.33%, and 2.06%, respectively, and 73.62%, 2.55%, and 2.38%,
respectively. 

Income Tax Expense   

 For the three months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015, the Company recorded income tax expense of $1.0 million and $735,000, respectively. The Company s effective tax
rates for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were 34.06% and 36.42%, respectively. The decrease in the effective
tax rate was the result of tax-exempt income being relatively higher to total income for the three months ended September 30, 2016
compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. 

COMPARISON OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR
THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 AND 2015   

Earnings Summary   

 Consolidated net income available to common
shareholders of $5.3 million or $1.15 per common share (diluted) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased $517,000
or $0.13 per common share (diluted) compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This is attributable to increased net
interest income and noninterest income of $2.2 million and $79,000, respectively, and preferred dividends paid of $23,000 in 2015,
partially offset by increases to the provision for loan losses of $618,000, noninterest expense of $981,000 and income tax expense
of $238,000. 

Additionally, it is important to note that
consolidated net income reflects the impact of the 2015 subordinated debt offering that replaced SBLF preferred stock. During the
first nine months of 2016, interest expense increased $148,000 due to the larger first quarter 2016 average balance of the subordinated
notes issued in February 2015. 

The Company s return on average assets
was even at 0.59% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company s return on average common
stockholders' equity was 6.89% compared to 6.42% for the same comparative period. 

Net Interest Income   

 The primary component of the Company s
net income is its net interest income, which is the difference between income earned on assets and interest paid on the deposits
and borrowings used to fund them. Net interest income is affected by the difference between the yields earned on the Company s
interest-earning assets and the rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities, as well as the relative amounts of such assets and
liabilities. Net interest income, divided by average interest-earning assets, represents the Company s net interest margin. 

Net interest income increased $2.2 million
to $29.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $27.2 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2015. The net interest margin was 3.50% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, a 10 basis point decrease from 3.60% for
the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in net interest margin was largely the result of lower yields on loans and
slightly higher funding costs. 

The following table shows the components of
net interest income and the dollar and percentage changes for the periods presented. 

Interest and dividend income increased by $2.8
million to $35.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $32.7 million for the nine months ended September
30, 2015, primarily due to increased income from the growth in the average balance of loans. Interest and dividend income also
increased due to growth in the average balance of investments and increased investment yields. Interest and dividend income on
loans increased $3.4 million due to growth of $98.3 million, or 11.3%, in the average balance of loans from $869.3 million for
the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $967.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Interest and dividend
income on investments increased $509,000 during the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same period in the prior year as
average interest-earning investment balances increased $18.8 million and average yields increased from 1.74% to 1.97%. Average
loan yields declined 17 basis points from 4.74% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to 4.57% for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, which resulted in a decrease in interest and dividend income of $1.1 million. As described previously, ten
year and five year U.S. Treasury rates have remained below 2015 average rates during 2016. Assuming treasury rates remain at current
rates in the 5 to 10 year range, there will be continued pressure on the re-pricing of the loan portfolio and the pricing of new
loans. The Company is optimistic that interest-earning asset growth will offset the negative impacts of lower asset yields in the
current interest rate environment. Additionally, overall portfolio loan yields have decreased as the Bank has added residential
first mortgages during 2016, which have increased from 14.30% of the loan portfolio at December 31, 2015 to 15.91% of the portfolio
at September 30, 2016. 

Interest expense increased $546,000 to $6.0
million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $5.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, due
primarily to an increase in the average balances of interest-bearing liabilities and a change in the composition of interest-bearing
liabilities between the comparable periods. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, interest expense increased $529,000
due to larger average balances of interest-bearing transaction deposit accounts, time deposits, short-term borrowings and subordinated
notes compared to the same period of 2015. Additionally, interest expense increased $246,000 due to increased rates on interest-bearing
deposit accounts and debt. These increases to interest expense were partially offset by a reduction in interest expense of $229,000
due to a $12.5 million decrease in average long-term debt balances from the comparable period to $58.8 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016. The average rate paid on debt, which includes long-term debt, trust preferred junior subordinated debentures
( TRUPS ), subordinated notes, and short-term borrowings, decreased from 2.77% for the nine months ended September
30, 2015 to 2.67% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was
$148,000 greater than the comparable period as a result of the timing of the funding of the subordinated notes in February 2015. 

The Company continued to make progress in controlling
deposit costs by increasing transaction deposits as a percentage of overall deposits. Average transaction accounts as a percentage
of total deposits increased from 55.8% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to 57.8% for the nine months ended September
30, 2016. Deposit costs at 0.48% were the same for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Average transaction
deposits, which include savings, money market, interest-bearing demand and noninterest bearing demand accounts, for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 increased $80.4 million, or 16.8%, to $559.4 million compared to $479.0 million for the comparable period
in 2015. The increase in average transaction deposits included growth in noninterest bearing demand deposits of $22.9 million,
or 19.67%, from $117.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $140.0 million for the nine months ended September
30, 2016. 

The following table presents information on

Provision for Loan Losses   

 The following table shows the dollar and percentage
changes for the provision for loan losses for the periods presented. 

The provision for loan losses increased $618,000
to $1.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $1.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.
Net charge-offs for the first nine months decreased $610,000 from $1.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to
$567,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Improvements to baseline charge-off factors for the periods used to evaluate
the adequacy of the allowance as well as improvements in some qualitative factors, such as reductions in classified assets and
delinquency, were offset by increases in other qualitative factors, such as increased loan growth. Overall, these changes resulted
in a higher provision for loan losses for the comparable periods. The specific allowance is based on management s estimate
of realizable value for particular loans and has decreased as specific credits have been resolved through a return to performance,
charge-offs or additions to OREO. 

See further discussion of the provision under
the caption  Asset Quality  in the Comparison of Financial Condition section of Management s Discussion and Analysis. 

Noninterest Income   

 The following table shows the components of
noninterest income and the dollar and percentage changes for the periods presented. 

Noninterest income increased by $79,000 to
$2.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $2.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.
Noninterest income is up $161,000 compared to the prior year due to higher service charge income from the growth in the number
of customer accounts, wealth services and rental income on OREO properties that were disposed of during the second quarter of 2016.
In addition, no loss was recognized in 2016 comparable to the third quarter 2015 one-time expense to record a $426,000 provision
for the loss on the sale of the King George, Virginia branch building and equipment. These positive impacts on noninterest income
were offset by decreases to noninterest income from the Company s exit from the origination of residential first mortgage
loans during the second quarter of 2015. There were no gains on residential loans held for sale in the nine months ended September
30, 2016 compared to $104,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. In addition, during the first nine months of 2016,
the Company recognized losses of $440,000 on the disposition of OREO compared to $20,000 in OREO losses recognized for the comparable
period. 

Noninterest Expense   

 The following tables show the components of
noninterest expense and the dollar and percentage changes for the periods presented. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
noninterest expense increased 4.7%, or $981,000, to $21.8 million from $20.9 million for the comparable period in 2015. The Company s
2015 total growth in salary and benefit costs was 3.2%. Total growth of salary and benefits in the first nine months of 2016 was
$399,000 or 3.3%. Salary and benefit costs have increased from the comparable period as incentive compensation has increased due
to interest-earning asset growth as well as higher self-insured health insurance claims. The Company has controlled the growth
of salary and benefit costs by restructuring our branch organization and better aligning incentives with Company performance. As
previously disclosed, the Company is working to slow the growth of noninterest expenses as a percentage of average assets based
on interest-earning asset growth and a greater ability to increase efficiencies as a result of our larger asset size. Data processing
costs have increased primarily due to the increased asset size of the Bank. The Company s efficiency ratio, noninterest expense
as a percentage of average assets and net operating expense as a percentage of average assets for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015 were 68.47%, 2.41%, and 2.14%, respectively, and 70.55%, 2.56%, and 2.27%, respectively. 

Income Tax Expense   

 For the nine months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015, the Company recorded income tax expense of $3.1 million and $2.8 million, respectively. The Company s effective
tax rates for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were 36.56% and 36.95%, respectively. The decrease in the effective
tax rate was the result of tax-exempt income being relatively higher to total income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016
compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

COMPARISON OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AT
SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 AND DECEMBER 31, 2015    

   Assets   

 Total assets at September 30, 2016 were $1.28
billion, an increase of $138.5 million, or 12.1% (16.2% on an annualized basis), compared to total assets of $1.14 billion at December
31, 2015. The increase in total assets was primarily attributable to growth in loans. Net loans increased $132.7 million, or 14.6%
(19.5% on an annualized basis), from $909.2 million at December 31, 2015 to $1,041.9 million at September 30, 2016, mainly due
to increases in loans for commercial real estate and residential first mortgages. The differences in allocations between the cash
and investment categories reflect operational needs. 

The following table shows the Company s
assets and the dollar and percentage changes for the periods presented. 

The following is a breakdown of the Company s
loan portfolio at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

The Company separated residential rentals into
a new loan portfolio segment beginning in the second quarter of 2016. Residential rentals include income producing properties that
are 1-4 family units and apartment buildings. The Company s decision to segregate the residential rental portfolio for financial
reporting was based on the growth and size of the portfolio and risk characteristics unique to residential rental properties. Residential
rentals were previously included in the residential first mortgage and commercial real estate mortgage portfolios. See Note 11
- Loans in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on risk characteristics of the residential
rental portfolio. 

Asset Quality    

 The following tables show asset quality ratios
at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

(a)   Non-accrual loans include all loans that are
90 days or more delinquent and loans that are non-accrual due to the operating results or cash flows of a customer. Non-accrual
loans can include loans that are current with all loan payments. Interest and principal are recognized on a cash-basis in accordance
with the Bank's policy if the loans are not impaired or there is no impairment. 

(b)   At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the
Bank had total TDRs of $15.8 million and $18.6 million, respectively, with three TDR relationships totaling $5.2 million and $5.4
million, respectively, in non-accrual status. These loans are classified as non-accrual loans for the calculation of financial
ratios. 

The Company has been working to reduce classified
loans by using approaches that maximize the Company s contractual rights with each individual customer relationship. The
objective is to move non-performing or substandard credits that are not likely to become performing or passing credits in a reasonable
timeframe off the balance sheet. The Company is encouraging existing classified customers to obtain financing with other lenders
or enforcing its contractual rights. Management believes this strategy is in the best long-term interest of the Company. As a result
of these efforts, non-accrual loans and OREO to total assets decreased 50 basis points from 1.83% at December 31, 2015 to 1.33%
at September 30, 2016. Non-accrual loans, OREO and TDRs to total assets decreased $6.3 million or 82 basis points from $34.0 million
or 2.98%, at December 31, 2015 to $27.7 million or 2.16%, at September 30, 2016. 

Management considers classified assets to be
an important measure of asset quality. Classified assets have been trending downward the last several years from a high point of
greater than $81.9 million at September 30, 2011 to $40.2 million as of September 30, 2016 representing a decline of greater than
50%. During the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company reduced classified loans $3.5 million to $32.8 million. Of the fourth quarter
2015 reduction in classified loans, $2.7 million was transferred to OREO. These properties consisted of a 21 unit apartment building
and 11 condo units. The Company disposed of $3.6 million of OREO properties during the first nine months of 2016, including the
aforementioned properties. During the three months ended March 31, 2016, the Company took a deed in lieu of foreclosure on a $2.1
million improved commercial office building with multiple tenants and a ratified contract for its sale. That contract was voided
during the second quarter. The Company plans to manage the property until its sale and will recognize miscellaneous rental income
during our ownership and management of the property. There is no expected loss from the eventual disposal of this property based
on current appraised values, the current rent roll and rents of similar space in the area. 

The following is a breakdown of the Company s classified and
special mention assets at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, 2014, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively: 

Classified Assets and Special Mention Assets  

The allowance for loan losses was 0.92% of
gross loans at September 30, 2016 and 0.93% at December 31, 2015. There was an increase in the general component of the allowance
due to changes to general allowance factors that reflect changes in historical loss, loan growth, delinquency rates and general
economic conditions. Management s determination of the adequacy of the allowance is based on a periodic evaluation of the
portfolio with consideration given to: overall loss experience; current economic conditions; size, growth and composition of the
loan portfolio; financial condition of the borrowers; current appraised values of underlying collateral and other relevant factors
that, in management s judgment, warrant recognition in determining an adequate allowance. Improvements to baseline charge-off
factors for the periods used to evaluate the adequacy of the allowance as well as improvements in some qualitative factors, such
as reductions in classified assets and delinquency, were offset by increases in other qualitative factors, such as increased loan
growth. The specific allowance is based on management s estimate of realizable value for particular loans. Management believes
that the allowance is adequate. 

The Company increased its general allowance
as a percentage of gross loans five basis points from 0.75% at December 31, 2015 to 0.80% at September 30, 2016. The following
is a breakdown of the Company s general and specific allowances as a percentage of gross loans at September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, respectively. 

The most important weighted factor in the Company s
allowance for loan loss methodology is the charge-off history of the loan portfolio. The historical loss experience factor is tracked
over various time horizons for each portfolio segment. It is weighted as the most important factor of the general component of
the allowance and has decreased as the Bank s charge-off history has improved. The following table provides a five-year trend
and the current year to date and comparable year to date of the prior year of net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans. 

Non-accrual loans (90 days or greater delinquent
and non-accrual only loans) decreased $3.0 million from $11.4 million or 1.24% of total loans at December 31, 2015 to $8.4 million
or 0.80% of total loans at September 30, 2016. Non-accrual only loans are loans classified as non-accrual due to customer operating
results or payment history. In accordance with the Company s policy, interest income is recognized on a cash basis for these
loans. The Company had 28 non-accrual loans at September 30, 2016 compared to 38 non-accrual loans at December 31, 2015. Non-accrual
loans at September 30, 2016 included $7.0 million, or 83% of non-accrual loans, attributed to 16 loans representing six customer
relationships classified as substandard. Non-accrual loans at December 31, 2015 included $8.1 million, or 71% of non-accrual loans,
attributed to 19 loans representing six customer relationships classified as substandard. Of these loans at September 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015, $3.6 million and $3.8 million, respectively, represented a residential development project. During the second
quarter of 2014, the Company deferred the collection of principal and interest on this project. The project is currently being
continued with the support of non-bank investment, which has been used for vertical construction that has significantly improved
the collateral value and the viability of the project. The loans remain classified as troubled debt restructures ( TDRs )
and non-accrual. In addition, at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had three TDR loans totaling $1.6 million
and $1.7 million, respectively, classified as non-accrual. These loans are classified solely as non-accrual loans for the calculation
of financial ratios. 

Loan delinquency (90 days or greater delinquent
and 31-89 days delinquent) decreased $3.2 million from $11.7 million, or 1.27% of loans, at December 31, 2015 to $8.5 million,
or 0.81% of loans, at September 30, 2016. 

At September 30, 2016, the Company had 17 accruing
TDRs totaling $10.6 million compared to 23 accruing TDRs totaling $13.1 million as of December 31, 2015. The Company had specific
reserves of $929,000 on seven TDRs totaling $6.2 million at September 30, 2016 and specific reserves of $1.3 million on nine TDRs
totaling $3.6 million at December 31, 2015. At September 30, 2016, $8.0 million or 76% of accruing TDRs of $10.6 million relate
to one customer relationship. The $8.0 million in TDRs is for eight loans with two construction and land development loans totaling
$724,000, one residential rental property of $228,000 and five commercial real estate loans totaling $7.1 million. The loans in
this relationship have been classified as TDRs since the fourth quarter of 2014 and have performed according to the terms of their
restructured agreements with all required payments made timely. They presently remain as TDRs due to below market rates of interest
negotiated at the time of the restructure to obtain additional collateral. The Company has a strong collateral position in this
relationship and as of September 30, 2016 has specific reserves of $426,000 on the relationship. 

The following is a breakdown by loan classification
of the Company s TDRs at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

The OREO balance was $8.6 million at September
30, 2016, a decrease of $829,000 compared to $9.4 million at December 31, 2015. This decrease consisted of additions of $3.1 million
offset by valuation allowances of $366,000 to adjust properties to current appraised values and $3.6 million in disposals. OREO
carrying amounts reflect management s estimate of the realizable value of these properties incorporating current appraised
values, local real estate market conditions and related costs. 

At September 30, 2016, 99%, or $141.3 million
of the asset-backed securities and bonds issued by GSEs, U.S. Agencies were rated AAA by Standard   Poor s or the equivalent
credit rating from another major rating agency compared to 99%, or $138.3 million, at December 31, 2015. Debt securities are evaluated
quarterly to determine whether a decline in their value is OTTI. No OTTI charge was recorded for the six months ended September
30, 2016 and year ended December 31, 2015, respectively. Classified securities decreased $161,000 from $1.1 million at December
31, 2015 to $931,000 at September 30, 2016. 

Gross unrealized losses on HTM and AFS securities
decreased from $1.5 million at December 31, 2015 to $320,000 at September 30, 2016 (see Note 10 in Consolidated Financial Statements).
Gross unrealized losses at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 for AFS securities were $168,000 and $557,000, respectively,
of amortized cost of $43.8 million and $35.5 million, respectively. Gross unrealized losses at September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015 for HTM securities were $152,000 and $941,000, respectively, of amortized cost of $103.0 million and $109.4 million, respectively.
The change in unrealized losses was the result of changes in interest rates, while credit risks remained stable. The Bank holds
over 96% of its AFS and HTM securities as asset-backed securities of GSEs or U.S. Agencies, GSE agency bonds or U.S. government
obligations. The Company intends to, and has the ability to, hold both AFS and HTM securities with unrealized losses until they
mature, at which time the Company will receive full value for the securities. The Company believes that the AFS and HTM securities
with unrealized losses will either recover in market value or be paid off as agreed. 

Liabilities   

 The following table shows the Company s
liabilities and the dollar and percentage changes for the periods presented. 

Deposits and Borrowings   

 Deposits increased by 11.5% (15.4% on an annualized
basis) or $104.7 million, to $1,011.6 million at September 30, 2016 compared to $906.9 million at December 31, 2015. Between 2012
and 2016, the Company increased transaction deposits, including noninterest bearing deposits, to lower its overall cost of funds.
Transaction deposits have increased from 44.9% of total deposits at December 31, 2011 to 58.9% of total deposits at September 30,
2016 

Details of the Company s deposit portfolio
at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are presented below: 

The Company uses both traditional brokered
deposits and reciprocal brokered deposits. Traditional brokered deposits at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were $109.8
million and $49.1 million, respectively. Reciprocal brokered deposits at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were $63.3 million
and $61.1 million, respectively. The reciprocal brokered deposits have many characteristics of core deposits and are used to maximize
FDIC insurance available to our customers. 

Long-term debt and short-term borrowings increased
$29.5 million from $91.6 million at December 31, 2015 to $121.1 million at September 30, 2016. The Company uses brokered deposits
and other wholesale funding to supplement funding when loan growth exceeds core deposit growth and for asset-liability management
purposes. 

The Bank uses advances from the FHLB of Atlanta
to supplement the supply of funds it may lend and to meet deposit withdrawal requirements. Advances from the FHLB are secured by
the Bank s stock in the FHLB, a portion of the Bank s loan portfolio and certain investments. Generally, the Bank s
ability to borrow from the FHLB of Atlanta is limited by its available collateral and also by an overall limitation of 30% of assets.
Further, short-term credit facilities are available at the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond and other commercial banks. Long-term
debt consists of adjustable-rate advances with rates based upon LIBOR, fixed-rate advances, and convertible advances. At September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, 100% of the Bank s long-term debt was fixed for rate and term, as the conversion optionality
of the advances have either been exercised or expired. 

Stockholders  Equity   

 The following table shows the Company s equity and the dollar
and percentage changes for the periods presented. 

During the nine months ended September 30,
2016, stockholders  equity increased $4.2 million to $104.0 million. The increase in stockholders  equity was due to
net income of $5.3 million, net stock related activities related to stock-based compensation of $264,000 and a current year increase
in accumulated other comprehensive income of $326,000. These increases to capital were partially offset by quarterly common dividends
paid of $1.4 million and repurchases of common stock of $337,000. Common stockholders' equity of $104.0 million at September 30,
2016 resulted in a book value of $22.33 per common share compared to $21.48 at December 31, 2015. The Company remains well-capitalized
at September 30, 2016 with a Tier 1 capital to average assets ratio of 9.22%.Accumulated other comprehensive losses reversed to
become gains during the first nine months of 2016 due to market valuation adjustments of the Company s AFS asset-backed securities
portfolio as a result of decreases in long-term interest rates. 

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES    

   Capital Resources   

 The Company has no business other than holding
the stock of the Bank and does not currently have any material funding requirements, except for the payment of dividends on common
stock, and the payment of interest on subordinated debentures and subordinated notes. 

The Company evaluates capital resources necessary
to maintain adequate regulatory capital ratios. The Company and the Bank annually update a three-year strategic capital plan. In
developing its plan, the Company considers the impact to capital of asset growth, income accretion, dividends, holding company
liquidity, investment in markets and people and stress testing. 

During the three months ended September 30,
2016 and the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company assessed using the new regulatory capital ratios that the Company meets
the requirements specified in the Basel III rules upon full adoption of the phased-in requirements. The Bank elected to continue
to exclude most accumulated other comprehensive income ( AOCI ) from capital in its March 31, 2015 quarterly call report
filing and, in effect, to retain the AOCI treatment under the prior capital rules. 

Federal banking regulations require the Company
and the Bank to maintain specified levels of capital. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company and Bank were
well-capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action under the new Basel III Capital Rules. Management
believes, as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, that the Company and the Bank met all capital adequacy requirements to
which they were subject. See Note 12 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Liquidity   

 Liquidity is defined as the ability to meet
cash demands as they arise. Such needs can develop from loan demand, deposit withdrawals or acquisition opportunities. Potential
obligations resulting from the issuance of standby letters of credit and commitments to fund future borrowings to loan customers
are other factors affecting the Company s liquidity needs. Many of these obligations and commitments are expected to expire
without being drawn upon; therefore the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements affecting
the Company s liquidity position. 

Asset liquidity is provided by cash and assets
which are readily marketable or which will mature in the near future. Liquid assets include cash, federal funds sold, and short-term
investments in cash deposits with other banks. Liquidity is also provided by access to funding sources, which include core depositors
and brokered deposits. Other sources of funds include the Company s ability to borrow, such as purchasing federal funds from
correspondent banks, sales of securities under agreements to repurchase and advances from the FHLB 

The Company s principal sources of liquidity
are cash on hand and dividends received from the Bank. The Bank is subject to various regulatory restrictions on the payment of
dividends. 

The Bank s principal sources of funds
for investment and operations are net income, deposits, sales of loans, borrowings, principal and interest payments on loans, principal
and interest received on investment securities and proceeds from the maturity and sale of investment securities. Its principal
funding commitments are for the origination or purchase of loans, the purchase of securities and the payment of maturing deposits.
Deposits are considered the primary source of funds supporting the Bank s lending and investment activities. The Bank also
uses borrowings from the FHLB of Atlanta to supplement deposits. The amount of FHLB advances available to the Bank is limited to
the lower of 30% of Bank assets or the amount supportable by eligible collateral including FHLB stock, loans and securities. In
addition, the Bank has established lines of credit with the Federal Reserve Bank and commercial banks. 

For additional information on these agreements,
including collateral, see Note 11 of the Consolidated Financial Statements as presented in the Company s Form 10-K for the
year ended December 31, 2015. 

The Bank s most liquid assets are cash,
cash equivalents and federal funds sold. The levels of such assets are dependent on the Bank s operating, financing and investment
activities at any given time. The variations in levels of cash and cash equivalents are influenced by deposit flows and anticipated
future deposit flows. 

Cash and cash equivalents as of September 30,
2016 totaled $14.4 million, an increase of $3.2 million, or 28.9%, from the December 31, 2015 total of $11.1 million. The increase
in cash was primarily due to an increase in cash provided by financing activities and operating activities which were partially
offset by cash used in investing activities. The increase in the Bank s deposits and borrowings provided cash to fund loan
growth. Changes to the level of cash and cash equivalents have minimal impact on operational needs as the Bank has substantial
sources of funds available from other sources. 

During the nine months ended September 30,
2016, all financing activities provided $132.4 million in cash compared to $21.9 million in cash for the same period in 2015. The
Bank was provided $110.5 million more cash due to financing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to
the nine months ended September 30, 2015 primarily due to increases in deposits of $91.8 million and net increases of $21.5 million
in long-term debt and short-term borrowings. These increases to cash were offset by a 3.0 million reduction in cash due to net
proceeds received during the first quarter 2015 for the subordinated notes issued of $23.0 million offset by the SBLF payoff of
$20 million. 

During the nine months ended September 30,
2016, all investing activities used $138.8 million in cash compared to $38.5 million in cash used for the same period in 2015.
The increase in cash used of $100.3 million was primarily the result of a net increase in cash used of $108.0 million from loan
activities. The Company purchased $1.2 million more premises and equipment in the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same
period in 2015. More cash was used to fund loans as loans originated or acquired increased $118.2 million from $180.5 million for
the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to $298.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. This was partially offset
by an increase to cash provided of $10.2 million as principal collected on loans increased from $150.1 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015 to $160.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Additionally, there was an increase in
cash provided of $5.0 million for securities transactions compared to the same period of 2015. This was primarily due to less net
cash used for investments for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 than the comparable period of 2015. The result of these
securities activities was that the Bank was a net purchaser of securities of $1.4 million year to date 2016 compared to a net purchaser
of securities of $6.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. In addition, cash provided in increased $3.8 million
from the sale of the King George branch premises and equipment and the sale of OREO. 

Operating activities provided cash of $9.6
million, or $325,000 more cash, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $9.3 million of cash provided for the
same period of 2015. . 

ITEM 3.    Quantitative
and qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk    

Interest rate risk is defined as the exposure
to changes in net interest income and capital that arises from movements in interest rates. Depending on the composition of the
balance sheet, increasing or decreasing interest rates can negatively affect the Company s results of operations and financial
condition. 

The Company measures interest rate risk over
the short and long term. The Company measures interest rate risk as the change in net interest income ( NII ) caused
by a change in interest rates over twelve and twenty-four months. The Company s NII simulations provide information about
short-term interest rate risk exposure. The Company also measures interest rate risk by measuring changes in the values of assets
and liabilities due to changes in interest rates. The economic value of equity ( EVE ) is defined as the present value
of future cash flows from existing assets, minus the present value of future cash flows from existing liabilities. EVE simulations
reflect the interest rate sensitivity of assets and liabilities over a longer time period, considering the maturities, average
life and duration of all balance sheet accounts. 

The Board of Directors has established an interest
rate risk policy, which is administered by the Bank s Asset Liability Committee ( ALCO ). The policy establishes
limits on risk, which are quantitative measures of the percentage change in NII and EVE resulting from changes in interest rates.
Both NII and EVE simulations assist in identifying, measuring, monitoring and controlling interest rate risk and are used by management
and the ALCO Committee to ensure that interest rate risk exposure will be maintained within Board policy guidelines. The ALCO Committee
reports quarterly to the Board of Directors. Mitigating strategies are used to maintain interest rate risk within established limits. 

The Company s interest rate risk ( IRR )
model uses assumptions which include factors such as call features, prepayment options and interest rate caps and floors included
in investment and loan portfolio contracts. Additionally, the IRR model estimates the lives and interest rate sensitivity of the
Company s non-maturity deposits. These assumptions have a significant effect on model results. The assumptions are developed
primarily based upon historical behavior of Bank customers. The Company also considers industry and regional data in developing
IRR model assumptions. There are inherent limitations in the Company s IRR model and underlying assumptions. When interest
rates change, actual movements of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, loan prepayments, and withdrawals of
time and other deposits, may deviate significantly from assumptions used in the model. 

The Company prepares a current base case and
several alternative simulations at least quarterly. Current interest rates are shocked by +/- 100, 200, 300, and 400 basis points
( bp ). The Company may elect not to use particular scenarios that it determines are impractical in a current rate
environment. It is management s goal to manage the portfolios of the Bank so that net interest income at risk over a twelve-month
and twenty-four month period and the economic value of equity at risk do not exceed policy guidelines at the various interest rate
shock levels. 

Measures
of net interest income at risk produced by  simulation  analysis
are indicators of an institution s short-term performance in alternative rate environments. The below schedule estimates
the changes in net interest income over a twelve month period for parallel rate shocks:   

Measures of equity value at risk indicate the
ongoing economic value of the Company by considering the effects of changes in interest rates on all of the Company s cash
flows, and by discounting the cash flows to estimate the present value of assets and liabilities. The below schedule estimates
the changes in the economic value of equity at parallel shocks: 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  

As of the end of the period covered by this
report, management of the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s
principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and
procedures. Based on this evaluation, the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded
that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed
by the Company in reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (1) is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms and
(2) is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its principal executive and financial officers
as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. It should be noted that the design of the Company s
disclosure controls and procedures is based in part upon certain reasonable assumptions about the likelihood of future events,
and there can be no reasonable assurance that any design of disclosure controls and procedures will succeed in achieving its stated
goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote, but the Company s principal executive and financial
officers have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are, in fact, effective at a reasonable assurance
level. There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September
30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonable likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over
financial reporting.
