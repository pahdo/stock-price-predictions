Note 3.  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers   (a new revenue recognition standard).  The core principle of the update is that a company will recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  In addition, this update specifies the accounting for certain costs to obtain or fulfill a contract with a customer and expands disclosure requirements for revenue recognition.  This update is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of the standard will have on the Company's financial position or results of operation.   
    
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,   Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.   This update applies to all entities that hold financial assets or owe financial liabilities and is intended to provide more useful information on the recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. Among other things, this update (a) requires equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income; (b) simplifies the impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values by requiring a qualitative assessment to identify impairment; (c) eliminates the requirement to disclose the fair value of financial instruments measured at amortized cost for entities that are not public business entities; (d) eliminates the requirement for public business entities to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet; (e) requires public business entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes; (f) requires an entity to present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument specific credit risk when the entity has elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments; (g) requires separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset (that is, securities or loans and receivables) on the balance sheet or the accompanying notes to the financial statements; and (h) clarifies that an entity should evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset related to available-for-sale securities in combination with the entity s other deferred tax assets. For public business entities, the amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. For all other entities including not-for-profit entities and employee benefit plans within the scope of Topics 960 through 965 on plan accounting, the amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim  
  
   9 

     Table of Contents  

periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. All entities that are not public business entities may adopt the amendments in this update earlier as of the fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of the standard will have on the Company s financial position or results of operations. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842)  .  The standard requires lessees to recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from leases on the balance sheet.  A lessee should recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term.  A short-term lease is defined as one in which: (a) the lease term is 12 months or less, and (b) there is not an option to purchase the underlying asset that the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise.  For short-term leases, lessees may elect to recognize lease payments over the lease term on a straight-line basis.  For public business entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those years.  For all other entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and for interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020.  The amendments should be applied at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach with earlier application permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of the standard will have on the Company s financial position or results of operations. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-04,   Liabilities   -    Extinguishments of Liabilities (Subtopic 405-20).   The standard provides that liabilities related to the sale of prepaid stored-value products within the scope of this Update are financial liabilities. The amendments in the Update provide a narrow scope exception to the guidance in Subtopic 405-20 to require that breakage for those liabilities be accounted for consistent with the breakage guidance in Topic 606. The amendments in this update are effective for public business entities, certain not-for-profit entities, and certain employee benefit plans for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. For all other entities, the amendments are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Earlier application is permitted, including adoption in an interim period.  This update is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company s financial statements. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-05,   Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815)  . The amendments in this update apply to all reporting entities for which there is a change in the counterparty to a derivative instrument that has been designated as a heading instrument under Topic 815  .   The standards in this update clarify that a change in the counterparty to a derivative instrument that has been designated as the hedging instrument under Topic 815     does not, in and of itself, require designation of that hedging relationship provided that all other hedge accounting criteria continue to be met.   For public business entities, the amendments in this update are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years. For all other entities, the amendments in this update are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. An entity has an option to apply the amendments in this update on e  ither a prospective basis or a modified retrospective basis. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. This update is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company s financial statements. 
    
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,   Financial Instruments-Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments   ( ASU 2016-13 ), which changes the impairment model for most financial assets. This ASU is intended to improve financial reporting by requiring timelier recording of credit losses on loans and other financial instruments held by financial institutions and other organizations.  The underlying premise of the ASU is that financial assets measured at amortized cost should be presented at the net amount expected to be collected, through an allowance for credit losses that is deducted from the amortized cost basis. The allowance for credit losses should reflect management s current estimate of credit losses that are expected to occur over the remaining life of a financial asset.  The income statement will be effected for the measurement of credit losses for newly recognized financial assets, as well as the expected increases or decreases of expected credit losses that have taken place during the period. ASU 2016-13 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2019, and early adoption is permitted for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018. With certain exceptions, transition to the new requirements will be through a cumulative effect adjustment to opening retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is adopted.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of the standard will have on the Company s financial position or results of operations. 
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230):  Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments   ( ASU 2016-15 ), which addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing diversity in practice.  Among these include recognizing cash payments for debt prepayment or debt extinguishment as cash outflows for financing activities; cash proceeds received from the settlement of insurance claims should be classified on the basis of the related insurance coverage; and cash proceeds received from the settlement of bank-owned life insurance policies should be classified as cash inflows from investing activities while the cash payments for premiums on bank-owned policies may be classified as cash

outflows for investing activities, operating activities, or a combination of investing and operating activities.  The amendments in this Update are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. For all other entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. If an entity early adopts the amendments in an interim period, any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period. An entity that elects early adoption must adopt all of the amendments in the same period. The amendments in this Update should be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented. If it is impracticable to apply the amendments retrospectively for some of the issues, the amendments for those issues would be applied prospectively as of the earliest date practicable. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of the standard will have on the Company s statement of cash flows.  

Note 4. Per Share Data 
    
  There are   no   convertible securities which would affect the denominator in calculating basic and dilutive earnings per share.  There are   31,000   stock options outstanding, however, since the strike price of   $42.03   is greater than the average closing market price the options are not included in the denominator when calculating basic and dilutive earnings per share.  Net income as presented on the consolidated statement of income will be used as the numerator.  The following table sets forth the composition of the weighted average common shares (denominator) used in the basic and dilutive earnings per share computation.

At   September 30, 2016   there were a total of   13   securities in a continuous unrealized loss position for less than twelve months and   11   individual securities that were in a continuous unrealized loss position for twelve months or greater. 
    
  The Company reviews its position quarterly and has determined that, at   September 30, 2016  , the declines outlined in the above table represent temporary declines and the Company does not intend to sell and does not believe it will be required to sell these securities before recovery of their cost basis, which may be at maturity.  The Company has concluded that the unrealized losses disclosed above are not other than temporary but are the result of interest rate changes, sector credit ratings changes, or company-specific ratings changes that are not expected to result in the non-collection of principal and interest during the period. 
    
  The amortized cost and fair value of debt securities at   September 30, 2016  , by contractual maturity, are shown below. Expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities since borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.

Note 6.     Loans 
    
  Management segments the Banks' loan portfolio to a level that enables risk and performance monitoring according to similar risk characteristics.  Loans are segmented based on the underlying collateral characteristics.  Categories include commercial, financial, and agricultural, real estate, and installment loans to individuals.  Real estate loans are further segmented into   three   categories: residential, commercial, and construction. 
    
  The following table presents the related aging categories of loans, by segment, as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

Purchased loans acquired are recorded at fair value on their purchase date without a carryover of the related allowance for loan losses. 
    
  Upon the acquisition of Luzerne Bank on June 1, 2013, the Company evaluated whether each acquired loan (regardless of size) was within the scope of ASC 310-30,   Receivables-Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality  .  Purchased credit-impaired loans are loans that have evidence of credit deterioration since origination and it is probable at the date of acquisition

that the Company will not collect all contractually required principal and interest payments. There were   no   material increases or decreases in the expected cash flows of these loans between June 1, 2013 (the  acquisition date ) and   September 30, 2016  .  The fair value of purchased credit-impaired loans, on the acquisition date, was determined, primarily based on the fair value of loan collateral.  The carrying value of purchased loans acquired with deteriorated credit quality was   $329,000   at   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  On the acquisition date, the preliminary estimate of the unpaid principal balance for all loans evidencing credit impairment acquired in the Luzerne Bank acquisition was   $1,211,000   and the estimated fair value of the loans was   $878,000  . Total contractually required payments on these loans, including interest, at the acquisition date was   $1,783,000  . However, the Company s preliminary estimate of expected cash flows was   $941,000  .  At such date, the Company established a credit risk related non-accretable discount (a discount representing amounts which are not expected to be collected from either the customer or liquidation of collateral) of   $842,000   relating to these impaired loans, reflected in the recorded net fair value. Such amount is reflected as a non-accretable fair value adjustment to loans.  The Company further estimated the timing and amount of expected cash flows in excess of the estimated fair value and established an accretable discount of   $63,000   on the acquisition date relating to these impaired loans. 

The following table presents additional information regarding loans acquired in the Luzerne Bank transaction with specific evidence of deterioration in credit quality: 

There were no material increases or decreases in the expected cash flows of these loans between June 1, 2013 (the  acquisition date ) and   September 30, 2016  .  There has been   no   allowance for loan losses recorded for acquired loans with specific evidence of deterioration in credit quality as of   September 30, 2016  .  
    
  The following table presents interest income the Banks would have recorded if interest had been recorded based on the original loan agreement terms and rate of interest for non-accrual loans and interest income recognized on a cash basis for non-accrual loans for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  :

Impaired Loans 
    
  Impaired loans are loans for which it is probable the Banks will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement.  The Banks evaluate such loans for impairment individually and does not aggregate loans by major risk classifications.  The definition of  impaired loans  is not the same as the definition of  non-accrual loans,  although the two categories overlap.  The Banks may choose to place a loan on non-accrual status due to payment delinquency or uncertain collectability, while not classifying the loan as impaired.  Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status and collateral value.  The amount of impairment for these types of loans is determined by the difference between the present value of the expected cash flows related to the loan, using the original interest rate, and its recorded value, or as a practical expedient in the case of collateralized loans, the difference between the fair value of the collateral and the recorded amount of the loan.  When foreclosure is probable, impairment is measured based on the fair value of the collateral. 
    
  Management evaluates individual loans in all of the commercial segments for possible impairment if the loan is greater than   $100,000   and if the loan is either on non-accrual status or has a risk rating of substandard.  Management may also elect to measure an individual loan for impairment if less than   $100,000   on a case-by-case basis. 
    
  Mortgage loans on one-to-four family properties and all consumer loans are large groups of smaller-balance homogeneous loans and are measured for impairment collectively. Loans that experience insignificant payment delays, which are defined as   90   days or less, generally are not classified as impaired.  Management determines the significance of payment delays on a case-by-case basis taking into consideration all circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower including the length of the delay, the borrower s prior payment record, and the amount of shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed.  Interest income for impaired loans is recorded consistent with the Banks' policy on non-accrual loans.

  Troubled Debt Restructurings 
    
  The loan portfolio also includes certain loans that have been modified in a Troubled Debt Restructuring ( TDR ), where economic concessions have been granted to borrowers who have experienced or are expected to experience financial difficulties.  These concessions typically result from loss mitigation activities and could include reductions in the interest rate, payment extensions, forgiveness of principal, forbearance, or other actions.  Certain TDRs are classified as nonperforming at the time of restructure and may only be returned to performing status after considering the borrower s sustained repayment performance for a reasonable period, generally   six months  . 
    
  There were   two   loan modifications that were considered TDRs completed during the three months ended September 30, 2016. Loan modifications that are considered TDRs completed during the   three and nine   months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 and were as follows: 

There were   five   loan modifications considered to be TDRs made during the twelve months previous to   September 30, 2016   that defaulted during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .  The defaulted loan types and recorded investments at March 31, 2016 are as follows:   one   commercial loan with a recorded investment of   $103,000  ,   one   commercial real estate loan with a recorded investment of   $239,000  , and   three   residential real estate loan with a recorded investment of   $173,000  .  There was   one   loan modifications considered TDRs made during the twelve months previous to   September 30, 2015   that defaulted during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .  The loan that defaulted is a commercial real estate loans with a recorded investment of   $48,000   at   September 30, 2015  .   
    
  Troubled debt restructurings amounted to   $9,219,000   and   $9,647,000   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  The amount of foreclosed residential real estate held at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , totaled   $0   and   $102,000  , respectively.  Consumer mortgage loans secured by residential real estate properties for which formal foreclosure proceedings are in process at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , totaled   $872,000   and   $448,000  , respectively.

Internal Risk Ratings 
    
  Management uses a ten point internal risk rating system to monitor the credit quality of the overall loan portfolio. The first   six   categories are considered not criticized, and are aggregated as  Pass  rated. The criticized rating categories utilized by management generally follow bank regulatory definitions. The special mention category includes assets that are currently protected but are potentially weak, resulting in an undue and unwarranted credit risk, but not to the point of justifying a substandard classification. Loans in the substandard category have well-defined weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt, and have a distinct possibility that some loss will be sustained if the weaknesses are not corrected.  All loans greater than   90   days past due are evaluated for substandard classification.  Loans in the doubtful category exhibit the same weaknesses found in the substandard loans, however, the weaknesses are more pronounced.  Such loans are static and collection in full is improbable.  However, these loans are not yet rated as loss because certain events may occur which would salvage the debt.  Loans classified loss are considered uncollectible and charge-off is imminent. 
    
  To help ensure that risk ratings are accurate and reflect the present and future capacity of borrowers to repay a loan as agreed, the Banks have a structured loan rating process with several layers of internal and external oversight.  Generally, consumer and residential mortgage loans are included in the pass category unless a specific action, such as bankruptcy, repossession, or death occurs to raise awareness of a possible credit event.  An external annual loan review of large commercial relationships is performed, as well as a sample of smaller transactions.  Confirmation of the appropriate risk category is included in the review.  Detailed reviews, including plans for resolution, are performed on loans classified as substandard, doubtful, or loss on a quarterly basis. 
    
  The following table presents the credit quality categories identified above as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

Allowance for Loan Losses 
    
  An allowance for loan losses ( ALL ) is maintained to absorb losses from the loan portfolio.  The ALL is based on management s continuing evaluation of the risk characteristics and credit quality of the loan portfolio, assessment of current economic conditions, diversification and size of the portfolio, adequacy of collateral, past and anticipated future loss experience, and the amount of non-performing loans. 
    
  The Banks' methodology for determining the ALL is based on the requirements of ASC Section 310-10-35 for loans individually evaluated for impairment (previously discussed) and ASC Subtopic 450-20 for loans collectively evaluated for impairment, as well as the Interagency Policy Statements on the Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses and other bank regulatory guidance.  The total of the   two   components represents the Banks' ALL. 
    
  Loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment are analyzed with general allowances being made as appropriate.  Allowances are segmented based on collateral characteristics previously disclosed, and consistent with credit quality monitoring.  Loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment are grouped into   two   classes for evaluation.  A general allowance is determined for  Pass  rated credits, while a separate pool allowance is provided for  Criticized  rated credits that are not individually evaluated for impairment. 

20 

     Table of Contents  

For the general allowances, historical loss trends are used in the estimation of losses in the current portfolio.  These historical loss amounts are modified by other qualitative factors.  A historical charge-off factor is calculated utilizing a   twelve   quarter moving average.  However, management may adjust the moving average time frame by up to four quarters to adjust for variances in the economic cycle. Management has identified a number of additional qualitative factors which it uses to supplement the historical charge-off factor because these factors are likely to cause estimated credit losses associated with the existing loan pools to differ from historical loss experience.  The additional factors that are evaluated quarterly and updated using information obtained from internal, regulatory, and governmental sources are: national and local economic trends and conditions; levels of and trends in delinquency rates and non-accrual loans; trends in volumes and terms of loans; effects of changes in lending policies; experience, ability, and depth of lending staff; value of underlying collateral; and concentrations of credit from a loan type, industry and/or geographic standpoint. 
    
  Loans in the criticized pools, which possess certain qualities or characteristics that may lead to collection and loss issues, are closely monitored by management and subject to additional qualitative factors.  Management also monitors industry loss factors by loan segment for applicable adjustments to actual loss experience. 
    
  Management reviews the loan portfolio on a quarterly basis in order to make appropriate and timely adjustments to the ALL.  When information confirms all or part of specific loans to be uncollectible, these amounts are promptly charged off against the ALL.

  The following sets forth the components of the net periodic benefit/cost of the domestic non-contributory defined benefit plan for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively: 

Employer Contributions 
    
  The Company previously disclosed in its consolidated financial statements, included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , that it expected to contribute a minimum of   $500,000   to its defined benefit plan in   2016  .  As of   September 30, 2016  , there were contributions of   $500,000   made to the plan with additional contributions of at least   $250,000   anticipated during the remainder of   2016  . 

Note 8.  Employee Stock Purchase Plan 
    
  The Company maintains an Employee Stock Purchase Plan ( Plan ).  The Plan is intended to encourage employee participation in the ownership and economic progress of the Company.  The Plan allows for up to   1,000,000   shares to be purchased by employees.  The purchase price of the shares is   95%   of market value with an employee eligible to purchase up to the lesser of   15%   of base compensation or   $12,000   in market value annually.  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , there were   1,617   and   1,723   shares issued under the plan, respectively.

Note 9.  Off Balance Sheet Risk 
    
  The Company is a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers.  These financial instruments are primarily comprised of commitments to extend credit, standby letters of credit, and credit exposure from the sale of assets with recourse.  These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit, interest rate, or liquidity risk in excess of the amount recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.  The contract amounts of these instruments express the extent of involvement the Company has in particular classes of financial instruments. 
    
  The Company s exposure to credit loss from nonperformance by the other party to the financial instruments for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of these instruments.  The Company uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on-balance sheet instruments.  The Company may require collateral or other security to support financial instruments with off-balance sheet credit risk. 
    
  Financial instruments whose contract amounts represent credit risk are as follows at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

Commitments to extend credit are legally binding agreements to lend to customers.  Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of fees.  Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future liquidity requirements.  The Company evaluates each customer s credit worthiness on a case-by-case basis.  The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary by the Company, on an extension of credit is based on management s credit assessment of the counterparty. 
    
  Standby letters of credit represent conditional commitments issued by the Company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party.  These instruments are issued primarily to support bid or performance related contracts.  The coverage period for these instruments is typically a   one year   period with an annual renewal option subject to prior approval by management.  Fees earned from the issuance of these letters are recognized upon expiration of the coverage period.  For secured letters of credit, the collateral is typically Bank deposit instruments or customer business assets. 

Note 10.  Fair Value Measurements 
    
  The following disclosures show the hierarchal disclosure framework associated with the level of pricing observations utilized in measuring assets and liabilities at fair value. 
                   Level I: 
      
    Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reported date. 

Level II: 
      
    Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reported date. The nature of these assets and liabilities include items for which quoted prices are available but traded less frequently, and items that are fair valued using other financial instruments, the parameters of which can be directly observed. 

Level III: 
      
    Assets and liabilities that have little to no pricing observability as of the reported date. These items do not have two-way markets and are measured using management s best estimate of fair value, where the inputs into the determination of fair value require significant management judgment or estimation. 

This hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available. 
    
  The following table presents the assets reported on the balance sheet at their fair value on a recurring basis as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , by level within the fair value hierarchy. Financial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.

  The discounted cash flow valuation technique is utilized to determine the fair value of performing impaired loans, while non-performing impaired loans utilize the appraisal of collateral method.  
    
  The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of the Company s impaired loans using the discounted cash flow valuation technique include temporary changes in payment amounts and the probability of default.  Significant increases (decreases) in payment amounts would result in significantly higher (lower) fair value measurements.  
    
  The significant unobservable input used in the fair value measurement of the Company s impaired loans using the appraisal of collateral valuation technique include appraisal adjustments, which are adjustments to appraisals by management for qualitative factors such as economic conditions and estimated liquidation expenses.  The significant unobservable input used in the fair value measurement of the Company s other real estate owned are the same inputs used to value impaired loans using the appraisal of collateral valuation technique. 

Note 11. Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
    
  The Company is required to disclose fair values for its financial instruments.  Fair values are made at a specific point in time, based on relevant market information and information about the financial instrument.  These estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering for sale at one time the Company s entire holdings of a particular financial instrument.  Also, it is the Company s general practice and intention to hold most of its financial instruments to maturity and not to engage in trading or sales activities.  Because no market exists for a significant portion of the Company s financial instruments, fair value estimates are based on judgments regarding future expected loss experience, current economic conditions, risk characteristics of various financial instruments, and other factors.  These fair values are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision.  Changes in assumptions can significantly affect the fair values. 
    
  Fair values have been determined by the Company using historical data and an estimation methodology suitable for each category of financial instruments.  The Company s fair values, methods, and assumptions are set forth below for the Company s other financial instruments. 
    
  As certain assets and liabilities, such as deferred tax assets, premises and equipment, and many other operational elements of the Company, are not considered financial instruments but have value, this fair value of financial instruments would not represent the full market value of the Company. 

26 

     Table of Contents  

The fair values of the Company s financial instruments are as follows at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

Cash and Cash Equivalents, Loans Held for Sale, Accrued Interest Receivable, Short-term Borrowings, and Accrued Interest Payable: 
  The fair value is equal to the carrying value. 
    
  Investment Securities: 
  The fair value of investment securities available for sale and trading is equal to the available quoted market price. If no quoted market price is available, fair value is estimated using the quoted market price for similar securities.  Regulatory stocks  fair value is equal to the carrying value. 
    
  Loans: 
  Fair values are estimated for portfolios of loans with similar financial characteristics.  Loans are segregated by type such as commercial, financial, and agricultural, commercial real estate, residential real estate, construction real estate, and installment  
  
   27 

     Table of Contents  

loans to individuals.  Each loan category is further segmented into fixed and adjustable rate interest terms and by performing and nonperforming categories. 
    
  The fair value of performing loans is calculated by discounting scheduled cash flows through the estimated maturity using estimated market discount rates that reflect the credit and interest rate risk inherent in the loan.  The estimate of maturity is based on the Company s historical experience with repayments for each loan classification, modified, as required, by an estimate of the effect of current economic and lending conditions. 
    
  Fair value for significant nonperforming loans is based on recent external appraisals.  If appraisals are not available, estimated cash flows are discounted using a rate commensurate with the risk associated with the estimated cash flows.  Assumptions regarding credit risk, cash flows, and discounted rates are judgmentally determined using available market information and specific borrower information. 
    
  Bank-Owned Life Insurance: 
  The fair value is equal to the cash surrender value of the life insurance policies. 
    
  Deposits: 
  The fair value of deposits with no stated maturity, such as noninterest-bearing demand deposits, savings, NOW, and money market accounts, is equal to the amount payable on demand.  The fair value of certificates of deposit is based on the discounted value of contractual cash flows. 
    
  The fair value estimates above do not include the benefit that results from the low-cost funding provided by the deposit liabilities compared to the cost of borrowing funds in the market, commonly referred to as the core deposit intangible. 
    
  Long Term Borrowings: 
  The fair value of long term borrowings is based on the discounted value of contractual cash flows. 
    
  Commitments to Extend Credit, Standby Letters of Credit, and Financial Guarantees Written: 
  There is no material difference between the notional amount and the estimated fair value of off-balance sheet items.  The contractual amounts of unfunded commitments and letters of credit are presented in Note 9 (Off Balance Sheet Risk). 

Note 12.  Stock Options 
    
  In 2014, the Company adopted the 2014 Equity Incentive Plan designed to help the Company attract, retain, and motivate employees and non-employee directors.  Incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, and restricted stock may be granted as part of the plan.   
    
  On August 27, 2015, the Company issued   38,750   stock options to a group of employees.  Each option granted has a strike price of   $42.03   and is exercisable only after   five   years following the date of the grant of such options.  The options expire   ten   years following the date of the grant of such options. 
    
  A summary of stock option activity is presented below:

value of the vested portion of the award at that date. The Company determines the fair value of options granted using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The risk-free interest rate is based on the United States Treasury bond with a similar term to the expected life of the options at the grant date. Expected volatility was estimated based on the adjusted historic volatility of the Company s shares. The expected life was estimated to equal the contractual life of the options. The dividend yield rate was based upon recent historical dividends paid on shares.

  EARNINGS SUMMARY 
    
  Comparison of the Three and   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   and   2015    
    
  Summary Results 
    
  Net income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $3,059,000 compared to $3,364,000 for the same period of 2015 as after-tax securities gains decreased $153,000 (from a gain of $325,000 to a gain of $172,000). Basic and diluted earnings per share for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $0.65 and $0.71, respectively. Return on average assets and return on average equity were 0.91% and 8.69% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 1.04% and 9.89% for the corresponding period of 2015. Net income from core operations ( operating earnings ) decreased to $2,887,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $3,039,000 for the same period of 2015.  Operating earnings per share for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were $0.61 and $0.64, respectively. 
    
  The   nine months ended September 30, 2016   generated net income of   $9,529,000   compared to   $10,152,000   for the same period of   2015  .  Comparable results were impacted by a decrease in after-tax securities gains of $296,000 (from a gain of $1,106,000 to a gain of $810,000). Earnings per share, basic and dilutive, for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   were   $2.01   compared to   $2.12   for the comparable period of   2015  .  Return on average assets and return on average equity were   0.95%   and   9.14%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   1.06%   and   9.90%   for the corresponding period of   2015  .  Operating earnings decreased to   $8,719,000   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $9,046,000   for the same period of   2015  , as the 2015 period included non-recurring gains on the sale of other real estate owned of $175,000 the 2016 level.  The 2016 period also included expenses related to a data breach at a national restaurant chain that impacted our customer base.  In addition, the investment portfolio has declined $61,599,000 from   September 30, 2015   to   September 30, 2016   as part of our strategy to position the balance sheet for a rising rate environment.  Operating earnings per share for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   were   $1.84   basic and dilutive compared to   $1.89   basic and dilutive for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . 
    
  Management uses the non-GAAP measure of net income from core operations, or operating earnings, in its analysis of the Company s performance.  This measure, as used by the Company, adjusts net income by excluding significant gains or losses that are unusual in nature.  Because certain of these items and their impact on the Company s performance are difficult to predict, management believes the presentation of financial measures excluding the impact of such items provides useful supplemental information in evaluating the operating results of the Company s core businesses.  For purposes of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, net income from core operations, or operating earnings, means net income adjusted to exclude after-tax net securities gains or losses and bank-owned life insurance gains on death benefit.  These disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for net income determined in accordance with GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies.

Interest and Dividend Income 
    
  Interest and dividend income for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   increased to   $11,660,000   compared to   $11,523,000   for the same period of   2015  .  Loan portfolio income increased due to the impact of portfolio growth, primarily in home equity products.  The loan portfolio income increase was offset by a decrease in investment portfolio interest due to a decline in the average taxable equivalent yield of 47 bp as the duration in the investment portfolio continues to be shortened in order to reduce interest rate and market risk in the future.  This is being undertaken primarily through the sale of long-term municipal bonds that have a maturity date of 2025 or later and securities with a call date within the next five years.  To offset the revenue impact of the declining  asset yields, a focus has been placed on increasing earning assets by adding quality short and intermediate term loans such as home equity loans, even though these new earning assets are at lower yields than legacy assets. 
    
  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, interest and dividend income was $35,056,000, an increase of $607,000 over the same period of 2015.  Interest income on the loan portfolio increased as the growth in the portfolio was countered by a 2 bp decline in average yield.  The investment portfolio interest income decreased as the portfolio size was decreased in order to reduce interest rate and market risk, while the yield on the investment portfolio declined 39 bp. 
    
  Interest and dividend income composition for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was as follows:

Interest Expense 
    
  Interest expense for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   increased   $124,000   to   $1,413,000   compared to   $1,289,000   for the same period of   2015  .  The increase in interest expense is the result of growth within the deposit portfolio and the lengthening of the time deposit portfolio as part of a strategy to build balance sheet protection in a rising rate environment, offset by a decrease in short term borrowing utilization.  
    
  Interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased 6.80% from the same period of 2015.  The reasons noted for the increase in interest expense for the three month period comparison also apply to the nine month period. 
    
  Interest expense composition for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was as follows: 

Net Interest Margin 
    
  The net interest margin ( NIM ) for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   was   3.37%   compared to   3.55%   for the corresponding period of   2015  .  The decline in the net interest margin was driven by a decreasing yield on the investment portfolio due to the continued low rate environment.  The impact of the declining earning asset yield and decreasing investment portfolio balance was partially offset by 6.65% growth in the balance of the average loan portfolio from   September 30, 2015   to   September 30, 2016  .  The primary funding for the loan growth was an increase in core deposits.  These deposits represent a lower cost funding source than time deposits and comprise 79.60% of total deposits at   September 30, 2016   compared to 78.02% at   September 30, 2015  .  Limiting the positive impact on the net interest margin caused by the growth in core deposits was the lengthening of the time deposit portfolio coupled with additional FHLB long-term borrowings as part of our strategy to prepare the balance sheet for a rising rate environment. 
    
  The NIM for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was 3.45% compared to 3.63% for the same period of 2015.  The impact of the items mentioned in the three month discussion also applies to the nine months ended.

Provision for Loan Losses 
    
  The provision for loan losses is based upon management s quarterly review of the loan portfolio.  The purpose of the review is to assess loan quality, identify impaired loans, analyze delinquencies, ascertain loan growth, evaluate potential charge-offs and recoveries, and assess general economic conditions in the markets served.  An external independent loan review is also performed annually for the Banks.  Management remains committed to an aggressive program of problem loan identification and resolution. 
    
  The allowance for loan losses is determined by applying loss factors to outstanding loans by type, excluding loans for which a specific allowance has been determined.  Loss factors are based on management s consideration of the nature of the portfolio segments, changes in mix and volume of the loan portfolio, and historical loan loss experience.  In addition, management considers industry standards and trends with respect to non-performing loans and its knowledge and experience with specific lending segments. 
    
  Although management believes it uses the best information available to make such determinations and that the allowance for loan losses is adequate at   September 30, 2016  , future adjustments could be necessary if circumstances or economic conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the initial determinations.  A downturn in the local economy, increased unemployment, and delays in receiving financial information from borrowers could result in increased levels of nonperforming assets, charge-offs, loan loss provisions, and reductions in income.  Additionally, as an integral part of the examination process, bank regulatory agencies periodically review the Banks' loan loss allowance.  The banking agencies could require the recognition of additions to the loan loss allowance based on their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examination. 
    
  When determining the appropriate allowance level, management has attributed the allowance for loan losses to various portfolio segments; however, the allowance is available for the entire portfolio as needed. 
    
  The allowance for loan losses increased from   $12,044,000   at   December 31, 2015   to   $12,718,000   at   September 30, 2016  .  The increase in the allowance for loan losses was driven by growth in the loan portfolio and an increase in total nonperforming loans. Limiting the increase in the allowance for loan losses was minimal net charge-offs during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   of   $192,000  .  The majority of the loans charged-off had a specific allowance within the allowance for losses.  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the allowance for loan losses to total loans was   1.19%   and   1.15%  , respectively.

     Table of Contents  

The provision for loan losses totaled   $258,000   and   $520,000   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   and $866,000 and $1,820,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  The amount of the provision for loan losses was primarily the result of loan growth and an increase in non-performing loans offset by minimal net charge-offs.   
    
  Nonperforming loans increasing to   $11,530,000   at   September 30, 2016   from   $8,608,000   at   September 30, 2015   is primarily the result of a large commercial real estate loan that was placed on non-accrual status.  The ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans was   1.08%   and 0.86% at   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and the ratio of the allowance for loan losses to nonperforming loans was   110.30%   and 133.47% at   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  Internal loan review and analysis coupled with loan growth dictated a provision for loan losses of   $866,000   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .    
    
  The following is a table showing total nonperforming loans as of: 

Non-interest Income 
    
  Total non-interest income for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015   decreased   $55,000   to   $3,082,000  .  Excluding net securities gains, non-interest income for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   increased   $177,000   compared to the same period in   2015  .  The increase in gain on sale of loans was driven by a shift in distribution channels and the hiring of additional mortgage loan officers over the past year.  The increase in other non-interest income is primarily the result of increased debit card income. 
    
  Total non-interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 decreased $197,000.  Excluding net securities gains, non-interest income increased $251,000 compared the 2015 period.  The increase in other non-interest income is primarily the result of an increase in debit card income offset by a decrease in non-recurring gains on the sale of other real estate owned of $175,000 from 2015 to 2016. 
    
  Non-interest income composition for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was as follows:

Non-interest Expense 
    
  Total non-interest expense increased   $209,000   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the same period of   2015  .  The increase in salaries and employee benefits is primarily attributable to increases in health insurance.  Amortization of investment in limited partnerships decreased as several of the partnerships have reached the end of their tax credit generating life and have been fully amortized.  Other expenses increased primarily due to increased expenses related to the debit card EMV (chip embedded card) conversion, data breach at a national restaurant chain that impacted our customer base, and system upgrades. 
    
  Total non-interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 increased $1,046,000.  The reasons noted for the three month period comparison also apply to the nine month period.

Provision for Income Taxes 
    
  Income taxes increased $316,000 and   $677,000   for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the same periods of   2015  .  The primary cause of the increase in tax expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to   2015   is the impact of a reduction of tax-exempt interest income within the investment portfolio as the portfolio was strategically reduced.  Excluding the impact of the net securities gains, the effective tax rate for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was 29.08% and   24.89%   compared to 20.62% and 18.55% for the same period of   2015  .  The Company currently is in a deferred tax asset position due to the low income housing tax credits earned both currently and previously.  Management has reviewed the deferred tax asset and has determined that the asset will be utilized within the appropriate carry forward period and therefore does not require a valuation allowance.

  Cash and Cash Equivalents 
    
  Cash and cash equivalents increased   $37,385,000   from   $22,796,000   at   December 31, 2015   to   $60,181,000   at   September 30, 2016   primarily as a result of the following activities during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  : 
    
  Loans Held for Sale 
    
  Activity regarding loans held for sale resulted in sales proceeds trailing loan originations, less $1,691,000 in realized gains, by $  1,403,000   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Loans 
    
  Gross loans increased   $24,273,000   since   December 31, 2015   due primarily to an increase in residential real estate mortgage loans driven by successful home equity loan and line of credit gathering efforts.

The following table shows the amount of accrual and non-accrual TDRs at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

Investments 
    
  The fair value of the investment securities portfolio at   September 30, 2016   decreased   $35,173,000   since   December 31, 2015   while the amortized cost of the portfolio decreased $  37,043,000  .  The decrease in value is the result of the investment portfolio being actively managed in order to reduce interest rate and market risk.  This is being undertaken primarily through the sale of long-term municipal bonds that have a maturity date of 2025 or later and securities with a call date within the next five years.  The proceeds of the bond sales are being deployed into loans and intermediate term corporate bonds and short and intermediate term municipal bonds.  The strategy to sell a portion of the long-term bond portfolio does negatively impact current earnings, but this action plays a key role in our long-term asset liability management strategy as the balance sheet is shortened to better prepare for a rising rate environment. The unrealized losses within the debt securities portfolio are the result of market activity, not credit issues/ratings, as approximately 87% of the debt securities portfolio on an amortized cost basis is currently rated A or higher by either S P or Moody s. 
    
  The Company considers various factors, which include examples from applicable accounting guidance, when analyzing the available for sale portfolio for possible other than temporary impairment.  The Company primarily considers the following factors in its analysis: length of time and severity of the fair value being less than carrying value; reduction of dividend paid (equities); continued payment of dividend/interest, credit rating, and financial condition of an issuer; intent and ability to hold until anticipated recovery (which may be maturity); and general outlook for the economy, specific industry, and entity in question. 
    
  The bond portion of the portfolio review is conducted with emphases on several factors.  Continued payment of principal and interest is given primary importance with credit rating and financial condition of the issuer following as the next most important.  Credit ratings were reviewed with the ratings of the bonds being satisfactory.  Bonds that were not currently rated were discussed with a third party and/or underwent an internal financial review.  The Company also monitors whether each of the investments incurred a decline in fair value from carrying value of at least 20% for twelve consecutive months or a similar decline of at least 50% for three consecutive months.  Each bond is reviewed to determine whether it is a general obligation bond, which is backed by the credit and taxing power of the issuing jurisdiction, or revenue bond, which is only payable from specified revenues.  Based on the review undertaken by the Company, the Company determined that the decline in value of the various bond holdings were temporary and were the result of the general market downturns and interest rate/yield curve changes, not credit issues.  The fact that almost all of such bonds are general obligation bonds further solidified the Company s determination that the decline in the value of these bond holdings is temporary.

The fair value of the equity portfolio continues to fluctuate as the economic turbulence continues to impact stock pricing.  The amortized cost of the available for sale equity securities portfolio has decreased $  4,022,000   to   $11,589,000   at   September 30, 2016   from   $15,611,000   at   December 31, 2015   while the fair value decreased   $3,927,000   over the same time period. 
    
  The equity portion of the portfolio is reviewed for possible other than temporary impairment in a similar manner to the bond portfolio with greater emphasis placed on the length of time the fair value has been less than the carrying value and financial sector outlook.  The Company also reviews dividend payment activities.  The starting point for the equity analysis is the length and severity of a market price decline.  The Company monitors two primary measures: 20% decline in fair value from carrying value for twelve consecutive months and 50% decline for three consecutive months. 
    
  The distribution of credit ratings by amortized cost and fair values for the debt security portfolio at   September 30, 2016   follows: 

Financing Activities 
    
  Deposits 
    
  Total deposits increased   $56,417,000   from   December 31, 2015   to   September 30, 2016  .  The growth was led by an increase in money market deposit accounts from   December 31, 2015   to   September 30, 2016   of 16.38%.  The increase in core deposits (deposits less time deposits) has provided relationship driven funding for the loan and investment portfolios.  The increase in deposits is the result of our focus on building relationships, not by offering market leading rates.   
    
  Deposit balances and their changes for the periods being discussed follow: 

Borrowed Funds 
    
  Total borrowed funds decreased   25.47%   or   $35,059,000   to   $102,604,000   at   September 30, 2016   compared to   $137,663,000   at   December 31, 2015  .  Short-term borrowings primarily decreased due to growth in deposits and a reduction in the size of the investment portfolio.

Capital 
    
  The adequacy of the Company s capital is reviewed on an ongoing basis with reference to the size, composition, and quality of the Company s resources and regulatory guidelines.  Management seeks to maintain a level of capital sufficient to support existing assets and anticipated asset growth, maintain favorable access to capital markets, and preserve high quality credit ratings. 
    
  Bank holding companies are required to comply with the Federal Reserve Board s risk-based capital guidelines.  The risk-based capital rules are designed to make regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profiles among banks and bank holding companies and to minimize disincentives for holding liquid assets.  Specifically, each is required to maintain certain minimum dollar amounts and ratios of common equity tier I risk-based, tier I risk-based, total risk-based, and tier I leverage capital.  In addition to the capital requirements, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvements Act (FDICIA) established five capital categories ranging from  well capitalized  to  critically undercapitalized.  To be classified as  well capitalized , common equity tier I risk-based, tier I risked-based, total risk-based, and tier I leverage capital ratios must be at least 6.5%, 8%, 10%, and 5%, respectively. 
    
  The Company's capital ratios as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   were as follows:

minimum capital requirements, add a new common equity tier 1 capital requirement, and establish criteria that instruments must meet to be considered common equity tier 1 capital, additional tier 1 capital or tier 2 capital.  The new minimum capital to risk-adjusted assets requirements are a common equity tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5% (6.5% to be considered  well capitalized ) and a tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0%, increased from 4.0% (and increased from 6.0% to 8.0% to be considered  well capitalized  the total capital ratio remains at 8.0% under the new rules (10.0% to be considered  well capitalized ).  Under the new rules, in order to avoid limitations on capital distributions (including dividend payments and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers), a banking organization must hold a capital conservation buffer comprised of common equity tier 1 capital above its minimum risk-based capital requirements in an amount greater than 2.5% of total risk-weighted assets.  The new minimum capital requirements were effective beginning on January 1, 2015.  The capital contribution buffer requirements phase in over a three-year period beginning January 1, 2016.  The Company and the Banks will continue to analyze these new rules and their effects on the business, operations and capital levels of the Company and the Banks. 
    
  Liquidity; Interest Rate Sensitivity and Market Risk 
    
  The asset/liability committee addresses the liquidity needs of the Company to ensure that sufficient funds are available to meet credit demands and deposit withdrawals as well as to the placement of available funds in the investment portfolio.  In assessing liquidity requirements, equal consideration is given to the current position as well as the future outlook. 
    
  The following liquidity measures are monitored for compliance and were within the limits cited at   September 30, 2016  : 
    
  1.                Net Loans to Total Assets, 85% maximum 
  2.                  Net Loans to Total Deposits, 100% maximum 
  3.                  Cumulative 90 day Maturity GAP %, +/- 20% maximum 
  4.                  Cumulative 1 Year Maturity GAP %, +/- 25% maximum 
    
  Fundamental objectives of the Company s asset/liability management process are to maintain adequate liquidity while minimizing interest rate risk.  The maintenance of adequate liquidity provides the Company with the ability to meet its financial obligations to depositors, loan customers, and shareholders.  Additionally, it provides funds for normal operating expenditures and business opportunities as they arise.  The objective of interest rate sensitivity management is to increase net interest income by managing interest sensitive assets and liabilities in such a way that they can be repriced in response to changes in market interest rates. 
    
  The Banks, like other financial institutions, must have sufficient funds available to meet liquidity needs for deposit withdrawals, loan commitments and originations, and expenses.  In order to control cash flow, the Banks estimate future cash flows from deposits, loan payments, and investment security payments.  The primary sources of funds are deposits, principal and interest payments on loans and investment securities, FHLB borrowings, and brokered deposits.  Management believes the Banks have adequate resources to meet their normal funding requirements. 
    
  Management monitors the Company s liquidity on both a long and short-term basis, thereby providing management necessary information to react to current balance sheet trends.  Cash flow needs are assessed and sources of funds are determined.  Funding strategies consider both customer needs and economical cost.  Both short and long-term funding needs are addressed by maturities and sales of available for sale and trading investment securities, loan repayments and maturities, and liquidating money market investments such as federal funds sold.  The use of these resources, in conjunction with access to credit provides core funding to satisfy depositor, borrower, and creditor needs. 
    
  Management monitors and determines the desirable level of liquidity.  Consideration is given to loan demand, investment opportunities, deposit pricing and growth potential, as well as the current cost of borrowing funds.  The Company has a total current maximum borrowing capacity at the FHLB of   $530,001,000  .  In addition to this credit arrangement, the Company has additional lines of credit with correspondent banks of   $45,366,000  .  Management believes it has sufficient liquidity to satisfy estimated short-term and long-term funding needs.  FHLB borrowings totaled   $90,625,000   as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Interest rate sensitivity, which is closely related to liquidity management, is a function of the repricing characteristics of the Company s portfolio of assets and liabilities.  Asset/liability management strives to match maturities and rates between loan and investment security assets with the deposit liabilities and borrowings that fund them.  Successful asset/liability management results in a balance sheet structure which can cope effectively with market rate fluctuations. The matching process by segments both assets and liabilities into future time periods (usually 12 months, or less) based upon when repricing can be effected.  Repriceable assets are subtracted from repriceable liabilities, for a specific time period to determine the  gap , or difference. Once known, the gap is managed based on predictions about future market interest rates.  Intentional mismatching, or gapping, can enhance net interest income if market rates move as predicted.  However, if market rates behave in a manner contrary to predictions, net interest income will suffer.  Gaps, therefore, contain an element of risk and must be prudently managed.  In addition to gap management,

the Company has an asset/liability management policy which incorporates a market value at risk calculation which is used to determine the effects of interest rate movements on shareholders  equity and a simulation analysis to monitor the effects of interest rate changes on the Company s balance sheet. 
    
  The Company currently maintains a GAP position of being asset sensitive.  The Company has strategically taken this position as it has decreased the duration of the earning asset portfolio by adding quality short and intermediate term loans such as home equity loans and the selling of long-term municipal bonds.  Lengthening of the liability portfolio is being undertaken to build protection in a rising rate environment. 
    
  A market value at risk calculation is utilized to monitor the effects of interest rate changes on the Company s balance sheet and more specifically shareholders  equity.  The Company does not manage the balance sheet structure in order to maintain compliance with this calculation.  The calculation serves as a guideline with greater emphases placed on interest rate sensitivity.  Changes to calculation results from period to period are reviewed as changes in results could be a signal of future events.  As of the most recent analysis, the results of the market value at risk calculation were within established guidelines due to the strategic direction being taken. 

Interest Rate Sensitivity 
    
  In this analysis the Company examines the result of a 100, 200, 300, and 400 basis point change in market interest rates and the effect on net interest income.  It is assumed that the change is instantaneous and that all rates move in a parallel manner.  Assumptions are also made concerning prepayment speeds on mortgage loans and mortgage securities. 
    
  The following is a rate shock forecast for the twelve month period ending   September 30,     2017   assuming a static balance sheet as of   September 30, 2016  . 

The model utilized to create the report presented above makes various estimates at each level of interest rate change regarding cash flow from principal repayment on loans and mortgage-backed securities and/or call activity on investment securities.  Actual results could differ significantly from these estimates which would result in significant differences in the calculated projected change.  In addition, the limits stated above do not necessarily represent the level of change under which management would undertake specific measures to realign its portfolio in order to reduce the projected level of change.  Generally, management believes the Company is well positioned to respond expeditiously when the market interest rate outlook changes. 
    
  Inflation 
    
  The asset and liability structure of a financial institution is primarily monetary in nature.  Therefore, interest rates rather than inflation have a more significant impact on the Company s performance.  Interest rates are not always affected in the same direction or magnitude as prices of other goods and services, but are reflective of fiscal policy initiatives or economic factors which are not measured by a price index. 

Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
    
  Market risk for the Company is comprised primarily of interest rate risk exposure and liquidity risk.  Interest rate risk and liquidity risk management is performed at both the level of the Company and the Banks.  The Company s interest rate sensitivity is monitored by management through selected interest rate risk measures produced by an independent third party.  There have been no substantial changes in the Company s gap analysis or simulation analysis compared to the information provided in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended   December 31, 2015  .  Additional information and details are provided in the  Liquidity, Interest Rate Sensitivity, and Market Risk  section of  Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  
    
  Generally, management believes the Company is well positioned to respond in a timely manner when the market interest rate outlook changes.
