  Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) 

Note 1  . Organization and Operations 
  Two Harbors Investment Corp., or the Company, is a Maryland corporation focused on investing in, financing and managing residential mortgage-backed securities, or RMBS, residential mortgage loans, mortgage servicing rights, or MSR, commercial real estate and other financial assets. The Company is externally managed and advised by PRCM Advisers LLC, or PRCM Advisers, which is a subsidiary of Pine River Capital Management L.P., or Pine River, a global multi-strategy asset management firm. The Company s common stock is listed on the NYSE under the symbol  TWO . 
  The Company was incorporated on May 21, 2009, and commenced operations as a publicly traded company on October 28, 2009, upon completion of a merger with Capitol Acquisition Corp., or Capitol, which became a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of the Company as a result of the merger. 
  The Company has elected to be treated as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, as defined under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As long as the Company continues to comply with a number of requirements under federal tax law and maintains its qualification as a REIT, the Company generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes to the extent that the Company distributes its taxable income to its stockholders on an annual basis and does not engage in prohibited transactions. However, certain activities that the Company may perform may cause it to earn income which will not be qualifying income for REIT purposes. The Company has designated certain of its subsidiaries as taxable REIT subsidiaries, or TRSs, as defined in the Code, to engage in such activities, and the Company may in the future form additional TRSs. 

Note 2  . Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies 
  Consolidation and Basis of Presentation 
  The interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC. Certain information and note disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP, have been condensed or omitted according to such SEC rules and regulations. However, management believes that the disclosures included in these interim condensed consolidated financial statements are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . In the opinion of management, all normal and recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly the financial condition of the Company at   September 30, 2016   and results of operations for all periods presented have been made. The results of operations for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   should not be construed as indicative of the results to be expected for future periods or the full year. 
  The condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared on the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make a number of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates include estimates of fair value of certain assets and liabilities, amount and timing of credit losses, prepayment rates, the period of time during which the Company anticipates an increase in the fair values of real estate securities sufficient to recover unrealized losses in those securities, and other estimates that affect the reported amounts of certain assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of certain revenues and expenses during the reported period. It is likely that changes in these estimates (  e.g.  , valuation changes due to supply and demand, credit performance, prepayments, interest rates, or other reasons) will occur in the near term. The Company s estimates are inherently subjective in nature and actual results could differ from its estimates and the differences may be material. 
  The condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company include the accounts of all subsidiaries; inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. The Company s Chief Investment Officer manages the investment portfolio as a whole and resources are allocated and financial performance is assessed on a consolidated basis. 
   All trust entities in which the Company holds investments that are considered VIEs for financial reporting purposes were reviewed for consolidation under the applicable consolidation guidance. Whenever the Company has both the power to direct the activities of a trust that most significantly impact the entity s performance, and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the entity that could be significant, the Company consolidates the trust.

Significant Accounting Policies 
  Included in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company s   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K is a summary of the Company s significant accounting policies. Provided below is a summary of additional accounting policies that are significant to the Company s consolidated financial condition and results of operations for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . 
  Revolving Credit Facilities 
  To finance MSR, the Company enters into revolving credit facilities collateralized by pledged MSR. Borrowings under these revolving credit facilities are generally short-term debt, which expire within one year. The Company s revolving credit facilities generally bear interest rates of a specified margin over one-month LIBOR and are uncommitted. Borrowings under revolving credit facilities are treated as collateralized financing transactions and are carried at contractual amounts, as specified in the respective agreements. 
  Offsetting Assets and Liabilities 
  Certain of the Company s repurchase agreements are governed by underlying agreements that provide for a right of setoff in the event of default of either party to the agreement. The Company also has netting arrangements in place with all derivative counterparties pursuant to standard documentation developed by the International Swap and Derivatives Association, or ISDA, or central clearing exchange agreements, in the case of centrally cleared interest rate swaps. Additionally, the Company and the counterparty or clearing agency are required to post cash collateral based upon the net underlying market value of the Company s open positions with the counterparty. 
  Under U.S. GAAP, if the Company has a valid right of setoff, it may offset the related asset and liability and report the net amount. The Company presents repurchase agreements subject to master netting arrangements or similar agreements on a gross basis, and derivative assets and liabilities subject to such arrangements on a net basis, based on derivative type and counterparty, in its condensed consolidated balance sheets. Separately, the Company presents cash collateral subject to such arrangements on a net basis, based on counterparty, in its condensed consolidated balance sheets. However, the Company does not offset financial assets and liabilities with the associated cash collateral on its condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
  The following tables present information about the Company s assets and liabilities that are subject to master netting arrangements or similar agreements and can potentially be offset on the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheets as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  :

    Amounts presented are limited in total to the net amount of assets or liabilities presented in the condensed consolidated balance sheets by instrument. Excess cash collateral or financial assets that are pledged to counterparties may exceed the financial liabilities subject to a master netting arrangement or similar agreement, or counterparties may have pledged excess cash collateral to the Company that exceed the corresponding financial assets. These excess amounts are excluded from the table above, although separately reported within restricted cash, due from counterparties, or due to counterparties in the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
       
  Recently Issued and/or Adopted Accounting Standards 
  Revenue from Contracts with Customers 
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued ASU No. 2014-09, which is a comprehensive revenue recognition standard that supersedes virtually all existing revenue guidance under U.S. GAAP. The standard s core principle is that an entity will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services. As a result of the issuance of ASU No. 2015-14 in August 2015 deferring the effective date of ASU No. 2014-09 by one year, the ASU is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning on or after December 15, 2017, with early adoption prohibited. The Company has determined this ASU will not have a material impact on the Company s financial condition or results of operations. 
  Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern 
  In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, which   requires management to evaluate whether there are conditions and events that raise substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern for both annual and interim reporting periods  . The update requires certain disclosures if management concludes that substantial doubt exists and plans to alleviate that doubt. The ASU is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and for both annual and interim periods thereafter, with early adoption permitted. 
  Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities 
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, which changes how entities measure certain equity investments and present changes in the fair value of financial liabilities measured under the fair value option that are attributable to their own credit. The ASU requires certain recurring disclosures and is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning on or after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The Company has determined this ASU will not have a material impact on the Company s financial condition or results of operations.

Lease Classification and Accounting 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, which requires lessees to recognize on their balance sheets both a lease liability for the obligation to make lease payments and a right-of-use asset for the right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. The ASU is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning on or after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company has determined this ASU will not have a material impact on the Company s financial condition or results of operations. 
  Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments 
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, which changes the impairment model for most financial assets and certain other instruments. Allowances for credit losses on AFS debt securities will be recognized, rather than direct reductions in the amortized cost of the investments. The new model also requires the estimation of lifetime expected credit losses and corresponding recognition of allowance for losses on trade and other receivables, held-to-maturity debt securities, loans, and other instruments held at amortized cost. The ASU requires certain recurring disclosures and is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning on or after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning on or after December 15, 2018. The Company is evaluating the adoption of this ASU. 
  Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, which clarifies how entities should classify certain cash receipts and cash payments and how the predominance principle should be applied on the statement of cash flows. The ASU is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning on or after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The Company has determined this ASU will not have an impact on the Company s financial condition or results of operations but may impact the presentation of the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows. 

Note 3  . Variable Interest Entities 
  The Company purchases subordinated debt and excess servicing rights from securitization trusts sponsored by either third parties or the Company s subsidiaries. Additionally, the Company is the sole certificate holder of a trust entity that holds a commercial real estate loan. All of these trusts are considered VIEs for financial reporting purposes and, thus, were reviewed for consolidation under the applicable consolidation guidance. Because the Company has both the power to direct the activities of the trusts that most significantly impact the entities  performance, and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the entities that could be significant, the Company consolidates the trusts. As the Company is required to reassess VIE consolidation guidance each quarter, new facts and circumstances may change the Company s determination. A change in the Company s determination could result in a material impact to the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements during subsequent reporting periods. 
  The following table presents a summary of the assets and liabilities of all consolidated trusts as reported on the condensed consolidated balance sheets as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  :

  Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) 

The Company is not required to consolidate VIEs for which it has concluded it does not have both the power to direct the activities of the VIEs that most significantly impact the entities  performance, and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the entities that could be significant. The Company s investments in these unconsolidated VIEs include non-Agency RMBS, which are classified within available-for-sale securities, at fair value on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the carrying value, which also represents the maximum exposure to loss, of all non-Agency RMBS in unconsolidated VIEs was   $1.8 billion   and   $1.9 billion  , respectively. 

Note 4  . Available-for-Sale Securities, at Fair Value 
  The Company holds AFS investment securities which are carried at fair value on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. AFS securities exclude the retained interests from the Company s on-balance sheet securitizations, as they are eliminated in consolidation in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The following table presents the Company s AFS investment securities by collateral type as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company pledged AFS securities with a carrying value of   $14.3 billion   and   $7.8 billion  , respectively, as collateral for repurchase agreements and advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines, or the FHLB. See   Note 15   -   Repurchase Agreements   and   Note 17   -   Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines Advances  . 
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company did not have any securities purchased from and financed with the same counterparty that did not meet the conditions of ASC 860,   Transfers and Servicing  , or ASC 860, to be considered linked transactions and, therefore, classified as derivatives. 
  The following tables present the amortized cost and carrying value (which approximates fair value) of AFS securities by collateral type as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  :

The following tables present the carrying value of the Company s AFS securities by rate type as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

The following table presents the Company s AFS securities according to their estimated weighted average life classifications as of   September 30, 2016  : 

When the Company purchases a credit-sensitive AFS security at a significant discount to its face value, the Company often does not amortize into income a significant portion of this discount that the Company is entitled to earn because the Company does not expect to collect the entire discount due to the inherent credit risk of the security. The Company may also record an other-than-temporary impairment, or OTTI, for a portion of its investment in the security to the extent the Company believes that the amortized cost will exceed the present value of expected future cash flows. The amount of principal that the Company does not amortize into income is designated as a credit reserve on the security, with unamortized net discounts or premiums amortized into income over time to the extent realizable.

The following table presents the changes for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , of the unamortized net discount and designated credit reserves on non-Agency AFS securities. 

The following table presents the components comprising the carrying value of AFS securities not deemed to be other than temporarily impaired by length of time that the securities had an unrealized loss position as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . At   September 30, 2016  , the Company held   1,220   AFS securities, of which   80   were in an unrealized loss position for less than twelve consecutive months and   124   were in an unrealized loss position for more than twelve consecutive months. At   December 31, 2015  , the Company held   1,181   AFS securities, of which   121   were in an unrealized loss position for less than twelve consecutive months and   182   were in an unrealized loss position for more than twelve consecutive months. 

Evaluating AFS Securities for Other-Than-Temporary Impairments 
  In evaluating AFS securities for OTTI, the Company determines whether there has been a significant adverse quarterly change in the cash flow expectations for a security. The Company compares the amortized cost of each security in an unrealized loss position against the present value of expected future cash flows of the security. The Company also considers whether there has been a significant adverse change in the regulatory and/or economic environment as part of this analysis. If the amortized cost of the security is greater than the present value of expected future cash flows using the original yield as the discount rate, an other-than-temporary credit impairment has occurred. If the Company does not intend to sell and will not be more likely than not required to sell the security, the credit loss is recognized in earnings and the balance of the unrealized loss is recognized in either   other comprehensive income (loss)  , net of tax, or   gain on investment securities  , depending on the accounting treatment. If the Company intends to sell the security or will be more likely than not required to sell the security, the full unrealized loss is recognized in earnings.

The Company recorded   $1.0 million   and   $1.8 million   in other-than-temporary credit impairments during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   on one and   four   non-Agency RMBS, respectively, where the future expected cash flows for each security were less than its amortized cost. As of   September 30, 2016  , impaired securities with a carrying value of   $124.0 million   had actual weighted average cumulative losses of   12.0%  , weighted average three-month prepayment speed of   6.8%  , weighted average 60+ day delinquency of   22.9%   of the pool balance, and weighted average FICO score of   666  . At   September 30, 2016  , the Company did not intend to sell the securities and determined that it was not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell the securities; therefore, only the projected credit loss was recognized in earnings. During the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , the Company recorded   $0.2 million   and   $0.5 million   in other-than-temporary credit impairments on   two   non-Agency RMBS where the future expected cash flows for the security were less than its amortized cost. 
  The following table presents the changes in OTTI included in earnings for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

Cumulative credit losses related to OTTI may be reduced for securities sold as well as for securities that mature, are paid down, or are prepaid such that the outstanding principal balance is reduced to zero. Additionally, increases in cash flows expected to be collected over the remaining life of the security cause a reduction in the cumulative credit loss. 
  Gross Realized Gains and Losses 
  Gains and losses from the sale of AFS securities are recorded as realized gains (losses) within   gain on investment securities   in the Company s   condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss)  . For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company sold AFS securities for   $2.8 billion   and   $6.6 billion   with an amortized cost of   $2.8 billion   and   $6.5 billion   for net realized gains of   $31.8 million   and   $63.3 million  , respectively. For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , the Company sold AFS securities for   $1.1 billion   and   $3.7 billion   with an amortized cost of   $1.0 billion   and   $3.4 billion   for net realized gains of   $66.5 million   and   $259.8 million  , respectively.

At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company pledged commercial real estate assets with a carrying value of   $997.2 million   and   $361.1 million  , respectively, as collateral for repurchase agreements and FHLB advances. See   Note 15   -   Repurchase Agreements   and   Note 17   -   Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines Advances  . 
  The following table summarizes activity related to commercial real estate assets for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 

The Company evaluates each loan for impairment at least quarterly by assessing the risk factors of each loan and assigning a risk rating based on a variety of factors. Risk factors include property type, geographic and local market dynamics, physical condition, leasing and tenant profile, projected cash flow, loan structure and exit plan, loan-to-value ratio, project sponsorship, and other factors deemed necessary. Risk ratings are defined as follows: 
    
           1   
    Lower Risk 
              2   
    Average Risk 
              3   
    Acceptable Risk 
              4   
    Higher Risk: A loan that has exhibited material deterioration in cash flows and/or other credit factors, which, if negative trends continue, could be indicative of future loss. 
              5   
    Impaired/Loss Likely: A loan that has a significantly increased probability of default or principal loss. 
       
  The following table presents the number of loans, unpaid principal balance and carrying value (amortized cost) by risk rating for commercial real estate assets as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

The Company has not recorded any allowances for losses as no loans are past-due and it is not deemed probable that the Company will not be able to collect all amounts due pursuant to the contractual terms of the loans.

Note 8  . Servicing Activities 
  Mortgage Servicing Rights, at Fair Value 
  One of the Company s wholly owned subsidiaries has approvals from Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae to own and manage MSR, which represent the right to control the servicing of mortgage loans. The Company and its subsidiaries do not originate or directly service mortgage loans, and instead contract with fully licensed subservicers to handle substantially all servicing functions for the loans underlying the Company s MSR. The following table summarizes activity related to MSR for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 

____________________ 
           (1) 
    Other changes in fair value primarily represents changes due to the realization of expected cash flows. 
              (2) 
    Other changes includes purchase price adjustments, contractual prepayment protection, and changes due to the Company s purchase of the underlying collateral. 
       
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company pledged MSR with a carrying value of   $73.5 million   as collateral for revolving credit facilities. See   Note 18   -   Revolving Credit Facilities  . The Company did not have any revolving credit facilities in place, and, thus, had not pledged any MSR as collateral, at   December 31, 2015  . 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the key economic assumptions and sensitivity of the fair value of MSR to immediate 10% and 20% adverse changes in these assumptions were as follows: 

19 

     Table of Contents  
    
  TWO HARBORS INVESTMENT CORP. 
  Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) 

These assumptions and sensitivities are hypothetical and should be considered with caution. Changes in fair value based on 10% and 20% variations in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in assumptions to the change in fair value may not be linear. Also, the effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of MSR is calculated without changing any other assumptions. In reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in another (  e.g.  , increased market interest rates may result in lower prepayments and increased credit losses) that could magnify or counteract the sensitivities. Further, these sensitivities show only the change in the asset balances and do not show any expected change in the fair value of the instruments used to manage the interest rates and prepayment risks associated with these assets. 
  Risk Mitigation Activities 
  The primary risk associated with the Company s MSR is interest rate risk and the resulting impact on prepayments. A significant decline in interest rates could lead to higher-than-expected prepayments that could reduce the value of the MSR. The Company economically hedges the impact of these risks with AFS securities and derivative financial instruments. Refer to   Note 11   -   Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities   for additional information regarding the derivative financial instruments used to economically hedge MSR. 
  Mortgage Servicing Income 
  The following table presents the components of servicing income recorded on the Company s   condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss)   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

Mortgage Servicing Advances 
  In connection with the servicing of loans, the Company s subservicers make certain payments for property taxes and insurance premiums, default and property maintenance payments, as well as advances of principal and interest payments before collecting them from individual borrowers. Servicing advances, including contractual interest, are priority cash flows in the event of a loan principal reduction or foreclosure and ultimate liquidation of the real estate-owned property, thus making their collection reasonably assured. These servicing advances, which are funded by the Company, totaled   $46.5 million   and   $37.5 million   and were included in other assets on the condensed consolidated balance sheets as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  
  Serviced Mortgage Assets 
  The Company s total serviced mortgage assets consist of loans owned and classified as residential mortgage loans held-for-sale, loans held in consolidated VIEs classified as residential mortgage loans held-for-investment in securitization trusts, and loans underlying MSR. The following table presents the number of loans and unpaid principal balance of the mortgage assets for which the Company manages the servicing as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  :

Note 9  . Restricted Cash 
  The Company is required to maintain certain cash balances with counterparties for securities and derivatives trading activity and collateral for the Company s repurchase agreements and FHLB advances in restricted accounts. The Company has also placed cash in a restricted account pursuant to a letter of credit on an office space lease. 
  The following table presents the Company s restricted cash balances as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  :

Note 11  . Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities 
  The Company enters into a variety of derivative and non-derivative instruments in connection with its risk management activities. The Company s primary objective for executing these derivative and non-derivative instruments is to mitigate the Company s economic exposure to future events that are outside its control. The Company s derivative financial instruments are utilized principally to manage market risk and cash flow volatility associated with interest rate risk (including associated prepayment risk) related to certain assets and liabilities. As part of its risk management activities, the Company may, at times, enter into various forward contracts, including short securities, Agency to-be-announced securities, or TBAs, options, futures, swaps, caps, credit default swaps and total return swaps. In executing on the Company s current risk management strategy, the Company has entered into interest rate swap and swaption agreements, TBAs, short U.S. Treasuries, put and call options for TBAs and U.S. Treasuries, constant maturity swaps, credit default swaps and total return swaps (based on the Markit IOS Index). The Company has also entered into a number of non-derivative instruments to manage interest rate risk, principally Agency interest-only securities.

The following summarizes the Company s significant asset and liability classes, the risk exposure for these classes, and the Company s risk management activities used to mitigate certain of these risks. The discussion includes both derivative and non-derivative instruments used as part of these risk management activities. Any of the Company s derivative and non-derivative instruments may be entered into in conjunction with one another in order to mitigate risks associated with the Company s investment portfolio. As a result, the following discussions of each type of instrument should be read as a collective representation of the Company s risk mitigation efforts and should not be considered independent of one another. While the Company uses derivative and non-derivative instruments to achieve the Company s risk management activities, it is possible that these instruments will not effectively mitigate all or a substantial portion of the Company s market rate risk. In addition, the Company might elect, at times, not to enter into certain hedging arrangements in order to maintain compliance with REIT requirements. 
  Balance Sheet Presentation 
  In accordance with ASC 815,   Derivatives and Hedging  , or ASC 815, the Company records derivative financial instruments on its condensed consolidated balance sheets as assets or liabilities at fair value. Changes in fair value are accounted for depending on the use of the derivative instruments and whether they qualify for hedge accounting treatment. Due to the volatility of the credit markets and difficulty in effectively matching pricing or cash flows, the Company has elected to treat all current derivative contracts as trading instruments. 
  The following tables present the gross fair value and notional amounts of the Company s derivative financial instruments treated as trading instruments as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 

Comprehensive Income (Loss)   Statement Presentation 
  The Company has not applied hedge accounting to its current derivative portfolio held to mitigate the interest rate risk and credit risk associated with its portfolio. As a result, the Company is subject to volatility in its earnings due to movement in the unrealized gains and losses associated with its interest rate swaps and its other derivative instruments.

Interest Rate Sensitive Assets/Liabilities 
  The Company s RMBS investment securities and MSR are generally subject to change in value when mortgage rates decline or increase, depending on the type of investment. Rising mortgage rates generally result in a slowing of refinancing activity, which slows prepayments and results in a decline in the value of the Company s fixed-rate Agency pools and an increase in the value of the Company s MSR. To mitigate the impact of this risk, the Company maintains a portfolio of fixed-rate interest-only securities, which increase in value when interest rates increase, as well as TBA positions, short U.S. Treasuries, put and call options for TBAs and U.S. Treasuries, constant maturity swaps, interest rate swap and swaption agreements and Markit IOS total return swaps to further mitigate its exposure to higher interest rates, decreased prepayment speeds and widening mortgage spreads. 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had outstanding fair value of   $50.1 million   and   $42.9 million  , respectively, of interest-only securities in place to economically hedge its investment securities. These interest-only securities are included in AFS securities, at fair value, in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
  The Company is exposed to interest rate risk on residential mortgage loans from the time it commits to purchase a mortgage loan until it acquires the loan from the originator and subsequently sells the loan to a third party. Changes in interest rates impact the market price for the mortgage loans. For example, as market interest rates decline, the value of residential mortgage loans held-for-sale increases, and vice versa. To mitigate the impact of this risk, the Company may enter into derivative contracts to hedge the interest rate risk related to its commitments to purchase residential mortgage loans and residential mortgage loans held-for-sale, such as interest rate swaps, swaptions, TBA positions, short U.S. Treasuries, put and call options for TBAs and U.S. Treasuries and constant maturity swaps. 
  TBAs.   At times, the Company may use TBAs for risk management purposes or as a means of deploying capital until targeted investments are available and to take advantage of temporary displacements in the marketplace. Additionally, the Company may use TBAs independently, or in conjunction with other derivative and non-derivative instruments, in order to mitigate risks associated with the Company s investment portfolio. TBAs are forward contracts for the purchase (long notional positions) or sale (short notional positions) of Agency RMBS. The issuer, coupon and stated maturity of the Agency RMBS are predetermined as well as the trade price, face amount and future settle date (published each month by the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association). However, the specific Agency RMBS to be delivered upon settlement is not known at the time of the TBA transaction. As a result, and because physical delivery of the Agency RMBS upon settlement cannot be assured, the Company accounts for TBAs as derivative instruments. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   $1.0 billion   of the Company s long notional TBA positions and   $1.6 billion   of the Company s short notional TBA positions were held in order to economically hedge portfolio risk. As of   December 31, 2015  ,   $847.0 million   of the Company s long notional TBA positions and   $550.0 million   of the Company s short notional TBA positions were held in order to economically hedge portfolio risk. The Company discloses these positions on a gross basis according to the unrealized gain or loss position of each TBA contract regardless of long or short notional position. The following tables present the notional amount, cost basis, market value and carrying value (which approximates fair value) of the Company s TBA positions as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  :

  Put and Call Options for TBAs  . The Company may use put and call options for TBAs independently, or in conjunction with other derivative and non-derivative instruments, in order to mitigate risks associated with the Company s investment portfolio. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had purchased put options for TBAs with a notional amount of   $6.9 billion  , short sold call options for TBAs with a notional amount of   $2.4 billion   and paid upfront premiums of approximately   $20.5 million  . The last of the options expires in   December 2016  . The put and call options had a net fair market value of   $2.2 million   included in derivative assets, at fair value, and   $4.7 million   included in derivative liabilities, at fair value, on the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of   September 30, 2016  . The Company did not hold any put and call options for TBAs as of   December 31, 2015  .  
  Interest Rate Swap Agreements  . The Company may use interest rate swaps independently, or in conjunction with other derivative and non-derivative instruments, in order to mitigate risks associated with the Company s investment portfolio. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company held the following interest rate swaps in order to mitigate mortgage interest rate exposure (or duration) risk associated with the Company s investment portfolio whereby the Company receives interest at a three-month LIBOR rate:

Additionally, as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company held the following interest rate swaps in order to mitigate mortgage interest rate exposure (or duration) risk associated with the Company s investment portfolio whereby the Company pays interest at a three-month LIBOR rate: 

The Company monitors its borrowings under repurchase agreements and FHLB advances, which are generally floating rate debt, in relation to the rate profile of its investment securities. When it is cost effective to do so, the Company may enter into interest rate swap arrangements to align the interest rate composition of its borrowings under repurchase agreements and FHLB advances with that of its investment securities and debt portfolios. This particularly applies to borrowing agreements with maturities or interest rate resets of less than six months. Typically, the interest receivable terms (  i.e.  , LIBOR) of the interest rate swaps match the terms of the underlying debt, resulting in an effective conversion of the rate of the related repurchase agreement or FHLB advance from floating to fixed. 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had the following outstanding interest rate swaps that were utilized as economic hedges of interest rate exposure (or duration) associated with the Company s short-term repurchase agreements and FHLB advances:

    Weighted averages exclude forward starting interest rate swaps. As of   September 30, 2016  , the weighted average fixed pay rate on interest rate swaps starting in   March 2017   was   1.8%  . The Company did not have any forward starting interest rate swaps as of   December 31, 2015  . 
       
  Interest Rate Swaptions  . The Company may use interest rate swaptions (agreements to enter into interest rate swaps in the future for which the Company would either pay or receive a fixed rate) independently, or in conjunction with other derivative and non-derivative instruments, in order to mitigate risks associated with the Company s investment portfolio. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had the following outstanding interest rate swaptions that were utilized as macro-economic hedges:

Markit IOS Total Return Swaps  . The Company may use total return swaps (agreements whereby the Company receives or makes payments based on the total return of an underlying instrument or index, such as the Markit IOS Index, in exchange for fixed or floating rate interest payments) independently, or in conjunction with other derivative and non-derivative instruments, in order to mitigate risks associated with the Company s investment portfolio. The Company enters into total return swaps to help mitigate the potential impact of larger increases or decreases in interest rates on the performance of our investment portfolio (referred to as  convexity risk ). Total return swaps based on the Markit IOS Index are intended to synthetically replicate the performance of interest-only securities. The Company had the following total return swap agreements in place at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

Credit Risk 
  The Company s exposure to credit losses on its Agency RMBS portfolio is limited due to implicit or explicit backing from the GSEs. The payment of principal and interest on the Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae mortgage-backed securities are guaranteed by those respective agencies, and the payment of principal and interest on the Ginnie Mae mortgage-backed securities are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government.

Credit Default Swaps  . For non-Agency investment securities, residential mortgage loans and commercial real estate assets, the Company may enter into credit default swaps to hedge credit risk. In future periods, the Company could enhance its credit risk protection, enter into further paired derivative positions, including both long and short credit default swaps, and/or seek opportunistic trades in the event of a market disruption (see discussion under    Non-Risk Management Activities    below). The Company also has processes and controls in place to monitor, analyze, manage and mitigate its credit risk with respect to non-Agency RMBS, residential mortgage loans and commercial real estate assets. 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company held credit default swaps through which the Company received credit protection for a fixed premium. The maximum payouts for these credit default swaps are limited to the current notional amounts of each swap contract. Maximum payouts for credit default swaps do not represent the expected future cash requirements, as the Company s credit default swaps are typically liquidated or expire and are not exercised by the holder of the credit default swaps. 
  The following tables present credit default swaps through which the Company is receiving protection held as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

Derivative financial instruments contain an element of credit risk if counterparties are unable to meet the terms of the agreements. Credit risk associated with derivative financial instruments is measured as the net replacement cost should the counterparties that owe the Company under such contracts completely fail to perform under the terms of these contracts, assuming there are no recoveries of underlying collateral, as measured by the market value of the derivative financial instruments. As of   September 30, 2016  , the fair value of derivative financial instruments as an asset and liability position was   $199.0 million   and   $39.9 million  , respectively. 
  The Company attempts to mitigate its credit risk exposure on derivative financial instruments by limiting its counterparties to banks and financial institutions that meet established credit guidelines. The Company also seeks to spread its credit risk exposure across multiple counterparties in order to reduce its exposure to any single counterparty. Additionally, the Company reduces credit risk on the majority of its derivative instruments by entering into agreements that permit the closeout and netting of transactions with the same counterparty or clearing agency, in the case of centrally cleared interest rate swaps, upon the occurrence of certain events. To further mitigate the risk of counterparty default, the Company maintains collateral agreements with certain of its counterparties and clearing agencies, which require both parties to maintain cash deposits in the event the fair values of the derivative financial instruments exceed established thresholds. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had received cash deposits from counterparties of   $12.1 million   and placed cash deposits of   $161.8 million   in accounts maintained by counterparties, of which the amounts are netted on a counterparty basis and classified within restricted cash, due from counterparties, or due to counterparties on the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheets.

Non-Risk Management Activities 
  The Company has entered into certain financial instruments that are considered derivative contracts under ASC 815 that are not for purposes of hedging. These contracts are currently limited to forward purchase commitments and inverse interest-only RMBS. 
  Commitments to Purchase Residential Mortgage Loans Held-for-Sale  . Prior to a mortgage loan purchase, the Company may enter into forward purchase commitments with counterparties whereby the Company commits to purchasing the loans at a particular interest rate, provided the borrower elects to close the loan. These commitments to purchase mortgage loans have been defined as derivatives and are, therefore, recorded on the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheets as assets or liabilities and measured at fair value. Subsequent changes in fair value are recorded on the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheets as adjustments to the carrying value of these assets or liabilities with a corresponding adjustment recognized in current period earnings. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had outstanding commitments to purchase   $61.4 million   and   $286.1 million   of mortgage loans, subject to fallout if the loans do not close, with a fair value asset of   $310,294   and a fair value liability of   $40,111   at   September 30, 2016  , and a fair value asset of   $77,227   and a fair value liability of   $427,468   at   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  Inverse Interest-Only Securities  . As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , inverse interest-only securities with a carrying value of   $142.6 million   and   $159.6 million  , including accrued interest receivable of   $1.4 million   and   $1.7 million  , respectively, are accounted for as derivative financial instruments in the condensed consolidated financial statements. The following table presents the amortized cost and carrying value (which approximates fair value) of inverse interest-only securities as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  :

  Fair Value Measurements 
  ASC 820,   Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures  , or ASC 820, defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. ASC 820 clarifies that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices available in active markets (  i.e.  , observable inputs) and the lowest priority to data lacking transparency (  i.e.  , unobservable inputs). Additionally, ASC 820 requires an entity to consider all aspects of nonperformance risk, including the entity s own credit standing, when measuring fair value of a liability. 
  ASC 820 establishes a three-level hierarchy to be used when measuring and disclosing fair value. An instrument s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of significant input to its valuation. Following is a description of the three levels: 
    
           Level 1 
    Inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the measurement date under current market conditions. Additionally, the entity must have the ability to access the active market and the quoted prices cannot be adjusted by the entity.

  Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) 

Level 2 
    Inputs include quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in inactive markets for identical or similar assets or liabilities; or inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means for substantially the full-term of the assets or liabilities. 
              Level 3 
    Unobservable inputs are supported by little or no market activity. The unobservable inputs represent the assumptions that market participants would use to price the assets and liabilities, including risk. Generally, Level 3 assets and liabilities are valued using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques that require significant judgment or estimation. 
       
  Following are descriptions of the valuation methodologies used to measure material assets and liabilities at fair value and details of the valuation models, key inputs to those models and significant assumptions utilized. 
  Available-for-sale securities  . The Company holds a portfolio of AFS securities that are carried at fair value in the condensed consolidated balance sheets and primarily comprised of Agency and non-Agency RMBS. The Company determines the fair value of its Agency RMBS based upon prices obtained from third-party pricing providers or broker quotes received using bid price, which are deemed indicative of market activity. The third-party pricing providers and brokers use pricing models that generally incorporate such factors as coupons, primary and secondary mortgage rates, rate reset period, issuer, prepayment speeds, credit enhancements and expected life of the security. In determining the fair value of its non-Agency RMBS, management judgment may be used to arrive at fair value that considers prices obtained from third-party pricing providers, broker quotes received and other applicable market data. If observable market prices are not available or insufficient to determine fair value due principally to illiquidity in the marketplace, then fair value is based upon internally developed models that are primarily based on observable market-based inputs but also include unobservable market data inputs (including prepayment speeds, delinquency levels, and credit losses). The Company classified   100%   of its RMBS AFS securities reported at fair value as Level 2 at   September 30, 2016  . AFS securities account for   74.1%   of all assets reported at fair value at   September 30, 2016  . 
  Residential mortgage loans held-for-sale  . The Company holds residential mortgage loans held-for-sale that are carried at fair value in the condensed consolidated balance sheets as a result of a fair value option election. The Company determines fair value of its residential mortgage loans based on prices obtained from third-party pricing providers and other applicable market data. If observable market prices are not available or insufficient to determine fair value due principally to illiquidity in the marketplace, then fair value is based upon cash flow models that are primarily based on observable market-based inputs but also include unobservable market data inputs (including prepayment speeds, delinquency levels and credit losses). The Company classified   90.7%   and   9.3%   of its residential mortgage loans held-for-sale as Level 2 and Level 3 fair value assets, respectively, at   September 30, 2016  . 
  Residential mortgage loans held-for-investment in securitization trusts  . The Company recognizes on its condensed consolidated balance sheets residential mortgage loans held-for-investment in securitization trusts that are carried at fair value as a result of a fair value option election. An entity is allowed to measure both the financial assets and financial liabilities of a qualifying CFE it consolidates using the fair value of either the CFE s financial assets or financial liabilities, whichever is more observable. As the Company s securitization trusts are considered qualifying CFEs, the Company determines the fair value of these residential mortgage loans based on the fair value of its collateralized borrowings in securitization trusts and its retained interests from the Company s on-balance sheet securitizations (eliminated in consolidation in accordance with U.S. GAAP), as the fair value of these instruments is more observable. The Company classified   100%   of its residential mortgage loans held-for-investment in securitization trusts as Level 2 fair value assets at   September 30, 2016  . 
  Mortgage servicing rights  .     The Company holds a portfolio of MSR that are carried at fair value on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company determines fair value of its MSR based on prices obtained from third-party pricing providers. Although MSR transactions are observable in the marketplace, the valuation is based upon cash flow models that include unobservable market data inputs (including prepayment speeds, delinquency levels and discount rates). As a result, the Company classified   100%   of its MSR as Level 3 fair value assets at   September 30, 2016  . 
  Derivative instruments  . The Company may enter into a variety of derivative financial instruments as part of its hedging strategies. The Company principally executes over-the-counter, or OTC, derivative contracts, such as interest rate swaps, swaptions, put and call options for TBAs and U.S. Treasuries, credit default swaps, constant maturity swaps and Markit IOS total return swaps. The Company utilizes third-party pricing providers to value its financial derivative instruments. The Company classified   100%   of the interest rate swaps, swaptions, put and call options for TBAs and U.S. Treasuries, credit default swaps, constant maturity swaps and total returns swaps reported at fair value as Level 2 at   September 30, 2016  .

The Company may also enter into certain other derivative financial instruments, such as TBAs, short U.S. Treasuries and inverse interest-only securities. These instruments are similar in form to the Company s AFS securities and the Company utilizes a pricing service to value TBAs and broker quotes to value short U.S. Treasuries and inverse interest-only securities. The Company classified   100%   of its inverse interest-only securities at fair value as Level 2 at   September 30, 2016  . The Company reported   100%   of its TBAs as Level 1 as of   September 30, 2016  . The Company did not hold any short U.S. Treasuries at   September 30, 2016  . 
  The Company may also enter into forward purchase commitments on residential mortgage loans whereby the Company commits to purchasing the loans at a particular interest rate. The fair value of these derivatives is determined based on prices currently offered in the marketplace for new commitments. Fallout assumptions if the borrower elects not to close the loan are applied to the pricing. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had outstanding commitments to purchase   $61.4 million   of mortgage loans, subject to fallout if the loans do not close, with a fair value asset of   $310,294   and a fair value liability of   $40,111  . The Company classified   100%   of the forward purchase commitments reported at fair value as Level 2 at   September 30, 2016  . 
  The Company s risk management committee governs trading activity relating to derivative instruments. The Company s policy is to minimize credit exposure related to financial derivatives used for hedging by limiting the hedge counterparties to major banks, financial institutions, exchanges, and private investors who meet established capital and credit guidelines as well as by limiting the amount of exposure to any individual counterparty. 
  The Company has netting arrangements in place with all derivative counterparties pursuant to standard documentation developed by ISDA, or central clearing exchange agreements, in the case of centrally cleared interest rate swaps. Additionally, both the Company and the counterparty or clearing agency are required to post cash collateral based upon the net underlying market value of the Company s open positions with the counterparty. Posting of cash collateral typically occurs daily, subject to certain dollar thresholds. Due to the existence of netting arrangements, as well as frequent cash collateral posting at low posting thresholds, credit exposure to the Company and/or to the counterparty or clearing agency is considered materially mitigated. Based on the Company s assessment, there is no requirement for any additional adjustment to derivative valuations specifically for credit. 
  Collateralized borrowings in securitization trusts  . The Company recognizes on its condensed consolidated balance sheets collateralized borrowings that are carried at fair value as a result of a fair value option election. In determining the fair value of its collateralized borrowings, management judgment may be used to arrive at fair value that considers prices obtained from third-party pricing providers, broker quotes received and other applicable market data. If observable market prices are not available or insufficient to determine fair value due principally to illiquidity in the marketplace, then fair value is based upon internally developed models that are primarily based on observable market-based inputs but also include unobservable market data inputs (including prepayment speeds, delinquency levels, and credit losses). The Company classified   100%   of its collateralized borrowings in securitization trusts as Level 2 fair value liabilities at   September 30, 2016  .

The following tables display the Company s assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis. The Company often economically hedges the fair value change of its assets or liabilities with derivatives and other financial instruments. The tables below display the hedges separately from the hedged items, and therefore do not directly display the impact of the Company s risk management activities. 

The Company may be required to measure certain assets or liabilities at fair value from time to time. These periodic fair value measures typically result from application of certain impairment measures under U.S. GAAP. These items would constitute nonrecurring fair value measures under ASC 820. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company did not have any assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in the periods presented.

The valuation of Level 3 instruments requires significant judgment by the third-party pricing providers and/or management. The third-party pricing providers and/or management rely on inputs such as market price quotations from market makers (either market or indicative levels), original transaction price, recent transactions in the same or similar instruments, and changes in financial ratios or cash flows to determine fair value. Level 3 instruments may also be discounted to reflect illiquidity and/or non-transferability, with the amount of such discount estimated by the third-party pricing provider in the absence of market information. Assumptions used by the third-party pricing provider due to lack of observable inputs may significantly impact the resulting fair value and therefore the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements. The Company s valuation committee reviews all valuations that are based on pricing information received from a third-party pricing provider. As part of this review, prices are compared against other pricing or input data points in the marketplace, along with internal valuation expertise, to ensure the pricing is reasonable. In addition, the Company performs back-testing of pricing information to validate price information and identify any pricing trends of a third-party price provider. 
  In determining fair value, third-party pricing providers use various valuation approaches, including market and income approaches. Inputs that are used in determining fair value of an instrument may include pricing information, credit data, volatility statistics, and other factors. In addition, inputs can be either observable or unobservable. 
  The availability of observable inputs can vary by instrument and is affected by a wide variety of factors, including the type of instrument, whether the instrument is new and not yet established in the marketplace and other characteristics particular to the instrument. The third-party pricing provider uses prices and inputs that are current as of the measurement date, including during periods of market dislocations. In periods of market dislocation, the availability of prices and inputs may be reduced for many instruments. This condition could cause an instrument to be reclassified to or from various levels within the fair value hierarchy. 
  Securities for which market quotations are readily available are valued at the bid price (in the case of long positions) or the ask price (in the case of short positions) at the close of trading on the date as of which value is determined. Exchange-traded securities for which no bid or ask price is available are valued at the last traded price. OTC derivative contracts, including interest rate swaps and swaption agreements, put and call options for TBAs and U.S. Treasuries, constant maturity swaps, credit default swaps and Markit IOS total return swaps, are valued by the Company using observable inputs, specifically quotations received from third-party pricing providers, and are therefore classified within Level 2.

           (1) 
    The change in unrealized gains or losses on residential mortgage loans held-for-sale was recorded in   (loss) gain on residential mortgage loans held-for-sale   on the   condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss)  . 
              (2) 
    The change in unrealized gains or losses on residential mortgage loans held-for-sale that were held at the end of the reporting period was recorded in   (loss) gain on residential mortgage loans held-for-sale   on the   condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss)  . 
              (3) 
    The change in unrealized gains or losses on MSR was recorded in   loss on servicing asset   on the   condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss)  . 
              (4) 
    The change in unrealized gains or losses on MSR that were held at the end of the reporting period was recorded in   loss on servicing asset   on the   condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss)  . 
       
  The Company did not incur transfers between Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3 during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . Transfers between Levels are deemed to take place on the first day of the reporting period in which the transfer has taken place. 
  The Company used a third-party pricing provider in the fair value measurement of its Level 3 residential mortgage loans held-for-sale. The significant unobservable inputs used by the third-party pricing provider included expected default, severity and discount rate. Significant increases (decreases) in any of the inputs in isolation may result in significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement.

The Company also used a third-party pricing provider in the fair value measurement of its Level 3 MSR. The table below presents information about the significant unobservable inputs used by the third-party pricing provider in the fair value measurement of the Company s MSR classified as Level 3 fair value assets at   September 30, 2016  : 

___________________ 
           (1) 
    Significant increases (decreases) in any of the inputs in isolation may result in significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement. A change in the assumption used for discount rates may be accompanied by a directionally similar change in the assumption used for the probability of delinquency and a directionally opposite change in the assumption used for prepayment rates. 
       
  Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities 
  On July 1, 2015, the Company elected the fair value option for Agency interest-only securities and GSE credit risk transfer securities acquired on or after such date. The fair value option was elected to simplify the reporting of changes in fair value. Agency interest-only securities and GSE credit risk transfer securities are carried within AFS securities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company s policy is to separately record interest income, net of premium amortization or including discount accretion, on these fair value elected securities. Fair value adjustments are reported in   gain on investment securities   on the   condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss)  . 
  The Company elected the fair value option for the residential mortgage loans it has acquired. The fair value option was elected to mitigate earnings volatility by better matching the accounting for the assets with the related hedges. The mortgage loans are carried within residential mortgage loans held-for-sale on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company s policy is to separately record interest income on these fair value elected loans. Upfront fees and costs related to the fair value elected loans are not deferred or capitalized. Fair value adjustments are reported in   (loss) gain on residential mortgage loans held-for-sale   on the   condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss)  . The fair value option is irrevocable once the loan is acquired. 
  The Company also elected the fair value option for both the residential mortgage loans held-for-investment in securitization trusts and the collateralized borrowings in securitization trusts carried on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. The fair value option was elected to better reflect the economics of the Company s retained interests. The Company s policy is to separately record interest income on the fair value elected loans and interest expense on the fair value elected borrowings. Upfront fees and costs are not deferred or capitalized. Fair value adjustments are reported in   other income (loss)   on the   condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss)  .

  Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
  In accordance with ASC 820, the Company is required to disclose the fair value of financial instruments, both assets and liabilities recognized and not recognized in the condensed consolidated balance sheets, for which fair value can be estimated. 
  The following describes the Company s methods for estimating the fair value for financial instruments. Descriptions are not provided for those items that have zero balances as of the current balance sheet date. 
             
    AFS securities, residential mortgage loans held-for-sale, residential mortgage loans held-for-investment in securitization trusts, MSR, derivative assets and liabilities, and collateralized borrowings in securitization trusts are recurring fair value measurements; carrying value equals fair value. See discussion of valuation methods and assumptions within the   Fair Value Measurements   section of this   Note 14  . 
                
    Commercial real estate assets are carried at cost, net of any unamortized acquisition premiums or discounts, loan fees and origination costs as applicable, unless deemed impaired. The Company estimates the fair value of its commercial real estate assets by assessing any changes in market interest rates, shifts in credit profiles and actual operating results for mezzanine commercial real estate loans and commercial real estate first mortgages, taking into consideration such factors as underlying property type, property competitive position within its market, market and submarket fundamentals, tenant mix, nature of business plan, sponsorship, extent of leverage and other loan terms. The Company categorizes the fair value measurement of these assets as Level 3. 
                
    Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash have a carrying value which approximates fair value because of the short maturities of these instruments. The Company categorizes the fair value measurement of these assets as Level 1. 
                
    As a condition to membership in the FHLB, the Company is required to purchase and hold a certain amount of FHLB stock, which is considered a non-marketable, long-term investment, and is carried at cost. Because this stock can only be redeemed or sold at its par value, and only to the FHLB, carrying value, or cost, approximates fair value. The Company categorizes the fair value measurement of these assets as Level 3. 
                
    Equity investments include cost method investments for which fair value is not estimated. Carrying value, or cost, approximates fair value. The Company categorizes the fair value measurement of these assets as Level 3.

The carrying value of repurchase agreements, FHLB advances and revolving credit facilities that mature in less than one year generally approximates fair value due to the short maturities. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company held   $222.6 million   of repurchase agreements and   $3.3 billion   of FHLB advances that are considered long-term. The Company s long-term repurchase agreements and FHLB advances have floating rates based on an index plus a spread and, for members of the FHLB, the credit spread is typically consistent with those demanded in the market. Accordingly, the interest rates on these borrowings are at market and thus carrying value approximates fair value. The Company categorizes the fair value measurement of these liabilities as Level 2. 
     The following table presents the carrying values and estimated fair values of assets and liabilities that are required to be recorded or disclosed at fair value at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 

Note 15  . Repurchase Agreements 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had outstanding   $10.6 billion   and   $5.0 billion  , respectively, of repurchase agreements. Excluding the effect of the Company s interest rate swaps, the repurchase agreements had a weighted average borrowing rate of   1.06%   and   1.10%   and weighted average remaining maturities of   69   and   35   days as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the repurchase agreement balances were as follows:

  Although the transactions under repurchase agreements represent committed borrowings until maturity, the respective lender retains the right to mark the underlying collateral to fair value. A reduction in the value of pledged assets would require the Company to provide additional collateral or fund margin calls. 
  The following table summarizes certain characteristics of the Company s repurchase agreements and counterparty concentration at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

____________________ 
           (1) 
    Represents the net carrying value of the securities, residential mortgage loans held-for-sale and commercial real estate assets sold under agreements to repurchase, including accrued interest plus any cash or assets on deposit to secure the repurchase obligation, less the amount of the repurchase liability, including accrued interest. However, at both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company did not have any such payables. 
        
  The Company does not anticipate any defaults by its repurchase agreement counterparties. There can be no assurance, however, that any such default or defaults will not occur. 

Note 16  . Collateralized Borrowings in Securitization Trusts, at Fair Value 
  The Company purchases subordinated debt and excess servicing rights from securitization trusts sponsored by either third parties or the Company s subsidiaries. The debt associated with the underlying residential mortgage loans held by the trusts, which are consolidated on the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheets, is classified as collateralized borrowings in securitization trusts and carried at fair value as a result of a fair value option election. See   Note 3   -   Variable Interest Entities   for additional information regarding consolidation of the securitization trusts. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , collateralized borrowings in securitization trusts had a carrying value of   $3.4 billion   and   $2.0 billion   with a weighted average interest rate of   3.4%   and   3.6%  , respectively. The stated maturity dates for all collateralized borrowings were more than five years from both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .

Note 17  . Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines Advances 
  The Company s wholly owned subsidiary, TH Insurance Holdings Company LLC, or TH Insurance, is a member of the FHLB. As a member of the FHLB, TH Insurance has access to a variety of products and services offered by the FHLB, including secured advances. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , TH Insurance had   $4.0 billion   and   $3.8 billion   in outstanding secured advances with a weighted average borrowing rate of   0.67%   and   0.58%  , respectively, and had no additional uncommitted capacity to borrow as of   September 30, 2016  . As of   December 31, 2015  , TH Insurance had an additional   $215.0 million   of available uncommitted capacity for borrowings. To the extent TH Insurance has uncommitted capacity, it may be adjusted at the sole discretion of the FHLB. 
  The ability to borrow from the FHLB is subject to the Company s continued creditworthiness, pledging of sufficient eligible collateral to secure advances, and compliance with certain agreements with the FHLB. Each advance requires approval by the FHLB and is secured by collateral in accordance with the FHLB s credit and collateral guidelines, as may be revised from time to time by the FHLB. Eligible collateral may include conventional 1-4 family residential mortgage loans, commercial real estate loans, Agency RMBS and certain non-Agency RMBS with a rating of A and above. 
  On January 11, 2016, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, or FHFA, released a final rule regarding membership in the Federal Home Loan Bank system. Among other effects, the final rule excludes captive insurers from membership eligibility, including the Company s subsidiary member, TH Insurance. Since TH Insurance was admitted as a member in 2013, it is eligible for a five-year membership grace period, during which new advances or renewals that mature beyond the grace period will be prohibited; however, any existing advances that mature beyond this grace period will be permitted to remain in place subject to their terms insofar as the Company maintains good standing with the FHLB. If any new advances or renewals occur, TH Insurance s outstanding advances will be limited to 40% of its total assets. 
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , FHLB advances had the following remaining maturities: 

The following table summarizes assets at carrying values that are pledged or restricted as collateral for the future payment obligations of FHLB advances:

The FHLB retains the right to mark the underlying collateral for FHLB advances to fair value. A reduction in the value of pledged assets would require the Company to provide additional collateral. In addition, as a condition to membership in the FHLB, the Company is required to purchase and hold a certain amount of FHLB stock, which is based, in part, upon the outstanding principal balance of advances from the FHLB. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had stock in the FHLB totaling   $167.9 million   and   $156.7 million  , respectively, which is included in other assets on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. FHLB stock is considered a non-marketable, long-term investment, is carried at cost and is subject to recoverability testing under applicable accounting standards. This stock can only be redeemed or sold at its par value, and only to the FHLB. Accordingly, when evaluating FHLB stock for impairment, the Company considers the ultimate recoverability of the par value rather than recognizing temporary declines in value. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had not recognized an impairment charge related to its FHLB stock. 

Note 18  . Revolving Credit Facilities 
  To finance MSR, the Company enters into revolving credit facilities collateralized by the value of the MSR pledged. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had outstanding short-term borrowings under revolving credit facilities of   $30.0 million   with a weighted average borrowing rate of   4.27%   and remaining maturities of   336   days. The Company did not have any revolving credit facilities in place at   December 31, 2015  . 
  Although the transactions under revolving credit facilities represent committed borrowings until maturity, the respective lender retains the right to mark the underlying collateral to fair value. A reduction in the value of pledged assets below a designated threshold would require the Company to provide additional collateral or fund margin calls. As of   September 30, 2016  , MSR with a carrying value of   $73.5 million   was pledged as collateral for the Company s future payment obligations under its revolving credit facilities. The Company does not anticipate any defaults by its revolving credit facility counterparties. There can be no assurance, however, that any such default or defaults will not occur.

As of   September 30, 2016  ,   327,056   shares have been issued under the plan for total proceeds of approximately   $3.3 million  , of which   14,621   and   43,764   shares were issued for total proceeds of   $0.1 million   and   $0.4 million   during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively. During the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  ,   17,904   and   54,088   shares were issued for total proceeds of   $0.2 million   and   $0.6 million  , respectively. 
  Share Repurchase Program 
  As of   December 31, 2015  , the Company s share repurchase program allowed the Company to repurchase up to   25,000,000   shares of its common stock. During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company s board of directors authorized an increase of   50,000,000   shares, for up to a total of   75,000,000   shares authorized under the program. Shares may be repurchased from time to time through privately negotiated transactions or open market transactions, pursuant to a trading plan in accordance with Rules 10b5-1 and 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, or by any combination of such methods. The manner, price, number and timing of share repurchases are subject to a variety of factors, including market conditions and applicable SEC rules. The share repurchase program does not require the purchase of any minimum number of shares, and, subject to SEC rules, purchases may be commenced or suspended at any time without prior notice. The share repurchase program does not have an expiration date. As of   September 30, 2016  , a total of   24,135,000   shares had been repurchased by the Company under the program for an aggregate cost of   $200.4 million  ; of these,   8,020,000   shares were repurchased for a total cost of   $61.3 million   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . No shares were repurchased during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  . During the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  ,   1,391,887   shares were repurchased for a total cost of   $12.5 million  . 
  At-the-Market Offering 
  On May 25, 2012, the Company entered into an equity distribution agreement under which the Company may sell up to an aggregate of   20,000,000   shares of its common stock from time to time in any method permitted by law deemed to be an  at the market  offering as defined in Rule 415 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act. On May 22, 2015, the Company entered into an amendment to the equity distribution agreement providing that any subsequent offers or sales of the Company s common stock under the equity distribution agreement shall be made pursuant to a new prospectus supplement, which was filed on the same date. As of   September 30, 2016  ,   7,585,869   shares of common stock have been sold under the equity distribution agreement for total accumulated net proceeds of approximately   $77.6 million  ; however, no shares were sold during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  .

Note 20  . Equity Incentive Plan 
  On May 14, 2015, the Company s stockholders approved the Company s Second Restated 2009 Equity Incentive Plan, which replaced the previous Restated 2009 Equity Incentive Plan, both of which are referred to collectively as the Plan. This stockholder approval effectuated, among other changes, an increase in the number of shares of common stock available for issuance under the Plan by   10,000,000   shares, to a total of   13,000,000   shares. 
  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company granted   81,739   and   55,229   shares of common stock, respectively, to its independent directors pursuant to the Plan. The estimated fair value of these awards was   $8.43   and   $10.41   per share on grant date, based on the closing price of the Company s common stock on the NYSE on such date. The grants vested immediately. 
  Additionally, during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company granted   1,937,522   and   1,115,574   shares of restricted common stock, respectively, to key employees of PRCM Advisers pursuant to the terms of the Plan and the associated award agreements. The estimated fair value of these awards was   $7.52   and   $10.49   per share on grant date, based on the closing market price of the Company s common stock on the NYSE on such date. However, as the cost of these awards is measured at fair value at each reporting date based on the price of the Company s stock as of period end in accordance with ASC 505,   Equity  , or ASC 505, the fair value of these awards as of   September 30, 2016   was   $8.53   per share based on the closing market price of the Company s common stock on the NYSE on such date. The shares underlying the grants vest in three equal annual installments commencing on the first anniversary of the grant date, as long as such grantee complies with the terms and conditions of his or her applicable restricted stock award agreement. During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , in connection with the restructuring described in   Note 21   -   Restructuring Charges  , certain agreements were forfeited and re-granted with accelerated vesting terms, in accordance with ASC 718,   Compensation - Stock Compensation  . 
  The following table summarizes the activity related to restricted common stock for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company recognized compensation costs and restructuring charges related to restricted common stock of   $3.5 million   and   $11.2 million  , respectively. For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , the Company recognized compensation costs related to restricted common stock of   $1.7 million   and   $7.4 million  , respectively. 

Note 21  . Restructuring Charges 
  On July 28, 2016, the Company announced that its board of directors had approved a plan to discontinue the Company s mortgage loan conduit and securitization business. The wind down process is expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2016.

In connection with the closure, the Company incurred the following charges, included within restructuring charges on the Company s   condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss)  , for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  : 

The Company expects to incur an estimated   $1.6 million   in additional restructuring costs, which will be expensed in the period in which they occur. The additional expenses, which are expected to be substantially incurred by the end of 2016, relate to termination benefits and contract terminations. 

Note 22  . Income Taxes 
  For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company qualified to be taxed as a REIT under the Code for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As long as the Company qualifies as a REIT, the Company generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes on its taxable income to the extent it annually distributes its net taxable income to stockholders, and does not engage in prohibited transactions. The Company intends to distribute 100% of its REIT taxable income and comply with all requirements to continue to qualify as a REIT. The majority of states also recognize the Company s REIT status. The Company s TRSs file separate tax returns and are fully taxed as standalone U.S. C-corporations. It is assumed that the Company will retain its REIT status and will incur no REIT level taxation as it intends to comply with the REIT regulations and annual distribution requirements. 
  During the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company s TRSs recognized a benefit from income taxes of   $16.8 million   and   $26.1 million  , respectively, which was primarily due to losses incurred on MSR and derivative instruments held in the Company s TRSs. During the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , the Company s TRSs recognized a benefit from income taxes of   $7.7 million   and   $25.3 million  , respectively, which was primarily due to losses incurred on MSR and derivative instruments held in the Company s TRSs. 
  Based on the Company s evaluation, it has been concluded that there are no significant uncertain tax positions requiring recognition in the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements of a contingent tax liability for uncertain tax positions.

  The following table presents a reconciliation of the   earnings (loss)   and shares used in calculating   basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  :

Note 24  . Related Party Transactions 
  The following summary provides disclosure of the material transactions with affiliates of the Company. 
  In accordance with its Management Agreement with PRCM Advisers, the Company incurred   $11.4 million   and   $35.3 million   as a management fee to PRCM Advisers for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, and   $12.6 million   and   $38.0 million   as a management fee to PRCM Advisers for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively, which represents approximately   1.5%   of stockholders  equity on an annualized basis as defined by the Management Agreement. For purposes of calculating the management fee, stockholders  equity is adjusted to exclude any common stock repurchases as well as any unrealized gains, losses or other items that do not affect realized   net income (loss)  , among other adjustments, in accordance with the Management Agreement. In addition, the Company reimbursed PRCM Advisers for direct and allocated costs incurred by PRCM Advisers on behalf of the Company. These direct and allocated costs totaled approximately   $6.3 million   and   $19.1 million   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, and   $5.9 million   and   $16.0 million   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively. 
  The Company has direct relationships with the majority of its third-party vendors. The Company will continue to have certain costs allocated to it by PRCM Advisers for compensation, data services, proprietary technology and certain office lease payments, but most direct expenses with third-party vendors are paid directly by the Company.  
  The Company recognized   $3.5 million   and   $11.2 million   of compensation expense and restructuring charges during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, and   $1.7 million   and   $7.4 million   of compensation expense during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively, related to restricted common stock issued to employees of PRCM Advisers and the Company s independent directors pursuant to the Plan.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
  The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as well as our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 

General 
  We are a Maryland corporation focused on investing in, financing and managing residential mortgage-backed securities, or RMBS, residential mortgage loans, mortgage servicing rights, or MSR, commercial real estate and other financial assets, which we collectively refer to as our target assets. We operate as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, as defined under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code. 
  We are externally managed by PRCM Advisers LLC, or PRCM Advisers, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Pine River Capital Management L.P., or Pine River, a global multi-strategy asset management firm providing comprehensive portfolio management, transparency and liquidity to institutional and high net worth investors. 
  Our objective is to provide attractive risk-adjusted total return to our stockholders over the long term, primarily through dividends and secondarily through capital appreciation. We selectively acquire and manage an investment portfolio of our target assets, which is constructed to generate attractive returns through market cycles. We focus on asset selection and implement a relative value investment approach across various sectors within the mortgage market. Our target assets include the following: 
             
    Agency RMBS (which includes inverse interest-only Agency securities classified as  Agency Derivatives  for purposes of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP), meaning RMBS whose principal and interest payments are guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage Association (or Ginnie Mae), the Federal National Mortgage Association (or Fannie Mae), or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (or Freddie Mac), or collectively, the government sponsored entities, or GSEs; 
                
    Non-Agency RMBS, meaning RMBS that are not issued or guaranteed by Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac; 
                
    Residential mortgage loans; 
                
    MSR; 
                
    Commercial real estate assets; and 
                
    Other financial assets comprising approximately 5% to 10% of the portfolio. 
     We generally view our target assets in three strategies that are based on our core competencies of understanding and managing prepayment and credit risk. Our rates strategy includes assets that are sensitive to changes in interest rates and prepayment speeds, specifically Agency RMBS and MSR. Our credit strategy includes assets with inherent credit risk including non-Agency RMBS, prime nonconforming residential mortgage loans and net economic interests in consolidated securitization trusts. Our commercial strategy includes as target assets first mortgage loans, mezzanine loans, b-notes and preferred equity. 
  As opportunities in the residential and commercial mortgage marketplace change, we continue to evolve our business model. From a capital allocation perspective, we expect to continue to increase our allocation towards MSR and commercial real estate assets, and decrease our exposure to RMBS and residential mortgage loans over time. During the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , however, we increased our allocation towards Agency RMBS due to attractive market prices. Within our non-Agency RMBS portfolio, we have historically had a substantial emphasis on  legacy  securities, which include securities issued prior to 2009. Over the course of the past two years, however, we have sold a number of these securities that we believe had reached maximum value, some of which were replaced with  new issue  non-Agency RMBS. We believe these  new issue  securities, which include some GSE credit risk transfer securities, have enabled us to find attractive returns and further diversify our non-Agency RMBS portfolio. 
  In July 2016, we announced a plan to discontinue our mortgage loan conduit and securitization business, whereby we acquire prime nonconforming residential mortgage loans from select mortgage loan originators and secondary market institutions with the intent to securitize the loans through the issuance of non-Agency mortgage-backed securities and/or exit through a whole loan sale. We expect the wind down process to be substantially completed by the end of 2016, though we currently intend to retain certain subordinated securities from our prior securitization transactions. In addition, we hold a small legacy portfolio of credit sensitive residential mortgage loans, or CSL, which are loans where the borrower has previously experienced payment delinquencies and is more likely to be underwater (  i.e.  , the amount owed on a mortgage loan exceeds the current market value of the home). As a result, there is a higher probability of default on CSL than on newly originated residential mortgage loans. We do not originate residential mortgage loans or provide direct financing to lenders.

     Table of Contents  

Within our MSR business, we purchase the right to control the servicing of mortgage loans from high-quality originators. Additionally, as an owner of MSR on loans from securitizations guaranteed by Ginnie Mae, we are obligated to purchase these loans from time to time in order to complete modifications on the mortgage loans or to convey foreclosed properties to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, or HUD. We also have the option to buy out delinquent mortgages in order to better control loss mitigation activities. We held a small portfolio of these Ginnie Mae buyout residential mortgage loans as of   September 30, 2016  . We do not directly service the mortgage loans we acquire, nor the mortgage loans underlying the MSR we acquire; rather, we contract with fully licensed third-party subservicers to handle substantially all servicing functions. 
  We believe our investment model allows management to allocate capital across various sectors within the mortgage market, with a focus on asset selection and the implementation of a relative value investment approach. Our capital allocation decisions factor in the opportunities in the marketplace, the cost of financing and the cost of hedging interest rate, prepayment, credit and other portfolio risks. As a result, capital allocation reflects management s opportunistic approach to investing in the marketplace. The following table provides our capital allocation among the target assets in each of our investment strategies as of   September 30, 2016   and the four immediately preceding period ends: 

As our capital allocation shifts, our annualized yields and cost of financing shift. As previously discussed, our investment decisions are not driven solely by annualized yields, but rather a multitude of macroeconomic drivers, including market environments and their respective impacts (  e.g.,   uncertainty of prepayment speeds, extension risk and credit events). 
  For the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , our net yield realized on the portfolio was lower than previous periods. Yields and net interest spreads on RMBS and MSR are generally lower than recent quarters, while net yields on net economic interests in consolidated securitization trusts have increased due to sales of higher-rated retained interests from on-balance sheet securitizations. Net yields on residential mortgage loans held-for-sale and commercial real estate assets have been relatively consistent. Our cost of financing has decreased slightly as a result of lower swap spread. The following table provides the average annualized yield on our target assets, including Agency and non-Agency RMBS, residential mortgage loans held-for-sale, residential mortgage loans held-for-investment, net of collateralized borrowings, in securitization trusts, commercial real estate assets and MSR for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , and the four immediately preceding quarters:

We seek to deploy moderate leverage as part of our investment strategy. We generally finance our RMBS, residential mortgage loans held-for-sale and commercial real estate assets through short- and long-term borrowings structured as repurchase agreements and through short- and long-term advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines, or the FHLB. We also finance our MSR through revolving credit facilities. Our Agency RMBS, given their liquidity and high credit quality, are eligible for higher levels of leverage, while non-Agency RMBS, residential mortgage loans held-for-sale, commercial real estate assets and MSR, with less liquidity and more exposure to credit risk, utilize lower levels of leverage. We believe the debt-to-equity ratio funding our Agency RMBS, non-Agency RMBS, residential mortgage loans held-for-sale, commercial real estate assets and MSR is the most meaningful leverage measure as collateralized borrowings on residential mortgage loans held-for-investment in securitization trusts represents term financing with no stated maturity. As a result, our debt-to-equity ratio is determined by our portfolio mix as well as many additional factors, including the liquidity of our portfolio, the sustainability and price of our financing, diversification of our counterparties and their available capacity to finance our assets, and anticipated regulatory developments. Over the past several quarters, we have generally maintained a debt-to-equity ratio range of 3.0 to 5.0 times to finance our RMBS portfolio, residential mortgage loans held-for-sale, commercial real estate assets and MSR, on a fully deployed capital basis. Our debt-to-equity ratio is directly correlated to the make-up of our portfolio; specifically, the higher percentage of Agency RMBS we hold, the higher our debt-to-equity ratio is, while the higher percentage of non-Agency RMBS, mortgage loans, commercial real estate assets and MSR we hold, the lower our debt-to-equity ratio is. We may alter the percentage allocation of our portfolio among our target assets depending on the relative value of the assets that are available to purchase from time to time, including at times when we are deploying proceeds from common stock offerings we conduct. See the section titled    Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Financial Condition - Repurchase Agreements    for further discussion. 
  We recognize that investing in our target assets is competitive and we compete with other entities for attractive investment opportunities. We rely on our management team and our dedicated team of investment professionals provided by our external manager to identify investment opportunities. In addition, we have benefited and expect to continue to benefit from our external manager s analytical and portfolio management expertise and infrastructure. We believe that our significant focus in the mortgage market, the extensive mortgage market expertise of our investment team, our strong analytics and our disciplined relative value investment approach give us a competitive advantage versus our peers. 
  We have elected to be treated as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. To qualify as a REIT we are required to meet certain investment and operating tests and annual distribution requirements. We generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes on our taxable income to the extent that we annually distribute all of our net taxable income to stockholders, do not participate in prohibited transactions and maintain our intended qualification as a REIT. However, certain activities that we may perform may cause us to earn income which will not be qualifying income for REIT purposes. We have designated certain of our subsidiaries as taxable REIT subsidiaries, or TRSs, as defined in the Code, to engage in such activities, and we may form additional TRSs in the future. We also operate our business in a manner that will permit us to maintain our exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the 1940 Act. While we do not currently originate or service residential mortgage loans, certain of our subsidiaries have obtained the requisite licenses and approvals to purchase and sell residential mortgage loans in the secondary market and to own and manage MSR. Additionally, certain of our subsidiaries are licensed to originate commercial real estate loans.

Factors Affecting our Operating Results 
  Our net interest income includes income from our RMBS portfolio, including the amortization of purchase premiums and accretion of purchase discounts, and income from our residential mortgage loans and commercial real estate assets. Net interest income, as well as our servicing income, net of subservicing expenses, will fluctuate primarily as a result of changes in market interest rates, our financing costs, and prepayment speeds on our assets. Interest rates, financing costs and prepayment rates vary according to the type of investment, conditions in the financial markets, competition and other factors, none of which can be predicted with any certainty. Our operating results will also be affected by default rates and credit losses with respect to the mortgage loans underlying our non-Agency RMBS and in our residential mortgage loan and commercial real estate portfolios. 

Fair Value Measurement 
  A significant portion of our assets and liabilities are reported at fair value and, therefore, our condensed consolidated balance sheets and statements of   comprehensive income (loss)   are significantly affected by fluctuations in market prices. At   September 30, 2016  , approximately   88.5%   of total assets, or   $19.3 billion  , and approximately   18.6%   of total liabilities, or   $3.4 billion  , consisted of financial instruments recorded at fair value. See   Note 14   -   Fair Value   to the condensed consolidated financial statements, included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, for descriptions of valuation methodologies used to measure material assets and liabilities at fair value and details of the valuation models, key inputs to those models and significant assumptions utilized. Although we execute various hedging strategies to mitigate our exposure to changes in fair value, we cannot fully eliminate our exposure to volatility caused by fluctuations in market prices. Although markets for asset-backed securities, including RMBS, have modestly stabilized since the severe dislocations experienced as a result of the financial crisis, these markets continue to experience volatility and, as a result, our assets and liabilities will be subject to valuation adjustment as well as changes in the inputs we use to measure fair value. 
  Any temporary change in the fair value of our available-for-sale, or AFS, securities, excluding Agency interest-only mortgage-backed securities and GSE credit risk transfer securities, is recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and does not impact our earnings. Our reported   earnings (loss)   for U.S. GAAP purposes, or GAAP   net income (loss)  , is affected, however, by fluctuations in market prices on the remainder of our financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value. For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , our unrealized fair value gains on interest rate swap and swaption agreements, which are accounted for as derivative trading instruments under U.S. GAAP, positively affected our financial results. The change in fair value of interest rate swaps was a result of changes to LIBOR, the swap curve and corresponding counterparty borrowing rates during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . Our financial results for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   were negatively affected by unrealized fair value losses on Agency interest-only mortgage-backed securities and GSE credit risk transfer securities and residential mortgage loans held-for-sale, and positively affected by unrealized fair value gains on net economic interests in consolidated securitization trusts and MSR. Our financial results for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   were positively affected by unrealized fair value gains on Agency interest-only mortgage-backed securities and GSE credit risk transfer securities and residential mortgage loans held-for-sale, and negatively affected by unrealized fair value losses on net economic interests in consolidated securitization trusts and MSR. 
  For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , our unrealized fair value losses on interest rate swap and swaption agreements negatively affected our financial results. The change in fair value of the interest rate swaps was a result of changes to LIBOR, the swap curve and corresponding counterparty borrowing rates during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . Our financial results for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015   were negatively affected by unrealized fair value losses on Agency interest-only mortgage-backed securities and GSE credit risk transfer securities and MSR. For the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  , our financial results were positively affected by unrealized fair value gains on residential mortgage loans held-for-sale and net economic interests in consolidated securitization trusts. Our financial results for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   were negatively affected by unrealized fair value losses on residential mortgage loans held-for-sale and net economic interests in consolidated securitization trusts. 
  In addition, our financial results for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   were affected by the unrealized gains and losses of certain other derivative instruments that were accounted for as trading derivative instruments (  i.e.  , credit default swaps, TBAs, short U.S. Treasuries, put and call options for TBAs and U.S. Treasuries, constant maturity swaps, Markit IOS total return swaps, inverse interest-only securities and forward residential mortgage loan purchase commitments).

We have numerous internal controls in place to help ensure the appropriateness of fair value measurements. Significant fair value measures are subject to detailed analytics and management review and approval. Our entire investment portfolio reported at fair value is priced by third-party brokers and/or by independent pricing providers. We generally receive three or more broker and vendor quotes on pass-through Agency RMBS, and generally receive multiple broker or vendor quotes on all other RMBS instruments, including interest-only Agency RMBS, inverse interest-only Agency RMBS, and non-Agency RMBS. We also typically receive two vendor quotes for the residential mortgage loans and MSR in our investment portfolio. For Agency RMBS, the third-party pricing providers and brokers use pricing models that commonly incorporate such factors as coupons, primary and secondary mortgage rates, rate reset period, issuer, prepayment speeds, credit enhancements and expected life of the security. For non-Agency RMBS, the third-party pricing providers and brokers utilize both observable and unobservable inputs such as pool specific characteristics (  i.e.  , loan age, loan size, credit quality of borrowers, vintage, servicer quality), floating rate indices, prepayment and default assumptions, and recent trading of the same or similar securities. For residential mortgage loans and MSR, vendors use pricing models that generally incorporate observable inputs such as principal balance, note rate, geographical location, loan-to-value (LTV) ratios, FICO, appraised value and other loan characteristics, along with observed market yields, securitization economics and trading levels. Additionally for MSR, pricing providers will customarily incorporate loan servicing cost, servicing fee, ancillary income, and earnings rate on escrow as observable inputs. Unobservable or model-driven inputs include forecast cumulative defaults, default curve, forecast loss severity and forecast voluntary prepayment. 
  We evaluate the prices we receive from both brokers and independent pricing providers by comparing those prices to actual purchase and sale transactions, our internally modeled prices calculated based on market observable rates and credit spreads, and to each other both in current and prior periods. We review and may challenge broker quotes and valuations from third-party pricing providers to ensure that such quotes and valuations are indicative of fair value as a result of this analysis. We then estimate the fair value of each security based upon the median of the final broker quotes received, and we estimate the fair value of residential mortgage loans and MSR based upon the average of prices received from independent providers, subject to internally-established hierarchy and override procedures. 
  We utilize  bid side  pricing for our RMBS assets and, as a result, certain assets, especially the most recent purchases, may realize a markdown due to the  bid-offer  spread. To the extent that this occurs, any economic effect of this would be reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income.  
  Considerable judgment is used in forming conclusions and estimating inputs to our Level 3 fair value measurements. Level 3 inputs such as interest rate movements, prepayments speeds, credit losses and discount rates are inherently difficult to estimate. Changes to these inputs can have a significant effect on fair value measurements. Accordingly, there is no assurance that our estimates of fair value are indicative of the amounts that would be realized on the ultimate sale or exchange of these assets. 

Market Conditions and Outlook 
  The key macroeconomic factors that impact our business are U.S. residential and commercial property prices, national employment rates and the interest rate environment. Home prices increased modestly through the third quarter of 2016 and are expected to gradually appreciate over the next several years. Credit standards remain tight, despite a modest easing in recent months, and have limited borrowers  ability to refinance their mortgages notwithstanding low interest rates and government programs that promote refinancing. Employment market conditions remain relatively solid as jobless claims, unemployment and payroll data are showing stability, although underemployment levels remain stubbornly high and new job creation has been disappointing. Other than LTV ratios and cash reserves, we believe employment is the most powerful determinant of homeowners  ongoing likelihood to pay their mortgages. Home price performance and employment are particularly important to our non-Agency portfolio. 
  The interest rate environment remained volatile in the third quarter of 2016 as a result of domestic economic data and international events. Interest rates decreased at the beginning of the third quarter following Britain s vote to exit the European Union, and did not experience much improvement throughout the remainder of the quarter. This had the effect of driving down inflation expectations and dimming the outlook for global growth. The low interest rate environment is expected to persist in the near term, as the Federal Reserve has suggested it will take a measured and conservative approach to future interest rate decisions. Additionally, it appears the Federal Reserve will continue to reinvest its mortgage-backed security principal repayments for the foreseeable future. 
  The U.S. economy continues to navigate headwinds that include: global economic lethargy, specifically in China; geopolitical unrest across various regions worldwide; the ongoing European debt crisis; quantitative easing by the European Central Bank; and persistently high underemployment.

Regulatory and legislative actions taken in response to the financial and foreclosure crises continue to impact the market. Regulatory actions that could affect the value and availability of our target assets, either positively or negatively, include: attempts by the U.S. government or the GSEs to establish long-term simplifying changes to the refinancing process to allow more borrowers to refinance into lower interest rate mortgage loans; any new programs or standards established after the expiration of both the Home Affordable Modification Program, or HAMP, and the Home Affordable Refinance Program 2.0, or HARP 2.0, at the end of 2016; the strict  ability-to-repay  and  qualified mortgage  regulations promulgated by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or the CFPB; the compliance with, enforcement of and potential liability associated with the new TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure, or TRID, rules recently implemented by the CFPB; and the application of the risk retention requirements of Section 15G of the Exchange Act. Additionally, the implementation of bank capital and liquidity rules could affect both the financing and liquidity of our target assets. 
  There have also been a number of legislative proposals aimed at eventually winding down or phasing out the GSEs. It remains uncertain as to whether any such proposal will ultimately become legislation, as recent efforts appear to have little momentum in Congress. We will continue to monitor these and other regulatory and policy activities closely. 
  In January 2016, the FHFA released a final rule regarding membership in the Federal Home Loan Bank system. Among other effects, the final rule excludes captive insurers from membership eligibility, including our subsidiary member, TH Insurance Holdings Company LLC, or TH Insurance. Since TH Insurance was admitted as a member in 2013, it is eligible for a five-year membership grace period, during which new advances or renewals that mature beyond the grace period will be prohibited; however, any existing advances that mature beyond this grace period will be permitted to remain in place subject to their terms insofar as we maintain good standing with the FHLB. If any new advances or renewals occur, TH Insurance s outstanding advances will be limited to 40% of its total assets. Notwithstanding the FHFA s ruling, we continue to believe our mission aligns well with that of the Federal Home Loan Bank system. 
  We believe our blended Agency and non-Agency RMBS portfolio and our investing expertise, as well as our operational capabilities to invest in net economic interests in consolidated securitization trusts, MSR and commercial real estate assets, will allow us to better navigate the dynamic mortgage market while future regulatory and policy activities take shape. Having a diversified portfolio allows us to mitigate a variety of risks, including interest rate and RMBS spread volatility. As such, we have diversified into several target assets that capitalize on our prepayment and credit expertise. 
  We expect that the majority of our assets will remain in whole-pool Agency RMBS in light of the long-term attractiveness of the asset class and in order to continue to satisfy the requirements of our exemption from registration under the 1940 Act. Interest-only Agency securities and MSR also provide a complementary investment and risk-management strategy to our principal and interest Agency RMBS investments. Risk-adjusted returns in our Agency RMBS portfolio may decline if we are required to pay higher purchase premiums due to lower interest rates or additional liquidity in the market. Additionally, the Federal Reserve s prior quantitative easing programs and continued reinvestment of its mortgage-backed security principal repayments and other policy changes may impact the returns of our Agency RMBS portfolio. 
  The following table provides the carrying value of our RMBS portfolio by product type:

Prepayment speeds and volatility due to interest rates  
  Our Agency RMBS and MSR portfolios are subject to inherent prepayment risk. Generally, a decline in interest rates that leads to rising prepayment speeds will cause the market value of our interest-only securities and MSR to deteriorate, and our fixed coupon Agency pools to increase. The inverse relationship occurs when interest rates increase and prepayments slow. As previously discussed, despite the Federal Reserve raising rates in December 2015, the low interest rate environment is expected to persist in the near term. However, changes in home price performance, key employment metrics and government programs, among other macroeconomic factors, could cause prepayment speeds to increase on many RMBS, which could lead to less attractive reinvestment opportunities. Nonetheless, we believe our portfolio management approach, including our security selection process, positions us to respond to a variety of market scenarios, including an overall faster prepayment environment. 
  Although we are unable to predict the movement in interest rates in   2016   and beyond, our diversified portfolio management strategy is intended to generate attractive yields with a low level of sensitivity to changes in the yield curve, prepayments and interest rate cycles. 
  Our Agency RMBS are collateralized by pools of fixed-rate mortgage loans and hybrid adjustable-rate mortgage loans, or hybrid ARMs, which are mortgage loans that have interest rates that are fixed for an initial period and adjustable thereafter. Our Agency portfolio also includes securities with implicit or explicit prepayment protection, including lower loan balances (securities collateralized by loans of less than $175,000 in initial principal balance), higher LTVs (securities collateralized by loans with LTVs greater than or equal to 80%), certain geographic concentrations and lower FICO scores. Our overall allocation of Agency RMBS and holdings of pools with specific characteristics are viewed in the context of our aggregate rates strategy, including MSR and related derivative hedging instruments. Additionally, the selection of securities with certain attributes is driven by the perceived relative value of the securities, which factors in the opportunities in the marketplace, the cost of financing and the cost of hedging interest rate, prepayment, credit and other portfolio risks. As a result, Agency RMBS capital allocation reflects management s opportunistic approach to investing in the marketplace. 
  The following tables provide the carrying value of our Agency RMBS portfolio by underlying mortgage loan rate type:

We offset a portion of the Agency exposure to prepayment speeds through our non-Agency portfolio. Our non-Agency RMBS yields are expected to increase if prepayment rates on such assets exceed our prepayment assumptions. To the extent that prepayment speeds increase due to macroeconomic factors, we expect to benefit from the ability to recognize the income from the heavily discounted RMBS prices that principally arose from credit or payment default expectations. 
  The following tables provide discount information on our non-Agency RMBS portfolio: 

Credit losses  
  Although our Agency portfolio is supported by U.S. government agency and federally chartered corporation guarantees of payment of principal and interest, we are exposed to credit risk in our non-Agency RMBS, residential mortgage loans and commercial real estate assets.

     Table of Contents  

The credit support built into non-Agency RMBS deal structures is designed to provide a level of protection from potential credit losses for more senior tranches. We evaluate credit risk on our non-Agency investments through a comprehensive asset selection process, which is predominantly focused on quantifying and pricing credit risk, including extensive initial modeling and scenario analysis. In addition, the discounted purchase prices paid for our non-Agency RMBS provide additional insulation from credit losses in the event we receive less than 100% of par on such assets. At purchase, we estimate the portion of the discount we do not expect to recover and factor that into our expected yield and accretion methodology. We may also record an other-than-temporary impairment, or OTTI, for a portion of our investment in a security to the extent we believe that the amortized cost exceeds the present value of expected future cash flows. We review our non-Agency RMBS on an ongoing basis using quantitative and qualitative analysis of the risk-adjusted returns on such investments and through on-going asset surveillance. Nevertheless, unanticipated credit losses could occur, adversely impacting our operating results.  
  We evaluate credit risk on our residential mortgage loans through a comprehensive asset selection process, which includes pre-acquisition due diligence and underwriting. We review our residential mortgage loans on an ongoing basis using quantitative and qualitative analysis and through on-going asset surveillance.  
  We also evaluate credit risk on our commercial real estate assets through a comprehensive asset selection process, which includes valuing the underlying collateral property as well as the financial and operating capability of the borrower, borrowing entity or loan sponsor. We also assess the financial wherewithal of any loan guarantors, the borrower s competency in managing and operating the properties, and the overall economic environment, real estate sector, and geographic sub-market in which the borrower operates. We evaluate each commercial real estate asset for impairment at least quarterly and may record an allowance to reduce the carrying value of the asset to the present value of expected future cash flows, if deemed impaired. 
  Counterparty exposure and leverage ratio  
  We monitor counterparty exposure in our broker, banking and lending counterparties on a daily basis. We believe our broker and banking counterparties are well-capitalized organizations and we attempt to manage our cash balances across these organizations to reduce our exposure to a single counterparty.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had entered into repurchase agreements with   31   counterparties,   22   of which had outstanding balances at   September 30, 2016  , including   two   facilities that provide short-term financing for our commercial real estate collateral with outstanding balances at   September 30, 2016  . In addition, we held both short- and long-term secured advances from the FHLB as well as short-term borrowings under revolving credit facilities. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had a total consolidated debt-to-equity ratio of   5.2  :1.0. The debt-to-equity ratio funding our RMBS AFS, residential mortgage loans held-for-sale, commercial real estate assets, MSR and Agency Derivatives only was   4.2  :1.0. We believe the debt-to-equity ratio funding our RMBS AFS, residential mortgage loans held-for-sale, commercial real estate assets, MSR and Agency Derivatives is the most meaningful debt-to-equity measure as collateralized borrowings on residential mortgage loans held-for-investment in securitization trusts represents term financing with no stated maturity.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $688.4 million   in cash and cash equivalents, approximately   $3.1 million   of unpledged Agency securities and derivatives and   $26.8 million   of unpledged non-Agency securities and retained interests from our on-balance sheet securitizations, which are eliminated in consolidation in accordance with U.S. GAAP. As a result, we had an overall estimated unused borrowing capacity on our unpledged RMBS and retained interests of approximately   $20.7 million  . We also had approximately   $23.1 million   of unpledged prime nonconforming residential mortgage loans,   $10.5 million   of unpledged CSL, and   $56.9 million   of unpledged Ginnie Mae buyout residential mortgage loans, and an overall estimated unused borrowing capacity on unpledged residential mortgage loans held-for-sale of approximately   $72.0 million  . As of   September 30, 2016  , we had approximately   $44.0 million   of unpledged mezzanine commercial real estate loans and   $73.4 million   of unpledged commercial real estate first mortgages, and an overall estimated unused borrowing capacity on unpledged commercial real estate assets of approximately   $78.3 million  . We also had approximately   $382.1 million   of unpledged MSR with no unused borrowing capacity on unpledged MSR. If borrowing rates and collateral requirements change in the near term, we believe we are subject to less earnings volatility than if we carried higher leverage. 
  We also monitor exposure to counterparties involved in our mortgage loan conduit and MSR businesses. In connection with securitization transactions and MSR assets, we are required to make certain representations and warranties to the investors in the RMBS we issue or the loans underlying the MSR we own. If the representations and warranties that we are required to make prove to be inaccurate, we may be obligated to repurchase certain mortgage loans, which may impact the profitability of these businesses. Although we obtain similar representations and warranties from the counterparty from which we acquired the relevant asset, if those representations and warranties do not directly mirror those we make to the investor, or if we are unable to enforce the representations and warranties against the counterparty for a variety of reasons, including the financial condition or insolvency of the counterparty, we may not be able to seek indemnification from our counterparties for any losses attributable to the breach.

Summary of Results of Operations and Financial Condition 
  Our GAAP net income was   $117.8 million   and   $11.9 million   (  $0.34   and   $0.03   per weighted share) for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , as compared to GAAP net loss of   $34.8 million   and income of   $281.5 million   (  $(0.09)   and   $0.77   per weighted share) for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .  
  With our accounting treatment for AFS securities, unrealized fluctuations in the market values of AFS securities, excluding Agency interest-only securities and GSE credit risk transfer securities, do not impact our GAAP   net income (loss)   or taxable income but are recognized on our condensed consolidated balance sheets as a change in stockholders  equity under  accumulated other comprehensive income.  As a result of this fair value accounting through stockholders  equity, we expect our   net income (loss)   to have less significant fluctuations and result in less U.S. GAAP to taxable income timing differences, than if the portfolio were accounted for as trading instruments. For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , net unrealized gains on AFS securities recognized as other comprehensive income, net of tax, were   $18.7 million   and   $179.4 million  , respectively. This, combined with GAAP net income of   $117.8 million   and   $11.9 million  , resulted in comprehensive income of   $136.5 million   and   $191.3 million   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively. For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , net unrealized losses on AFS securities recognized as other comprehensive loss, net of tax, were   $58.0 million   and   $282.8 million  , respectively. This, combined with GAAP net loss of   $34.8 million   and income of   $281.5 million  , resulted in comprehensive loss of   $92.8 million   and   $1.3 million   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively. 
  On   September 15, 2016  , we declared a cash dividend of   $0.23   per share. Our book value per common share for U.S. GAAP purposes was   $10.01   at   September 30, 2016  ,   a decrease   from   $10.11   book value per common share at   December 31, 2015  . During this   nine month period  , we recognized comprehensive income of   $191.3 million  , but declared cash dividends of   $239.8 million  , which drove the overall   decrease   in book value.

    Average balance represents average amortized cost on AFS securities, trading securities, commercial real estate assets and Agency Derivatives and average unpaid principal balance, adjusted for purchase price changes, on residential mortgage loans held-for-sale and residential mortgage loans held-for-investment in securitization trusts. 
              (2) 
    Interest income on Agency Derivatives is included in   loss on other derivative instruments   on the   condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss)  . 
       
  Total interest income, including interest income on Agency Derivatives, increased from   $158.8 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015   to   $172.4 million   for the same period in   2016  , while interest income decreased from   $488.9 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   to   $468.5 million   for the same period in   2016  . The increase in interest income for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , as compared to the same period in   2015  , was primarily due to the completion of multiple securitization transactions in 2015 and 2016 and the growth of the commercial real estate portfolio. The decrease in interest income for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , as compared to the same period in   2015  , was due primarily to sales of AFS and trading securities, offset by the completion of multiple securitization transactions in 2015 and 2016 and the growth of the commercial real estate portfolio. 
  The decrease in net yields on AFS securities for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , as compared to the same periods in   2015  , was predominantly driven by purchases of Agency RMBS AFS, specifically generic and specified pools, with lower yields during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . We did not recognize any interest income on trading securities during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   as we sold our trading security position during 2015. The increase in net yields on residential mortgage loans held-for-sale for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , as compared to the same periods in   2015  , was due in part to the Ginnie Mae buyout residential mortgage loans held throughout the period that underwent successful modifications, returned to performing loans, and were redelivered to future Ginnie Mae pools. Yields on residential mortgage loans held-for-investment in securitization trusts for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   were consistent with those for the same periods in   2015  . The yield on commercial real estate assets for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015   represents interest income on one asset settled during the first quarter of 2015 and eight assets settled during the third quarter of 2015, which, as a result, is not comparable to the yield for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . The decrease in net yields on Agency Derivatives for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , as compared to the same periods in   2015  , was driven by overall faster prepayments throughout the period. 
  The following tables present the components of the net yield earned by investment type on our RMBS AFS portfolio as a percentage of our average amortized cost of securities for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  :

  The decrease in net yields on Agency RMBS AFS for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , as compared to the same periods in   2015  , was predominantly driven by purchases of Agency RMBS AFS, specifically generic and specified pools, with lower yields during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . The increase in net yields on non-Agency RMBS for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , as compared to the same periods in   2015  , was due to continued improvement in legacy non-Agency fundamentals, credit performance and prepayments.

Interest Expense and the Cost of Funds 
  The following tables present the components of interest expense and average annualized cost of funds on borrowings incurred by investment type on our AFS securities, Agency Derivatives, trading securities, residential mortgage loans held-for-sale, residential mortgage loans held-for-investment in securitization trusts and commercial real estate assets for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  :

           (1) 
    Average balance represents average total repurchase agreements and FHLB advances on AFS securities, Agency Derivatives, trading securities, residential mortgage loans held-for-sale and commercial real estate assets, and average collateralized borrowings for residential mortgage loans held-for-investment in securitization trusts. 
              (2) 
    Cost of funds by investment type is based on the underlying investment type of the asset assigned as collateral. Cost of funds does not include the accrual and settlement of interest associated with interest rate swaps. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, those costs are included in   gain (loss) on interest rate swap and swaption agreements   in the   condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss)  . For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , our total average cost of funds on the assets assigned as collateral for repurchase agreements, FHLB advances and collateralized borrowings shown in the table above, including interest spread expense associated with interest rate swaps, was   1.5%   and   1.6%  , respectively, compared to   1.6%   and   1.6%   for the same periods in   2015  . 
              (3) 
    Excludes Agency Derivatives. For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , our average cost of funds on total Agency RMBS, including Agency Derivatives, was   0.8%   and   0.7%  , respectively, compared to   0.5%   and   0.4%   for the same periods in   2015  . 
              (4) 
    Includes repurchase agreements and FHLB advances collateralized by retained interests from our on-balance sheet securitizations, which are eliminated in consolidation in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

Total interest expense increased from   $37.1 million   and   $105.6 million   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015   to   $60.2 million   and   $155.6 million   for the same periods in   2016  , due primarily to increased interest expense on collateralized borrowings due to the completion of multiple securitization transactions in 2015 and 2016, commercial real estate assets and Agency RMBS AFS due to purchases. 
  The increase in cost of funds associated with the financing of Agency RMBS AFS, non-Agency RMBS and Agency Derivatives for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , as compared to the same periods in   2015  , was the result of increases in the repurchase agreement borrowing rates offered by counterparties. We did not recognize any interest expense on the financing of trading securities during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   as we sold our trading securities position during 2015. The increase in cost of funds associated with the financing of residential mortgage loans held-for-sale for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , as compared to the same periods in   2015  , was the result of an increase in the borrowing rate offered by the FHLB. The increase in cost of funds associated with the financing of residential mortgage loans held-for-investment in securitization trusts for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , as compared to the same periods in   2015  , was primarily the result of the sale of and corresponding removal of FHLB financing on higher-rated retained interests from our on-balance sheet securitizations. The cost of funds on commercial real estate assets for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015   represents repurchase agreement financing interest expense on one asset started in May 2015 which, as a result, is not comparable to the cost of funds for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  .  
  Net Interest Income 
  The following tables present the components of net interest income and average annualized net interest rate spread earned by investment type on our AFS securities, trading securities, residential mortgage loans held-for-sale, residential mortgage loans held-for-investment in securitization trusts, commercial real estate assets and Agency Derivatives for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  :

           (1) 
    Net interest rate spread does not include the accrual and settlement of interest associated with interest rate swaps. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, those costs are included in   gain (loss) on interest rate swap and swaption agreements   in the   condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss)  . For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , our total average net interest rate spread on the assets shown in the table above, including interest spread expense associated with interest rate swaps, was   2.2%   and   2.3%  , respectively, compared to   2.5%   and   2.2%   for the same periods in   2015  . 
              (2) 
    Excludes Agency Derivatives. For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , our average annualized net interest rate spread on total Agency RMBS, including Agency Derivatives, was   2.0%   and   2.3%  , respectively, compared to   2.8%   and   2.9%   for the same periods in   2015  . 
              (3) 
    Interest income on Agency Derivatives is included in   loss on other derivative instruments   on the   condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss)  , while interest expense on Agency Derivatives is included in interest expense on repurchase agreements on the   condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss)  . 
              (4) 
    Net of interest expense on repurchase agreements and FHLB advances collateralized by retained interests from our on-balance sheet securitizations, which are eliminated in consolidation in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 
       
  The decrease in net interest rate spread on Agency RMBS AFS, Agency Derivatives and residential mortgage loans held-for-sale for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , as compared to the same periods in   2015  , was predominantly driven by higher financing rates, as discussed above. The increase in net interest rate spread on non-Agency RMBS for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , as compared to the same period in   2015  , was due to continued improvement in legacy non-Agency fundamentals, credit performance and prepayments. The net interest rate spread on non-Agency RMBS for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was consistent with that for the same period in   2015  . We did not recognize any interest income or expense on trading securities during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   as we sold our trading security position during 2015. The decrease in net interest spread on our residential mortgage loans held-for-investment in securitization trusts for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , as compared to the same periods in   2015  , was the result of sales of higher-rated retained interests from our on-balance sheet securitizations. The net interest rate spread on commercial real estate assets for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015   represents interest income on one asset settled during the first quarter of 2015 and eight assets settled during the third quarter of 2015, net of interest expense on one repurchase agreement started in May 2015, which, as a result, is not comparable to the spreads for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  .  
  Other-Than-Temporary Impairments 
  We review each of our securities on a quarterly basis to determine if an OTTI charge is necessary. For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we recognized   $1.0 million   and   $1.8 million   in OTTI losses, respectively. For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , we recognized   $0.2 million   and   $0.5 million   in OTTI losses, respectively. For further information about evaluating AFS securities for OTTI, refer to   Note 4   -   Available-for-Sale Securities, at Fair Value   of the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements.

Gain on Investment Securities  
  During the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we sold AFS securities for   $2.8 billion   and   $6.6 billion   with an amortized cost of   $2.8 billion   and   $6.5 billion  , for net realized gains of   $31.8 million   and   $63.3 million  , respectively. During the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , we sold AFS securities for   $1.1 billion   and   $3.7 billion   with an amortized cost of   $1.0 billion   and   $3.4 billion  , for net realized gains of   $66.5 million   and   $259.8 million  , respectively. We also sold trading securities for   $2.0 billion   with an amortized cost of   $2.0 billion  , resulting in realized gains of   $7.4 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . We did not sell any trading securities during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   or the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  . We do not expect to sell assets on a frequent basis, but may sell assets to reallocate capital into new assets that we believe have higher risk-adjusted returns. 
  For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , Agency interest-only mortgage-backed securities and GSE credit risk transfer securities experienced a change in unrealized losses of   $3.5 million   and a change in unrealized gains of   $2.7 million  , respectively. For both the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , Agency interest-only mortgage-backed securities and GSE credit risk transfer securities experienced a change in unrealized losses of   $2.3 million  . The changes in unrealized gains and losses for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , as compared to the same periods in   2015  , were impacted by increased prepayment expectations on Agency interest-only mortgage-backed securities, offset by continued improvement in fundamentals, credit performance and prepayments on GSE credit risk transfer securities. 
  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , trading securities experienced a change in unrealized losses   $1.4 million  . We did not hold any trading securities during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   or the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  . The decrease in change in unrealized losses on trading securities for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , as compared to the same periods in   2015  , was driven by the sale of our trading security position during 2015. 
  Gain (Loss) on Interest Rate Swap and Swaption Agreements  
  For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we recognized   $4.3 million   and   $18.1 million  , respectively, of expenses for the accrual and/or settlement of the net interest expense associated with our interest rate swaps. The expenses result from paying either a fixed interest rate or LIBOR interest on an average   $14.5 billion   and   $14.8 billion   notional, respectively, to economically hedge/mitigate interest rate exposure (or duration) risk associated with our investment portfolio and our short-term repurchase agreements and FHLB advances, and receiving either LIBOR interest or a fixed interest rate. For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , we recognized   $19.4 million   and   $73.1 million  , respectively, of expenses for the accrual and/or settlement of the net interest expense associated with our interest rate swaps. The expenses result from paying either a fixed interest rate or LIBOR interest on an average   $15.4 billion   and   $16.8 billion   notional, respectively, to economically hedge/mitigate interest rate exposure (or duration) risk associated with our investment portfolio and our short-term repurchase agreements and FHLB advances, and receiving either LIBOR interest or a fixed interest rate. 
  During the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we terminated, had agreements mature or had options expire on   26   and   81   interest rate swap and swaption positions of   $1.2 billion   and   $20.9 billion   notional, respectively. Upon settlement of the early terminations and option expirations, we paid   $0.7 million   and   $2.7 million   in full settlement of our net interest spread liability and recognized   $95.1 million   and   $119.5 million   in realized losses on the swaps and swaptions for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, including early termination penalties. During the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , we terminated, had agreements mature or had options expire on   25   and   69   interest rate swap and swaption positions of   $17.9 billion   and   $47.4 billion   notional, respectively. Upon settlement of the early terminations and option expirations, we paid   $4.7 million   and   $32.3 million   in full settlement of our net interest spread liability and recognized   $61.9 million   and   $125.0 million   in realized losses on the swaps and swaptions for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively, including early termination penalties. We elected to terminate certain swaps and swaptions during these periods to align with our investment portfolio.  
  Also included in our financial results for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , was the recognition of a change in unrealized valuation gains of   $104.9 million   and   $5.1 million  , respectively, on our interest rate swap and swaption agreements that were accounted for as trading instruments, compared to a change in unrealized valuation losses of   $90.3 million   and   $55.1 million   for the same periods in   2015  . The change in fair value of interest rate swaps was a result of changes to LIBOR, the swap curve and corresponding counterparty borrowing rates during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  . Since these swaps and swaptions are used for purposes of hedging our interest rate exposure, their unrealized valuation gains and losses are generally offset by unrealized losses and gains in our Agency RMBS AFS portfolio, which are recorded either directly to stockholders  equity through   other comprehensive income (loss)  , net of tax, or to   gain on investment securities  , in the case of Agency interest-only securities.

Loss on Other Derivative Instruments  
  Included in our financial results for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , was the recognition of   $12.0 million   and   $44.1 million   of losses, respectively, on other derivative instruments we hold for purposes of both hedging and non-hedging activities, principally credit default swaps, TBAs, put and call options for TBAs, Markit IOS total return swaps and inverse interest-only securities. Included within these results for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , was the recognition of   $4.0 million   and   $15.4 million   of interest income, net of accretion on inverse interest-only securities on an average amortized cost basis of   $119.0 million   and   $123.1 million  , respectively. The remainder represented realized and unrealized net gains (losses) on other derivative instruments. As these derivative instruments are considered trading instruments, our financial results include both realized and unrealized gains (losses) associated with these instruments.  
  Included in our financial results for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , was the recognition of   $0.5 million   and   $3.0 million   of losses, respectively, on other derivative instruments we hold for purposes of both hedging and non-hedging activities, principally credit default swaps, TBAs, short U.S. Treasuries, put and call options for TBAs and U.S. Treasuries, constant maturity swaps, Markit IOS total return swaps and inverse interest-only securities. Included within these results for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , was the recognition of   $6.2 million   and   $21.3 million   of interest income, net of accretion on inverse interest-only securities on an average amortized cost basis of   $151.0 million   and   $155.9 million  , respectively. The remainder represented realized and unrealized net gains (losses) on other derivative instruments. Since our derivative instruments are generally used for purposes of hedging our interest rate and credit risk exposure, their unrealized valuation gains and losses are generally offset by unrealized losses and gains in our RMBS AFS and residential mortgage loan portfolios. 
  (Loss) Gain on Residential Mortgage Loans Held-for-Sale  
  For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we recorded losses of   $0.9 million   and gains of   $17.6 million  , respectively, on residential mortgage loans held-for-sale. Included within these results was the recognition of losses of   $1.0 million   and gains of   $15.2 million  , respectively, on residential mortgage loans held-for-sale and gains of   $0.1 million   and   $2.5 million   on commitments to purchase residential mortgage loans held-for-sale for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively. For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , we recorded gains of   $16.0 million   and   $18.3 million  , respectively, on residential mortgage loans held-for-sale. Included within these results was the recognition of gains of   $13.2 million   and   $19.6 million  , respectively, on residential mortgage loans held-for-sale and gains of   $2.8 million   and losses of   $1.3 million   on commitments to purchase residential mortgage loans held-for-sale for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively. The decrease in gains on residential mortgage loans held-for-sale during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , as compared to the same period in   2015  , was generally due to lower realized gains on the redelivery of Ginnie Mae buyout residential mortgage loans to future Ginnie Mae pools. The decrease in gain on residential mortgage loans held-for-sale during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , as compared to the same period in   2015  , was due to lower realized gains on the redelivery of Ginnie Mae buyout residential mortgage loans to future Ginnie Mae pools, offset by higher unrealized gains on prime nonconforming residential mortgage loans driven by interest rates generally falling during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , as compared to interest rates generally rising during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .

Servicing Income 
  For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we recognized total servicing income of   $38.7 million   and   $108.7 million  , respectively. These amounts include servicing fee income of   $37.2 million   and   $104.8 million  , ancillary fee income of   $0.4 million   and   $1.4 million  , and float income of   $1.0 million   and   $2.5 million  , respectively. For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , we recognized total servicing income of   $32.0 million   and   $94.6 million  , respectively. These amounts include servicing fee income of   $31.1 million   and   $91.9 million  , ancillary fee income of   $0.5 million   and   $1.6 million  , and float income of   $0.4 million   and   $1.1 million  , respectively. The increase in servicing income for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , as compared to the same periods in   2015  , was the result of an increase in the size of our MSR portfolio. 
  Loss on Servicing Asset  
  For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , loss on servicing asset of   $33.5 million   and   $211.4 million  , respectively, includes a decrease in fair value of MSR due to realization of cash flows (runoff) of   $18.2 million   and   $52.8 million  , respectively, and an increase in fair value of MSR due to changes in valuation inputs or assumptions of   $3.8 million   and a decrease in fair value of MSR due to changes in valuation inputs or assumptions of   $139.6 million  , respectively. Additionally, we recognized losses on sales of MSR of   $19.1 million   for both the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , loss on servicing asset of   $61.5 million   and   $96.3 million  , respectively, includes a decrease in fair value of MSR due to realization of cash flows (runoff) of   $12.1 million   and   $32.7 million  , respectively, and a decrease in fair value of MSR due to changes in valuation inputs or assumptions of   $49.4 million   and   $63.6 million  , respectively. The decrease in loss on servicing asset for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , as compared to the same period in   2015  , was the result of prepayment speed assumptions decreasing throughout the three months ended September 30, 2016, as opposed to prepayment speed assumptions increasing throughout the three months ended September 30, 2015, which was partially offset by higher actual prepayment speeds and losses on sales of MSR during the three months ended September 30, 2016. The increase in loss on servicing asset for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , as compared to the same period in   2015  , was generally driven by an increase in prepayment speed assumptions as well as losses on sales of MSR during the three months ended September 30, 2016. 
  Other Income (Loss) 
  For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we recorded other income of   $5.8 million   and other loss of   $1.0 million  , which includes   $24.6 million   and   $63.7 million   in gains on residential mortgage loans held-for-investment in securitization trusts and   $20.4 million   and   $68.9 million   in losses, respectively, on collateralized borrowings in securitization trusts. Also included in other income (loss) for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was other mortgage loan revenue of   $0.1 million   and   $0.2 million   and dividend income on our FHLB stock of   $1.4 million   and   $4.1 million  , respectively. For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , we recorded other income of   $2.2 million   and other loss of   $16.3 million  , which includes   $16.0 million   in gains and   $33.1 million   in losses, respectively, on residential mortgage loans held-for-investment in securitization trusts and   $14.9 million   in losses and   $13.6 million   in gains, respectively, on collateralized borrowings in securitization trusts. Also included in other income (loss) for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015   was other mortgage loan revenue of   $0.1 million   and   $0.4 million   and dividend income on our FHLB stock of   $1.0 million   and   $2.7 million  , respectively. The decrease in other loss for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , as compared to the same period in   2015  , was due in part to the sale of retained interests from our on-balance sheet securitizations during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  . The increase in other income for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , as compared to the same period in   2015  , was driven by interest rates generally falling during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , as compared to interest rates generally rising during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . 
   
  Management Fees 
  We incurred management fees of   $11.4 million   and   $35.3 million   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   $12.6 million   and   $38.0 million   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively, which are payable to PRCM Advisers, our external manager, under our management agreement. The management fee is calculated based on our stockholders  equity with certain adjustments outlined in the management agreement. See further discussion of the management fee calculation in   Note 24   -   Related Party Transactions   of the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  Securitization Deal Costs 
  For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we recognized   $2.1 million   and   $6.2 million  , respectively, in upfront costs related to the sponsoring of securitization trusts, compared to   $2.7 million   and   $7.8 million   for the same periods in   2015  . These costs are included when evaluating the economics of a securitization; however, the election of the fair value option for the assets and liabilities held in the securitization trusts requires the expense to be recognized upfront on the   condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss)  . Changes in securitization deal costs are directly related to the number and size of securitization trusts sponsored by either third parties or our subsidiaries during the respective periods.

Servicing Expenses 
  For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we recognized   $9.1 million   and   $24.5 million  , respectively, in servicing expenses generally related to the subservicing of residential mortgage loans, commercial real estate assets and MSR, compared to   $7.2 million   and   $19.8 million   for the same periods in   2015  . Included in servicing expenses for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was MSR representation and warranty reserve expense of   $1.1 million   and   $1.9 million  , respectively, compared to MSR representation and warranty reserve expense of   $0.4 million   and a decrease in the MSR representation and warranty reserve of   $0.5 million   for the same respective periods in   2015  . The increase in servicing expenses during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , as compared to the same periods in   2015  , was the result of an increase in the size of our MSR portfolio and an increase in the MSR representation and warranty reserve. 
  Other Operating Expenses 
  For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we recognized   $14.8 million   and   $47.3 million   of other operating expenses, which represents an annualized expense ratio of   1.7%   and   1.8%   of average equity, respectively. For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , we recognized   $16.1 million   and   $48.0 million   of other operating expenses, which represents an annualized expense ratio of   1.6%   of average equity for both respective periods. The increase of our operating expense ratio resulted primarily from a decrease in our average equity balance due to share repurchases in 2015 and 2016. 
  Included in other operating expenses are direct and allocated costs incurred by PRCM Advisers on our behalf and reimbursed by us. For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , these direct and allocated costs totaled approximately   $6.3 million   and   $19.1 million  , respectively, compared to   $5.9 million   and   $16.0 million   for the same periods in   2015  . Included in these reimbursed costs was compensation paid to employees of Pine River serving as our principal financial officer and general counsel of   $0.2 million   and   $1.6 million   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   $0.2 million   and   $1.5 million   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively. The allocation of compensation paid to employees of Pine River serving as our principal financial officer and general counsel is based on time spent overseeing our company s activities in accordance with the management agreement; we do not reimburse PRCM Advisers for any expenses related to the compensation of our chief executive officer or chief investment officer. Equity based compensation expense for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   also includes the amortization of the restricted stock awarded to our executive officers in conjunction with the Company s Second Restated 2009 Equity Incentive Plan, or the Plan (see discussion in   Note 20   -   Equity Incentive Plan  ), including our chief executive officer, chief investment officer, principal financial officer and general counsel of   $1.7 million   and   $5.6 million  , compared to   $1.0 million   and   $3.5 million   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively. 
  We have direct relationships with the majority of our third-party vendors. We will continue to have certain costs allocated to us by PRCM Advisers for compensation, data services, proprietary technology and certain office lease payments, but most of our expenses with third-party vendors are paid directly by us.  
  Restructuring Charges 
  On July 28, 2016, we announced that our board of directors had approved a plan to discontinue our mortgage loan conduit and securitization business. This decision was made due to the challenging market environment facing the business, combined with the intent to reduce operating complexity and costs, and will allow for the reallocation of capital to more attractive and efficient target assets. The wind down process is expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2016. 
  In connection with the closure, we incurred restructuring charges, including termination benefits, contract terminations and other associated costs, of   $1.2 million   for both the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . 
  Income Taxes 
  During the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , our TRSs recognized a benefit from income taxes of   $16.8 million   and   $26.1 million  , respectively, which was primarily due to losses incurred on MSR and derivative instruments held in the Company s TRSs. During the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , our TRSs recognized a benefit from income taxes of   $7.7 million   and   $25.3 million  , respectively, which was primarily due to losses incurred on MSR and derivative instruments held in the Company s TRSs. We currently intend to distribute 100% of our REIT taxable income and comply with all requirements to continue to qualify as a REIT. 

Financial Condition 
  Available-for-Sale Securities, at Fair Value 
  Agency RMBS 
  Our Agency RMBS AFS portfolio is comprised of adjustable rate and fixed rate mortgage-backed securities backed by single-family and multi-family mortgage loans. All of our principal and interest Agency RMBS AFS were Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac mortgage pass-through certificates or collateralized mortgage obligations that carry an implied rating of  AAA,  or Ginnie Mae mortgage pass-through certificates, which are backed by the guarantee of the U.S. Government. The majority of these securities consist of whole pools in which we own all of the investment interests in the securities.

    Fixed Other represents weighted-average coupon interest-only securities that are not generally used for our interest-rate risk management purposes. These securities pay variable coupon interest based on the weighted average of the fixed rates of the underlying loans of the security, less the weighted average rates of the applicable issued principal and interest securities. 
       
  Our three-month average constant prepayment rate, or CPR, experienced by Agency RMBS AFS owned by us as of   September 30, 2016  , on an annualized basis, was   9.6%  . 
  The following table summarizes the number of months until the next reset for our floating or adjustable rate Agency RMBS AFS mortgage portfolio at   September 30, 2016  : 

Non-Agency RMBS 
  Our non-Agency RMBS portfolio is comprised of senior and mezzanine tranches of mortgage-backed securities, and excludes the retained interests from our on-balance sheet securitizations, as they are eliminated in consolidation in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The following table provides investment information on our non-Agency RMBS as of   September 30, 2016  :

The majority of our non-Agency RMBS were rated at   September 30, 2016  . Note that credit ratings are based on the par value of the non-Agency RMBS, whereas the distressed non-Agency RMBS assets in our portfolio were acquired at heavily discounted prices. The following table summarizes the credit ratings of our non-Agency RMBS portfolio, based on the Bloomberg Index Rating, a composite of each of the four major credit rating agencies (  i.e.  , DBRS Ltd., Moody s Investors Services, Inc., Standard   Poor s Corporation and Fitch, Inc.), as of   September 30, 2016  : 

Within our non-Agency RMBS portfolio, we have historically had a substantial emphasis on  legacy  securities, which include securities issued prior to 2009, many of which were subprime. We believe these deeply discounted securities can add relative value as the economy and housing markets continue to improve. There remains upside optionality to lower delinquencies, higher recoveries and faster prepays. Throughout the past year, however, we have sold a number of these securities that we believe had reached maximum value, many of which were replaced with  new issue  non-Agency RMBS. We believe these  new issue  securities, which include some GSE credit risk transfer securities, have enabled us to find attractive returns and further diversify our non-Agency RMBS portfolio. 
  As a result of these portfolio changes, our designated credit reserve as a percentage of total discount and total face value has   decreased   (as disclosed in   Note 4   -   Available-for-Sale Securities, at Fair Value   of the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements). When focused on principal and interest securities, from   September 30, 2015   to   September 30, 2016  , our designated credit reserve as a percentage of total discount   decreased   from   51.3%   to   37.1%   and our designated credit reserve as a percentage of total face value   decreased   from   17.9%   to   14.5%  . 
  A subprime bond may generally be considered higher risk; however, if purchased at a discount that reflects a high expectation of credit losses, it could be viewed as less risky than a prime bond, which is subject to unanticipated credit loss performance. Accordingly, we believe our risk profile in owning a heavily discounted subprime bond with known delinquencies affords us the ability to assume a higher percentage of expected credit loss with comparable risk-adjusted returns to a less discounted prime bond with a lower percentage of expected credit loss.

Trading Securities, at Fair Value 
  From time to time, we hold U.S. Treasuries in a TRS and classify these securities as trading instruments due to short-term investment objectives. We did not have any trading securities on our condensed consolidated balance sheet as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  Residential Mortgage Loans Held-for-Sale, at Fair Value 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we held prime nonconforming residential mortgage loans with a carrying value of   $655.8 million   and had outstanding commitments to purchase   $61.4 million   of residential mortgage loans, subject to fallout if the loans do not close. In July 2016, we announced a plan to discontinue our mortgage loan conduit and securitization business. The wind down process is scheduled to be substantially completed by the end of 2016, during which time we expect to sell our remaining loans through one or more whole loan sales. 
  In 2013, we acquired a portfolio of CSL, which are loans where the borrower has previously experienced payment delinquencies and is more likely to be underwater (  i.e.  , the amount owed on a mortgage loan exceeds the current market value of the home). As a result, there is a higher probability of default than on newly originated residential mortgage loans. We subsequently sold substantially all of our CSL portfolio during the first quarter of 2014. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had CSL with a carrying value of   $10.5 million   remaining. 
  Additionally, as the owner of MSR on loans from securitizations guaranteed by Ginnie Mae, we are obligated to purchase these loans from time to time in order to complete modifications on the mortgage loans or to convey foreclosed properties to HUD. We also have the option to buy out delinquent mortgages in order to better control loss mitigation activities. As of   September 30, 2016  , we held Ginnie Mae buyout residential mortgage loans with a carrying value of   $56.9 million  . 
  The following table presents our residential mortgage loans held-for-sale portfolio by loan type as of   September 30, 2016  : 

Residential Mortgage Loans Held-for-Investment in Securitization Trusts, at Fair Value 
  We purchase subordinated debt and excess servicing rights from securitization trusts sponsored by either third parties or our subsidiaries. The underlying residential mortgage loans held by the trusts, which are consolidated on our condensed consolidated balance sheets, are classified as residential mortgage loans held-for-investment in securitization trusts and carried at fair value as a result of a fair value option election. See   Note 3   -   Variable Interest Entities   to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding consolidation of the securitization trusts. As of   September 30, 2016  , residential mortgage loans held-for-investment in securitization trusts had a carrying value of   $3.6 billion  .

Commercial Real Estate Assets 
  We originate and purchase commercial real estate debt and related instruments generally to be held as long-term investments. These assets are classified as commercial real estate assets on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. Additionally, we are the sole certificate holder of a trust entity that holds a commercial real estate loan. The underlying loan held by the trust is consolidated on our condensed consolidated balance sheets and classified as commercial real estate assets. See   Note 3   -   Variable Interest Entities   to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding consolidation of the trust. Commercial real estate assets are reported at cost, net of any unamortized acquisition premiums or discounts, loan fees and origination costs as applicable, unless the loans are deemed impaired. As of   September 30, 2016  , our commercial real estate assets were comprised of   28   first mortgage and mezzanine commercial real estate loans with a carrying value of   $1.1 billion  . 
  Mortgage Servicing Rights, at Fair Value 
  One of our wholly owned subsidiaries has approvals from Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae to own and manage MSR, which represent the right to control the servicing of mortgage loans. We do not directly service mortgage loans, and instead contract with fully licensed subservicers to handle substantially all servicing functions for the loans underlying our MSR. As of   September 30, 2016  , our MSR had a fair market value of   $455.6 million  . 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our MSR portfolio included MSR on   249,032   loans with an unpaid principal balance of approximately   $55.1 billion  . The following table summarizes certain characteristics of the loans underlying our MSR at   September 30, 2016  :

           (1) 
    Includes loans issued by Ginnie Mae. 
              (2) 
    Includes loans issued by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or private investors. 
       
  Repurchase Agreements, Federal Home Loan Bank of Des Moines Advances and Revolving Credit Facilities 
  Our borrowings consist primarily of repurchase agreements, FHLB advances and revolving credit facilities collateralized by our pledge of AFS securities, derivative instruments, residential mortgage loans, commercial real estate assets, MSR and certain cash balances. Substantially all of our Agency RMBS AFS are currently pledged as collateral, and the majority of our non-Agency RMBS and residential mortgage loans have been pledged, either through repurchase agreements or FHLB advances. As of   September 30, 2016  , the debt-to-equity ratio funding our RMBS AFS, residential mortgage loans held-for-sale, commercial real estate assets, MSR and Agency Derivatives only was   4.2  :1.0. We believe our debt-to-equity ratio provides unused borrowing capacity and, thus, improves our liquidity and the strength of our balance sheet.

  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had outstanding   $10.6 billion   of repurchase agreements, and the term to maturity ranged   from two days to over 29 months  . Repurchase agreements had a weighted average borrowing rate of   1.1%   and weighted average remaining maturities of   69   days as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had outstanding   $4.0 billion   of FHLB advances. As of   September 30, 2016  , the weighted average term to maturity of our FHLB advances was   149   months, ranging   from approximately four months to over 19 years  . The weighted average cost of funds for our advances was   0.67%   at   September 30, 2016  . 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had outstanding   $30.0 million   of short-term borrowings under revolving credit facilities with a weighted average borrowing rate of   4.27%   and remaining maturities of   336   days. 
  The following table provides the quarterly average balances, the quarter-end balances, and the maximum balances at any month-end within that quarterly period, of borrowings under repurchase agreements, FHLB advances and revolving credit facilities for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , and the four immediately preceding quarters:

  Collateralized Borrowings in Securitization Trusts, at Fair Value 
  We purchase subordinated debt and excess servicing rights from securitization trusts sponsored by either third parties or our subsidiaries. The underlying debt held by the trusts, which are consolidated on our condensed consolidated balance sheets, is classified as collateralized borrowings in securitization trusts and carried at fair value as a result of a fair value option election. See   Note 3   -   Variable Interest Entities   to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding consolidation of the securitization trusts. As of   September 30, 2016  , collateralized borrowings in securitization trusts had a carrying value of   $3.4 billion   with a weighted average interest rate of   3.4%  . The stated maturity dates for all collateralized borrowings were greater than five years from   September 30, 2016  .

Net Economic Interests in Consolidated Securitization Trusts 
  The net of the underlying residential mortgage loans and the debt held by the securitization trusts discussed above represents the carrying value of the securities that we retained from these securitizations. Because we consolidate these securitization trusts on our condensed consolidated balance sheets, our retained interests are eliminated in consolidation in accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, the carrying value, characteristics and performance of these securities and those of the underlying collateral are relevant to our portfolio as a whole.

    Core Earnings is a non-U.S. GAAP measure that we define as   Comprehensive Income (Loss)  , excluding  realized gains and losses  (impairment losses, realized gains or losses on the aggregate portfolio, amortization of business combination intangible assets, reserve expense for representation and warranty obligations on MSR, certain upfront costs related to securitization transactions and restructuring charges) and  unrealized mark-to-market gains and losses  (unrealized gains and losses on the aggregate portfolio). As defined, Core Earnings includes interest income or expense and premium income or loss on derivative instruments and servicing income, net of estimated amortization on MSR. Core Earnings is provided for purposes of comparability to other peer issuers. 
       
  Share Repurchase Program 
  As of   December 31, 2015  , our share repurchase program allowed for the repurchase of up to   25,000,000   shares of our common stock. During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , our board of directors authorized an increase of   50,000,000   shares, for up to a total of   75,000,000   shares authorized under the program. Shares may be repurchased from time to time through privately negotiated transactions or open market transactions, pursuant to a trading plan in accordance with Rules 10b5-1 and 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, or by any combination of such methods. The manner, price, number and timing of share repurchases are subject to a variety of factors, including market conditions and applicable SEC rules. The share repurchase program does not require the purchase of any minimum number of shares, and, subject to SEC rules, purchases may be commenced or suspended at any time without prior notice. The share repurchase program does not have an expiration date. As of   September 30, 2016  , a total of   24,135,000   shares had been repurchased under the program for an aggregate cost of   $200.4 million  ; of these,   8,020,000   shares were repurchased for a total cost of   $61.3 million   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . We did not repurchase shares during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  . 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Our liquidity and capital resources are managed and forecast on a daily basis. We believe this ensures that we have sufficient liquidity to absorb market events that could negatively impact collateral valuations and result in margin calls, and that we have the flexibility to manage our portfolio to take advantage of market opportunities. 
  Our principal sources of cash consist of borrowings under repurchase agreements, FHLB advances and revolving credit facilities, payments of principal and interest we receive on our target assets, cash generated from our operating results, and proceeds from capital market transactions. We typically use cash to repay principal and interest on our repurchase agreements and FHLB advances, to purchase our target assets, to make dividend payments on our capital stock, and to fund our operations.

To the extent that we raise additional equity capital through capital market transactions, we anticipate using cash proceeds from such transactions to purchase additional RMBS, MSR, commercial real estate assets and other target assets and for other general corporate purposes. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we held   $688.4 million   in cash and cash equivalents available to support our operations;   $20.4 billion   of AFS securities, residential mortgage loans held-for-sale, residential mortgage loans held-for-investment in securitization trusts, commercial real estate assets, MSR and derivative assets held at fair value; and   $18.0 billion   of outstanding debt in the form of repurchase agreements, FHLB advances, borrowings under revolving credit facilities and collateralized borrowings in securitization trusts. During the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , our total consolidated debt-to-equity ratio increased from   4.9  :1.0 to   5.2  :1.0. The debt-to-equity ratio funding our AFS securities, residential mortgage loans held-for-sale, commercial real estate assets, MSR and Agency Derivatives only also increased from   4.0  :1.0 to   4.2  :1.0 predominantly driven by the purchase of and increased financing on Agency RMBS, commercial real estate assets and MSR. We believe the debt-to-equity ratio funding our AFS securities, residential mortgage loans held-for-sale, commercial real estate assets, MSR and Agency Derivatives is the most meaningful debt-to-equity measure as collateralized borrowings on residential mortgage loans held-for-investment in securitization trusts represents term financing with no stated maturity.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had approximately   $3.1 million   of unpledged Agency RMBS AFS and Agency Derivatives and   $26.8 million   of unpledged non-Agency securities and retained interests from our on-balance sheet securitizations, which are eliminated in consolidation in accordance with U.S. GAAP. As a result, we had an overall estimated unused borrowing capacity on unpledged RMBS and retained interests of approximately   $20.7 million  . We also had approximately   $23.1 million   of unpledged prime nonconforming residential mortgage loans,   $10.5 million   of unpledged CSL and   $56.9 million   of unpledged Ginnie Mae buyout residential mortgage loans, and an overall estimated unused borrowing capacity on unpledged residential mortgage loans held-for-sale of approximately   $72.0 million  . As of   September 30, 2016  , we had approximately   $44.0 million   of unpledged mezzanine commercial real estate loans and   $73.4 million   of unpledged commercial real estate first mortgages, and an overall estimated unused borrowing capacity on unpledged commercial real estate assets of approximately   $78.3 million  . We also had approximately   $382.1 million   of unpledged MSR with no unused borrowing capacity on unpledged MSR. On a daily basis, we monitor and forecast our available, or excess, liquidity. Additionally, we frequently perform shock analyses against various market events to monitor the adequacy of our excess liquidity. If borrowing rates and/or collateral requirements change in the near term, we believe we are subject to less earnings volatility than a more leveraged organization. 
  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we did not experience any restrictions to our funding sources, although balance sheet capacity of counterparties tightened due to compliance with the Basel III regulatory capital reform rules as well as management of perceived risk in the volatile interest rate environment. We expect ongoing sources of financing to be primarily repurchase agreements, FHLB advances, revolving credit facilities and similar financing arrangements. We plan to finance our assets with a moderate amount of leverage, the level of which may vary based upon the particular characteristics of our portfolio and market conditions. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had master repurchase agreements in place with   31   counterparties (lenders), the majority of which are U.S. domiciled financial institutions, and we continue to evaluate further counterparties to manage and reduce counterparty risk. Under our repurchase agreements, we are required to pledge additional assets as collateral to our lenders when the estimated fair value of the existing pledged collateral under such agreements declines and such lenders, through a margin call, demand additional collateral. Lenders generally make margin calls because of a perceived decline in the value of our assets collateralizing the repurchase agreements. This may occur following the monthly principal reduction of assets due to scheduled amortization and prepayments on the underlying mortgages, or may be caused by changes in market interest rates, a perceived decline in the market value of the investments and other market factors. To cover a margin call, we may pledge additional securities or cash. At maturity, any cash on deposit as collateral is generally applied against the repurchase agreement balance, thereby reducing the amount borrowed. Should the value of our assets suddenly decrease, significant margin calls on our repurchase agreements could result, causing an adverse change in our liquidity position.

  In addition to our master repurchase agreements to fund our RMBS and commercial real estate assets, we have   two   facilities that provide short- and long-term financing for our commercial real estate assets and one revolving credit facility that provides short-term financing for our MSR portfolio. An overview of the facilities is presented in the table below:

    The facilities are set to mature on the stated expiration date, unless extended pursuant to their terms.  
       
  Our wholly owned subsidiary, TH Insurance, is a member of the FHLB. As a member of the FHLB, TH Insurance has access to a variety of products and services offered by the FHLB, including secured advances. As of   September 30, 2016  , TH Insurance had   $4.0 billion   in outstanding secured advances with a weighted average borrowing rate of   0.67%  , and had no additional uncommitted capacity to borrow. To the extent TH Insurance has uncommitted capacity, it may be adjusted at the sole discretion of the FHLB. 
  The ability to borrow from the FHLB is subject to our continued creditworthiness, pledging of sufficient eligible collateral to secure advances, and compliance with certain agreements with the FHLB. Each advance requires approval by the FHLB and is secured by collateral in accordance with the FHLB s credit and collateral guidelines, as may be revised from time to time by the FHLB. Eligible collateral may include conventional 1-4 family residential mortgage loans, commercial real estate loans, Agency RMBS and certain non-Agency RMBS with a rating of A and above. 
  In January 2016, the FHFA released a final rule regarding membership in the Federal Home Loan Bank system. Among other effects, the final rule excludes captive insurers from membership eligibility, including our subsidiary member, TH Insurance Holdings Company LLC, or TH Insurance. Since TH Insurance was admitted as a member in 2013, it is eligible for a five-year membership grace period, during which new advances or renewals that mature beyond the grace period will be prohibited; however, any existing advances that mature beyond this grace period will be permitted to remain in place subject to their terms insofar as we maintain good standing with the FHLB. If any new advances or renewals occur, TH Insurance s outstanding advances will be limited to 40% of its total assets. Notwithstanding the FHFA s ruling, we continue to believe our mission aligns well with that of the Federal Home Loan Bank system.

We are subject to a variety of financial covenants under our lending agreements. The following represent the most restrictive financial covenants across the agreements as of   September 30, 2016  : 
             
    Total indebtedness to net worth must be less than the specified threshold ratio in the repurchase agreement. As of   September 30, 2016  , our debt to net worth, as defined, was   5.2  :1.0 while our threshold ratio, as defined, was   5.6  :1.0. 
                
    Liquidity must be greater than the sum of 1.5% of indebtedness related to Agency securities and 5.0% of total indebtedness, excluding indebtedness related to Agency securities. As of   September 30, 2016  , this sum was   $313.6 million   while our liquidity, as defined, was   $1.0 billion  . 
                
    Net worth must be greater than the sum of $1.75 billion plus 40% of the aggregate net cash proceeds of any additional equity issuances made and capital contributions received. As of   September 30, 2016  , our net worth, as defined, was   $3.5 billion  . 
     We are also subject to additional financial covenants in connection with various other agreements we enter into in the normal course of our business. We intend to continue to operate in a manner which complies with all of our financial covenants. 
  The following table summarizes assets at carrying values that are pledged or restricted as collateral for the future payment obligations of repurchase agreements, FHLB advances and revolving credit facilities.

    Includes the retained interests from our on-balance sheet securitizations, which are eliminated in consolidation in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 
       
  Although we generally intend to hold our target assets as long-term investments, we may sell certain of our assets in order to manage our interest rate risk and liquidity needs, to meet other operating objectives and to adapt to market conditions. Our RMBS are generally actively traded and thus, in most circumstances, readily liquid. However, certain of our assets, including residential mortgage loans, commercial real estate assets and MSR, are subject to longer trade timelines, and, as a result, market conditions could significantly and adversely affect the liquidity of our assets. Any illiquidity of our assets may make it difficult for us to sell such assets if the need or desire arises. Our ability to quickly sell certain assets, such as residential mortgage loans, commercial real estate assets and MSR, may be limited by delays encountered while obtaining certain regulatory approvals required for such dispositions and may be further limited by delays due to the time period needed for negotiating transaction documents, conducting diligence, and complying with regulatory requirements regarding the transfer of such assets before settlement may occur. Consequently, even if we identify a buyer for our residential mortgage loans, commercial real estate assets and MSR, there is no assurance that we would be able to quickly sell such assets if the need or desire arises.  
  In addition, if we are required to liquidate all or a portion of our portfolio quickly, we may realize significantly less than the value at which we previously recorded our assets. Assets that are illiquid are more difficult to finance, and to the extent that we use leverage to finance assets that become illiquid, we may lose that leverage or have it reduced. Assets tend to become less liquid during times of financial stress, which is often the time that liquidity is most needed. As a result, our ability to sell assets or vary our portfolio in response to changes in economic and other conditions may be limited by liquidity constraints, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  
  We cannot predict the timing and impact of future sales of our assets, if any. Because many of our assets are financed with repurchase agreements and FHLB advances, and may be financed with credit facilities (including term loans and revolving facilities), a significant portion of the proceeds from sales of our assets (if any), prepayments and scheduled amortization are used to repay balances under these financing sources.

The following table provides the maturities of our repurchase agreements, FHLB advances and revolving credit facilities as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

For the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , our unrestricted cash balance   decreased   approximately   $3.8 million   to   $688.4 million   at   September 30, 2016  . The cash movements can be summarized by the following: 
             
    Cash flows from operating activities.   For the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , operating activities   decreased   our cash balances by approximately   $431.5 million  , primarily driven by purchases of residential mortgage loans held-for-sale.  
                
    Cash flows from investing activities  . For the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , investing activities   decreased   our cash balances by approximately   $733.7 million  , primarily driven by purchases, net of sales, of AFS securities.  
                
    Cash flows from financing activities.   For the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , financing activities   increased   our cash balance by approximately   $1.2 billion  , primarily driven by proceeds from repurchase agreements due to purchases of AFS securities and net proceeds from sales of retained interests from our on-balance sheet securitizations. 

Inflation 
  Substantially all of our assets and liabilities are financial in nature. As a result, changes in interest rates and other factors impact our performance far more than does inflation. Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and dividends are based upon net ordinary income and capital gains as calculated for tax purposes; in each case, our results of operations and reported assets, liabilities and equity are measured with reference to historical cost or fair value without considering inflation. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
  We seek to manage our risks related to the credit quality of our assets, interest rates, liquidity, prepayment speeds and market value while providing an opportunity to stockholders to realize attractive risk-adjusted total return through ownership of our capital stock. Although we do not seek to avoid risk completely, we believe that risk can be quantified from historical experience and we seek to manage our risk levels in order to earn sufficient compensation to justify the risks we undertake and to maintain capital levels consistent with taking such risks. 
  To reduce the risks to our portfolio, we employ portfolio-wide and asset-specific risk measurement and management processes in our daily operations. PRCM Advisers and its affiliates  risk management tools include software and services licensed or purchased from third parties and proprietary software and analytical methods developed by Pine River. There can be no guarantee that these tools and methods will protect us from market risks. 
  Interest Rate Risk 
  Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including fiscal and monetary policies and domestic and international economic and political considerations, as well as other factors beyond our control. We are subject to interest rate risk in connection with our assets and related financing obligations. Subject to maintaining our qualification as a REIT, we engage in a variety of interest rate management techniques that seek to mitigate the influence of interest rate changes on the values of our assets. 
  
   85 

     Table of Contents  

We may utilize U.S. Treasuries as well as derivative financial instruments, which during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   were limited to interest rate swaps, swaptions, TBAs, put and call options for TBAs, Markit IOS total return swaps and, to a certain extent, inverse interest-only securities, to hedge the interest rate risk associated with our portfolio. In addition, because MSR are negative duration assets, they provide a natural hedge to interest rate exposure on our RMBS portfolio. We seek to hedge interest rate risk with respect to both the fixed income nature of our assets and the financing of our portfolio. In hedging interest rates with respect to our fixed income assets, we seek to reduce the risk of losses on the value of our investments that may result from changes in interest rates in the broader markets. In utilizing interest rate hedges with respect to our financing, we seek to improve risk-adjusted returns and, where possible, to obtain a favorable spread between the yield on our assets and the cost of our financing. We implement part of our hedging strategy through our TRSs, which are subject to U.S. federal, state and, if applicable, local income tax. 
  Interest Rate Effect on Net Interest Income 
  Our operating results depend in large part on differences between the income earned on our assets and our cost of borrowing and hedging activities. The costs associated with our borrowings are generally based on prevailing market interest rates. During a period of rising interest rates, our borrowing costs generally will increase while the yields earned on our existing portfolio of leveraged fixed-rate RMBS and residential mortgage loans held-for-sale will remain static. Moreover, interest rates may rise at a faster pace than the yields earned on our leveraged adjustable-rate and hybrid RMBS and adjustable-rate residential mortgage loans held-for-sale. Both of these factors could result in a decline in our net interest spread and net interest margin. The severity of any such decline would depend on our asset/liability composition at the time, as well as the magnitude and duration of the interest rate increase. Further, an increase in short-term interest rates could also have a negative impact on the market value of our target assets. If any of these events happen, we could experience a decrease in net income or incur a net loss during these periods, which could adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations. 
  Our hedging techniques are partly based on assumed levels of prepayments of our target assets. If prepayments are slower or faster than assumed, the life of the investment will be longer or shorter, which could reduce the effectiveness of any hedging strategies we may use and may cause losses on such transactions. Hedging strategies involving the use of derivative securities are highly complex and may produce volatile returns. 
  We acquire adjustable-rate and hybrid RMBS. These are assets in which some of the underlying mortgages are typically subject to periodic and lifetime interest rate caps and floors, which may limit the amount by which the security s interest yield may change during any given period. However, our borrowing costs pursuant to our financing agreements are not subject to similar restrictions. Therefore, in a period of increasing interest rates, interest rate costs on our borrowings could increase without limitation, while the interest-rate yields on our adjustable-rate and hybrid RMBS could effectively be limited by caps. This issue will be magnified to the extent we acquire adjustable-rate and hybrid RMBS that are not based on mortgages that are fully indexed. In addition, adjustable-rate and hybrid RMBS may be subject to periodic payment caps that result in some portion of the interest being deferred and added to the principal outstanding. If this happens, we could receive less cash income on such assets than we would need to pay for interest costs on our related borrowings. These factors could lower our net interest income or cause a net loss during periods of rising interest rates, which would harm our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. 
  Our adjustable-rate residential mortgage loans held-for-sale are typically subject to periodic and lifetime interest rate caps and floors, which may limit the amount by which the loan s interest yield may change during any given period. However, our borrowing costs pursuant to our financing agreements are not subject to similar restrictions. Therefore, in a period of increasing interest rates, interest rate costs on our borrowings could increase without limitation, while the interest-rate yields on our adjustable-rate residential mortgage loans held-for-sale could effectively be limited by caps. 
  Interest Rate Mismatch Risk 
  We fund the majority of our adjustable-rate and hybrid Agency RMBS, adjustable-rate residential mortgage loans held-for-sale and commercial real estate assets with borrowings that are based on LIBOR, while the interest rates on these assets may be indexed to other index rates, such as the one-year Constant Maturity Treasury index, or CMT, the Monthly Treasury Average index, or MTA, or the 11   th    District Cost of Funds Index, or COFI. Accordingly, any increase in LIBOR relative to these indices may result in an increase in our borrowing costs that is not matched by a corresponding increase in the interest earnings on these assets. Any such interest rate index mismatch could adversely affect our profitability, which may negatively impact distributions to our stockholders. To mitigate interest rate mismatches, we utilize the hedging strategies discussed above.

  Our analysis of risks is based on PRCM Advisers  and its affiliates  experience, estimates, models and assumptions. These analyses rely on models which utilize estimates of fair value and interest rate sensitivity. Actual economic conditions or implementation of decisions by PRCM Advisers may produce results that differ significantly from the estimates and assumptions used in our models. 
  
   87 

     Table of Contents  

We use a variety of recognized industry models, as well as proprietary models, to perform sensitivity analyses which are derived from primary assumptions for prepayment rates, discount rates and credit losses. The primary assumption used in this model is implied market volatility of interest rates. The information presented in the following interest rate sensitivity table projects the potential impact of sudden parallel changes in interest rates on our financial results and financial condition over the next 12 months, based on our interest sensitive financial instruments at   September 30, 2016  . 
  All changes in value are measured as the change from the   September 30, 2016   financial position. All projected changes in annualized net interest income are measured as the change from the projected annualized net interest income based off current performance returns. 

The interest rate sensitivity table quantifies the potential changes in net interest income and portfolio value, which includes the value of swaps and our other derivatives, should interest rates immediately change. The interest rate sensitivity table presents the estimated impact of interest rates instantaneously rising 50 and 100 basis points, and falling 50 and 100 basis points. The cash flows associated with the portfolio for each rate change are calculated based on assumptions, including prepayment speeds, yield on future acquisitions, slope of the yield curve, and size of the portfolio. Assumptions made on the interest rate sensitive liabilities include anticipated interest rates, collateral requirements as a percentage of borrowings and amount and term of borrowing. 
  Certain assumptions have been made in connection with the calculation of the information set forth in the foregoing interest rate sensitivity table and, as such, there can be no assurance that assumed events will occur or that other events will not occur that would affect the outcomes. The base interest rate scenario assumes interest rates at   September 30, 2016  . The analysis utilizes assumptions and estimates based on management s judgment and experience. Furthermore, while we generally expect to retain such assets and the associated interest rate risk to maturity, future purchases and sales of assets could materially change our interest rate risk profile. 
  
   88 

     Table of Contents  

The change in annualized net interest income does not include any benefit or detriment from faster or slower prepayment rates on our Agency premium RMBS, non-Agency discount RMBS, and instruments that represent the interest payments (but not the principal) on a pool of mortgages, or interest-only securities. We anticipate that faster prepayment speeds in lower interest rate scenarios will generate lower realized yields on Agency and non-Agency premium and interest-only securities and higher realized yields on Agency and non-Agency discount RMBS. Similarly, we anticipate that slower prepayment speeds in higher interest rate scenarios will generate higher realized yields on Agency premium and interest-only securities and lower realized yields on non-Agency discount RMBS. Although we have sought to construct the portfolio to limit the effect of changes in prepayment speeds, there can be no assurance this will actually occur, and the realized yield of the portfolio may be significantly different than we anticipate in changing interest rate scenarios. 
  Given the low interest rate environment at   September 30, 2016  , we applied a floor of 0% for all anticipated interest rates included in our assumptions. Because of this floor, we anticipate that any hypothetical interest rate shock decrease would have a limited positive impact on our funding costs; however, because prepayment speeds are unaffected by this floor, we expect that any increase in our prepayment speeds (occurring as a result of any interest rate decrease or otherwise) could result in an acceleration of our premium amortization on Agency and interest-only securities purchased at a premium, and accretion of discount on our non-Agency RMBS purchased at a discount. As a result, because this floor limits the positive impact of any interest rate decrease on our funding costs, hypothetical interest rate decreases could cause the fair value of our financial instruments and our net interest income to decline. 
  The information set forth in the interest rate sensitivity table above and all related disclosures constitutes forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimated in the foregoing interest rate sensitivity table. 
  Prepayment Risk 
  Prepayment risk is the risk that principal will be repaid at a different rate than anticipated. As we receive prepayments of principal on our RMBS assets, premiums paid on such assets will be amortized against interest income. In general, an increase in prepayment rates will accelerate the amortization of purchase premiums, thereby reducing the interest income earned on the assets. Conversely, discounts on such assets are accreted into interest income. In general, an increase in prepayment rates will accelerate the accretion of purchase discounts, thereby increasing the interest income earned on the assets. 
  We believe that we will be able to reinvest proceeds from scheduled principal payments and prepayments at acceptable yields; however, no assurances can be given that, should significant prepayments occur, market conditions would be such that acceptable investments could be identified and the proceeds timely reinvested. 
  MSR are also subject to prepayment risk in that, generally, an increase in prepayment rates would result in a decline in value of the MSR. 
  Market Risk 
  Market Value Risk.   Our AFS securities are reflected at their estimated fair value, with the difference between amortized cost and estimated fair value for all AFS securities except Agency interest-only securities and GSE credit risk transfer securities reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income. The estimated fair value of these securities fluctuates primarily due to changes in interest rates, market valuation of credit risks, and other factors. Generally, in a rising interest rate environment, we would expect the fair value of these securities to decrease; conversely, in a decreasing interest rate environment, we would expect the fair value of these securities to increase. As market volatility increases or liquidity decreases, the fair value of our assets may be adversely impacted. 
  Our residential mortgage loans held-for-sale and held-for-investment are reflected at their estimated fair value. The estimated fair value fluctuates primarily due to changes in interest rates, market valuation of credit risks and other factors. Generally in a rising rate environment, we would expect the fair value of these loans to decrease; conversely, in a decreasing rate environment, we would expect the fair value of these loans to increase. However, the fair value of the CSL and Ginnie Mae buyout residential mortgage loans included in residential mortgage loans held-for-sale is generally less sensitive to interest rate changes. 
  Our MSR are reflected at their estimated fair value. The estimated fair value fluctuates primarily due to changes in interest rates and other factors. Generally, in a rising interest rate environment, we would expect prepayments to decrease, resulting in an increase in the fair value of our MSR. Conversely, in a decreasing interest rate environment, we would expect prepayments to increase, resulting in a decline in fair value. 
  Real estate risk  . Both residential and commercial property values are subject to volatility and may be affected adversely by a number of factors, including national, regional and local economic conditions; local real estate conditions (such as an oversupply of housing); changes or continued weakness in specific industry segments; construction quality, age and design; demographic factors; retroactive changes to building or similar codes; and natural disasters and other catastrophes. Decreases in property values reduce the value of the collateral for residential mortgage and commercial real estate loans and the potential proceeds available to borrowers to repay the loans, which could cause us to suffer losses on our non-Agency RMBS investments and residential mortgage and commercial real estate loans.

     Table of Contents  

Liquidity Risk 
  Our liquidity risk is principally associated with our financing of long-maturity assets with shorter-term borrowings in the form of repurchase agreements and FHLB advances. Although the interest rate adjustments of these assets and liabilities fall within the guidelines established by our operating policies, maturities are not required to be, nor are they, matched. 
  Should the value of our assets pledged as collateral suddenly decrease, margin calls relating to our repurchase agreements could increase, causing an adverse change in our liquidity position. Additionally, if the FHLB or one or more of our repurchase agreement counterparties chose not to provide ongoing funding, our ability to finance would decline or exist at possibly less advantageous terms. As such, we cannot assure that we will always be able to roll over our repurchase agreements and FHLB advances. See Item 2,    Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources    in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for further information about our liquidity and capital resource management. 
  Credit Risk 
  We believe that our investment strategy will generally keep our risk of credit losses low to moderate. However, we retain the risk of potential credit losses on all of the loans underlying our non-Agency RMBS and on our residential mortgage and commercial real estate loans. With respect to our non-Agency RMBS that are senior in the credit structure, credit support contained in RMBS deal structures provide a level of protection from losses. We seek to manage the remaining credit risk through our pre-acquisition due diligence process, which includes comprehensive underwriting, and by factoring assumed credit losses into the purchase prices we pay for non-Agency RMBS and residential mortgage and commercial real estate assets. In addition, with respect to any particular target asset, we evaluate relative valuation, supply and demand trends, shape of yield curves, prepayment rates, delinquency and default rates, recovery of various sectors and vintage of collateral. We further mitigate credit risk in our residential mortgage and commercial real estate loan portfolios through (i) selecting servicers whose specialties are well matched against the underlying attributes of the borrowers contained in the loan pools, and (ii) an actively managed internal servicer oversight and surveillance program. At times, we enter into credit default swaps or other derivative instruments in an attempt to manage our credit risk. Nevertheless, unanticipated credit losses could adversely affect our operating results. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
  A review and evaluation was performed by our management, including our Chief Executive Officer, or CEO, and Chief Financial Officer, or CFO, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on that review and evaluation, the CEO and CFO have concluded that our current disclosure controls and procedures, as designed and implemented, were effective. Although our CEO and CFO have determined our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, a control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that it will detect or uncover failures within the Company to disclose material information otherwise required to be set forth in the reports we submit under the Exchange Act. 
  There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
  From time to time we may be involved in various legal claims and/or administrative proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business. As of the date of this filing, we are not party to any litigation or legal proceedings or, to the best of our knowledge, any threatened litigation or legal proceedings, which, in our opinion, individually or in the aggregate, would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.

Risk Factors  of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , or the Form 10-K. The materialization of any risks and uncertainties identified in our Forward-Looking Statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, together with those previously disclosed in the Form 10-K, or those that are presently unforeseen could result in significant adverse effects on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.

  (c)  As of December 31, 2015, our share repurchase program allowed for the repurchase of up to   25,000,000   shares of our common stock. During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , our board of directors authorized an increase of   50,000,000   shares, for up to a total of   75,000,000   shares authorized under the program. Shares may be repurchased from time to time through privately negotiated transactions or open market transactions, pursuant to a trading plan in accordance with Rules 10b5-1 and 10b-18 under the Exchange Act or by any combination of such methods. The manner, price, number and timing of share repurchases are subject to a variety of factors, including market conditions and applicable SEC rules. The share repurchase program does not require the purchase of any minimum number of shares, and, subject to SEC rules, purchases may be commenced or suspended at any time without prior notice. The share repurchase program does not have an expiration date. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had repurchased   24,135,000   shares under the program for a total cost of   $200.4 million  . We did not repurchase shares during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  .
