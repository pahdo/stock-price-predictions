 1.     Basis of Presentation   
 The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements of Schlumberger Limited and its subsidiaries (Schlumberger) have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements.  In the opinion of Schlumberger management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair statement have been included in the accompanying unaudited financial statements.  All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.  Operating results for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2016.  The December 31, 2015 balance sheet information has been derived from the Schlumberger 2015 audited financial statements.  For further information, refer to the  Consolidated Financial Statements  and notes thereto included in the Schlumberger Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 27, 2016.  
 New Accounting Pronouncements 
 In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers . This ASU amends the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition and is based on the principle   that revenue should be recognized to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration   a company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. Schlumberger is required to adopt this ASU on January 1,   2018, with early adoption permitted on January 1, 2017.  Schlumberger does not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.   
 In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17 , Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes , which amends existing guidance on income taxes to require the classification of all deferred tax assets and liabilities as non-current on the balance sheet.  Schlumberger is required to adopt this ASU no later than January 1, 2017, with early adoption permitted, and the guidance may be applied either prospectively or retrospectively.  Schlumberger does not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 
 In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,  Leases .  This ASU requires lessees to recognize a right of use asset and lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases, with the exception of short-term leases.  Schlumberger will adopt this ASU on January 1, 2019 and is evaluating the impact that the adoption of this ASU will have on its consolidated financial statements. 
 Reclassifications 
 Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. 
 2.    Charges and Credits   
 Schlumberger recorded the following charges and credits during the first nine months of 2016: 
 Third quarter of 2016: 

In connection with Schlumberger s acquisition of Cameron International Corporation ( Cameron ) (see Note 4     Acquisition of Cameron  ), Schlumberger recorded $237 million of charges consisting of the following:  $149 million relating to the amortization of purchase accounting adjustments associated with the write-up of acquired inventory to its estimated fair value; $11 million of facility closure costs; $46 million of employee benefits; and $31 million of other merger and integration-related costs.  These amounts are classified in   Merger   integration   in the   Consolidated Statement of Income.     

 Second quarter of 2016: 

As a result of the persistent unfavorable oil and gas industry market conditions that continued to deteriorate in the first half of 2016, and the related impact on the first half operating results and expected customer activity levels, Schlumberger determined that the carrying values of certain assets were no longer recoverable and also took certain decisions that resulted in the following impairment and other charges:     

-   
 
  $646 million of severance costs associated with headcount reductions.     

-   
 
  $209 million impairment of pressure pumping equipment in North America.     

-   
 
  $165 million impairment of facilities in North America.     

 8 

-   
 
        $684   million of other fixed asset impairments primarily relating to other underutilized equipment.       

-   
 
  $616 million write-down of the carrying value of certain inventory to its net realizable value.     

-   
 
  $198 million impairment of certain multiclient seismic data, largely related to the US Gulf of Mexico.     

-   
 
  $55 million of other costs, primarily relating to facility closure costs.     

The fair value of the impaired fixed assets and multiclient seismic data was estimated based on the projected present value of future cash flows that these assets are expected to generate.  Such estimates included unobservable inputs that required significant judgments.  Additional charges may be required in future periods should industry conditions worsen.  The above items are classified in  Impairments   other  in the  Consolidated Statement of Income . 

In connection with Schlumberger s acquisition of Cameron, Schlumberger recorded $335 million of charges consisting of the following: $150 million relating to the amortization of purchase accounting adjustments associated with the write-up of acquired inventory to its estimated fair value;  $47 million relating to employee benefits for change-in-control arrangements and retention bonuses;  $45 million of transaction costs, including advisory and legal fees;  $40 million of facility closure costs, and $53 million of other merger and integration-related costs.  These amounts are classified in   Merger   integration   in the   Consolidated Statement of Income  .     

 The following is a summary of the charges and credits recorded during the first nine months of 2016:  

There were no charges or credits recorded during the first quarter of 2016. 
 Schlumberger recorded the following charges and credits during the first quarter of 2015: 

As a result of the severe fall in activity in North America, combined with the impact of lower international activity due to customer budget cuts driven by lower oil prices, Schlumberger decided to reduce its headcount during the first quarter of 2015.  Schlumberger recorded a $390 million charge associated with this headcount reduction as well as an incentivized leave of absence program.     

In February 2015, the Venezuelan government replaced the SICAD II exchange rate with a new foreign exchange market system known as SIMADI. The SIMADI exchange rate was approximately 192 Venezuelan   Bolivares   fuertes to the US dollar as of March 31, 2015. As a result, Schlumberger recorded a $49 million devaluation charge during the first quarter of 2015, reflecting the adoption of the SIMADI exchange rate.  This   change resulted in a reduction in the US dollar reported amount of local currency denominated revenues, expenses and, consequently, income before taxes and net income in Venezuela.       

 The following is a summary of these charges, all of which were classified as  Impairments   other  in the  Consolidated Statement of Income :  

9 
 
    There were no charges or credits recorded during the second and third quarters of 2015.  
   
 3.    Earnings Per Share   
 The following is a reconciliation from basic earnings (loss) per share of Schlumberger to diluted earnings (loss) per share of Schlumberger:  

The number of outstanding options to purchase shares of Schlumberger common stock that were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share, because to do so would have had an antidilutive effect, was as follows:  

4.    Acquisition of Cameron  
 On April 1, 2016, Schlumberger acquired all of the outstanding shares of Cameron, a leading provider of flow equipment products, systems and services to the oil and gas industry worldwide. The acquisition is expected to create technology-driven growth by integrating Schlumberger reservoir and well technologies with Cameron wellhead and surface equipment, flow control and processing technology. The combination of the two complementary technology portfolios provides the industry s most comprehensive range of products and services, from exploration to production and integrated pore-to-pipeline solutions that optimize hydrocarbon recovery to deliver reservoir performance. 
 Under the terms of the merger agreement, Cameron became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Schlumberger.  Each share of Cameron common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger was converted into the right to receive 0.716 shares of Schlumberger stock and $14.44 in cash.

 Preliminary Allocation of Consideration Transferred to Net Assets Acquired 
 The following amounts represents the preliminary estimates of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the merger.  The final determination of fair value for certain assets and liabilities will be completed as soon as the information necessary to complete the analysis is obtained.  These amounts, which may differ materially from these preliminary estimates, will be finalized as soon as practicable, but no later than one year from the acquisition date. 

(1)     Schlumberger recorded an adjustment of $299 million to write-up the acquired inventory to its estimated fair value.  Schlumberger s cost of sales reflected this increased valuation as this inventory was sold.   
  (2)     In connection with the merger, Schlumberger assumed all of the debt obligations of Cameron, including their $2.75 billion of fixed rate notes.  Schlumberger recorded a $244 million adjustment to increase the carrying amount of these notes to their estimated fair value.  This adjustment is being amortized as a reduction of interest expense over the remaining term of the respective obligations. 
  (3)     In connection with the acquisition accounting, Schlumberger provided deferred taxes related to, among other items, the estimated fair value adjustments for acquired inventory, intangible assets and assumed debt obligations. 
    (4)     Prior to the completion of the merger, Cameron and Schlumberger operated OneSubsea, a joint venture that manufactured and developed products, systems and services for the subsea oil and gas market, which was 40% owned by Schlumberger and 60% owned by Cameron.  OneSubsea is now owned 100% by Schlumberger.  As a result of obtaining control of this joint venture, Schlumberger was required to  
 11 
 
  remeasure its previously held equity interest in the joint venture   to   its acquisition-date fair value. Schlumberger determined that the estimated fair value of its previously held equity interest approximated its carrying value.  Accordingly  ,   Schlum  berger did not recognize any gain or loss on this transaction.  
  (5)     The goodwill recognized is primarily attributable to expected synergies that will result from combining the operations of Schlumberger and Cameron, as well as intangible assets which do not qualify for separate recognition.  The amount of goodwill that is deductible for income tax purposes is not significant.   
   
 Supplemental Pro Forma Financial Information 
 Cameron s results of operations have been included in Schlumberger s financial statements for periods subsequent to the closing of the acquisition on April 1, 2016.  Businesses acquired from Cameron contributed revenues of approximately $3 billion and pretax operating income of $0.5 billion for the period from April 1, 2016 through September 30, 2016.   
 The following supplemental pro forma results of operations assume that Cameron had been acquired as of January 1, 2015.  The supplemental pro forma financial information was prepared based on the historical financial information of Schlumberger and Cameron and has been adjusted to give effect to pro forma adjustments that are both directly attributable to the transaction and factually supportable.  The pro forma amounts reflect certain adjustments to amortization expense, interest expense and income taxes resulting from purchase accounting.  The pro forma results for the three months ended September 30, 2016 reflect adjustments to exclude after-tax merger and integration costs of $73 million and after-tax charges relating to the amortization of the inventory fair value adjustment of $104 million.  The pro forma results for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 reflect adjustments to exclude after-tax merger and integration costs of $221 million and after-tax charges relating to the amortization of the inventory fair value adjustment of $209 million. As required by generally accepted accounting principles, the pro forma results for the three months ended September 30, 2015 have been adjusted to include $73 million of after-tax merger and integration charges.  The pro forma results for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 have been adjusted to include after-tax adjustments for merger and integration costs of $221 million and the after-tax charges relating to the amortization of the inventory fair value adjustment of $209 million. 
 The supplemental pro forma financial information presented below does not include any anticipated cost savings or the expected realization of other synergies associated with this transaction.  Accordingly, this supplemental pro forma financial information is presented for informational purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of what the actual results of operations of the combined company would have been had the acquisition occurred on January 1, 2015, nor is it indicative of future results of operations.

10.    Long-term Debt   
 A summary of  Long-term Debt  follows:  

14 

(1)   Represents long-term fixed rate debt obligations assumed in connection with the acquisition of Cameron, net of amounts repurchased   subsequent to the closing of the transaction.  
 The estimated fair value of Schlumberger s  Long-term Debt  at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, based on quoted market prices, was $18.2 billion and $14.4 billion, respectively.  
 Borrowings under the commercial paper program at September 30, 2016 were $3.0 billion, of which $2.8 billion was classified within  Long-term Debt  and $0.2 billion was classified within  Long-term debt   current portion  in the  Consolidated Balance Sheet .  At December 31, 2015, borrowings under the commercial paper program were $2.4 billion, of which $1.0 billion was classified within  Long-term Debt  and $1.4 billion was classified within  Long-term debt   current portion  in the  Consolidated Balance Sheet . 

11.    Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities   
 Schlumberger is exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.  To mitigate these risks, Schlumberger utilizes derivative instruments.  Schlumberger does not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes.  
 Interest Rate Risk  
 Schlumberger is subject to interest rate risk on its debt and its investment portfolio.  Schlumberger maintains an interest rate risk management strategy that uses a mix of variable and fixed rate debt combined with its investment portfolio and occasionally interest rate swaps to mitigate the exposure to changes in interest rates.  
 During the fourth quarter of 2013, Schlumberger entered into a cross currency swap for a notional amount of  0.5 billion in order to hedge changes in the fair value of Schlumberger s  0.5 billion 1.50% Guaranteed Notes due 2019.  Under the terms of this swap, Schlumberger receives interest at a fixed rate of 1.50% on the euro notional amount and pays interest at a floating rate of three-month LIBOR plus approximately 64 basis points on the US dollar notional amount. 
 This cross currency swap is designated as a fair value hedge of the underlying debt.  This derivative instrument is marked to market with gains and losses recognized in income to largely offset the respective gains and losses recognized on changes in the fair value of the hedged debt.   
 At September 30, 2016, Schlumberger had fixed rate debt of $14.4 billion and variable rate debt of $6.9 billion after taking into account the effect of the swap.  
 Short-term investments  and  Fixed income investments ,  held to maturity  totaled $7.7 billion at September 30, 2016.  The carrying value of these investments approximated fair value, which was estimated using quoted market prices for those or similar investments.     
 Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk  
 As a multinational company, Schlumberger conducts its business in over 85 countries. Schlumberger s functional currency is primarily the US dollar.  However, outside the United States, a significant portion of Schlumberger s expenses is incurred in foreign currencies.  Therefore, when the US dollar weakens (strengthens) in relation to the foreign currencies of the countries in which Schlumberger conducts business, the US dollar reported expenses will increase (decrease).    
 Schlumberger is exposed to risks on future cash flows to the extent that the local currency is not the functional currency and expenses denominated in local currency are not equal to revenues denominated in local currency.  Schlumberger is also exposed to risks on future cash flows relating to certain of its fixed rate debt that is denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. Schlumberger uses foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency options to provide a hedge against a portion of these cash flow risks.  These contracts are accounted for as cash flow hedges, with the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the hedge recorded on the  Consolidated Balance Sheet  and in  Accumulated other comprehensive loss.   Amounts recorded in  Accumulated other comprehensive loss  are reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods that the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of hedging instruments, if any, is recorded directly to earnings.  
 At September 30, 2016, Schlumberger recognized a cumulative net $16 million loss in  Accumulated other comprehensive loss  relating to revaluation of foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency options designated as cash flow hedges, the majority of which is expected to be reclassified into earnings within the next 12 months.  
 15 
 
    Schlumberger is exposed to changes in   the fair value of assets and liabilities   that   are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency.  While Schlumberger uses foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency options to economically hedge this exposure as it relates to c  ertain currencies, these contracts are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes.  Instead, the fair value of the contracts is recorded on the   Consolidated Balance Sheet,   and changes in the fair value are recognized in the   Consolidated Statement of   Income   as are changes in fair value of the hedged item.   
 At September 30, 2016, contracts were outstanding for the US dollar equivalent of $4.6 billion in various foreign currencies, of which $0.7 billion related to hedges of debt denominated in currencies other than the functional currency.

 A reconciliation of the US statutory federal tax rate (35%) to the consolidated effective income tax rate follows:  

The components of net deferred tax assets (liabilities) were as follows:  

The above deferred tax balances at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were net of valuation allowances relating to net operating losses in certain countries of $170 million and $162 million, respectively. 

13.    Contingencies   
 Schlumberger and its subsidiaries are party to various legal proceedings from time to time.  A liability is accrued when a loss is both probable and can be reasonably estimated. Management believes that the probability of a material loss with respect to any currently pending legal proceedings is remote.  However, litigation is inherently uncertain and it is not possible to predict the ultimate disposition of any of these proceedings.    
 14.    Segment Information

  Third Quarter 2016 Compared to Third Quarter 2015   

(1)   Comprised principally of certain corporate expenses not allocated to the segments, stock-based compensation costs, amortization expense associated with certain intangible assets, certain centrally managed initiatives and other nonoperating items.  The third quarter of 2016 includes $63 million of amortization expense associated with intangible assets recorded as a result of the acquisition of Cameron, which was completed on April 1, 2016.   
  (2)    Interest income excludes amounts which are included in the segments  income ($7 million in 2016; $5 million in 2015).   
  (3)    Interest expense excludes amounts which are included in the segments  income ($14 million in 2016; $8 million in 2015).  
  (4)    Charges and credits recorded during the third quarter of 2016 are described in detail in Note 2 to the   Consolidated Financial Statements  .  
   
 On April 1, 2016, Schlumberger acquired all of the outstanding shares of Cameron International Corporation (Cameron), a leading provider of flow equipment products, systems and services to the oil and gas industry worldwide. The acquisition is expected to create technology-driven growth by integrating Schlumberger reservoir and well technologies with Cameron wellhead and surface equipment, flow control and processing technology. The combination of the two complementary technology portfolios provides the industry s most comprehensive range of products and services, from exploration to production and integrated pore-to-pipeline solutions that optimize hydrocarbon recovery to deliver reservoir performance.   
 Under the terms of the merger agreement, Cameron became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Schlumberger. Each share of Cameron common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger was converted into the right to receive 0.716 shares of Schlumberger stock and $14.44 in cash. As a result, Schlumberger issued approximately 138 million shares of its common stock and paid cash of approximately $2.8 billion in connection with this transaction. Based on the closing price of Schlumberger s common stock on April 1, 2016, the total fair value of the consideration transferred to effect the acquisition of Cameron was approximately $12.8 billion.  Cameron s revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $8.8 billion.   
 Third-quarter 2016 revenue of $7.0 billion decreased 17% year-on-year.  The Cameron Group contributed $1.3 billion of revenue to the third quarter of 2016.  Excluding the impact of the Cameron Group, revenue declined 33% year-on-year.  
 Third-quarter 2016 revenue from the Reservoir Characterization and Production Groups each declined year-on-year by 29% as a result of lower demand for exploration- and development-related products and services as E P budgets were further reduced.  Drilling Group revenue fell by 37% due to the rig count decline in both North America and internationally.   
 Third-quarter 2016 pretax operating margin decreased 634 basis points (bps) to 12%, as a result of the overall decline in activity and pervasive pricing concessions.  The margin decrease was the highest in the Drilling Group, which contracted by 764 bps to 11%.  Reservoir Characterization Group pretax operating margin fell 684 bps to 19%, while the Production Group decreased 652 bps to 5%. The Cameron Group posted a pretax margin of 16%. 
   
 20 
 
    Reservoir Characterization Group  
 Third-quarter 2016 revenue of $1.7 billion decreased 29% year-on-year primarily due to sustained cuts in exploration and discretionary spending that impacted Wireline, Testing Services and SIS software sales. 
 Year-on-year, pretax operating margin decreased 684 bps to 19% mainly due to reduced high-margin Wireline and Testing Services activities.  
 Drilling Group 
 Third-quarter  2016 revenue of $2.0 billion decreased 37% year-on-year primarily due to the severe drop in rig count in both North America and internationally, combined with pricing pressure  that mainly affected the Drilling   Measurements and M-I SWACO Technologies. 
   
 Year-on-year, pretax operating margin decreased 764 bps to 11% primarily due to the significant decline in higher-margin activities of Drilling   Measurements combined with pricing weakness. 
 Production Group  
 Third-quarter  2016 revenue of $2.1 billion   decreased 29% year-on-year with most of the revenue decrease attributable to a decline in North America, particularly on Well Services pressure pumping technologies  driven by activity declines and pricing pressure as the land rig count declined dramatically.   
 Year-on-year, pretax operating margin decreased 652 bps to 5% as a result of lower activity and increasing pricing pressure, which continued to impact North America land.   
 Cameron Group  
 Cameron Group contributed third-quarter revenue of $1.3 billion and pretax operating margin of 16%.  Revenue was impacted by a declining project backlog as well as a further slowdown in North America land activity, which also affected the short-cycle businesses of the Valves   Measurement and Surface product lines. 
 Pretax operating margin of 16% was driven by strong project execution in OneSubsea, improved manufacturing efficiency, and overall strong cost control across the Group. 
  Nine Months 2016 Compared to Nine Months 2015   

21 

(1)   Comprised principally of certain corporate expenses not allocated to the segments, stock-based compensation costs, amortization expense associated with certain intangible assets, certain centrally managed initiatives and other nonoperating items.  The nine months ended September 30, 2016 includes $126 million of amortization expense associated with intangible assets recorded as a result of the acquisition of Cameron.   
  (2)    Interest income excludes amounts which are included in the segments  income ($20 million in 2016; $16 million in 2015).   
  (3)    Interest expense excludes amounts which are included in the segments  income ($40 million in 2016; $21 million in 2015).  
  (4)    Charges and credits recorded during the first nine months of 2016 and 2015 are described in detail in Note 2 to the   Consolidated Financial Statements  .  
   
 Nine-month 2016 revenue of $20.7 billion decreased 25% year-on-year.  This included six months of activity from the acquired Cameron businesses. The Cameron Group contributed $2.9 billion of revenue.  Excluding the impact of the Cameron Group, revenue declined 36% year-on-year.  
 Nine-month 2016 revenue from the Reservoir Characterization and Production Groups each declined year-on-year by 33% as a result of lower demand for exploration- and development-related products and services as E P budgets were further reduced.  Drilling Group revenue fell by 38% due to the rig count decline in both North America and internationally. 
 Nine-month 2016 pretax operating margin decreased 694 bps to 12%, as a result of the overall decline in activity and pervasive pricing concessions.  The margin decrease was highest in the Reservoir Characterization Group, which contracted by 767 bps to 18%.  Drilling Group pretax operating margin fell 765 bps to 12%, while the Production Group decreased 704 bps to 6% The Cameron Group posted a pretax operating margin of 16%. 
 Reservoir Characterization Group 
 Nine-month 2016 revenue of $5.0 billion decreased 33% year-on-year primarily due to sustained cuts in exploration and discretionary spending that primarily impacted Wireline, Testing Services and SIS software sales.  
 Year-on-year, pretax operating margin decreased 767 bps to 18% due to reduced high-margin Wireline and Testing Services activities. 
 Drilling Group 
 Nine-month 2016 revenue of $6.5 billion decreased 38% year-on-year primarily due to the severe drop in rig count in both North America and internationally combined with pricing pressure  that mainly affected Drilling   Measurements and M-I SWACO Technologies.  
   
 Year-on-year, pretax operating margin decreased 765 bps to 12% primarily due to the significant decline in higher-margin activities of Drilling   Measurements combined with pricing weakness. 
 Production Group  
 Nine-month 2016 revenue of $6.5 billion   decreased 33% year-on-year with most of the revenue decrease attributable to a decline in North America, particularly on Well Services pressure pumping technologies  driven by activity declines and pricing pressure as the land rig count declined dramatically.     
 Year-on-year, pretax operating margin decreased 704 bps to 6% as a result of lower activity and increasing pricing pressure, which continued to impact North America land.   
 Cameron Group  
 Cameron Group contributed six-month revenue of $2.9 billion and pretax operating margin of 16%.  Revenue was impacted by a declining project backlog as well as a further slowdown in North America land activity, which also affected the short-cycle businesses of the Valves   Measurement and Surface product lines. 
 Pretax operating margin of 16% was driven by strong project execution in OneSubsea, improved manufacturing efficiency, and overall strong cost control across the Group. 
   
 22 
 
    Interest and Other Income  
 Interest   other income  consisted of the following:  

The decreases in earnings of equity method investments primarily reflects the effects of the downturn in the oil and gas industry, which has negatively impacted the majority of Schlumberger s investments in affiliates, particularly those in North America. 
 The increases in interest income are primarily attributable to the higher cash and short-term investment balances as a result of the issuance of $6.0 billion of Senior Notes during the fourth quarter of 2015. 
  Other  
 Research   engineering  and  General   administrative  expenses, as a percentage of  Revenue , for the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:   

Although  Research   engineering  and  General   administrative  costs have increased as a percentage of  Revenue , they have decreased in absolute dollar terms as a result of cost control measures that Schlumberger has implemented, offset in part by the impact of the Cameron acquisition. 
 Interest expense of $149 million for the third quarter of 2016 increased by $63 million compared to the same period of the prior year.  Interest expense of $431 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased by $177 million compared to the same period of the prior year.  These increases were primarily due to the issuance of $6.0 billion of Senior Notes during the fourth quarter of 2015 and the impact of the $3.0 billion of debt assumed in the acquisition of Cameron. 
 The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2016 was 5% compared to 20% for the same period of the prior year.  The charges described in Note 2 to the  Consolidated Financial Statements  reduced the third quarter 2016 effective tax rate by 11 percentage points.  The remaining decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to the geographic mix of earnings, as Schlumberger generated a greater portion of its pretax earnings outside of North America during the third quarter of 2016 as compared to the same period last year. 
 The effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was 15% compared to 22% for the same period of the prior year.  The charges described in Note 2 to the  Consolidated Financial Statements  reduced the effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 by one percentage point and increased the effective tax for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 by one percentage point.  Excluding the impact of the charges, the effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2016 was 16% and 21% for the same period in the prior year.  This decrease was primarily attributable to the fact that Schlumberger generated a greater portion of its pretax earnings outside of North America during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period last year. 
  Charges and Credits  
 In connection with Schlumberger s acquisition of Cameron (see Note 4    Acquisition of Cameron ), Schlumberger recorded $237 million of pretax charges ($177 million after-tax) in the third quarter of 2016, consisting of the following pretax amounts:  $149 million relating to the amortization of purchase accounting adjustments associated with the write-up of acquired inventory to its estimated fair value; $11 million of facility closure costs; $46 million of employee benefits including retention bonuses; and $31 million of other merger and integration-related costs.  These amounts are classified in  Merger   integration   in the   Consolidated Statement of Income.  
 23 
 
    During the second quarter of 2016, Schlumberger recorded $2.  573   billion of asset impairment and   workforce reduction charges   and $335 million of merger and integration  -  related charges associated with the   acquisition of Cameron which are classified as   Impairments       other   and   Merger   integration  ,   respectively,   in the   Consolidated Statement of Income  .  These charges     are more fully described in Note 2 to the   Consolidated Financial Statements  .  
 The following is a summary of the charges and credits recorded during the first nine months of 2016: 

There were no charges or credits recorded during the first quarter of 2016. 
 Schlumberger recorded charges during the first quarter of 2015, all of which were classified as  Impairments   other  in the  Consolidated Statement of Income .  These charges, which are summarized below, are more fully described in Note 2 to the  Consolidated Financial Statements . 

24 
 
    There were no charges or credits recorded during the second and third quarter  s   of 2015.  
  Net Debt   
 Net Debt represents gross debt less cash, short-term investments and fixed income investments, held to maturity. Management believes that Net Debt provides useful information regarding the level of Schlumberger s indebtedness by reflecting cash and investments that could be used to repay debt.   Net Debt is a non-GAAP financial measure that should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, total debt. 
 Details of changes in Net Debt follow:  

(1)       
 
 Includes depreciation of property, plant and equipment and amortization of intangible assets, multiclient seismic data costs and SPM investments.     

  (2)        Free cash flow  represents cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, SPM investments and multiclient seismic data costs capitalized. Management believes that free cash flow is an important liquidity measure for the company and that it is useful to investors and management as a measure of the ability of our business to generate cash.  Once business needs and obligations are met, this cash can be used to reinvest in the company for future growth or to return to shareholders through dividend payments or share repurchases.  Free cash flow does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures.  Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that should be considered in addition to, not as substitute for, or superior to, cash flow from operations.  

25 

Key liquidity events during the first nine months of 2016 and 2015 included:  

Schlumberger paid $2.8 billion of cash in connection with the April 1, 2016 acquisition of Cameron.  Additionally, as a result of the acquisition of Cameron, Schlumberger assumed net debt of $785 million.  This amount consisted of $3.0 billion of debt (including a $244 million adjustment to increase Cameron s long-term fixed rate debt to its estimated fair value) and $2.2 billion of cash and short-term investments.     

During the second quarter of 2016, Schlumberger repurchased approximately $1.4 billion of Cameron s long-term fixed-rate debt.     

On July 18, 2013, the Schlumberger Board of Directors (the  Board ) approved a $10 billion share repurchase program to be completed at the latest by June 30, 2018.  Schlumberger had repurchased $9.2 billion of shares under this new share repurchase program as of September 30, 2016.      

 The following table summarizes the activity under this share repurchase program:  

On January 21, 2016, the Board approved a new $10 billion share repurchase program for Schlumberger common stock.  The new program will take effect once the remaining $0.8 billion authorized to be repurchased under the July 18, 2013 program is exhausted. 

In April 2016, Schlumberger announced that it would reduce its activity in Venezuela to align operations with cash collections as a result of insufficient payments received in recent quarters and a lack of progress in establishing new mechanisms that address past and future accounts receivable.  Venezuela represented less than 5% of Schlumberger s consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
 Schlumberger operates in more than 85 countries.  At September 30, 2016, only five of those countries individually accounted for greater than 5% of Schlumberger s accounts receivable balances, of which only two (the United States and Venezuela) accounted for greater than 10%.  Schlumberger s net receivable balance in Venezuela as of September 30, 2016 was approximately $1.2 billion. 
 As of September 30, 2016, Schlumberger had $10.8 billion of cash and short-term investments on hand.  Schlumberger had separate committed debt facility agreements aggregating $6.8 billion with commercial banks, of which $3.8 billion was available and unused as of September 30, 2016.  The $6.8 billion of committed debt facility agreements included $6.5 billion of committed facilities that support commercial paper programs.  Schlumberger believes these amounts are sufficient to meet future business requirements for at least the next 12 months.  
 Borrowings under the commercial paper programs at September 30, 2016 were $3.0 billion.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.   
   For quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk affecting Schlumberger, see Item 7A,  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk,  of the Schlumberger Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. Schlumberger s exposure to market risk has not changed materially since December 31, 2015.  
  Item 4. Controls and Procedures.   
 Schlumberger has carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of Schlumberger s management, including the Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ) and the Chief Financial Officer ( CFO ), of the effectiveness of Schlumberger s  disclosure controls and procedures  (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act )) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on this evaluation, the CEO and the CFO have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, Schlumberger s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the reports that Schlumberger files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. Schlumberger s disclosure controls and procedures include controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to its management, including the CEO and the CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. There was no change in Schlumberger s internal control over financial reporting during the quarter to which this report relates that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, Schlumberger s internal control over financial reporting.  
  PART II. OTHER INFORMATION   
   
      Item 1. Legal Proceedings.   
 The information with respect to this Item 1 is set forth under Note 13  Contingencies,  in the  Consolidated Financial Statements .  
   
    Item 1A. Risk Factors.   
   On April 1, 2016, Schlumberger completed the acquisition of Cameron and therefore no longer faces risks associated with the ability to complete the Cameron merger.  Except as described in the foregoing sentence, as of the date of this filing, there have been no material changes from the risk factors previously disclosed in Part 1, Item 1A, of Schlumberger s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. 
  Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds.   
  Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities   
 27 
 
    None.   
  Issuer Repurchases of Equity Securities   
 On July 18, 2013, the Board approved a $10 billion share repurchase program for shares of Schlumberger common stock, to be completed at the latest by June 30, 2018.    
 Schlumberger s common stock repurchase program activity for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was as follows:  

In connection with the exercise of stock options under Schlumberger s incentive compensation plans, Schlumberger routinely receives shares of its common stock from optionholders in consideration of the exercise price of the stock options. Schlumberger does not view these transactions as requiring disclosure under this Item as the number of shares of Schlumberger common stock received from optionholders is not material.  
 On January 21, 2016, the Board approved a new $10 billion share repurchase program for Schlumberger common stock.  This new program will take effect once the remaining $0.8 billion authorized to be repurchased under the July 18, 2013 program is exhausted. 
   
      Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities.   
 None .   
   
    Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures.   
 The barite and bentonite mining operations of M-I LLC, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, are subject to regulation by the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977. Information concerning mine safety violations or other regulatory matters required by section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and Item 104 of Regulation S-K is included in Exhibit 95 to this report.  
   
      Item 5. Other Information.   
 Schlumberger completed the wind down of its service operations in Iran during 2013. Prior to this, certain non-US subsidiaries of Schlumberger provided oilfield services to the National Iranian Oil Company and certain of its affiliates ( NIOC ). 
  Schlumberger s residual transactions or dealings with the government of Iran in the third quarter of 2016 consisted of payments of taxes and other typical governmental charges. Certain non-US subsidiaries of Schlumberger maintain depository accounts at the Dubai branch of Bank Saderat Iran ( Saderat ), and at Bank Tejarat ( Tejarat ) in Tehran and in Kish for the deposit by NIOC of amounts owed to non-US subsidiaries of Schlumberger for prior services rendered in Iran and for the maintenance of such amounts previously received. One non-US subsidiary also maintains an account at Tejarat for payment of local expenses such as taxes. Schlumberger anticipates that it will discontinue dealings with Saderat and Tejarat following the receipt of all amounts owed to Schlumberger for prior services rendered in Iran.

Exhibit 95   
 Mine Safety Disclosure  
   
     The following disclosure is provided pursuant to Section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which requires certain disclosures by companies required to file periodic reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that operate mines regulated under the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977.   
 The table that follows reflects citations, orders, violations and proposed assessments issued by the Mine Safety and Health Administration (the  MSHA ) to M-I LLC, an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Schlumberger.  The disclosure is with respect to the three months ended September 30, 2016.  Due to timing and other factors, the data may not agree with the mine data retrieval system maintained by the MSHA at www.MSHA.gov. 
  Three Months Ended September 30, 2016  
 [unaudited] 
 ( whole dollars ) 

(1)   
 
 Amounts included are the total dollar value of proposed assessments received from MSHA on or before September 30, 2016, regardless of whether the assessment has been challenged or appealed.  Citations and orders can be contested and appealed, and as part of that process, are sometimes reduced in severity and amount, and sometimes dismissed.  The number of citations, orders, and proposed assessments vary by inspector and also vary depending on the size and type of the operation.    

*As of September 30, 2016, MSHA had not yet proposed an assessment for one S S citation at Greystone Mine/2600411.
