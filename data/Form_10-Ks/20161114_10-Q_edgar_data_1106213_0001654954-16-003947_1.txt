Statements
in this Form 10-Q Quarterly Report may be  forward-looking
statements.   Forward-looking statements include,
but are not limited to, statements that express our intentions,
beliefs, expectations, strategies, predictions or any other
statements relating to our future activities or other future events
or conditions.  These statements are based on our current
expectations, estimates and projections about our business based,
in part, on assumptions made by our management.  These
assumptions are not guarantees of future performance and involve
risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to
predict.  Therefore, actual outcomes and results may
differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in the
forward-looking statements due to numerous factors, including those
risks discussed in this Form 10-Q Quarterly Report, under
 Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations  and in other documents
which we file with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. 

In
addition, such statements could be affected by risks and
uncertainties related to our financial condition, factors that
affect our industry, market and customer acceptance, changes in
technology, fluctuations in our quarterly results, our ability to
continue and manage our growth, liquidity and other capital
resource issues, compliance with government regulations and
permits, agreements with third parties to conduct operations,
competition, fulfillment of contractual obligations by other
parties and general economic conditions.  Any
forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they
are made, and we do not undertake any obligation to update any
forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after
the date of this Form 10-Q Quarterly Report, except as required by
Federal Securities law.

NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

(Unaudited) 

The
accompanying condensed financial statements of Seafarer Exploration
Corp. ( Seafarer  or the  Company ) are
unaudited, but in the opinion of management, reflect all
adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments)
necessary to fairly state the Company s financial position,
results of operations, and cash flows as of and for the dates and
periods presented. The financial statements of the Company are
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) for
interim financial information. 

These
unaudited condensed financial statements should be read in
conjunction with the Company s audited financial statements
and footnotes included in the Company s Report on Form 10-K
for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the  Commission ).
The results of operations for the nine months ended September 30,
2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be
expected for the entire year ending December 31, 2016 or for
any future period. 

NOTE 1   DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS 

Seafarer
Exploration Corp. (the  Company ), formerly Organetix,
Inc. ( Organetix ), was incorporated on May 28, 2003 in
the State of Delaware. 

The
principal business of the Company is to develop the infrastructure
necessary to engage in the archaeologically-sensitive exploration
and recovery of historic shipwrecks. During 2008, the Company
changed its fiscal year end from April 30 to December
31. 

NOTE 2 - GOING CONCERN 

These
financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis,
which assumes the Company will be able to realize its assets and
discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business for the
foreseeable future. The Company has incurred net losses since
inception, which raises substantial doubt about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern. Based on its historical
rate of expenditures, the Company expects to expend its available
cash in less than one month from November 14, 2016. Management's
plans include raising capital through the equity markets to fund
operations and, eventually, the generation of revenue through its
business. The Company does not expect to generate any revenues for
the foreseeable future. 

Failure
to raise adequate capital and generate adequate revenues could
result in the Company having to curtail or cease operations. The
Company s ability to raise additional capital through the
future issuances of the common stock is unknown. Additionally, even
if the Company does raise sufficient capital to support its
operating expenses and generate adequate revenues, there can be no
assurances that the revenue will be sufficient to enable it to
develop to a level where it will generate profits and cash flows
from operations. These matters raise substantial doubt about the
Company's ability to continue as a going concern; however, the
accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going
concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and
satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. These
financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the
recovery of the recorded assets or the classifications of the
liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to
continue as a going concern.

NOTE 3   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES 

This
summary of significant accounting policies of Seafarer Exploration
Corp. is presented to assist in understanding the
Company s condensed financial statements.  The
condensed financial statements and notes are representations of the
Company s management, who are responsible for their integrity
and objectivity.  These accounting policies conform to
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America, and have been consistently applied in the preparation of
the condensed financial statements. 

Accounting Method 

The
Company s condensed financial statements are prepared using
the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents 

For
purposes of the statement of cash flows, the Company considers all
highly liquid investments and short-term debt instruments with
original maturities of three months or less to be cash
equivalents.     

Revenue Recognition 

The
Company recognizes revenue on arrangements in accordance with
Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No.
101,  Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements  and
No. 104,  Revenue Recognition . In all cases, revenue
is recognized only when the price is fixed or determinable,
persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the service is
performed and collectability is reasonably assured. For the periods
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company did not report any
revenues. 

Earnings Per Share 

The
Company has adopted the Financial Accounting Standards
Board s ( FASB ) Accounting Standards
Codification ( ASC ) 260-10 which provides for
calculation of "basic" and "diluted" earnings per
share.  Basic earnings per share includes no dilution and
is computed by dividing net income or loss available to common
stockholders by the weighted average common shares outstanding for
the period.  Diluted earnings per share reflect the
potential dilution of securities that could share in the earnings
of an entity.  Basic and diluted losses per share were
the same at the reporting dates as there were no common stock
equivalents outstanding at September 30, 2016 and
2015. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments 

Effective
January 1, 2008, fair value measurements are determined by the
Company's adoption of authoritative guidance issued by the FASB,
with the exception of the application of the statement to
non-recurring, non-financial assets and liabilities, as permitted.
Fair value is defined in the authoritative guidance as the price
that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a
liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the
asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market
participants at the measurement date. A fair value hierarchy was
established, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair
value into three broad levels as follows: 

Level 1
  Valuation based on unadjusted quoted market prices in
active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 

Level 2
  Valuation based on, observable inputs (other than level one
prices), quoted market prices for similar assets such as at the
measurement date; quoted prices in the market that are not active;
or other inputs that are observable, either directly or
indirectly. 

Level 3
  Valuation based on unobservable inputs that are supported
by little or no market activity, therefore requiring
management s best estimate of what market participants would
use as fair value. 

In
instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is
based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy,
the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair
value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is
significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The
Company s assessment of the significance of a particular
input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires
judgment, and considers factors specific to the asset or liability.
The valuation of the Company s notes recorded at fair value
is determined using Level 3 inputs, which consider (i) time value,
(ii) current market and (iii) contractual prices. 

The
carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities, such as cash
and cash equivalents, receivables, accounts payable, notes payable
and other payables, approximate their fair values because of the
short maturity of these instruments.

Property and Equipment and Depreciation 

Fixed
assets are recorded at historical cost. Depreciation is computed on
the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the
respective assets. Property and equipment, net consist of the
following at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

Depreciation
expense for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and
2015 amounted to $25,488. 

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets 

In
accordance with ASC 360-10, the Company, on a regular basis,
reviews the carrying amount of long-lived assets for the existence
of facts or circumstances, both internally and externally, that
suggest impairment. The Company determines if the carrying amount
of a long-lived asset is impaired based on anticipated undiscounted
cash flows, before interest, from the use of the asset. In the
event of impairment, a loss is recognized based on the amount by
which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the asset. Fair
value is determined based on appraised value of the assets or the
anticipated cash flows from the use of the asset, discounted at a
rate commensurate with the risk involved. There were no impairment
charges recorded during the periods ended September 30, 2016 and
2015. 

Employee Stock Based Compensation 

The
FASB issued SFAS No.123 (revised 2004),  Share-Based Payment  , which was
superseded by ASC 718-10. ASC 718-10 provides investors and other
users of financial statements with more complete and
neutral financial information, by requiring that the
compensation cost relating to share-based payment transactions be
recognized in financial statements. That cost will be measured
based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments
issued. SFAS 123(R) covers a wide range of share-based compensation
arrangements, including share options, restricted share plans,
performance-based awards, share appreciation rights and employee
share purchase plans. As of September 30, 2016, the Company has not
implemented an employee stock based compensation plan. 

Non-Employee Stock Based Compensation 

The
Company accounts for stock based compensation awards issued to
non-employees for services, as prescribed by ASC 718-10, at either
the fair value of the services rendered or the instruments issued
in exchange for such services, whichever is more readily
determinable, using the measurement date guidelines enumerated in
EITF 96-18,   Accounting for
Equity Instruments That Are Issued to Other Than Employees for
Acquiring, or in Conjunction with Selling, Goods or Services 
, which was superseded by ASC 505-50.  The Company has
previously issued compensatory shares for various services
including, but not limited to, executive, board of directors,
business consulting, corporate advisory, accounting, research,
archeological, operations, strategic planning, corporate
communications, financial, legal and administrative consulting
services. As determined by Management the Company may issue
compensatory shares in the future for these or other services.

Use of Estimates 

The
process of preparing condensed financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America requires the use of estimates and assumptions regarding
certain types of assets, liabilities, revenues, and
expenses.  Such estimates primarily relate to unsettled
transactions and events as of the date of the condensed financial
statements.  Accordingly, upon settlement, actual results
may differ from estimated amounts. 

11 

Convertible Notes Payable 

The
Company accounts for conversion options embedded in convertible
notes in accordance with ASC 815. ASC 815 generally requires
companies to bifurcate conversion options embedded in convertible
notes from their host instruments and to account for them as free
standing derivative financial instruments. ASC 815 provides for an
exception to this rule when convertible notes, as host instruments,
are deemed to be conventional, as defined by ASC
815-40. 

The
Company accounts for convertible notes deemed conventional and
conversion options embedded in non-conventional convertible notes
which qualify as equity under ASC 815, in accordance with the
provisions of ASC 470-20, which provides guidance on accounting for
convertible securities with beneficial conversion features.
Accordingly, the Company records, as a discount to convertible
notes, the intrinsic value of such conversion options based upon
the differences between the fair value of the underlying common
stock at the commitment date of the note transaction and the
effective conversion price embedded in the note. Debt discounts
under these arrangements are amortized over the term of the related
debt.   

The
classification of derivative instruments, including whether such
instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity, is
evaluated at the end of each reporting
period.  Derivative instrument liabilities are classified
in the balance sheet as current or non-current based on whether or
not net-cash settlement of the derivative instrument could be
required within 12 months of the balance sheet
date.  

Convertible Notes Payable at Fair Value 

The
  Company   elected   to   account   for
  this   hybrid   contract   under   the
  guidance   of   ASC  
815-15-25-4.  This guidance allows an entity that
initially recognizes a hybrid financial instrument that under
paragraph   ASC 815-15-25-1 would be required to be
separated into a host contract and a derivative instrument may
irrevocably elect to initially and subsequently measure that hybrid
financial instrument in its entirety at fair value (with changes in
fair value recognized in earnings). 

The
fair value election is also available when a previously recognized
financial instrument subject to a re-measurement event and the
separate recognition of an embedded derivative. The fair value
election may be made instrument by instrument. For purposes of this
paragraph, a re-measurement event (new basis event) is an event
identified in generally accepted accounting principles, other than
the recognition of an other-than-temporary impairment, that
requires a financial instrument to be re-measured to its fair value
at the time of the event but does not require that instrument to be
reported at fair value on a continuous basis with the change in
fair value recognized in earnings. Examples of re-measurement
events are business combinations and significant modifications of
debt as defined in Subtopic 470-50.

Series B Preferred Stock 

On
February 10, 2014, the Board of Directors of the Company under the
authority granted under Article V of the Articles of Incorporation,
defined and created a new preferred series of shares from the
50,000,000 authorized preferred shares. Pursuant to Article V, the
Board of Directors has the power to designate such shares and all
powers and matters concerning such shares. Such share class shall
be designated Preferred Class B. The preferred class was created
for 60 Preferred Class B shares. Such shares each have a voting
power equal to one percent of the outstanding shares issued
(totaling 60%) at the time of any vote action as necessary for
share votes under Florida law, with or without a shareholder
meeting.  Such shares are non-convertible to common stock
of the Company and are not considered as convertible under any
accounting measure. Such shares shall only be held by the Board of
Directors as a Corporate body, and shall not be placed into any
individual name. Such shares were considered issued at the time of
this resolution s adoption, and do not require a stock
certificate to exist, unless selected to do so by the Board for
representational purposes only.  Such shares are
considered for voting as a whole amount, and shall be voted for any
matter by a majority vote of the Board of Directors. Such shares
shall not be divisible among the Board members, and shall be voted
as a whole either for or against such a vote upon the vote of the
majority of the Board of Directors. In the event that there is any
vote taken which results in a tie of a vote of the Board of
Directors, the vote of the Chairman of the Board shall control the
voting of such shares. Such shares are not transferable except in
the case of a change of control of the Corporation when such shares
shall continue to be held by the Board of Directors. Such shares
have the authority to vote for all matters that require a share
vote under Florida law and the Articles of
Incorporation.

at the federal statutory rate and the provision for income taxes
are as follows:

Deferred
income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences
between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial
reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax
purposes. 

As of
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company s only
significant deferred income tax asset was an estimated net tax
operating loss of  $12,518,000 and
$11,326,000  respectively that is available to offset future
taxable income, if any, in future periods, subject to expiration
and other limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue
Service. Management has considered the Company's operating
losses incurred to date and believes that a full valuation
allowance against the deferred tax assets is required as of
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. Company is preparing
information for tax returns for past years. Due to the
Company s lack of revenue since inception, management does
not believe that there is any income tax liability for past years.
Management has evaluated tax positions in accordance with ASC 740
and has not identified any tax positions, other than those
discussed above, that require disclosure.

NOTE 8 - CONVERTIBLE NOTES PAYABLE AND NOTES
PAYABLE 

The
Company evaluates each financial instrument to determine whether it
meets the definition of  conventional convertible  debt
under ASC 815-40.  The note payable conversion feature of
the outstanding convertible debt met the definition of conventional
convertible for purposes of applying the conventional convertible
exemption. The definition of conventional contemplates a limitation
on the number of shares issuable under the arrangement. Since the
convertible notes achieved the conventional convertible exemption,
the Company was required to consider whether the hybrid contracts
embody a beneficial conversion feature. The calculation of the
effective conversion amount did result in a beneficial conversion
feature.  

Convertible Notes Payable 

The
following table reflects the convertible notes payable, other than
five notes that have been remeasured to fair value which are

The

Note
Conversions    

A
lender who had a convertible promissory note outstanding with a
remaining principal balance of $38,000 elected to convert a portion
of the principal balance of $13,348 of the note plus accrued
interest and late fees of $6,652 into 12,750,000 shares of the
Company s common stock. The remaining principal balance of
this note was $23,652 at September 30, 2016 

A
lender elected to convert the entire principal balance of $15,000
of a convertible promissory note into 30,000,000 shares of the
Company s common stock. The remaining principal balance of
this note was $0 at September 30, 2016. 

A
lender elected to receive 10,000,000 shares of the Company s
common stock to pay down $10,000 of the principle balance of a
promissory note. The remaining principal balance of this note was
$7,000 at September 30, 2016. 

At
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, combined accrued interest
on the convertible notes payable, notes payable and stockholder
loans was $154,790 and $135,581 respectively, and is included in
accounts payable and accrued liabilities on the accompanying
balance sheets. 

Convertible Notes Payable and Notes Payable, in
Default 

The
Company does not have additional sources of debt financing to
refinance its convertible notes payable and notes payable that are
currently in default. If the Company is unable to obtain additional
capital, such lenders may file suit, including suit to foreclose on
the assets held as collateral for the obligations arising under the
secured notes. If any of the lenders file suit to foreclose on the
assets held as collateral, then the Company may be forced to
significantly scale back or cease its operations which would more
than likely result in a complete loss of all capital that has been
invested in or borrowed by the Company. The fact that the Company
is in default of several promissory notes held by various lenders
makes investing in the Company or providing any loans to the
Company extremely risky with a very high potential for a complete
loss of capital. 

The
convertible notes that have been issued by the Company are
convertible at the lender s option. These convertible notes
represent significant potential dilution to the Company s
current shareholders as the convertible price of these notes is
generally lower than the current market price of the
Company s shares. As such when these notes are converted into
shares of the Company s common stock there is typically a
highly dilutive effect on current shareholders and very possible
that such dilution may significantly negatively affect the trading
price of the Company s common stock. 

Shareholder Loans 

At September 30, 2016 the Company had two loans outstanding to its
CEO totaling $29,270, consisting of a loan in the amount of $28,070
with a 6% annual rate of interest and a loan in the amount of
$1,200 at 6% rate of interest and an option to convert the loan
into restricted shares of the Company s common stock at
$0.002, and, a loan in the amount of $1,200 at a rate of 0%
interest.

Convertible Notes Payable at Fair Value 

Convertible Note Payable Dated August 28, 2015 at Fair
Value 

On
August 28, 2015 the Company entered into a convertible note payable
with a corporation.  The note payable, with a face value
of $44,000, including a $4,000 of original issue discount, bears
interest at 12.0% per annum and is due on August 28, 2016. The
convertible note payable is convertible, at the holder s
option, into the Company s common shares at the Variable
Conversion Price. The Variable Conversion Price is defined as 62%
multiplied by the lowest closing bid price for the Company s
common stock during the twenty (20) trading day period including
the day the notice of conversion is received by the Company. If the
Company s market capitalization is less than $1,000,000 on
the day immediately prior to the date of the notice of conversion,
then the conversion price shall be 25% multiplied by the lowest
closing price as of the date notice of conversion is given and if
the closing price of the Company s common stock on the day
immediately prior to the date of the notice of conversion is less
than $0.00075 then the conversion price shall be 25% multiplied by
the lowest closing price as of the date a notice of conversion is
given. The conversion feature is subject to full-ratchet,
anti-dilution protection if the Company sells shares or
share-indexed financing instruments at less than the conversion
price. 

In the
evaluation of the financing arrangement, the Company concluded that
the conversion feature did not meet the conditions set forth in
current accounting standards for equity classification. Since
equity classification is not available for the conversion feature,
it requires bifurcation and liability classification, at fair
value. The Company elected to account for this hybrid contract
under the guidance of ASC 815-15-25-4.   

In
connection with the issuance of the convertible note payable, the
Company recognized day-one derivative loss totaling $76,210 related
to the recognition of (i) the hybrid note and (ii) the derivative
instrument arising from the fair value measurement due to the fair
value of the hybrid note and embedded derivative exceeding the
proceeds that the Company received from the arrangement. Therefore,
the Company was required to record a $76,210 loss on the derivative
financial instrument. In addition, the fair value will change in
future periods, based upon changes in the Company s common
stock price and changes in other assumptions and market indicators
used in the valuation techniques. These future changes will be
currently recognized in interest expense or interest income on the
Company s statement of operations. 

The
conversion of the note into shares of the Company s common
stock is potentially highly dilutive to current shareholders. If
the note holder elects to sell the shares that it has acquired as a
result of converting the note into shares of common stock, then any
such sales may result in a significant decrease in the market price
of the Company s shares.   

During
the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, the principle
balance and accrued interest was converted into 54,561,311 shares
of common stock. 

Convertible Note Payable Dated September 3, 2015 at Fair
Value 

On
September 3, 2015 the Company entered into a convertible note
payable with a corporation.  The note payable in the
amount of $38,500, including a $3,500 original issue discount, and
bears interest at 12.0% per annum and is due on September 3, 2017.
According to the terms of the note, the Company was eligible to
utilize up to $200,000 of credit under the note, with potential
proceeds received of $180,000, however at the time the Company
elected to borrow only the $38,500.  Any additional
amount borrowed under this note would require approval of both the
Company and the lender. The convertible note payable is
convertible, at the holder s option, into the Company s
common shares at the Variable Conversion Price. The Variable
Conversion Price is defined as 65% multiplied by the lowest trade
price for the Company s common stock in the twenty-five (25)
trading day period previous to the conversion. The conversion
feature is subject to full-ratchet, anti-dilution protection if the
Company sells shares or share-indexed financing instruments at less
than the conversion price. 

In the
evaluation of the financing arrangement, the Company concluded that
the conversion feature did not meet the conditions set forth in
current accounting standards for equity classification. Since

In
connection with the issuance of the convertible note payable, the
Company recognized day-one derivative loss totaling $42,308 related
to the recognition of (i) the hybrid note and (ii) the derivative
instrument arising from the fair value measurement due to the fair
value of the hybrid note and embedded derivative exceeding the
proceeds that the Company received from the arrangement. Therefore,
the Company was required to record a $29,789 loss on the derivative
financial instrument. In addition, the fair value will change in
future periods, based upon changes in the Company s common
stock price and changes in other assumptions and market indicators
used in the valuation techniques. These future changes will be
currently recognized in interest expense or interest income on the
Company s statement of operations. 

The

payable with a corporation.  The convertible note
payable, with a face value of $27,000, bears interest at 8.0% per
annum and is due on September 8, 2016. The note payable is
convertible, at the holder s option, into the Company s
common shares at the Variable Conversion Price. The Variable
Conversion Price is defined as 65% multiplied by the lowest closing
bid price   for the Company s common stock during
the fifteen (15) trading day period including the day the notice of

Elizabeth Lizzano, Karen Lizzano, Susan Miller, Jillian Mally,
Michael Mona, Alan Wolper, Sarah Wolper, Alan Wolper FBO Michael
Wolper, Spartan Securities Group, Ltd., and Am Asia Consulting
entered into the settlement agreement with Seafarer. An earlier
named party, CADEF, The Childhood Autism Foundation, Inc., had
previously entered into a settlement agreement and is no longer a
party in the Litigation. 

The
settlement called for both cases to be dismissed, with prejudice,
and the Plaintiffs in case number 09-CA-30763 agreed to surrender
and cancel all of their 32,300,000 shares of restricted common
stock which were returned to the treasury of the Corporation. All
such shares have been returned for cancellation. On March 23, 2016
Seafarer CEO signed the resolution to cancel the 32,300,000 shares
and instructed the transfer agent ClearTrust LLC to cancel the
shares and return them to treasury for the benefit of Seafarer thus
reducing the number of outstanding shares by 32,300,000 shares. At
the present time the dismissal has been filed and the case closed,
with all shares cancelled. 

On June
18, 2013, Seafarer began litigation against Tulco Resources, LLC,
in a lawsuit filed in the Circuit Court in and for Hillsborough
County, Florida. Such suit was filed for against Tulco based
upon  for breach of contract, equitable relief and
injunctive relief. Tulco was the party holding the rights under a
permit to a treasure site at Juno Beach, Florida. Tulco and
Seafarer had entered into contracts  in March 2008, and
later renewed under an amended agreement on June 11, 2010. Such
permit was committed to by Tulco to be an obligation and
contractual duty to which they would be responsible for payment of
all costs in order for the permit to be reissued. Such obligation
is contained in the agreement of March 2008 which was renewed in
the June 2010 agreement between Seafarer and Tulco. Tulco made the
commitment to be responsible for payments of all necessary costs
for the gaining of the new permit. Tulco never performed on such
obligation, and Seafarer during the period of approximately March
2008 and April 2012 had endeavored and even had to commence a
lawsuit to gain such permit which was awarded in April 2012.
Seafarer alleges in their complaint the expenditure of large
amounts of shares and monies for financing and for delays due to
Tulco s non-performance. Seafarer seeks monetary damages and
injunctive relief for the award of all rights held by Tulco to
Seafarer Seafarer gained a default and final Judgment on such
matter on July 23, 2014. Seafarer is now working with the State for
the renewed permit to be in Seafarer s name and rights only,
with Tulco removed per the Order of the Court. On March 4, 2015,
the Court awarded full rights to the Juno sight to Seafarer
Exploration, erasing all rights of Tulco Resources. The company has
currently filed an Admiralty Claim over such sight in the United
States District Court which is pending final ruling. On October 21,
2016 a hearing on the Admiralty Claim in the United States District
Court for the Southern District of Florida was held, where the
Court Ordered actions to take place for ongoing admiralty claim,
which will occur during the month of November 2016. The Company
expects to complete such claim within a few months.

On
September 3, 2014, the Company filed a lawsuit against Darrel
Volentine, of California. Mr. Volentine was sued in two counts of
libel per se under Florida law, as well as a count for injunction
against the Defendant to exclude and prohibit internet postings.
Such lawsuit was filed in the Circuit Court in Hillsborough County,
Florida. Such suit is based upon internet postings on  www.investorshub.com .
On or about October 15, 2015, the Company and Volentine entered
into a stipulation whereby Volentine admitted to his tortious
conduct, however the stipulated damages agreed to were rejected by
the Court, and the Company is proceeding to trial on damages
against Volentine in a non-jury trial on December 1, 2015. The
Defendant is the subject of a contempt of court motion which was
heard on April 7, 2016, whereby the Court found a violation and
modified the injunction against the Defendant, and imposed other
matters of potential penalties against the Defendant. The Court
also awarded attorney s fees against the Defendant on behalf
of Seafarer for such motion. The Defendant subsequently attempted
to have such ruling, evidence and testimony attacked through a
motion heard before the Court on October 24, 2016. The Court
dismissed the Defendant s motion after presentation of the
Defendant s case at the hearing. The Plaintiff has set the
matter for entry of the attorney s fees amount due from the
Defendant for hearing in December 2016. As well the Plaintiff has
set for hearing its motion for sanctions in the form of
attorney s fees for frivolous filing of the October
24 th 
motion, which motion is also set for hearing in December 2016. The
Plaintiff filed a renewed and amended motion for punitive damages
in the case on September 11, 2016, which has not been set for
hearing. The Defendant had also filed a motion for summary judgment
on the matter of notice entitlement pre-suit, which motion is
pending before the Court. The Plaintiff filed a motion for
sanctions against the Defendant for the motion for summary judgment
being frivolous under existing law, and such motion is pending
ruling on the motion. Discovery is ongoing on such
case.

Overview 

General 

It has
been estimated, but not verified, by the United Nations
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization
( UNESCO ) that there are over three million
undiscovered shipwrecks around the world and a few of these
shipwrecks were lost with verifiable cargoes that contained
valuable materials, including artifacts and treasure. However, many
of these shipwrecks may have very little archaeological or
historical value. 

The
Company s principal business plan is to develop the
infrastructure to engage in the archaeologically-sensitive
exploration, recovery and conservation of historic shipwrecks. Once
artifacts have been properly conserved, they will be made available
for scientific research and allowed to be displayed for the public.
The Company believes it will eventually be conducting
archaeological research around the world and potentially supporting
organizations like UNESCO and The National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration ( NOAA ) in the documentation of
historic shipwrecks. The business plan also includes in-depth
archival research and translation of historical documents from
various international archives and repositories. These translations
of archival research will be made available to government states,
university researchers, NOAA, UNESCO, and other responsible
academic parties upon reasonable request. In addition to the
research, there is ongoing education of personnel involved in
operations with the Company. College level courses in archaeology
are being periodically taught by a Ph.D. in a program to help
educate the personnel in context, work methodology, documentation,
and conservation. It is the Company s intent to have the
highest educated personnel possible. 

This
type of business venture is extremely speculative in nature and
carries a tremendous amount of risk. An investment in our
securities is highly speculative and extremely risky and should
only be considered by those investors or lenders who do not require
liquidity and who can afford to suffer a complete and total loss of
their investment. 

The
exploration and recovery of historic shipwrecks involves a
multi-year, multi stage process. It may take many years and/or be
prohibitively expensive to locate, if any are ever located at all,
and recover valuable artifacts from historic shipwrecks. Locating
and recovering valuable artifacts is very challenging and the
probability that the Company will locate and recover valuable
artifacts or treasure is remote. If the Company is able to recover
valuable artifacts, the artifacts will be very expensive to
conserve and store. If the Company is not able to locate and
recover artifacts or treasure that are of significant value, then
there is high probability that the Company will face adverse
consequences. 

Underwater
recovery operations are inherently difficult and dangerous and may
be delayed or suspended by weather, sea conditions or other natural
hazards. In addition, even though sea conditions in a particular
search location may be somewhat predictable, the possibility exists
that unexpected conditions may occur, and already have occurred,
that adversely affect the Company s operations. It is also
possible that natural hazards may prevent or significantly delay
exploration and recovery operations. 

In
addition to natural hazards there are constant repair and
maintenance issues with historic shipwreck exploration and recovery
vessels, which tend to be older vessels that were originally used
in other capacities that have been converted for use in historic
shipwreck exploration and recovery operations. The repairs,
maintenance and upkeep of this type of vessel, and in particular
the Company s main vessel, is time consuming and can be very
expensive and there may be significant periods of vessel down time
that results from needed repairs being made or a lack of current
financing to make repairs to the vessel. 

27 

Furthermore,
there are very strict international, federal and state laws that
govern the exploration and recovery of historic shipwrecks. While
the Company has been able to obtain some permits, there is no
guarantee that the Company will be able to secure future permits or
be able to enter into agreements with government agencies in order
to explore and salvage historic shipwrecks. 

Obtaining
permits and entering into agreements with governmental and
quasi-governmental agencies to conduct historic shipwreck
exploration and recovery operations is generally a very complex,
time consuming, and expensive process. Furthermore, the process of
entering into agreements and/or obtaining permits may be subject to
lengthy delays, possibly in excess of a year. 

The
reasons for a lengthy permitting process may be due to a number of
potential factors including but not limited to requests by
permitting agencies for additional information, submitted
applications that need to be revised or updated, newly discovered
information that needs to be added to an application or agreement,
changes to either the agreement or permit terms or revisions to
other information contained in the permit, excessive administrative
time lags at permitting agencies, etc. The length of time it takes
to obtain permits or enter into agreements may cause the Company to
expend significant resources while gearing up to do work with
little or no visibility as to the timing of receiving a
permit. 

It is
also possible that permits that are sought for potential future
international projects may never be issued, and if issued, may not
be legal or honored by the entities that issued them. Even if the
Company is able to obtain permits for shipwreck projects there is a
possibility that the shipwrecks may have already been recovered or
may not be found, or may not have had anything valuable on board at
the time that they sank. 

It is
the Company s intent to find shipwrecks where available
research suggests there were not any previous recovery efforts or
past recovery efforts failed or were not completed. In the event
that valuable artifacts are located and recovered, it is possible
that the cost of recovery will exceed the value of the artifacts
recovered. It is also possible that other entities, including both
private parties and governmental entities, will assert conflicting
claims and challenge the Company s rights to the recovered
artifacts which could lead to lengthy and expensive legal
issues. 

Moreover,
there is the possibility that should the Company be successful in
locating and recovering artifacts that have significant
archeological, historical and/or monetary value that a country
whose ship was recovered may attempt to assert ownership of the
artifacts by pursuing litigation. In the event that the Company is
able to make a valid claim to artifacts or other items at a
shipwreck site there is a risk of theft of such items at sea, both
before or after the recovery or while the artifacts are in transit
to a designated and safe destination, as well as when stored in a
secured location. Such thefts may not be adequately covered by
insurance. Based on a number of these and other potential issues
the Company could spend a great deal of time and invest a large sum
in a specific shipwreck project and receive very little or no
salvage claim or revenue for its work. 

There
are a number significant issues and challenges that make the
exploration and recovery of historic shipwrecks a speculative
and highly risky business venture including, but not limited to,
government regulation, the Company s inability to secure
permits and contracts or lengthy delays in obtaining permits or
entering into agreements, periodic lack of financing, lack of
revenue and cash flow and continued losses from
operations. There is also a significant expense involved in
research and ongoing educational programs. Research expenses
involve paying scientists for translations, dues and fees for
various historical entities such as archives, travel and
accommodations, and research materials.  

There
is a possibility that the Company will be forced to cease its
operations if it is not successful in eventually locating valuable
artifacts or treasure. If the Company were to cease its operations,
then it is likely that there would be complete loss of all capital
invested in or borrowed by the Company. As such, an investment in
Seafarer is extremely speculative and of exceptionally high
risk. 

There
is currently a limited trading market for our securities. We cannot
assure when and if an active-trading market in our shares will be
established, or whether any such market will be sustained or
sufficiently liquid to enable holders of shares of our common stock
to liquidate their investment in our company. The sale of
unregistered and restricted securities by current shareholders,
including shares issued to consultants and shares issued to settle
convertible promissory notes and to settle other loans and debt,
may cause a significant decline in the market price of the
Company s securities. 

Accordingly,
an investment in our securities is highly speculative and extremely
risky and should only be considered by those investors who do not
require liquidity and who can afford to suffer a complete and total
loss of their investment. An investor should consider consulting
with professional financial advisers before making an investment in
our securities. 

Plan of Operation 

During
the periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company has
taken the following steps to implement its business
plan: 

To
date, the Company has devoted its time towards establishing its
business to develop the infrastructure capable of researching,
exploring, and recovering historic shipwrecks. The Company has
performed some research, exploration and recovery
activities. 

Spent
considerable time and money researching potential shipwrecks,
including past physical visits to obtain information from foreign
archives. 

Although
the Company has not generated revenues to date our business goals
continue to evolve. Relationships are being developed with foreign
dignitaries and scientists around the world for the purpose of
identifying, researching, locating and obtaining the exploration
rights to historic shipwrecks. 

28 

The
Company is discussing and reviewing revenue producing opportunities
at this time. 

The
Company has evaluated various opportunities to enter into
agreements or contracts to conduct exploration and recovery
operations at known historic shipwreck locations or potential
locations. The Company has previously spent some of its efforts
exploring what it believes may be a historic shipwreck site located
off of Juno Beach, Florida. As previously noted on its form 8-K
filed on May 9, 2011, the Company and Tulco Resources received a
1A-31 Recovery Permit from the Florida Division of Historical
Resources. The Recovery Permit was previously active through April
25, 2014. It is necessary for the Company to obtain a renewal to
the Recovery Permit for the Juno Beach shipwreck site in order to
continue to perform work at the site after April 25, 2014.
Management is pursuing the renewal of the permit, however the
renewal process is anticipated to be a very slow, complex and
complicated process. The potential renewal and name change will
eventually involve a State Judge, Federal Judge, the U.S.
Marshall s Service and the Florida Division of Historical
Resources. Due to these multiple additional steps, the renewal of
the permit has not been issued as of the filing of this report and
Management is not able to predict the timing or success of any such
renewal. The Company met with a Federal Judge in of October 2016,
and is moving forward as instructed. 

The
Juno Beach Shipwreck site is a speculative project as far as the
potential for the Company to ever locate valuable artifacts or
treasure. Although the Company has recovered various artifacts that
it believes are interesting, it has not located artifacts and/or
treasure of any significant value from the Juno Beach Shipwreck
site. There is also the possibility that there are no artifacts of
significant value located at the Juno Beach shipwreck site. Even if
there are valuable artifacts and/or treasure located at the site,
recovering them may be extremely difficult or impossible due to a
variety of challenges that include, but are not limited to;
inclement weather, hazardous ocean conditions, large amounts of
sand that cover large areas of the site, ongoing maintenance and
repair issues with the Company s main salvage vessel,
permitting issues and/or a lack of financing,
etc. Additionally, Management believes the previous partner,
Tulco Resources, deleted a significant portion of the 2003
magnetometer survey which may contain portions of the wreck itself.
The Company is planning the process to perform additional research
and a cesium vapor magnetometer survey of the deleted area. This
survey has not been completed as of the filings of this
report. 

Moreover,
the Company does not currently have sufficient data to positively
identify the potential Juno Beach shipwreck, or its country of
origin, and it is therefore not possible to determine whether or
not the ship was originally carrying cargo of any significant
value. Only remnants and scattered pieces of a sunken ship have
been located to date; no main shipwreck body has been located,
although there is a large deleted area which has not been searched.
It is also possible, although there is no proof suggesting this,
that a ship began to break up on the site but the body of the ship
actually sank in another area that is outside of the designated
Juno Beach site area and all that was left on the Juno Beach site
were scattered remnants of the original ship that have little or no
archeological or actual value. There is a possibility that there
are no artifacts of significant value located on the Juno Beach
shipwreck site.   

On July
28, 2014, Seafarer s Quest, LLC received a 1A-31 Exploration
Permit with a Dig and Identify modification (the
 Permit ) from the Florida Division of Historical
Resources for an area identified as area 2 off of Melbourne Beach,
Florida. The Permit is active for three years from the date of
issuance. In the past in addition to the Company s main
salvage vessel, the Company has utilized additional vessels in
order to perform operations. On occasion, inclement weather and
difficult sea conditions have hampered the Company s ability
to perform exploration operations at this site. An archeologist
with the technical skills, knowledge, and experience from around
the world was hired to help insure the integrity of the work. On
July 6, 2016 Seafarer s Quest, LLC received a 1A-31
Exploration Permit with a Dig and Identify modification (the
 Second Melbourne Permit ) from the Florida Division of
Historical Resources for an area identified as area 1 located off
of Melbourne Beach, Florida. The Second Melbourne Permit is active
for three years from the date of issuance. 

The
Company regularly reviews opportunities to perform exploration and
recovery operations at purported historic shipwreck sites; however,
the Company does not have specific plans to perform exploration and
recovery operations at other shipwreck sites at the present time.
The Company is actively reviewing other potential historic
shipwreck sites, including sites located internationally, for
possible exploration and recovery. Should the Company decide that
it will pursue exploration and recovery activities at other
potential shipwreck sites, it may be necessary to obtain various
permits. 

If the
Company is not able to perform any exploration or recovery
operations, then it may have to suspend or cease its operations. If
the Company ceases its previously stated efforts, there are
currently no plans to pursue other business opportunities.

Limited Operating History 

The
Company has not currently generated any revenue from operations and
does not expect to report any significant revenue from operations
for the foreseeable future. 

At
September 30, 2016, the Company had a working capital deficit of
$969,286. The Company is in immediate need of further working
capital and is seeking options, with respect to financing, in the
form of debt, equity or a combination thereof. 

Since
inception, the Company has funded its operations through common
stock issuances and loans in order to meet its strategic
objectives; however, there can be no assurance that the Company
will be able to obtain further funds to continue with its efforts
to establish a new business. There is a very significant risk that
the Company will be unable to obtain financing to fund its
operation and as such the Company may be forced to cease operations
at any time which would likely result in a complete loss of all
capital that has been invested in and/or borrowed by the Company to
date. 

29 

The
Company expects to continue to incur significant operating losses
and to generate negative cash flow from operating activities, while
building out its infrastructure in order to explore and salvage
historic shipwreck sites and establishing itself in the
marketplace. Based on our historical rate of expenditures, the
Company expects to expend its available cash in less than one
month from November 14, 2016. 

The
Company s ability to eliminate operating losses and to
generate positive cash flow from operations in the future will
depend upon a variety of factors, many of which it is unable to
control. If the Company is unable to implement its business plan
successfully, it may not be able to eliminate operating losses,
generate positive cash flow or achieve or sustain profitability,
which may have a material adverse effect on the Company s
business, operations, and financial results, as well as its ability
to make payments on its debt obligations, and the Company may be
forced to cease operations. 

The
Company s lack of operating cash flow and reliance on the
sale of its commons stock and loans to fund operations is extremely
risky. If the Company is unable to continue to raise capital or
obtain loans or other financing on terms that are acceptable to the
Company, or at all, then it is highly likely that the Company will
be forced to cease operations. If the Company ceases its
operations, then it is likely that all capital invested in and/or
borrowed by the Company will be lost.   

Summary of Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Results of
Operations 

The
Company s net loss for the nine month period ended September
30, 2016 was $1,192,443 as compared to a net loss of $736,778
during the nine month period ended September 30, 2015.  The increase in net losses of approximately 62%
in 2016 was primarily due to the impact of the fair value
measurement adjustments on several convertible promissory notes
that resulted in an interest expense of $618,092 in 2016 as
compared to interest income of $72,559 in 2015. The swing from
interest income in 2015 to an interest expense in 2016 was due to
the fair value measurement of several convertible notes. 
During the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, the Company
incurred consulting related expenses of $338,144 versus $479,834
during the nine month period ended September 30, 2015, a decrease
of 29.5%. The decrease in consulting and contractor expenses
 was largely due to a lull in
operations during the first half of 2016 and significantly less
stock based compensation being paid for services . During the
nine month period ended September 30, 2016, the Company incurred
professional fees of $78,191 as compared to $62,754 during the nine
month period ended September 30, 2015, an increase of approximately
25%. During the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, the
Company s general and administrative expenses were $42,101 as
compared to $109,093 during the nine month period ended September
30, 2015, an decrease of approximately 61.4%.  During the
nine month period ended September 30, 2016, the Company incurred
vessel related expenses of $18,901 versus $41,223 during the nine
month period ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of approximately
54%. The 54% decrease in vessel expenses was due to fewer overall
significant maintenance issues with the Company s primary
salvage vessel in 2016 as compared to some prior years. The Company
has tried to keep repair costs lower for its main salvage vessel by
being more proactive with vessel maintenance, however due to the
advancing age of the vessel the Company anticipates that it will
continue to require repairs and in some cases major unforeseen
repairs. The Company has also utilized a few newer and smaller
vessels in its operations and these vessels do not require as much
maintenance and upkeep which helps to keep costs down. Travel and
entertainment expenses decreased approximately 10.1%, from $50,044
for the nine month period ended September 30, 2015 to $44,949 for
the nine month period ended September 30, 2016. The decrease in
travel and entertainment expenses was generally due to the Company
not having to pay for hotel lodging expenses on a regular basis for
several of its independent contract divers and operations personnel
as a result of renting an operations house where personnel are able
to stay while performing services for the Company. Rent expense was
$26,577 for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 versus
$40,901for the same period in 2015, a decrease of nearly
35%. 

Summary of Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Results of
Operations 

The
Company s net loss for the three month period ended September
30, 2016 was $685,265 as compared to a net loss of $326,116 during
the three month period ended September 30, 2015. The 110% increase
in the net loss for the three month period ended September 30, 2016
was primarily attributable to 207% increase in interest expense and
a 41.8% increase in losses from operations. Interest expense for
the three month period ended September 30, 2016 was $414,633 versus
$135,227 for the three month period ended September 30, 2015.
 The approximate 207% increase in interest expense was due to
the fair value measurement adjustments on several convertible
promissory notes.  During the three month period ended
September 30, 2016, the Company incurred consulting and independent
contractor related expenses of $166,803 versus $125,787 during the
three month period ended September 30, 2015, an increase of 32.6%.
The 32.6% decrease in consulting and independent contractor related
expenses was due to a ramping up of operations during the period
and increased stock based compensations paid to several consultants
and independent contractors for various services including business
advisory, legal, operations, administrative, media consulting,
digital storefront development, strategic planning, etc. The
Company issued shares to several consultants as a retention bonus
and inducement for the consultants to continue to provide services
under terms that are favorable to the Company. During the three
month period ended September 30, 2016, the Company incurred
professional fees of $30,521 as compared to $12,375 during the
three month period ended September 30, 2015, an increase of 146.6%.
The increase in professional fees paid during 2016 was due stock
based compensation paid to one of the Company s legal
advisors. During the three month period ended September 30, 2016,
the Company incurred travel and entertainment expenses of $27,662
versus $13,711 during the three month period ended September 30,
2015, increase of approximately102%. During the three month period
ended September 30, 2016, the Company s general and
administrative expenses were $12,675 as compared to $3,290 during
the three month period ended September 30, 2015, an increase of
285%. During the three month period ended September 30, 2016, the
Company incurred vessel related expenses of $13,958 versus $14,431
during the three month period ended September 30, 2015, a decrease
of approximately 3.2%. The decrease in vessel expenses was due to
fewer overall maintenance issues with the Company s primary
salvage vessel, however as the vessel is an older ship it continues
to require constant maintenance and upkeep that may be very
expensive.

Lack of Revenues and Cash Flow/Significant Losses from
Operations 

It is
extremely challenging to build a publicly traded historic shipwreck
exploration and recovery company. The exploration and recovery of
historic shipwrecks requires a multi-year, multi stage process and
it may be many years before any revenue is generated from
exploration and recovery activities, if ever. The Company believes
that it may be several years before it is able to generate any cash
flow from its operations, if any are ever generated at all. Without
revenues and cash flow the Company does not have any steady cash
flow to pay its expenses. The Company relies on outside financing
in the form of equity and debt and it is possible that the Company
may not be able to obtain outside financing in the future. If the
Company is not able to obtain financing it would more than likely
be forced to cease operations and all of the capital that has been
invested in or borrowed by the Company would likely be
lost. 

The
Company has experienced a net loss in every fiscal year since the
reverse merger in 2008. The Company s losses from operations
were $574,351 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and
$809,337 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The Company
believes that it will continue to generate losses from its
operation for the foreseeable future and the Company may not be
able to generate a profit in the long-term, or ever. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

At
September 30, 2016, the Company had cash in the bank of
$6,521.  During the nine month period ended September 30,
2016 the Company incurred net losses of $1,192,443. At September
30, 2016, the Company had $52,042 in current assets and $1,021,328
in current liabilities, leaving the Company with a working capital
deficit of $969,286. 

Lack of Liquidity 

A major
financial challenge and significant risk facing the Company is a
lack of liquidity. The company continued to operate with
significant debt and a working capital deficit during the three and
nine month periods ended September 30, 2016. This working capital
deficit indicates that the Company is unable to meet its
short-term liabilities with its current assets. This working
capital deficit is extremely risky for the Company as it may be
forced to cease its operations due to its inability to meet all of
its current obligations. If the Company is forced to cease its
operations then it is highly likely that all capital invested in
and/or borrowed by the Company will be lost. 

The
expenses associated with being a small publicly traded company
attempting to develop the infrastructure to explore and recover
historic shipwrecks are extremely prohibitive, especially given
that the Company does not currently generate any revenues and does
not expect to generate any revenues in the near future. There are
ongoing expenses associated with operations that are incurred
whether the Company is conducting shipwreck exploration and
recovery operations or not. Vessel maintenance, particularly for an
older vessel such as the Company s main salvage vessel,
upkeep expenses and docking fees are continuous and unavoidable
regardless of the Company s operational status. These repairs
and maintenance are expensive and a drain on the Company s
cash. 

In
addition to the operations expenses, a publicly traded company also
incurs the significant recurring corporate expenses related to
maintaining publicly traded status, which include, but are not
limited to accounting, legal, audit, executive, administrative,
corporate communications, rent, etc. The recurring expenses
associated with being a publicly traded company are very burdensome
for smaller public companies such as Seafarer. This lack of
liquidity creates a very risky situation for the Company in terms
of its ability to continue operating, which in turn makes owning
shares of the Company s commons stock extremely risky and
highly speculative. The Company s lack of liquidity may cause
the Company to be forced to cease operations at any time which
would likely result in a complete loss of all capital invested in
or borrowed by the Company to date. 

Due to
the fact that the Company does not generate any revenues and does
not expect to generate revenues for the foreseeable future the
Company must rely on outside equity and debt funding. The
combination of the ongoing operational, even during times when
there is little or no exploration or salvage activities taking
place, and corporate expenses as well as the need for outside
financing creates a very risky situation for the Company and its
shareholders. This working capital shortfall and lack of access to
cash to fund corporate activities is extremely risky and may force
the Company to cease its operations which would more than likely
result in a complete loss of all capital invested in or loaned to
the Company to date. 

Lack of Revenues and Cash Flow/Significant Losses from
Operations 

The
exploration and recovery of historic shipwrecks requires a
multi-year, multi stage process and it may be many years before any
revenue is generated from exploration and recovery activities, if
ever. The Company believes that it may be several years before it
is able to generate any cash flow from its operations, if any are
ever generated at all. Without revenues and cash flow the Company
does not have reliable cash flow to pay its expenses. The Company
relies on outside financing in the form of equity and debt and it
is possible that the Company may not be able to obtain outside
financing in the future. If the Company is not able to obtain
financing it would more than likely be forced to cease operations
and all of the capital that has been invested in or borrowed by the
Company would be lost. 

31 

Convertible Notes Payable and Notes Payable, in
Default 

At
September 30, 2016, the Company had convertible notes
payable and notes payable with a face value of $748,102 of
which $670,952 were in default.   

The
Company does not have additional sources of debt financing to
refinance its convertible notes payable and notes payable that are
currently in default. If the Company is unable to obtain additional
capital, such lenders may file suit, including suit to foreclose on
the assets held as collateral for the obligations arising under the
secured notes. If any of the lenders file suit to foreclose on the
assets held as collateral, then the Company may be forced to
significantly scale back or cease its operations which would more
than likely result in a complete loss of all capital that has been
invested in or borrowed by the Company. The fact that the Company
is in default regarding several loans held by various lenders makes
investing in the Company or providing any loans to the Company
extremely risky with a very high potential for a complete loss of
capital.   

The
convertible notes that have been issued by the Company are
convertible at the lender s option. These convertible notes
represent significant potential dilution to the Company s
current shareholders as the convertible price of these notes is
generally lower than the current market price of the
Company s shares. As such when these notes are converted into
equity there is typically a highly dilutive effect on current
shareholders and very high probability that such dilution may
significantly negatively affect the trading price of the
Company s common stock. Furthermore, management intends to
have discussions or has already had discussions with several of the
promissory note holders who do not currently have convertible notes
regarding converting their notes into equity. Any such amended
agreements to convert promissory notes into equity would more than
likely have a highly dilutive effect on current shareholders and
there is a very high probability that such dilution may
significantly negatively affect the trading price of the
Company s common stock. Some of these note holders have
already amended their non-convertible notes to be convertible and
converted the notes into equity. Based on conversations with other
note holders, the Company believes that additional note holders
will amend their notes to contain a convertibility clause and
eventually convert the notes into equity. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

Our
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of
operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America.  The
preparation of these financial statements requires us to make
estimates and judgments which affect the reported amounts of
assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures
of contingent assets and liabilities (see Note 3, Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies, contained in the notes to the
Company s financial statements for the periods ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015.)  On an ongoing basis, we
evaluate our estimates.  We base our estimates on
historical experience and on various other assumptions which we
believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of
which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value
of assets and liabilities which are not readily apparent from other
sources.  Actual results may differ from these estimates
based upon different assumptions or conditions; however, we believe
that our estimates are reasonable.    

Management
is aware that certain changes in accounting estimates employed in
generating financial statements can have the effect of making the
Company look more or less profitable than it actually
is.  Management does not believe that either the Company
or its auditors have made any such changes in accounting
estimates. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

None. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
Risk 

Not
required for smaller reporting companies. 

Item 4T. Controls and Procedures 

Management s Responsibility for Controls and
Procedures 

The
Company s management is responsible for establishing and
maintaining adequate internal control over the Company s
financial reporting. The Company s controls over financial
reporting are designed under the supervision of the Company s
Principal Executive Officer/Principal Financial Officer to ensure
that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the
reports that the Company files or submits under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ),
is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management,
including the Company s principal executive officer/principal
financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure. 

32 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our principal
executive officer, the Company conducted an evaluation of the
effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure
controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act, as of
September 30, 2016.  Based on this evaluation, management
concluded that our financial disclosure controls and procedures
were not effective so as to timely record, process, summarize and
report financial information required to be included on our
Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) reports due
to the Company s limited internal resources and lack of
ability to have multiple levels of transaction
review.  However, as a result of our evaluation and
review process, management believes that the financial statements
and other information presented herewith are materially
correct. 

The
management including its Principal Executive Officer/Principal
Financial Officer, does not expect that its disclosure controls and
procedures, or its internal controls over financial reporting will
prevent all error and all fraud.  A control system no
matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable
not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system
are met.  Further, the design of the control system must
reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the
benefit of controls must be considered relative to their
costs. 

Because
of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation
of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues
and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been
detected. 

The
Company has limited resources and as a result, a material weakness
in financial reporting currently exists, because of our limited
resources and personnel, including those described
below. 

* 

The
Company has an insufficient quantity of dedicated resources and
experienced personnel involved in reviewing and designing internal
controls. As a result, a material misstatement of the interim and
annual financial statements could occur and not be prevented or
detected on a timely basis. 

* 

We have
not achieved the optimal level of segregation of duties relative to
key financial reporting functions. 

* 

We do
not have an audit committee or an independent audit committee
financial expert. While not being legally obligated to have an
audit committee or independent audit committee financial expert, it
is the managements view that to have audit committee, comprised of
independent board members, and an independent audit committee
financial expert is an important entity-level control over the
Company's financial statements. 

* 

We have
not achieved an optimal segregation of duties for executive
officers of the Company. 

A
material weakness is a deficiency (within the meaning of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) auditing standard 5) or
combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial
reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a
material misstatement of the Company's annual or interim financial
statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
Management has determined that a material weakness exists due to a
lack of segregation of duties, resulting from the Company's limited
resources and personnel. 

Remediation Efforts to Address Deficiencies in Disclosure Controls
and Procedures 

As a
result of these findings, management, upon obtaining sufficient
capital and operations, intends to take practical, cost-effective
steps in implementing internal controls, including the possible
remedial measures set forth below.  As of September 30,
2016 we did not have sufficient capital and/or operations to
implement any of the remedial measures described
below. 

* 

Assessing
the current duties of existing personnel and consultants, assigning
additional duties to existing personnel and consultants, and, in a
cost effective manner, potentially hiring additional personnel to
assist with the preparation of the Company's financial statements
to allow for proper segregation of duties, as well as additional
resources for control documentation. 

* 

Assessing
the duties of the existing officers of the Company and, in a cost
effective manner, possibly promote or hire additional personnel to
diversify duties and responsibilities of such executive
officers. 

* 

Board
to review and make recommendations to shareholders concerning the
composition of the Board of Directors, with particular focus on
issues of independence. The Board of Directors will consider
nominating an audit committee and audit committee financial expert,
which may or may not consist of independent members. 

(b) Change in Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting 

The
Company has not made any change in our internal control over
financial reporting during the period ended September 30,
2016.

Part II. Other
Information 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 

On
March 23, 2016 the Board of Directors signed a universal settlement
agreement with the Plaintiffs in the litigation matters of
 Micah Eldred, et al., v. Seafarer
Exploration, et al. , Hillsborough County, Florida, Case No.
09-CA-30763, and  Micah Eldred v.
Seafarer Exploration Corp., et al., Hillsborough County,
Florida , Case No. 14-CA-5360, and in the matter of
 Seafarer Exploration, et al. v.
Micah Eldred, et al.,  Hillsborough County, Florida, Court of
Appeals Case No. 14-2884, specifically: Micah Eldred, Michael
Daniels, Diane J. Harrison, James Eldred, Mary R. Eldred, Michole
Eldred, Nathan Eldred, Toni A. Eldred, Toni A. Eldred FBO Jordan
Gratton, Toni A. Eldred FBO Justin Gratton, Vanessa A Verbosh,
Oksana Savchenko, Matthew J. Presy, Olessia Kritskaia, Ekaterina
Messinger, Abby Lord, Ioulia Hess, Anna Krokhina, George Linder,
Christine Zitman, Carl Dilley, Heather Dilley, Robert Lizzano,
Elizabeth Lizzano, Karen Lizzano, Susan Miller, Jillian Mally,
Michael Mona, Alan Wolper, Sarah Wolper, Alan Wolper FBO Michael
Wolper, Spartan Securities Group, Ltd., and Am Asia Consulting
entered into the settlement agreement with Seafarer. An earlier
named party, CADEF, The Childhood Autism Foundation, Inc., had
previously entered into a settlement agreement and is no longer a
party in the Litigation. 

The
settlement called for both cases to be dismissed, with prejudice,
and the Plaintiffs in case number 09-CA-30763 agreed to surrender
and cancel all of their 32,300,000 shares of restricted common
stock which were returned to the treasury of the Corporation. All
such shares have been returned for cancellation. On March 23, 2016
Seafarer CEO signed the resolution to cancel the 32,300,000 shares
and instructed the transfer agent ClearTrust LLC to cancel the
shares and return them to treasury for the benefit of Seafarer thus
reducing the number of outstanding shares by 32,300,000 shares. At
the present time the dismissal has been filed and the case closed,
with all shares cancelled. 

On June
18, 2013, Seafarer began litigation against Tulco Resources, LLC,
in a lawsuit filed in the Circuit Court in and for Hillsborough
County, Florida. Such suit was filed for against Tulco based
upon  for breach of contract, equitable relief and
injunctive relief. Tulco was the party holding the rights under a
permit to a treasure site at Juno Beach, Florida. Tulco and
Seafarer had entered into contracts  in March 2008, and
later renewed under an amended agreement on June 11, 2010. Such
permit was committed to by Tulco to be an obligation and
contractual duty to which they would be responsible for payment of
all costs in order for the permit to be reissued. Such obligation
is contained in the agreement of March 2008 which was renewed in
the June 2010 agreement between Seafarer and Tulco. Tulco made the
commitment to be responsible for payments of all necessary costs
for the gaining of the new permit. Tulco never performed on such
obligation, and Seafarer during the period of approximately March
2008 and April 2012 had endeavored and even had to commence a
lawsuit to gain such permit which was awarded in April 2012.
Seafarer alleges in their complaint the expenditure of large
amounts of shares and monies for financing and for delays due to
Tulco s non-performance. Seafarer seeks monetary damages and
injunctive relief for the award of all rights held by Tulco to
Seafarer Seafarer gained a default and final Judgment on such
matter on July 23, 2014. Seafarer is now working with the State for
the renewed permit to be in Seafarer s name and rights only,
with Tulco removed per the Order of the Court. On March 4, 2015,
the Court awarded full rights to the Juno sight to Seafarer
Exploration, erasing all rights of Tulco Resources. The company has
currently filed an Admiralty Claim over such sight in the United
States District Court which is pending final ruling. On October 21,
2016 a hearing on the Admiralty Claim in the United States District
Court for the Southern District of Florida was held, where the
Court Ordered actions to take place for ongoing admiralty claim,
which will occur during the month of November 2016. The Company
expects to complete such claim within a few months. 

On
September 3, 2014, the Company filed a lawsuit against Darrel
Volentine, of California. Mr. Volentine was sued in two counts of
libel per se under Florida law, as well as a count for injunction
against the Defendant to exclude and prohibit internet postings.
Such lawsuit was filed in the Circuit Court in Hillsborough County,
Florida. Such suit is based upon internet postings on  www.investorshub.com .
On or about October 15, 2015, the Company and Volentine entered
into a stipulation whereby Volentine admitted to his tortious
conduct, however the stipulated damages agreed to were rejected by
the Court, and the Company is proceeding to trial on damages
against Volentine in a non-jury trial on December 1, 2015. The
Defendant is the subject of a contempt of court motion which was
heard on April 7, 2016, whereby the Court found a violation and
modified the injunction against the Defendant, and imposed other
matters of potential penalties against the Defendant. The Court
also awarded attorney s fees against the Defendant on behalf
of Seafarer for such motion. The Defendant subsequently attempted
to have such ruling, evidence and testimony attacked through a
motion heard before the Court on October 24, 2016. The Court
dismissed the Defendant s motion after presentation of the
Defendant s case at the hearing. The Plaintiff has set the
matter for entry of the attorney s fees amount due from the
Defendant for hearing in December 2016. As well the Plaintiff has
set for hearing its motion for sanctions in the form of
attorney s fees for frivolous filing of the October
24 th 
motion, which motion is also set for hearing in December 2016. The
Plaintiff filed a renewed and amended motion for punitive damages
in the case on September 11, 2016, which has not been set for
hearing. The Defendant had also filed a motion for summary judgment
on the matter of notice entitlement pre-suit, which motion is
pending before the Court. The Plaintiff filed a motion for
sanctions against the Defendant for the motion for summary judgment
being frivolous under existing law, and such motion is pending
ruling on the motion. Discovery is ongoing on such
case.

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of
Proceeds 

During
the three month period ended September 30, 2016, the Company issued
58,732,000 restricted common shares of its common stock to various
consultants for services including business advisory, legal,
administrative, operations, diving and exploration, media and
entertainment, website development and editing, consulting, as
retention bonuses and bonuses to several independent contractors,
other services. From time to time in the regular course of its
business the Company issues shares of its restricted common stock
to consultants and other vendors for a variety of services rendered
including, but not limited to, legal, financial, accounting,
administrative, archeological, executive, corporate communications,
operations, diving, etc. The Company issued 13,100,000 shares to
two shareholders in conjunction with repricing agreements. The
anti-dilution protection extends through the date upon which all
registration restrictions expires, typically one year from the date
the shares were issued, and is based upon the trading market value
at the end of that period. The Company issued 2,500,000 shares of
its restricted common stock as financing fees to a lender in
exchange for the lender extending the term of a loan. The Company
believes that the issuance of the securities was exempt from
registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, in
reliance on Section 4(2) of the Securities Act as a
transaction by an issuer not involving any public offering and
based on the fact that such securities were issued for services to
sophisticated or accredited investors and persons who are
thoroughly familiar with the Company s proposed business by
virtue of their affiliation with the Company. 

On
various dates during the three month period ended September 30,
2016, the Company entered into subscription agreements to sell
142,834,199 shares of its restricted common stock to nine investors
and receive proceeds of $129,200. The proceeds were used for
general corporate purposes, working capital and the repayment of
some debt. 

Exemptions from Registration for Sales of Restricted
Securities. 

The
issuance of securities referenced above were issued to persons who
the Company believes were either  accredited
investors,  or  sophisticated investors  who, by
reason of education, business acumen, experience or other factors,
were fully capable of evaluating the risks and merits of an
investment in us; and each had prior access to all material
information about us. None of these transactions involved a public
offering. An appropriate restrictive legend was placed on each
certificate that has been issued, prohibiting public resale of the
shares, except subject to an effective registration statement under
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  Act ) or
in compliance with Rule 144. The Company believes that the offer
and sale of these securities was exempt from the registration
requirements of the Securities Act pursuant to Section 4(2) under
the Securities Act of 1933 (the  Act )
thereof, and/or Regulation D. There may be additional
exemptions available to the Company. 

Issuance of Securities Due to Conversion of Notes and
Debt 

During the three month period ended September 30, 2016 the holder
of a convertible promissory notes with a remaining principal
balance of $87,348 elected to convert the principal balance of
their notes plus accrued interest into 165,022,855 shares of the
Company s common stock..  A holder of a convertible
promissory note elected to convert a portion of the principal
balance of $13,348 of the note plus accrued interest and late fees
of $6,652 into 12,750,000 shares of the Company s common
stock. A holder of a convertible promissory note elected to convert
the remaining principal balance of its note totaling $15,000 into
30,000,000 shares of the Company s common stock.  The Company settled $10,000 of the principal
balance of a note payable by issuing 20,000,000 shares of its
restricted common stock to the note holder.   A related party vendor agreed to convert debt
owed to the related party vendor by the Company for transfer agent
services and legal fees totaling $32,213, into 32,212,790 shares of
the Company s restricted common stock. A related party agreed
to accept 25,000,000 shares of the Company s restricted
common stock in exchange for a magnetometer that the related party
had previously agreed to purchase in order to rent to the Company
for use in its operations. The Company believes that the offer and
sale of these securities were exempt from the registration
requirements of the Securities Act pursuant to Sections 3(a)(9)
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended  

Item 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities 

The
Company has several promissory notes that are currently in default
to non-payment of principle and interest. See Part I, Item 2, notes

weaknesses in internal controls; and 

b) 

any
fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in the registrant s
