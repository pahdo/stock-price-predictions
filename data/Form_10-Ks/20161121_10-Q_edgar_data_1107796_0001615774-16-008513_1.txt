NOTE 2 -SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES   

Basis of presentation   

These unaudited condensed
interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation
S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements.
In the opinion of management, all adjustments of a normal recurring nature and considered necessary for a fair presentation of
its financial condition and results of operations for the interim periods presented in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q have
been included. Operating results for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of financial results for the full year.
These unaudited condensed interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and
notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) on April 18, 2016. In preparing these unaudited condensed interim financial statements,
management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date
of the unaudited condensed interim financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. 

MOTIVATING THE MASSES, INC.  

  Notes to Unaudited Condensed Financial Statements  

Use of estimates   

The preparation of unaudited condensed interim
financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the unaudited condensed interim financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Accordingly, actual results could differ
from those estimates. Such estimates include management s assessments of the carrying value of certain assets, useful lives
of assets, and related depreciation and amortization methods applied. 

Concentration of Credit Risk   

Financial instruments that potentially subject
the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash and accounts receivable. During the nine months period
ended September 30, 2016, the Company may have had cash deposits that exceeded Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC )
insurance limits. The Company maintains its cash balances at high quality financial institutions to mitigate this risk. The Company
performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and generally does not require collateral. The Company records an allowance
for doubtful accounts in accordance with the procedures discussed below. Past-due amounts are written off against the allowance
for doubtful accounts when collections are believed to be unlikely and all collection efforts have ceased. 

Cash and cash equivalents   

The Company considers all highly liquid investments
with an original maturity of 90 days or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015,
the Company had no cash equivalents. 

Fair value of financial instruments   

The Company follows the provisions of FASB
ASC 820 (the  Fair Value Topic ), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value under
GAAP, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. 

The Fair Value Topic defines fair value as
the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most
advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. It
requires that valuation techniques maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. It also establishes
a fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the valuation inputs into six broad levels. 

The following fair value hierarchy is used
to classify assets and liabilities based on the observable inputs and unobservable inputs used in order to value the assets and
liabilities: 

A) Market approach Uses prices and other
relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. Prices may be indicated
by pricing guides, sale transactions, market trades, or other sources; 

B) Cost approach Based on the amount
that currently would be required to replace the service capacity of an asset (replacement cost); and 

C) Income approach Uses valuation techniques to convert future
amounts to a single present amount based on current market expectations about the future amounts (includes present value techniques,
and option-pricing models). Net present value is an income approach where a stream of expected cash flows is discounted at an appropriate
market interest rate. 

Level 1: Quoted market prices available
in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date. An active market for an asset or liability is a
market in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with significant frequency and volume to provide pricing information
on an ongoing basis. 

MOTIVATING THE MASSES, INC.  

  Notes to Unaudited Condensed Financial Statements  

Level 2: Observable inputs other than
Level 1 inputs. Example of Level 2 inputs include quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities and quoted
prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active. 

Level 3: Unobservable inputs based
on the Company s assessment of the assumptions that are market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. 

The carrying amount of
the Company s financial assets and liabilities, such as cash, accounts payable, accrued expenses, and deferred revenue approximate
their fair value because of the short maturity of those instruments. 

The Company had no assets and/or liabilities
measured at fair value on a recurring basis at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, using the market and income
approaches. 

Accounts Receivable and Allowance for
Doubtful Accounts   

Accounts receivable related to the products
and services sold are recorded at the time revenue is recognized, and are presented on the balance sheet net of allowance for doubtful
accounts. The ultimate collection of the receivable may not be known for several months after services have been provided and billed. 

Property and Equipment   

Property and equipment are recorded at cost.
Expenditures for major additions and betterments are capitalized. Maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred.
Depreciation is computed by the straight-line method over the assets estimated useful life of three (3) years for equipment, five
(5) years for automobile, and seven (7) years for furniture and fixtures. Upon sale or retirement of property and equipment, the
related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is reflected in statements of operations. 

Impairment of long-lived assets   

The Company follows paragraph ASC350 of the
FASB Accounting Standards Codification for its long-lived assets. The Company s long-lived assets, such as intellectual property,
are required to be reviewed for impairment annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount of the asset may not be recoverable. 

The Company assesses the recoverability of
its long-lived assets by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the related long-lived asset or group
of long-lived assets over their remaining estimated useful lives against their respective carrying amounts. Impairment, if any,
is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets. Fair value is generally determined using the
asset s expected future discounted cash flows or market value, if readily determinable. If long-lived assets are determined
to be recoverable, but the newly determined remaining estimated useful lives are shorter than originally estimated, the net book
values of the long-lived assets are depreciated over the newly determined remaining estimated useful lives. 

The Company determined that there were no impairments
of long-lived assets as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

Commitments and contingencies   

The Company follows subtopic 450-20 of the
FASB Accounting Standards Codification to report accounting for contingencies.  Liabilities for loss contingencies arising
from claims, assessments, litigation, fines and penalties and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has
been incurred and the amount of the assessment can be reasonably estimated. 

Revenue recognition   

The Company follows paragraph 605-10-S99-1
of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for revenue recognition. The Company will recognize revenue when it is realized or
realizable and earned. The Company considers revenue realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met:
(i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) the product has been shipped or the services have been rendered to the customer,
(iii) the sales price is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured. In addition, the Company records
allowances for accounts receivable that are estimated to not be collected. 

MOTIVATING THE MASSES, INC.  

  Notes to Unaudited Condensed Financial Statements  

A portion of the Company s revenues are
from coaching and/or training services provided under contracts that are greater than one month in length. These contracts are
billed in total at the onset of the contract period, and to the extent that billings exceed revenue earned, the Company will record
such amount as deferred revenue until the revenue is earned. We recognize revenue on these contracts in the period the coaching
and/or training services are provided under the contract. Expenses associated with providing the coaching and/or training services
are recognized in the period the services are provided which coincides with when the revenue is earned. Revenue associated with
the Company s live events is recognized in the month of the corresponding event. Revenue associated with the Company s
on-line digital content is recognized at the time of purchase. 

Income taxes   

The Company follows Section 740-10-30 of the
FASB Accounting Standards Codification, which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future
tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax
assets and liabilities are based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using
enacted tax rates in effect for the fiscal year in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Deferred
tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent management concludes it is more likely than not that the assets will
not be realized. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period
that includes the enactment date. 

The Company adopted section 740-10-25 of the
FASB Accounting Standards Codification ( Section 740-10-25 ) with regards to uncertainty in income taxes. Section 740-10-25
addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the
financial statements. Under Section 740-10-25, the Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if
it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical
merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on
the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent (50%) likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Section
740-10-25 also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties on income taxes, accounting in interim
periods and requires increased disclosures. The Company had no material adjustments to its assets and/or liabilities for unrecognized
income tax benefits according to the provisions of Section 740-10-25. 

At December 31, 2015, the Company had net operating
loss carryforwards of approximately $4,585,839 that may be offset against future taxable income from the year 2015 to 2035. The
net change in the valuation allowance for the year ended December 31, 2015 was an increase of $451,700. 

Stock-Based Compensation   

In December 2004, the FASB issued FASB Accounting
Standards Codification No. 718,  Compensation   Stock Compensation .  Under FASB Accounting Standards
Codification No. 718, companies are required to measure the compensation costs of share-based compensation arrangements based on
the grant-date fair value and recognize the costs in the financial statements over the period during which employees are required
to provide services. Share-based compensation arrangements include stock options, restricted share plans, performance-based awards,
share appreciation rights and employee share purchase plans.  As such, compensation cost is measured on the date of grant
at their fair value.  Such compensation amounts, if any, are amortized over the respective vesting periods of the option
grant.  As of September 30, 2016, the Company did not have any share-based compensation arrangements. 

Equity instruments ( instruments )
issued to other than employees are recorded on the basis of the fair value of the instruments, as required by FASB Accounting Standards
Codification No. 718.  FASB Accounting Standards Codification No. 505,  Equity Based Payments to Non-Employees  defines
the measurement date and recognition period for such instruments.  In general, the measurement date is when either a (a) performance
commitment, as defined, is reached; or (b) the earlier of (i) the non-employee performance is complete, or (ii) the instruments
are vested. The measured value related to the instruments is recognized over a period based on the facts and circumstances of each
particular grant as defined in the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. 

Net income (loss) per share   

The Company computes basic and diluted earnings
per share amounts pursuant to section 260-10-45 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Basic earnings per share is computed
by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders, by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding
during the period, excluding the effects of any potentially dilutive securities. Diluted earnings per share are computed by dividing
net income (loss) available to common shareholders by the diluted weighted average number of shares of common stock during the
period. The diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding is the basic weighted number of shares adjusted as of
the first day of the year for any potentially diluted debt or equity. 

MOTIVATING THE MASSES, INC.  

  Notes to Unaudited Condensed Financial Statements  

There were no potentially dilutive shares outstanding
as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

Subsequent events   

The Company follows the guidance in Section
855-10-50 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for the disclosure of subsequent events. The Company has determined that,
other than listed in Note 9, no material subsequent events exist through the date of this filing.. 

Recently issued accounting pronouncements   

We have decided to take advantage of the exemptions
provided to emerging growth companies under the JOBS Act and as a result our financial statements may not be comparable to
companies that comply with public company effective dates. We may take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements
that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies, including not being required to comply with
the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, delay compliance with new or revised accounting
standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until they are made applicable to private companies. 

Company management does not believe that any
other recently issued, but not yet effective accounting pronouncements, if adopted, would have a material effect on the accompanying
unaudited condensed financial statements. 

NOTE 3 - GOING CONCERN   

These unaudited condensed financial statements
have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applicable to a going concern, which contemplates
the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. The Company's ability
to continue as a going concern is contingent upon its ability to achieve and maintain profitable operations, and the Company s
ability to raise additional capital as required. 

These conditions raise substantial doubt about
the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Management has taken certain actions and continues to implement changes designed
to improve the Company s consolidated financial results and operating cash flows. The actions involve certain cost-saving
initiatives and growing strategies, including (a) product expansion, (b) optimizing online sales, (c) maximizing media opportunities,
and (d) lowering operating expenses. Management believes these actions will enable the Company to improve future profitability
and cash flow. As a result, these unaudited condensed financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability
and classification of recorded asset amounts, or amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from this uncertainty. 

NOTE 4   PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT   

Fixed assets, stated at cost, less accumulated
depreciation at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, consisted of the following: 

Depreciation expense   

Depreciation expense for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 was $9,610 and $10,362, respectively.

NOTE 5   DEFERRED REVENUES   

A portion of the Company s revenues are
from coaching and/or training services provided under contracts that are greater than one month in length. These contracts are
billed in total at the onset of the contact period, and to the extent that billings exceed revenue earned, the Company will record
such amount as deferred revenue until the revenue is earned. We recognize revenue on these contracts in the period the coaching
and/or training services are provided under the contract. Expenses associated with providing the coaching and/or training services
are recognized in the period the services are provided which coincides with when the revenue is earned. 

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015,
the Company had deferred revenues balance of $1,170,870 and $1,572,644, respectively. 

NOTE 6   COMMITMENTS   CONTINGENCIES

ITEM 2.          MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION
AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

The following discussion
should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included herein. In connection with,
and because we desire to take advantage of, the  safe harbor  provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform
Act of 1995, we caution readers regarding certain forward looking statements in the following discussion and elsewhere in this
report and in any other statement made by, or on our behalf, whether or not in future filings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the  SEC ). Forward looking statements are statements not based on historical information and which relate
to future operations, strategies, financial results or other developments. Forward looking statements are necessarily based upon
estimates and assumptions that are inherently subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies,
many of which are beyond our control and many of which, with respect to future business decisions, are subject to change. These
uncertainties and contingencies can affect actual results and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed
in any forward looking statements made by, or on our behalf. We disclaim any obligation to update forward looking statements.  

Overview
and History   

Motivating the Masses,
Inc. (we, us, our, or the  Company ) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on September 2, 1998 to engage in providing
top-quality professional development and coaching services to its clientele. The Company s products and services revolve
around the personal and business   coaching programs written and developed by its CEO Lisa Nichols. The program
sells as a package of books and DVD s at its local and national training seminars, and on the Company s website. The
Company has contract rights to the sales of the product. The Company, through its CEO and a core team of coaches, also provides
training and development programs through local and national seminars, on-site employee training, public and private speaking engagements,
and customized life-coaching programs. 

We qualify as an  emerging growth company 
under the JOBS Act. As a result, we are permitted to, and intend to, rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements. For
so long as we are an emerging growth company, we will not be required to: 

have an auditor report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;  

comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements (i.e., an auditor discussion and analysis);  

submit certain executive compensation matters to shareholder advisory votes, such as  say-on-pay  and  say-on-frequency;  and  

disclose certain executive compensation related items such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the CEO s compensation to median employee compensation.  

In
addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition
period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words,
an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to
private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. Our financial statements
may therefore not be comparable to those of companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards. 

We
will remain an  emerging growth company  for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first
fiscal year in which our total annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion, (ii) the date that we become a  large accelerated
filer  as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which would occur if the market value of our ordinary
shares that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal
quarter or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three year
period. 

We
also qualify as a smaller reporting company under Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. As a smaller reporting
company and so long as we remain a smaller reporting company, we benefit from similar exemptions and exclusions as an emerging
growth company. In the event that we cease to be an emerging growth company as a result of a lapse of the five-year period, but
continue to be a smaller reporting company, we would continue to be subject to similar exemptions available to emerging growth
company until such time as we were no longer a smaller reporting company. 

Our principal place of
business is located at 5950 La Place Court, Carlsbad, California 92008.  Our phone number is 760-931-9400. 

We have not been subject
to any bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceeding. 

Results of Operations  

Revenues  

Revenues for the three months ended September
30, 2016 were $1,290,750 compared to $607,714 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, which was an increase of $683,036
or 112%. The increase in revenues was largely due to  14K Club , a new program launched in 2016 coupled with increased sales
in Keynotes, GLP and executive coaching services. 

Revenues for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 were $3,851,384 compared to $2,780,189 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, which was an increase of $1,071,195
or 39%. The increase in revenues was mainly due to the addition of two  Abundance Now  Events, which were held in January
and February of 2016 and collectively brought in $595,000 in new sales, and the Company s newest training program  14K
Club , which produced $387,735 in new sales. The additional growth in sales was attributed to increased sales, year over year,
in Keynotes, GLP and executive coaching services. 

Cost of Revenues  

The gross margin for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 was 66% of sales compared to 24% for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in gross margin
was primarily due to increased sales of the Company s most profitable programs: GLP and Keynotes. 

The gross margin for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 was 56% of sales compared to 54% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The improvement in gross margin
was primarily due to increased sales in GLP and Keynotes, which are the Company s most profitable programs. 

Operating Activities  

Total operating income for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 was $335,583 as compared to an operating loss of $528,698 for the three months ended September 30, 2015,
which was an increase of $864,281. Total operating income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $277,835 as compared
to an operating loss of $448,221 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, which was an increase of $726,056. Operating income
improved in Q3 and fiscal year to date due to an increase in sales of the Company s most profitably programs: GLP and Keynotes
coupled with a reduction in wage related expenses.. 

Consulting expense was $161,942 for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $127,016 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, resulting in an increase
of $34,926. The increase was primarily due to retaining a marketing expert and copy editor to build several marketing funnels to
grow our online sales. Consulting expense was $441,314 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $459,267 for
the nine months ended September 30, 2015, resulting in a decrease of $17,953. The decrease was primarily due to the elimination
of several consulting contracts in early 2016. 

Professional fees were $8,435 for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $57,891 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, resulting in a decrease of
$49,456. The decline was largely due to the termination of a monthly financial consulting agreement with Andrew Garrett, Inc.,
an Investment Bank, following the hire of new CFO, Scott Ryder, who possesses commensurate experience. The consulting agreement
was terminated in February 2016. Professional fees were $182,988 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $170,945
for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, which was an increase of $12,043. The increase was largely due to one-time accounting
expenses in Q1 associated with the re-audit of our 2014 financial statements, which were greater than the savings realized from
the termination of our financial consulting agreement with Andrew Garrett, Inc. 

General and administrative expenses were $148,303
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $170,500 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, resulting
in a decrease of $22,197. The decline was primarily due to a one-time granting of stock for services in September 2015, which
was not repeated in 2016. General and administrative expenses were $456,911 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared
to $445,939 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, resulting in an increase of $10,942. The increase was primarily due
to an increase in various fees in Q1 associated with the re-audit of our 2014 financial statements, including accounting
expenses and attorney fees. 

Wages and other compensation were $198,345
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $316,178 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, resulting
in a decrease of $117,833. The Company saved money through improved efficiencies related to headcount in our sales and marketing
departments. The Company consolidated certain sales and marketing functions, which enabled it to reduce its FTEs by two. Wages
and other compensation were $782,054 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $853,409 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2015, resulting in a decrease of $71,355. The Company saved money through improved efficiencies related to headcount
in our sales and marketing departments. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

Our cash balance was $83,308 as of September
30, 2016 as compared to $80,991 as of December 31, 2015. 

As of September 30, 2016, total current assets
were $83,357 compared to $95,930 at December 31 2015. The decrease of $12,573 in current assets is mainly a result of a decline
in other receivables. 

As of September 30, 2016, accounts payable
and accrued expenses were $901,196 compared to $591,055 at December 31, 2015. The increase of $310,141 is largely due to an increase
in commissions payable to Lisa Nichols and Susie Carder. 

As of September 30, 2016, total current liabilities
were $2,108,163 as compared to $2,165,351 on December 31, 2015. The decline in our current liabilities is mainly due to the decline
in deferred revenue. 

During the nine months ended September 30,
2016, net cash provided by operating activities was $99,228 consisting of  $14,889 decrease in other receivables, $401,774 decline
in deferred revenues, $111,472 increase in deposits and $310,140 increase in accounts payable. 

Net cash used in investing activities for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $1,264. 

Net cash used from financing activities for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, was $95,648 consisting primarily of the repurchase of shares of common stock for $115,997. 

The Company s management is reviewing
new ways to cut costs and increase revenues so they can increase operational efficiency in the future. The Company is in the process
of restructuring its compensation plan in a way to reduce cash expense while incentivizing increased sales. The Company s
2016 Equity Incentive Plan (the  2016 Plan , filed as Exhibit A to its Definitive Information Statement on Schedule
14C filed with the SEC on April 29, 2016) was adopted by the Board of Directors on April 26, 2016 and approved by its shareholders
holding a majority of the Company s shares of Common Stock via written consent on April 26, 2016. The Company plans to increase
the utilization of its website with users and have increased material that will be sold online in the form of instructional videos
and webinars that will incrementally increase revenues without increasing costs.  The costs are being incurred now through
the creation of the technology but the revenues will be realized in the years to come with very minimal costs in the form of website
hosting and video hosting. 

Because we are currently
subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act of 1934, we expect that we will incur ongoing expenses associated with
professional fees for accounting, legal and other expenses for annual reports and proxy statements.  We estimate that these
costs could range up to $250,000 per year for the next few years and will be higher if our business volume and activity increases. 

Inflation  

Although our operations
are influenced by general economic conditions, we do not believe that inflation had a material effect on our results of operations
during the three-month period ended September 30, 2016. 

Critical Accounting Estimates  

The discussion and analysis
of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance
with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts of
assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis,
we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under
the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities
that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or
conditions. Note 2 above represents a summary of our critical accounting policies, defined as those policies that we believe are
the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require management s most
difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are
inherently uncertain. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements   

We do not have any off-balance
sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in
financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is
material to investors. 

ITEM 3.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE
DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.  

We are a smaller reporting
company and are not required to provide the information under this item pursuant to Regulation S-K. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.  

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and
Procedures   

Management maintains  disclosure
controls and procedures,  as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange
Act ), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated
and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure. 

In connection with the
preparation of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, an evaluation was carried out by management, with the participation of our Chief
Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules
13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of September 30, 2016. 

Based on that evaluation,
management concluded, that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of September 30, 2016 in recording, processing,
summarizing, and reporting information required to be disclosed, within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and
forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Changes in Internal Controls over Financial
Reporting   

As of the end of the period
covered by this report, there have been no changes in the internal controls over financial reporting that materially affected,
or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting subsequent to the date of management s
last evaluation.
