DYNAMIC MATERIALS CORPORATION 
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (Amounts in Thousands, Except Share and Per Share Data) 
  (unaudited) 

1.      BASIS OF PRESENTATION 
    
  The information included in the condensed consolidated financial statements is unaudited but includes all normal and recurring adjustments which, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair presentation of the interim periods presented. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements that are included in our Annual Report filed on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 

2.      SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
    
  Principles of Consolidation 
    
  The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Dynamic Materials Corporation ("DMC") and its controlled subsidiaries.  Only subsidiaries in which controlling interests are maintained are consolidated.  All significant intercompany accounts, profits, and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 
    
  Income Taxes 
    
  The effective tax rate for each of the periods reported differs from the U.S. statutory rate due primarily to favorable foreign permanent differences, variation in contribution to consolidated pre-tax income from each jurisdiction for the respective periods and differences between the U.S. and foreign tax rates (which range from   20%   to   35%  ) on earnings that have been permanently reinvested. 
       
  We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future income tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities.  Any effects of changes in income tax rates or tax laws are included in the provision for income taxes in the period of enactment.   The deferred income tax impact of tax credits are recognized as an immediate adjustment to income tax expense.  We recognize deferred tax assets for the expected future effects of all deductible temporary differences to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized.  We record a valuation allowance when, based on current circumstances, it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.  In making such determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, recent financial operations and their associated valuation allowances, if any.  
    
  We recognize the tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only when it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits of the position; the tax position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of any related appeals or litigation.  The tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position are measured as the largest benefit that is more likely than not of being realized upon ultimate resolution.  We recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in operating expense. 
    
  Tax audits are currently in progress for the years 2013 through 2015 in the U.S. and 2011 through 2014 in Germany. Our tax provisions reflect our best estimate of state, local, federal, and foreign taxes. However, the outcome of tax audits  cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in the Company s tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with our expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs. 
    
  Earnings Per Share 
    
  Unvested awards of share-based payments with rights to receive dividends or dividend equivalents, such as our restricted stock awards ( RSAs ), are considered participating securities for purposes of calculating earnings per share ( EPS ) during periods in which we have net income and require the use of the two class method for calculating EPS.  Under this method, a portion of net income is allocated to these participating securities and therefore is excluded from the calculation of EPS allocated to common stock, as shown in the table below. 
    
  Computation and reconciliation of earnings per common share are as follows:

Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
    
  The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, trade accounts receivable and payable, accrued expenses and lines of credit approximate their fair value.   
    
  Recently Adopted Accounting Standards 
    
  In November 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued an accounting standards update ("ASU") which requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in the statement of financial position based on an analysis of each taxpaying component within a jurisdiction. This ASU would have been effective for the Company December 1, 2017, however the Company elected to early adopt prospectively beginning with the year ended December 31, 2015, as is permitted under the standard. 
    
  In April 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standards update to revise the presentation of debt issuance costs.  Under this pronouncement, entities will present debt issuance costs in their balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an asset.  Amortization of the deferred debt issuance costs will continue to be included in interest expense. The new accounting guidance represents a change in accounting principle and was required to be adopted retrospectively in  fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. Accordingly, the Company applied the guidance and reclassified the prior period amount of   $674   of debt issuance costs from other assets, net to lines of credit in the balance sheet as of December 31, 2015.  Because the application of this guidance affects classification only, such reclassifications did not have a material effect on the Company s consolidated financial position or results of operations. 
    
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued a new accounting pronouncement related to accounting for share-based payments. The pronouncement intends to simplify the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including income tax consequences, the classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and the classification on the statement of cash flows. This pronouncement is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Management is currently evaluating the potential impact that the adoption of this standard will have on the Company s financial position, results of operations, and related disclosures.  
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued a new accounting pronouncement regarding the financial reporting of leasing transactions. This new standard requires a lessee to record assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for the rights and obligations arising from leases with terms of more than 12 months. The Company is required to adopt the new standard on January 1, 2019 using a modified retrospective approach. Management is currently evaluating the potential impact that the adoption of this standard will have on the Company s financial position, results of operations, and related disclosures.

     Table of Contents  

In July 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standards update to simplify the measurement of inventory and to change the measurement from lower of cost or market to lower of cost and net realizable value. This pronouncement is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. We currently do not expect that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on the Company s financial position or results of operations. 
    
  In May 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standards update to clarify the principles of recognizing revenue and to develop a common revenue standard and disclosure requirements for U.S. GAAP and IFRS.  The pronouncement is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. Earlier application is permitted only for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period.  We currently are evaluating the potential impact the adoption of this standard will have on the Company s financial position, results of operations, and related disclosures.  

3.      INVENTORIES 
    
  Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market value.  Cost elements included in inventory are material, labor, subcontract costs, and manufacturing overhead.  As necessary, we record provisions and maintain reserves for excess, slow moving and obsolete inventory. To determine reserve amounts, we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and values, and compare them to estimates of future product demand, market conditions, production requirements and technological developments.  
    
  Inventories consist of the following at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   and include reserves of   $3,830   and   $3,682  , respectively:

4.      GOODWILL 
    
  All of the goodwill is recorded within our NobelClad segment. The changes to the carrying amount of goodwill during the period are summarized below: 

5.      PURCHASED INTANGIBLE ASSETS 
    
  The following table presents details of our purchased intangible assets, other than goodwill, as of   September 30, 2016  : 

The following table presents details of our purchased intangible assets, other than goodwill, as of   December 31, 2015  : 

The change in the gross value of our purchased intangible assets from   December 31, 2015   to   September 30, 2016   was due to foreign currency translation and an adjustment due to recognition of tax benefit of tax amortization previously applied to certain goodwill related to the DynaEnergetics reporting unit. After the goodwill was written off at December 31, 2015, the tax amortization reduces other noncurrent intangible assets related to the historical acquisition. 

6.      CUSTOMER ADVANCES 
    
  On occasion, we require customers to make advance payments prior to the shipment of goods in order to help finance our inventory investment on large orders or to keep customers  credit limits at acceptable levels.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , customer advances totaled   $2,589   and   $2,396  , respectively, and originated from several customers.

7.      DEBT 
    
  Lines of credit consisted of the following at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

Syndicated Credit Agreement 
    
  We have a   five  -year   $75,000   syndicated credit agreement ( credit facility ), which allows for revolving loans of   $65,000   in US dollars and   $10,000   in alternate currencies as well as a   $100,000   accordion feature to increase the commitments in any of the loan classes subject to approval by applicable lenders. We also maintain a line of credit with a German bank for certain European operations.  This line of credit provides a borrowing capacity of    4,000  , of which    1,694   is available after considering outstanding letters of credit.   
    
  Borrowings under the   $65,000   revolving loan can be in the form of Alternate Base Rate loans ( ABR  borrowings are based on the greater of adjusted Prime rates, adjusted CD rates, or adjusted Federal Funds rates) or one, two, three, or six month London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) loans.  ABR loans bear interest at the defined ABR rate plus an applicable margin (varying from   0.25%   to   1.50%  ) and LIBOR loans bear interest at the applicable LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin (varying from   1.25%   to   2.75%  ). 
    
  Borrowings under the   $10,000   Alternate Currency revolving loans can be in Canadian Dollars, Euros, Pound Sterling and any other currency that is freely transferable and convertible to U.S. Dollars.  Alternative currency borrowings denominated in Canadian Dollars shall be comprised of Canadian Dealer Offered Rate ( CDOR ) Loans or Canadian Prime Loans, at our option, and bear interest at the CDOR rate plus applicable margin (varying from   1.25%   to   2.75%  ) or the applicable Canadian Prime Rate plus an applicable margin (varying from   0.25%   to   1.50%  ), respectively.  Alternative currency borrowings denominated in Euros shall be comprised of Euro Interbank Offered Rate ( EURIBOR ) loans and bear interest at the EURIBOR rate plus an applicable margin (varying from   1.25%   to   2.75%  ).  Alternative currency borrowings denominated in any other alternate currency shall be comprised of Eurocurrency loans and bear interest at the LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin (varying from   1.25%   to   2.75%  ). 
    
  Loan Covenants and Restrictions 
    
  Our existing loan agreements include various covenants and restrictions, certain of which relate to the payment of dividends or other distributions to stockholders; redemption of capital stock; incurrence of additional indebtedness; mortgaging, pledging or disposition of major assets; and maintenance of specified financial ratios.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we were in compliance with all financial covenants and other provisions of our debt agreements.  

8.      BUSINESS SEGMENTS 
    
  Our business is organized into   two   segments:  NobelClad and DynaEnergetics. NobelClad's revenues are generated principally from cladding two dissimilar metals together using an explosion-welding process to form plates or transition joints. The clad plates and transition joints are sold to customers that fabricate industrial equipment for various industries, including oil and gas, petrochemicals, alternative energy, hydrometallurgy, aluminum production, shipbuilding, power generation and industrial refrigeration.  DynaEnergetics manufactures shaped charges, detonators and detonating cord, perforating guns, and bidirectional boosters  for sale to customers that perform the perforation of oil and gas wells and to customers involved in oil and gas exploration and development activities.

     Table of Contents  

The accounting policies of all of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies included herein and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .  Our reportable segments are separately managed strategic business units that offer different products and services. Each segment s products are marketed to different customer types and require different manufacturing processes and technologies. 
  Segment information is presented   for the three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   as follows: 

During the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  ,   no   one customer accounted for more than 10% of total net sales.

9.      RESTRUCTURING 
    
  During 2016 and 2015, we executed several programs to enhance operating efficiencies across our businesses, including closing distribution and production centers, consolidating manufacturing to more cost-effective locations, and reducing corporate headcount. 
    
  NobelClad Restructuring 
  Beginning in 2014 and continuing into 2015, NobelClad shifted the majority of clad metal plate production in Europe from facilities in Rivesaltes, France and W rgendorf, Germany to its manufacturing facility in Liebenscheid, Germany. 
    
  DynaEnergetics Restructuring 
  In the second quarter of 2016, DynaEnergetics reduced headcount   in Troisdorf, Germany and Austin, Texas.   During the third quarter of 2016, we incurred additional expenses to consolidate administrative offices to Houston, Texas. Additionally, we had a favorable adjustment for previously accrued severance amounts and equipment write-offs after relocating perforating gun manufacturing operations from the previous leased facility in Troisdorf, Germany to the new facility in Liebenscheid, Germany. 
  In the first quarter of 2015, we launched several initiatives to enhance DynaEnergetics  operational efficiencies and align its production and distribution resources with the anticipated demands of the market.  In January 2015, we closed   two   North American distribution centers.  In February 2015, we announced the closure of a perforating gun manufacturing facility and distribution center in Edmonton, Alberta.  North America perforating gun manufacturing was consolidated at DynaEnergetics' existing gun facility in Whitney, Texas.  We also exited several other distribution centers in Texas and Colombia.   Two   centralized distribution centers replaced the distribution centers closed. 
  Corporate Restructuring 
  In conjunction with the DynaEnergetics cost reductions announced in the second quarter of 2016, we eliminated certain positions and incurred restructuring charges associated with the accelerated vesting of stock awards.  
    
  In the first quarter of 2015, we restructured our corporate office by eliminating certain positions, and incurred restructuring charges associated with severance and accelerated vesting of stock awards.  
    
  Total restructuring and impairment charges incurred for these programs are as follows and are reported in the  restructuring expenses  line item in our consolidated statement of operations:

During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the changes to the restructuring liability associated with these programs is summarized below: 

(1) Severance expense excludes   $74   of non-cash charges for accelerated vesting of stock awards. 
   
  10.     COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES 
    
  Contingent Liabilities 
    
  The Company records an accrual for contingent liabilities when a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable. If some amount within a range of loss appears to be a better estimate than any other amount within the range, that amount is accrued. When no amount within a range of loss appears to be a better estimate than any other amount, the lowest amount in the range is accrued.  
    
  Anti-dumping and Countervailing Duties  
    
  In June 2015, U.S. Customs and Border Protection ( U.S. Customs ) sent us a Notice of Action that proposed to classify certain of our imports as subject to anti-dumping duties pursuant to a 2010 anti-dumping duty ( AD ) order on Oil Country Tubular Goods ( OCTG ) from China. A companion countervailing duty ( CVD ) order on the same product is in effect as well. The Notice of Action covered one entry of certain raw material steel mechanical tubing made in China and imported into the U.S. from Canada by our DynaEnergetics segment during 2015 for use in manufacturing perforating guns.  
    
  In July 2015, we sent a response to U.S. Customs outlining the reasons our mechanical tubing imports do not fall within the scope of the AD order on OCTG from China and should not be subject to anti-dumping duties. U.S. Customs proposed to take  
  
   17 

     Table of Contents  

similar action with respect to other entries of this product and requested an approximately   $1,100   cash deposit or bond for AD/CVD duties.  
    
  In August 2015, we posted the bond of approximately   $1,100   to U.S. Customs.  Subsequently, U.S. Customs declined to conclude on the Company's assertion that the mechanical tubing the Company has been importing is not within the scope of the AD order on OCTG from China. As a result, on September 25, 2015 the Company filed a request for a scope ruling with the U.S. Department of Commerce ("Commerce Department").   
    
  On February 15, 2016, the Company received the Commerce Department s scope ruling, which determined certain imports, primarily used for gun carrier tubing, are included in the scope of the AD/CVD orders on OCTG from China and thus is subject to AD/CVD duties. 
    
  On March 11, 2016, the Company filed an appeal with the U.S. Court of International Trade related to the Commerce Department s scope ruling.  In its financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company recorded a   $6.4 million   reserve for AD/CVD duties and interest that the Company expects to pay if it is unsuccessful in its appeal. For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company recorded   $128   of interest on its reserve for AD/CVD duties. 
    
  The Company will incur legal defense costs and could also be subject to additional interest and penalties. Accruals for potential penalties are not reflected in our financial statements as of   September 30, 2016   as they are neither probable nor estimable at this time. 
    
  Patent and Trademark Infringement 
    
  On September 22, 2015, GEODynamics, Inc., a US-based oil and gas perforating equipment manufacturer based in Fort Worth, TX, filed a patent and trademark infringement action against DynaEnergetics US, Inc., ( DynaEnergetics ), a wholly owned subsidiary of DMC, in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas ( District Court ) regarding alleged infringement of US Patent No. 9,080,431 granted on July 14, 2015 ( the  431 patent ) and a related US trademark for REACTIVE, alleging that DynaEnergetics  US sales of DPEX  shaped charges infringe the  431 patent and the trademark. DynaEnergetics denies validity and infringement of the  431 patent and trademark and has vigorously defended against this lawsuit. Motions for summary judgment are due by December 2, 2016, and DynaEnergetics expects to file more than one summary judgment motion.  On July 1, 2016, GeoDynamics filed a second patent infringement action against DynaEnergetics in District Court alleging infringement of US Patent No. 8,544,563 ( the  563 patent ), also based on DynaEnergetics  US sales of DPEX  shaped charges.  DynaEnergetics denies validity and infringement of the  563 patent and plans to vigorously defend against this lawsuit. On September 20, 2016, DynaEnergetics instituted an Inter Parties Review (IPR) against the  563 patent at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office ( USPTO ), requesting that the  563 patent be declared invalid by the USPTO. 
    
  We do not believe that the  431 or  563 patents or infringement claims based on the patents are valid, and we do not believe it is probable that we will incur a material loss in this matter. However, if the District Court or a jury determines that the patents are valid and that DynaEnergetics has infringed them, it is reasonably possible that our financial statements could be materially affected. We are not able to provide a reasonable estimate of the range of loss, and we have not accrued for any such losses. Such an evaluation includes, among other things, a determination of the total number of infringing sales in the United States of the implicated systems; what a reasonable royalty, if any, might be under the circumstances; or, alternatively, the scope of damages and the relevant period for which damages would apply, if any.

ITEM 2.      Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
    
  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements and notes, as well as the selected historical consolidated financial data that are included in our Annual Report filed on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Unless stated otherwise, all currency amounts are presented in thousands of U.S. dollars (000s). 

Overview 
    
  Dynamic Materials Corporation ("DMC") operates a diversified family of technical product and process businesses serving the energy, industrial and infrastructure markets. Our businesses operate globally through an international network of manufacturing, distribution and sales facilities.  Our business is organized into two segments: NobelClad and DynaEnergetics.   
    
  NobelClad 
    
  NobelClad manufactures clad metal plates and transition joints, which are made from clad plates, for sale to customers that fabricate industrial equipment for various industries, including oil and gas, petrochemicals, alternative energy, hydrometallurgy, aluminum production, shipbuilding, power generation, industrial refrigeration, and similar industries.  While a large portion of the demand for our clad metal products is driven by new plant construction and large plant expansion projects, maintenance and retrofit projects at existing chemical processing, petrochemical processing, oil refining, and aluminum smelting facilities also account for a significant portion of total demand.  These industries tend to be cyclical in nature and timing of new order inflow remains difficult to predict.  We use backlog as a primary means to measure the immediate outlook for our NobelClad business.  We define  backlog  at any given point in time as all firm, unfulfilled purchase orders and commitments at that time.  Generally speaking, we expect to fill most backlog orders within the following 12 months.  From experience, most firm purchase orders and commitments are realized.  NobelClad's backlog decreased to   $32,931   at   September 30, 2016   from $41,832 at   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  The largest component of NobelClad's cost of products sold is the cost of metals and alloys used to manufacture clad metal plates.  Because NobelClad's metal products are primarily produced for custom projects and conform to requirements set forth in customers  purchase orders, it holds a limited metal inventory and purchases its raw materials based on contract specifications. Under most contracts, any raw material price increases are passed on to NobelClad s customers. In a declining price market for metals, NobelClad experiences corresponding declines in revenue. 
    
  DynaEnergetics 
  DynaEnergetics manufactures shaped charges, detonators and detonating cord, perforating guns, and bidirectional boosters  for sale to customers that perform the perforation of oil and gas wells and to customers involved in oil and gas exploration activities. 
    
  These products are sold to large, mid-sized, and small oilfield service companies in the U.S., Europe, Canada, South America, Africa, the Middle East, Russia, and Asia. DynaEnergetics also sells directly to end-users. The market for perforating products, which are used during the well completion process, generally corresponds with oil and gas exploration and production activity. Exploration activity over the last several years has led to increasingly complex well completion operations, which in turn, has increased the demand for high quality and technically advanced perforating products.  
    
  Cost of products sold for DynaEnergetics includes the cost of metals, explosives and other raw materials used to manufacture shaped charges, detonating products and perforating guns as well as employee compensation and benefits, depreciation of manufacturing facilities and equipment, manufacturing supplies and other manufacturing overhead expenses.  
    
  Factors Affecting Results 
    
  During the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the following factors most affected our financial performance: 

NobelClad experienced a shipment delay associated with a large order, which negatively impacted revenue and gross profit for the third quarter. The year-to-date period was positively impacted by the shipment in the second quarter of specialized plates for a large semiconductor capital equipment project in East Asia. 
                
    DynaEnergetics' third quarter net sales improved from the prior year primarily due to the India project that shipped in the third quarter of 2016 versus shipping in the second quarter of 2015. Gross profit percentage for the quarter  
     
   19 

     Table of Contents  

and year-to-date periods was impacted by continued pressure on selling prices from the prolonged downturn in the oil and gas well-completions sector, which is the segment's primary end market. 
             
    Restructuring expenses of   $1,202   for the year-to-date period primarily related   to severance for headcount reductions and lease termination costs   in DynaEnergetics. 
                  
    The Company continued its investments in research and development, as well as technology, product and market development initiatives. DynaEnergetics' research and development spending was   $814   and   $2,718  , respectively, for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $584   and   $1,721  , respectively, in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. Research and development expenses are included in costs of product sold line item in the consolidated statements of operations. 

Consolidated Results of Operations 
    
  Three months ended September 30, 2016   compared with   three months ended September 30, 2015    

Net sales   The   decrease   compared with   2015   was due to a   21%     decrease   in NobelClad primarily due to delays at a subcontractor that pushed the shipment of a large project in the agricultural sector out of the third quarter of 2016. This partially was offset by an   8%     increase   in DynaEnergetics driven by the annual India project that shipped in the third quarter of 2016 versus the second quarter last year. Unit sales of DynaEnergetics' intrinsically-safe DynaSelect   TM    initiator increased significantly year over year. However, the increases in DynaEnergetics partially were offset by a decline in unit selling prices across all major product lines as a result of the downturn in the oil and gas exploration and development sector.     
    
  Gross profit   The   decrease   in gross profit and gross profit percentage compared with   2015   was due to unfavorable selling prices in DynaEnergetics combined with unfavorable project mix and warranty work in NobelClad. 
    
  General and administrative expenses   The   increase   compared with   2015   primarily was due to higher outside legal fees related to regulatory and litigation matters and information technology ("IT") project costs partially offset by lower salaries and benefits as a result of headcount reductions and a decline in stock-based compensation. 

20 

     Table of Contents  

Selling and distribution expenses   The   decrease   compared with   2015   principally was due to lower bad debt expense, a decrease in outside sales agent commissions and the impact of closing multiple distribution centers in DynaEnergetics as part of its previously announced restructuring programs.  
    
  Restructuring charges   For the   three months ended September 30, 2016   the components of restructuring charges were as follows: 

DynaEnergetics restructuring includes   severance adjustments related to headcount reductions announced in prior quarters, lease termination costs to exit administrative offices in Austin, Texas, and relocation of perforating gun manufacturing in Germany  .  
    
  For the   three months ended September 30, 2015   the components of restructuring charges were as follows: 

NobelClad's restructuring relates to shifting the majority of clad metal plate production in Europe from facilities in Rivesaltes, France and W rgendorf, Germany to its manufacturing facility in Liebenscheid, Germany. 
    
  DynaEnergetics' restructuring relates to the consolidation of perforating gun manufacturing centers and the closure of distribution centers in the Americas as well as the reduction of administrative workforce at the corporate offices in Troisdorf, Germany. 
    
  Operating loss   The increase compared with   2015   was due to a decrease in NobelClad's operating income combined with a higher operating loss at DynaEnergetics and higher corporate unallocated expenses. Corporate unallocated and stock-based compensation expenses are not allocated to our business segments. 
    
  Other income (expense), net   The   decrease   in expense compared with   2015   primarily was due to a decrease in unrealized foreign currency losses. Our subsidiaries frequently enter into inter-company and third party transactions that are denominated in currencies other than their functional currency.  Changes in exchange rates with respect to these transactions will result in unrealized gains or losses if unsettled at the end of the reporting period or realized foreign currency transaction gains or losses at settlement of the transaction.   
    
  Interest income (expense), net   The   increase   in expense compared with   2015   was due to interest on the accrued anti-dumping duties in the DynaEnergetics segment offset by lower interest on our line of credit. 
    
  Income tax provision   We recorded income tax expense of   $272   for the   third quarter   of   2016   compared with income tax expense of   $1,574   for the   third quarter   of   2015  . We currently are unable to recognize tax benefits associated with losses incurred in certain jurisdictions due to valuation allowances recorded against deferred tax assets in those jurisdictions. 
    
  Net   loss     As a result of the factors discussed above, net   loss   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   was   $3,136  , or   $0.22   per diluted share, compared with a net   loss   of   $4,233  , or   $0.30   per diluted share, for the same period in   2015  . 
    
  Adjusted EBITDA   The   decrease   compared with 2015 primarily was due to an increased operating loss. 

21 

     Table of Contents  

Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) measure that we believe provides an important indicator of our ongoing operating performance. We define EBITDA as net income plus or minus net interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA excludes from EBITDA stock-based compensation, restructuring and impairment charges and, when appropriate, other items that management does not utilize in assessing DMC s operating performance (as further described in the following financial schedules). 
    
  EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, as well as income measures that exclude restructuring expenses (ex-items), are non-GAAP financial measures. Management uses these non-GAAP measures in its operational and financial decision-making, believing that it is useful to eliminate certain items in order to focus on what it deems to be a more reliable indicator of ongoing operating performance. As a result, internal management reports used during monthly operating reviews feature Adjusted EBITDA and certain management incentive awards are based, in part, on the amount of Adjusted EBITDA achieved during the year. 
    
   The presence of non-GAAP financial measures in this report is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, DMC s GAAP information, and investors are cautioned that the non-GAAP financial measures are limited in their usefulness and may be unique to DMC, should not be considered as a supplement to DMC s GAAP financial measures and do not reflect any positive or negative trends in DMC s performance. Because not all companies use identical calculations, DMC s presentation of non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.  
    
  The following is a reconciliation of the most directly comparable GAAP measure to EBITDA and Adjusted EBIDTA.

Nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared with   nine months ended September 30, 2015 

Net sales   The   decrease   compared with   2015   was due to a   14%     decrease   in DynaEnergetics partially offset by a   3%     increase   in NobelClad. The decline in DynaEnergetics was due to prolonged downturn in the oil and gas well-completions sector while the increase in NobelClad primarily related to a large project for the semiconductor capital equipment industry that shipped in the second quarter of 2016. 
    
  Gross profit   The   decrease   in gross profit and gross profit percentage compared with   2015   primarily was due to unfavorable selling prices in DynaEnergetics and a lower proportion of sales in DynaEnergetics relative to NobelClad. 
    
  General and administrative expenses   The   decrease   compared with   2015   primarily was due to lower salaries and benefits from reducing headcount during the period and lower stock-based compensation. General and administrative expenses for 2015 also included incremental audit and legal expenses of $450 associated with the restatement of previously-issued financial statements included in our 2014 Form 10-K.  
    
  Selling and distribution expenses   The   decrease   compared with   2015   principally was due to lower salaries and benefits, lower bad debt expense in both DynaEnergetics and NobelClad, and lower outside sales agent commissions in DynaEnergetics driven by sales volume in territories in which our segments do not have a captive sales force.  
    
  Restructuring charges   For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   the components of restructuring charges were as follows: 

23 

     Table of Contents  

DynaEnergetics restructuring   relates to severance for headcount reductions in Troisdorf, Germany and Austin, Texas as well as lease termination costs in Austin  . Corporate restructuring relates to the accelerated vesting of stock awards in connection with the elimination of certain positions in DynaEnergetics. 
    
  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   the components of restructuring charges were as follows: 

NobelClad's restructuring relates to shifting the majority of clad metal plate production in Europe from facilities in Rivesaltes, France and W rgendorf, Germany to its manufacturing facility in Liebenscheid, Germany. 
    
  DynaEnergetics' restructuring relates to the consolidation of perforating gun manufacturing centers, the closure of distribution centers in the Americas, and the reduction of administrative workforce at its corporate offices in Troisdorf, Germany. 
    
  Corporate restructuring relates to severance payments and the accelerated vesting of stock awards associated with  
  the elimination of certain positions in our corporate office. 
    
  Operating loss   The   decrease   compared with   2015   was due to an   increase   in NobelClad's operating income and lower corporate unallocated and stock-based compensation expenses partially offset by an increase in DynaEnergetics' operating loss. Corporate unallocated and stock-based compensation expenses are not allocated to our business segments. 
    
  Other income (expense), net   The change compared with   2015   was due to an increase in unrealized foreign currency gains partially offset by a decrease in realized foreign currency losses. Our subsidiaries frequently enter into inter-company and third party transactions that are denominated in currencies other than their functional currency.  Changes in exchange rates with respect to these transactions will result in unrealized gains or losses if unsettled at end of the reporting period or realized foreign currency transaction gains or losses at settlement of the transaction. 
    
  Interest income (expense), net   The   increase   in expense compared with   2015   was primarily due to interest expense recorded on the accrued anti-dumping duties in DynaEnergetics. 
    
  Income tax provision   We recorded income tax expense of   $321   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared with income tax expense of   $2,704   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . We currently are unable to recognize tax benefits associated with losses incurred in certain jurisdictions due to valuation allowances recorded against our deferred tax assets in those jurisdictions. 
    
  Net   loss     As a result of the factors discussed above, net   loss   for   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   $4,316  , or   $0.31   per diluted share, compared with a net   loss   of   $7,929  , or   $0.57   per diluted share, for the same period in   2015  . 
    
  Adjusted EBITDA   The   decrease   compared with   2015   primarily was due to lower income tax expense and restructuring charges partially offset by a smaller operating loss compared with   2015  . 
    
  See explanation of the use of Adjusted EBITDA under the comparison of the   three months ended September 30, 2016   with the same period of   2015  .  The following is a reconciliation of the most directly comparable GAAP measure to EBITDA and Adjusted EBIDTA.

Business Segment Financial Information     
    
  We primarily evaluate performance and allocate resources based on segment revenues, operating income and adjusted EBITDA as well as projected future performance. Segment operating income is defined as revenues less expenses identifiable to the segment. Segment operating income will reconcile to consolidated income before income taxes by deducting unallocated corporate expenses, including stock-based compensation, net other expense, net interest expense, and income tax provision.

  Three months ended September 30, 2016   compared with   three months ended September 30, 2015    

Net sales   The   decrease   compared with   2015   reflects the timing differences with respect to when orders enter our backlog and the subsequent shipment of these orders. During the third quarter of 2016, NobelClad experienced a temporary delay at a subcontractor that pushed the shipment of a large order out of the third quarter. 
    
  Gross profit   The   decrease   in gross profit and gross profit percentage compared with   2015   primarily was due to warranty work and less favorable margins on its mix of projects in the third quarter of 2016 compared with the same period in 2015.   
    
  General and administrative expenses   The   decrease   compared with   2015   primarily was attributable to a decline in salaries and wages.

During the second quarter of 2016, NobelClad shipped a large project related to specialized explosion clad plates to be used in the fabrication of equipment for a semiconductor material production facility in East Asia. 
    
  Gross profit   The   increase   in gross profit and gross profit percentage compared with   2015   primarily was due to more favorable margins on its mix of projects during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared with the same period in 2015. Gross profit also benefited from lower manufacturing overhead expenses from the consolidation of European manufacturing facilities.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  We have historically financed our operations from a combination of internally generated cash flow, revolving credit borrowings, various long-term debt arrangements, and the issuance of common stock.  We believe that cash flow from operations and funds available under our current credit facilities and any future replacement thereof will be sufficient to fund the working capital, debt interest service, dividend payments, and capital expenditure requirements of our current business operations for the foreseeable future.  Nevertheless, our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations will depend upon our success in executing our strategies. If we are unable to (i) realize sales from our backlog; (ii) secure new customer orders; (iii) selling products at attractive margins; and (iv) continue to implement cost-effective internal processes, our ability to meet cash requirements through operating activities could be impacted.  Additionally, continued challenging conditions in our core energy markets could impact our ability to meet cash requirements through operating activities.  Furthermore, any restriction on the availability of borrowings under our credit facilities could negatively affect our ability to meet future cash requirements.   
    
  Debt facilities 
    
  We have a a   five  -year   $75,000   syndicated credit agreement ( credit facility ), which allows for revolving loans of   $65,000   in US dollars and   $10,000   in alternate currencies as well as a   $100,000   accordion feature to increase the commitments in any of the loan classes subject to approval by applicable lenders. We also maintain a line of credit with a German bank for certain DynaEnergetics operations.  This line of credit provides a borrowing capacity of 4,000 Euros.   
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , U.S. dollar revolving loans of   $15,250   were outstanding under our credit facility.  While we had approximately $  59,750   of available revolving credit loan capacity as of   September 30, 2016   under our various credit facilities, future borrowings are subject to compliance with financial covenants that could significantly limit such availability. 
    
  There are two significant financial covenants under our credit facility, the leverage ratio and debt service coverage ratio requirements.  The leverage ratio is defined in the credit facility as Consolidated Funded Indebtedness at the balance sheet date as compared to Consolidated EBITDA, which is defined as earnings before provisions for income taxes, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, extraordinary, non-recurring charges and other non-cash charges, for the previous twelve months.  For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and the year ended   December 31, 2015  , Consolidated EBITDA approximated the  Adjusted EBITDA  that we reported for the respective periods.  Under our credit facility, the maximum leverage ratio permitted by our credit facility during the third quarter was 3.25 to 1.0. As of October 1, 2016, the maximum leverage ratio permitted under the the credit facility is 3.0 to 1.0. 
    
  The debt service coverage ratio, as defined in the credit facility, means, for any period, the ratio of Consolidated EBITDA less the sum of cash dividends, cash income taxes and capital expenditures to Debt Service Charges.  Consolidated EBITDA is defined above and Debt Service Charges equals the sum of cash interest expense and scheduled principal payments of Consolidated Funded Indebtedness.  Under our credit facility, the minimum debt service coverage ratio permitted by our credit facility is 1.35 to 1.0.

     Table of Contents  

Our existing loan agreements include various covenants and restrictions, certain of which relate to the payment of dividends or other distributions to stockholders, redemption of capital stock, incurrence of additional indebtedness, mortgaging, pledging or disposition of major assets, and maintenance of specified financial ratios.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we were in compliance with all financial covenants and other provisions of our debt agreements. 
     
  Other contractual obligations and commitments 
    
  Our long-term debt balance decreased to   $15,250   at   September 30, 2016   from   $27,500   at   December 31, 2015  . Our other contractual obligations and commitments have not materially changed since   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Cash flows from operating activities 
    
  Net cash provided by operating activities was   $17,839   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . This compares to net cash used in operating activities of   $6,414   for the same period in   2015  .  The year-over-year increase in operating cash flows of $  24,253   primarily was driven by a $  25,522   decrease in net working capital.  We experienced favorable net working capital changes of $  11,584   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared with unfavorable changes in net working capital of $  13,938   in the same period of   2015  . Favorable changes in working capital for the nine months ended September 30,   2016   included a   $10,480   decrease in accounts receivable due to lower sales and the timing of collections, a   $3,400   reduction in inventory, and a   $1,037   increase in accrued expenses. These favorable changes in working capital partially were offset by a   $3,166   decrease in accounts payable from a decline in purchases and a   $347   increase in prepaid expenses. 
    
  Net cash used in operating activities was $  6,414   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .  We experienced unfavorable net working capital changes of $  13,938   in the   2015   period, including an increase in inventories, prepaid expenses, and receivables of $  3,908  , $  1,523  , and   $220  , respectively, and decreases of $  1,271   in customer advances and $  3,742   in accounts payable. The increase in net working capital was driven by a ramp up of inventory associated with a new product introduction in DynaEnergetics, cash payments related to restructuring activities and a decrease in customer advances in NobelClad. 
    
  Cash flows from investing activities 
    
  Net cash flows used in investing activities for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   were   $4,008   primarily due to capital expenditures.   
    
  Net cash flows used in investing activities for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   totaled $  4,690   primarily due to capital expenditures.  
    
  Cash flows from financing activities 
    
  Net cash flows used in financing activities for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   totaled   $12,945  , which included net repayments on bank lines of credit of $  12,250   and payment of quarterly dividends of $  861  .   
    
  Net cash flows provided by financing activities for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   totaled $  10,965  , which included net borrowings on bank lines of credit of $  13,446  , payment of quarterly dividends of   $1,692  , and payment of deferred debt issuance costs of   $1,042  .   
    
  Payment of Dividends 
    
  On August 30, 2016, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.02 per share which was paid on October 15, 2016.  The dividend totaled   $290   and was payable to shareholders of record as of September 30, 2016.  We also paid quarterly cash dividends of $0.02 per share in the first and second quarters of 2016 and 0.04 per share in the first three quarters of 2015. 
    
  We may continue to pay quarterly dividends in the future subject to capital availability and periodic determinations that cash dividends are in compliance with our debt covenants and are in the best interests of our stockholders, but we cannot assure you that such payments will continue.  Future dividends may be affected by, among other items, our views on potential future capital requirements, future business prospects, debt covenant compliance, changes in federal income tax laws, or any other factors that our board of directors deems relevant.  Any decision to pay cash dividends is and will continue to be at the discretion of our Board of Directors. 

Critical Accounting Policies 

30 

     Table of Contents  

Our critical accounting policies have not changed from those reported in our Annual Report filed on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 

ITEM 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk 
    
  There have been no events that materially affect our quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk from that reported in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 

ITEM 4.      Controls and Procedures 
    
  As previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014, a material weakness in our controls over deferred income tax accounting was identified during the course of the 2014 external audit of the accounts and related controls. As a result of the significance of the accounting errors resulting from the deficient controls, we restated 2012 and 2013 financial statements included in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014.  
    
  In 2015, we took steps to remediate the material weakness, including: 

Hired a new Global Tax Director.   
                
    Engaged third-party tax advisors to assist with designing and implementing processes and procedures to compile, reconcile and review income tax accounts. 
                
    Provided income tax training and development to tax personnel.  
       
  Although we implemented new processes and procedures in 2015, we concluded that the material weakness was not remediated as of December 31, 2015 as the existing controls were not in place for an adequate period of time to ensure proper operation and additional controls are required to be implemented for our income tax accounting. During the remainder of 2016, the Company will continue the internal control process and documentation improvements and testing related to deferred income tax and related income tax expense accounts in order to conclude on the remediation efforts. 
    
  The remediation efforts are subject to ongoing senior management review, as well as Audit Committee oversight.  Although we plan to complete this remediation process as quickly as possible, we cannot at this time estimate how long it will take and our initiatives may not prove to be successful in remediating this material weakness.  Management believes the already implemented actions, along with any additional controls will effectively remediate the material weakness.  As we continue to evaluate and work to improve our internal control over financial reporting, management may execute additional measures to address potential control deficiencies or modify the remediation plan described above.  Management will continue to review and make necessary changes to the overall design of our internal controls.   
    
  We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is accurately recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily applied its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e)).  Based on that evaluation, which includes the material weakness identified at December 31, 2014 and not remediated as of December 31, 2015 as discussed above, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at the reasonable assurance level.  There have been no other changes in our internal controls during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   or in other factors that could materially affect our internal controls over financial reporting. 
    
  Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud.  Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.  As a result of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our company have been detected.  These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple errors or mistakes.  As a result of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.  Accordingly, our disclosure  
  
   31 

     Table of Contents  

controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the disclosure controls and procedures are met.

Part II - OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
    
  On September 22, 2015, GeoDynamics, Inc., a US-based oil and gas perforating equipment manufacturer based in Fort Worth, TX, filed a patent and trademark infringement action against DynaEnergetics US, Inc., ( DynaEnergetics ), a wholly owned subsidiary of DMC, in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas ( District Court ) regarding alleged infringement of US Patent No. 9,080,431 granted on July 14, 2015 ( the  431 patent ) and a related US trademark for REACTIVE, alleging that DynaEnergetics  US sales of DPEX  shaped charges infringe the  431 patent and the trademark.  Motions for summary judgment are due by December 2, 2016, and DynaEnergetics expects to file more than one summary judgment motion. On July 1, 2016, GeoDynamics filed a second patent infringement action against DynaEnergetics in District Court alleging infringement of US Patent No. 8,544,563 ( the  563 patent ), also based on DynaEnergetics  US sales of DPEX  shaped charges. On September 20, 2016, DynaEnergetics instituted an Inter Parties Review (IPR) against the  563 patent at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office ( USPTO ), requesting that the  563 patent be declared invalid by the USPTO.  GEODynamics is seeking, among other things, compensatory damages and injunctive relief from further infringement in both actions.  We believe that the claims are meritless and that we have substantial legal and factual defenses to the claims and allegations contained in the complaints.  At this time, no assessment can be made as to the likely outcome of these actions or whether the outcome will be material to us. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
    
  There have been no significant changes in the risk factors identified as being attendant to our business in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
    
  In connection with the vesting of Company restricted common stock under the 2006 Stock Incentive Plan ( 2006 Plan ), we retain shares of common stock at the election of the recipients of such awards in satisfaction of withholding tax obligations. These shares are held as treasury shares by the Company.  

(1) All shares purchased in 2016 were to offset tax withholding obligations that occur upon the vesting of restricted common stock under the terms of the 2006 Plan.  
  (2) As of September 30, 2016, the maximum number of shares that may yet be purchased would not exceed the employees  portion of taxes withheld on unvested shares (381,491 shares).
