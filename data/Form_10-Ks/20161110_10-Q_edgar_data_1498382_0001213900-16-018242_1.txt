Nature
of operations   

DelMar
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the  Company ) is a clinical stage drug development company with a focus on the treatment of
cancer.   We are conducting clinical trials in the United States with our product candidate, VAL-083, as a potential
new treatment for glioblastoma multiforme, the most common and aggressive form of brain cancer.  We have also acquired
certain exclusive commercial rights to VAL-083 in China where it is approved as a chemotherapy for the treatment of chronic myelogenous
leukemia and lung cancer.  In order to accelerate our development timelines and reduce risk, we leverage existing clinical
and commercial data from a wide range of sources.  We plan to seek marketing partnerships in China in order to potentially
generate future royalty revenue.  

The
address of the Company s administrative offices is Suite 720 - 999 West Broadway, Vancouver, British Columbia, V5Z 1K5 with
clinical operations located at 3485 Edison Way, Suite R, Menlo Park, California, 94025.  

Corporate
history   

The
Company is a Nevada corporation formed on June 24, 2009 under the name Berry Only Inc. On January 25, 2013, the Company entered
into and closed an exchange agreement (the  Exchange Agreement ), with Del Mar Pharmaceuticals (BC) Ltd. ( DelMar
(BC) ), 0959454 B.C. Ltd. ( Callco ), and 0959456 B.C. Ltd. ( Exchangeco ) and the security holders
of DelMar (BC). Upon completion of the Exchange Agreement, DelMar (BC) became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the  Reverse
Acquisition ).   

DelMar
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is the parent company of DelMar (BC), a British Columbia, Canada corporation incorporated on April 6, 2010,
which is a clinical stage company with a focus on the development of drugs for the treatment of cancer. The Company is also the
parent company to Callco and Exchangeco which are British Columbia, Canada corporations. Callco and Exchangeco were formed to
facilitate the Reverse Acquisition.  

References
to the Company refer to the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, DelMar (BC), Callco and Exchangeco.  

Liquidity
risk  

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company reported a loss of $2,290,339 and an accumulated deficit of $34,837,585
at that date. As at September 30, 2016, the Company had cash and cash equivalents on hand of $4,799,033. The Company does not
have the prospect of achieving revenues in the near future and the Company will require additional funding to maintain its research
and development projects and for general operations. There is a great degree of uncertainty with respect to the expenses the Company
will incur in executing its business plan. In addition, the Company has not begun to commercialize or generate revenues from its
product candidate.

(expressed
in US dollars unless otherwise noted)  

Consequently,
management is pursuing various financing alternatives to fund the Company s operations so it can continue as a going concern
in the medium to longer term. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company received $256,940 in proceeds from
the exercise of share purchase warrants (note 6). During the year ended June 30, 2016 the Company completed a convertible preferred
share private placement for net cash proceeds of $6,540,821. We believe, based on our current estimates, that we will be able
to fund our operations beyond the next twelve months.   

There is no assurance that our
cost estimates will prove to be accurate or that unforeseen events, problems or delays will not occur with respect thereto. The
ability of the Company to meet its obligations and continue the research and development of its product candidate is dependent
on its ability to continue to raise adequate financing. There can be no assurance that such financing will be available to the
Company in the amount required at any time or for any period or, if available, that it can be obtained on terms satisfactory to
the Company. The Company may tailor its drug candidate development program based on the amount of funding the Company raises.

                                         accounting policies     

Reverse
stock split   

On May 16,
2016, the Company filed a Certificate of Change with the Secretary of State of Nevada that effected a 1-for-4 reverse stock split
of its common stock. The reverse split became effective on May 20, 2016. All warrants, stock options, conversion ratios, and per
share information in these consolidated condensed financial statements give retroactive effect to this 1-for-4 reverse stock split.
The Company s authorized and issued preferred stock was not affected by the split. However, the common stock conversion
ratio on the Company s Series B preferred shares was adjusted as a result of the reverse stock split. 

Basis
of presentation   

The
consolidated condensed interim financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with United States Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles ( U.S. GAAP ) and are presented in United States dollars. The Company s functional
currency is the United States dollar.  

The
accompanying consolidated condensed interim financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries,
DelMar BC, Callco, and Exchangeco. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.  

The
principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below and have been consistently
applied to all periods presented.

Unaudited
interim financial data   

The accompanying unaudited September
30, 2016 consolidated condensed interim balance sheet, the consolidated condensed interim statements of loss and comprehensive
loss for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and consolidated condensed cash flows for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, and the related interim information contained within the notes to the consolidated condensed interim
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission
for interim financial information. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and the notes required by U.S. GAAP
for complete financial statements. These consolidated condensed interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with
the audited financial statements of the Company as at June 30, 2016 included in our Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission on September 13, 2016. In the opinion of management, the unaudited consolidated condensed interim financial statements
reflect all adjustments, consisting of normal and recurring adjustments, necessary for the fair statement of the Company s
financial position at September 30, 2016 and results of its operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
and its cash flows for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The results for three months ended September 30, 2016
are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2017 or for any other future
annual or interim period. 

Use
of estimates   

The
preparation of consolidated condensed interim financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates
and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, expenses, contingent assets and contingent
liabilities as at the end or during the reporting period. Actual results could significantly differ from those estimates. Significant
areas requiring management to make estimates include the derivative liability and the valuation of equity instruments issued for
services. There have been no changes to the methodology used in determining these estimates from the period ended June 30, 2016.  

Loss
per share   

Loss
per share is calculated based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. For the three month periods ended September
30, 2016 and 2015 diluted loss per share does not differ from basic loss per share since the effect of the Company s warrants
and stock options are anti-dilutive. At September 30, 2016, potential common shares of 4,528,040 (September 30, 2015   4,476,111)
relating to warrants and 856,250 (September 30, 2015   886,250) relating to stock options were excluded from the calculation
of net loss per common share because their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.  

Recent
accounting pronouncements   

From
time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) or other
standard setting bodies that are adopted by the Company as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, we believe
that the impact of recently issued standards that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on our financial position
or results of operations upon adoption.

ASU
2016-09, Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.    

The
amendments in this update change existing guidance related to accounting for employee share-based payments affecting the income
tax consequences of awards, classification of awards as equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows.
ASU 2016-09 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those
annual periods, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of the adoption of this
standard.  

ASU
2016-02, Leases (Topic 842).    

The
new standard establishes a right-of-use ( ROU ) model that requires a lessee to record a ROU asset and a lease liability
on the consolidated balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases will be classified as either finance
or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the consolidated income statement. ASU 2016-02
is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those annual periods, with
early adoption permitted. A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases
existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with
certain practical expedients available. The Company is currently evaluating the potential impact of the adoption of this standard.  

ASU
No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and
Financial Liabilities.    

The
updated guidance enhances the reporting model for financial instruments, and requires entities to use the exit price notion when
measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes, and the separate presentation of financial assets and
financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset (i.e., securities or loans and receivables) on the balance
sheet or the accompanying notes to the financial statements. The guidance is effective for annual and interim reporting periods
beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company is currently assessing this standard for its impact on future reporting periods.  

Accounting
Standards Update ( ASU ) 2014-15 - Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern   

The
objective of the guidance is to require management to explicitly assess an entity's ability to continue as a going concern, and
to provide related footnote disclosures in certain circumstances. In connection with each annual and interim period, management
will assess if there is substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the issuance
date of an entity s financial statements. The new standard defines substantial doubt and provides examples of indicators
thereof. The definition of substantial doubt incorporates a likelihood threshold of  probable  similar to the current
use of that term in U.S. GAAP for loss contingencies. The new standard will be effective for all entities in the first annual
period ending after December 15, 2016 (December 31, 2016 for calendar year-end entities). Earlier application is permitted. The
Company is currently assessing this standard for its impact on future reporting periods.

       Valent Technologies, LLC    

On September 30, 2014, the Company entered into an exchange
agreement (the  Valent Exchange Agreement ) with Valent Technologies, LLC ( Valent ), an entity owned by
Dr. Dennis Brown, the Company s Chief Scientific Officer and director, and DelMar (BC). Pursuant to the Valent Exchange Agreement,
Valent exchanged its loan payable in the outstanding amount of $278,530 (including aggregate accrued interest to September 30,
2014 of $28,530), issued to Valent by DelMar (BC), for 278,530 shares of the Company s Series A Preferred Stock. The Series
A Preferred Stock have a stated value of $1.00 per share (the  Series A Stated Value ) and are not convertible into
common stock. The holder of the Series A Preferred Stock is entitled to dividends at the rate of 3% of the Stated Value per year,
payable quarterly in arrears. 

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 respectively, the Company recorded $2,089 related to the dividend payable to
Valent. The dividend of $2,089 has been recorded as a direct increase in accumulated deficit.  

4   
       Related
party transactions    

Pursuant to consulting agreements with the Company s
officers the Company recognized a total of $120,000 (2015 - $120,000) in compensation expense for the three months ended September
30, 2016. 

The Company incurred $45,000 (2015   $41,750)
in directors  fees during the three months ended September 30, 2016. 

The Company recorded $2,089 (2015 - $2,089) in
dividends related to the preferred stock issued to Valent (note 3). 

5   
       Derivative
liability    

The
Company has issued common stock purchase warrants. Based on the terms of certain of these warrants the Company determined that
the warrants were a derivative liability which is recognized at fair value at the date of the transaction and re-measured at fair
value each reporting period with the changes in fair value recorded in the consolidated condensed statement of loss and comprehensive
loss.  

2013
Investor Warrants    

During the quarter ended March
31, 2013 the Company issued an aggregate of 3,281,250 units at a purchase price of $3.20 per unit, for aggregate gross proceeds
of $10,500,000 (the  Private Offering ). Each unit consisted of one share of common stock and one five-year warrant
(the  2013 Investor Warrants ) to purchase one share of common stock at an initial exercise price of $3.20. The exercise
price of the 2013 Investor Warrants is subject to adjustment in the event that the Company issues common stock at a price lower
than the exercise price, subject to certain exceptions. The 2013 Investor Warrants are redeemable by the Company at a price of
$0.004 per 2013 Investor Warrant at any time subject to the conditions that (i) the Company s common stock has traded for
twenty (20) consecutive trading days with a closing price of at least $6.40 per share with an average trading volume of 50,000
shares per day, and (ii) the underlying shares of common stock are registered for resale.

of $134,900 from these exercises. The warrants that have been exercised were revalued at their respective exercise dates and then
the reclassification to equity was recorded resulting in $181,008 of the derivative liability being reclassified to equity.

entered into amendments (the  2013 Investor Warrant Amendments ) with the holders of certain 2013 Investor Warrants.
During the three months ended September 30, 2016 pursuant to the 2013 Investor Warrant Amendments, 15,944 of the 2013 Investor
Warrants were amended to extend the expiration date to March 31, 2019 and remove the provision requiring an adjustment of the
exercise price in the event the Company sells common stock at a purchase price lower than the current warrant exercise price.
As a result of the 2013 Investor Warrant Amendments, the Company has reclassified $53,006 from the derivative liability to equity.
The 2013 Investor Warrants were revalued to their respective amendment dates and were then reclassified to equity.

7      Financial
                                         instruments     

The
Company has financial instruments that are measured at fair value. To determine the fair value, we use the fair value hierarchy
for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs
by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs market participants would use
to value an asset or liability and are developed based on market data obtained from independent sources. Unobservable inputs are
inputs based on assumptions about the factors market participants would use to value an asset or liability. The three levels of
inputs that may be used to measure fair value are as follows:  

Level
                                         one - inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical
                                         assets or liabilities;    

Level
                                         two - inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable
                                         for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly such as interest rates, foreign
                                         exchange rates, and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals; and    

Level
                                         three - unobservable inputs developed using estimates and assumptions, which are
                                         developed by the reporting entity and reflect those assumptions that a market participant
                                         would use.

(expressed

Assets
and liabilities are classified based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurements. Changes
in the observability of valuation inputs may result in a reclassification of levels for certain securities within the fair value
hierarchy.  

The
Company s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, other receivables, accounts payable, related party
payables and derivative liability. The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, other receivables, accounts payable and related
party payables approximate their fair values due to the immediate or short-term maturity of these financial instruments.  

Derivative
liability   

The
Company accounts for certain warrants under the authoritative guidance on accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed
to, and potentially settled in, a company s own stock, on the understanding that in compliance with applicable securities
laws, the warrants require the issuance of securities upon exercise and do not sufficiently preclude an implied right to net cash
settlement. The Company classifies these warrants on its balance sheet as a derivative liability which is fair valued at each
reporting period subsequent to the initial issuance. The Company has used a simulated probability valuation model to value the
warrants. Determining the appropriate fair-value model and calculating the fair value of warrants requires considerable judgment.
Any change in the estimates (specifically probabilities) used may cause the value to be higher or lower than that reported. The
estimated volatility of the Company s common stock at the date of issuance, and at each subsequent reporting period, is
based on the historical volatility of similar life sciences companies. The risk-free interest rate is based on rates published
by the government for bonds with a maturity similar to the expected remaining life of the warrants at the valuation date. The
expected life of the warrants is assumed to be equivalent to their remaining contractual term.  

a)    Fair
                                         value of derivative liability    

The
derivative is not traded in an active market and the fair value is determined using valuation techniques. The Company uses judgment
to select a variety of methods to make assumptions that are based on specific management plans and market conditions at the end
of each reporting period. The Company uses a fair value estimate to determine the fair value of the derivative liability. The
carrying value of the derivative liability would be higher or lower as management estimates around specific probabilities change.
The estimates may be significantly different from those recorded in the consolidated financial statements because of the use of
judgment and the inherent uncertainty in estimating the fair value of these instruments that are not quoted in an active market.
All changes in the fair value are recorded in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss each reporting period.
This is considered to be a Level 2 financial instrument.  

The
Company has the following liabilities under the fair value hierarchy:

                                          DMPI .    

We
                                         advanced our product development program in refractory GBM toward a pivotal Phase III
                                         clinical trial:     

We
                                         completed a Phase I/II clinical trial of VAL-083 in refractory GBM and reported data
                                         at the American Society of Clinical Oncology s annual meeting demonstrating that
                                         VAL-083 may offer improved survival for GBM patients in comparison to currently available
                                         salvage chemotherapy;    

We
                                         completed an  End of Phase II  meeting with the United States Food and Drug
                                         Administration ( FDA ) and plan to advance VAL-083 into a pivotal Phase III
                                         clinical trial for GBM patients whose tumors have progressed following treatment with
                                         bevacizumab; and    

We presented additional data demonstrating that VAL-083
exhibits a distinct mode of action from other chemotherapies used in the treatment of GBM at the European Association of Neuro-Oncology
annual meeting.   

We
                                         established collaborations designed to accelerate and expand our product opportunities
                                         with VAL-083:    

We
                                         entered into a collaboration research agreement with Accurexa, Inc. to explore local
                                         delivery of VAL-083 as a potential combination therapy for the treatment of brain tumors;
                                         and    

We
                                         announced plans to initiate a new Phase II clinical study of VAL-083 in patients with
                                         GBM at first recurrence/progression (prior to Avastin  exposure) in collaboration
                                         with the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center ( MD Anderson ).    

We
                                         continued to obtain promising research results supporting the potential of VAL-083 in
                                         new indications:    

We
                                         presented data supporting the effectiveness of VAL-083 against chemotherapy-resistant
                                         ovarian cancers at the 11 th  Biennial Ovarian Cancer Research Symposium;    

We
                                         presented new non-clinical data supporting the differentiation of VAL-083 in the treatment
                                         of lung cancer at the American Association for Cancer Research s ( AACR )
                                         annual meeting;    

We
                                         presented data indicating that VAL-083 offers potential therapeutic alternatives in difficult-to-treat
                                         pediatric brain tumors at the AACR   Advances in Pediatric Research: From Mechanisms
                                         and Models to Treatment and Survivorship Conference; and    

In
                                         the spring of 2016, the FDA Office of Orphan Products Development ( OOPD )
                                         granted orphan drug designations to VAL-083 for the treatment of ovarian cancer and medulloblastoma.
                                         We have previously been granted an orphan drug designation for VAL-083 in glioma in the
                                         USA and Europe.    

We
                                         continued to strengthen our intellectual property portfolio. DelMar now holds six issued
                                         US patents and seven issued patents outside of the US. We have thirteen patent families
                                         in various stages of prosecution, and over 100 patent filings in total.    

Overview   

DelMar
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (the  Company ) is a clinical stage drug development company with a focus on the treatment of
cancer. We are conducting clinical trials in the United States of our first product candidate, VAL-083, as a potential new treatment
for GBM, the most common and aggressive form of brain cancer. We have also acquired certain exclusive commercial rights to VAL-083
in China where it is approved as a chemotherapy for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia ( CML ) and lung
cancer. In order to accelerate our development timelines and reduce risk, we leverage existing clinical and commercial data from
a wide range of sources. We plan to pursue independent development and commercialization of VAL-083 refractory GBM and potentially
other product candidates that we may acquire or discover through our research activities. We will also seek collaborative
development and commercialization partnerships in order to accelerate and expand our own product development efforts and potentially
generate future royalty revenue.  

VAL-083    

Our
product candidate, VAL-083, represents a  first-in-class  small molecule chemotherapeutic which means that the molecular
structure of VAL-083 is not an analogue or derivative of other small molecule chemotherapeutics approved for the treatment of
cancer. VAL-083 was originally discovered in the 1960 s and has been assessed in 42 Phase I and Phase II clinical trials
sponsored by the National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) in the United States as a treatment against various cancers including
lung, brain, cervical, ovarian tumors and leukemia. Published pre-clinical and clinical data suggest that VAL-083 may be active
against a range of tumor types. VAL-083 is approved as a cancer chemotherapeutic in China for the treatment of CML and lung cancer.
VAL-083 has not been approved for any indications outside of China.  

Upon
obtaining regulatory approval, we intend to commercialize VAL-083 for the treatment of refractory GBM and other orphan cancer
indications where patients have failed other therapies or have limited medical options. Orphan diseases are defined in the United
States under the Rare Disease Act of 2002 as  any disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 persons in the United
States . The Orphan Drug Act of 1983 is a federal law that provides financial and other incentives including a seven-year
period of market exclusivity in the United States to encourage the development of new treatments for orphan diseases. We also
plan to seek collaborative development and commercialization partnerships to accelerate and expand the development of VAL-083
in newly diagnosed GBM and other non-orphan cancer indications.  

We
research the mechanism of action of potential product candidates to determine the clinical indications best suited for therapy
and seek to rapidly advance into human clinical trials and toward commercialization. The mechanism of action of VAL-083 is understood
to be a bi-functional alkylating agent. Alkylating agents are a commonly used class of chemotherapy drugs. They exhibit anti-cancer
effects by binding to DNA and interfering with normal processes within the cancer cell, which prevents the cell from making the
proteins needed to grow and survive. After exposure to alkylating agents, the cancer cell becomes dysfunctional and dies. There
are a number of alkylating agents on the market that are used by physicians to treat different types of cancer.  

VAL-083
attacks cancer cells via a unique mechanism of action which is distinct from other chemotherapies used in the treatment of cancer.
Based on published research and our own data, the cytotoxic functional groups and the mechanism of action of VAL-083 are understood
to be functionally different from alkylating agents commonly used in the treatment of cancer. VAL-083 has previously demonstrated
activity in cell-lines that are resistant to other types of chemotherapy. No evidence of cross-resistance has been reported in
published clinical studies. Therefore, we believe that VAL-083 may be effective in treating tumors that have failed or become
resistant to other chemotherapies.  

VAL-083
readily crosses the blood brain barrier where it maintains a long half-life in comparison to the plasma. Published pre-clinical
and clinical research demonstrate that VAL-083 is selective for brain tumor tissue.  

The
main dose-limiting toxicity ( DLT ) related to the administration of VAL-083 in previous NCI-sponsored clinical studies
was myelosuppression. Myelosuppression is the decrease in cells responsible for providing immunity, carrying oxygen, and those
responsible for normal blood clotting. Myelosuppression is a common side effect of chemotherapy. There is no evidence of lung,
liver or kidney toxicity even with prolonged treatment by VAL-083. Commercial data from the Chinese market where the drug has
been approved for more than 15 years supports the safety findings of the NCI studies.  

Modern
medicine allows for better management of myelosuppressive side effects. We believe this offers the potential opportunity to improve
upon the drug s already established efficacy profile by substantially increasing the dose of VAL-083 that can be safely
administered to GBM patients.  

Background
on GBM    

Worldwide,
there are an estimated 240,000 new cases of brain and central nervous system ( CNS ) tumors each year. Gliomas are
a type of CNS tumor that arises from glial cells in the brain or spine. Glial cells are the cells surrounding nerves. Their primary
function is to provide support and protection for neurons in the CNS.  

GBM
is the most common and the most lethal form of glioma. According to the World Health Organization, GBM occurs with an incidence
of 3.17 per 100,000 person-years. Approximately 15,000 new cases of GBM are expected to be diagnosed in the United States during
2016.  

GBM
progresses quickly and patients deteriorate rapidly. Common symptoms include headaches, seizures, nausea, weakness, paralysis
and personality or cognitive changes such as loss of speech or difficulty in thinking clearly. The majority of GBM patients do
not survive for more than two years following diagnosis, and the median survival in newly diagnosed patients with best available
treatments is less than 15 months.  

Standard
treatment following diagnosis includes surgical resection to remove as much of the tumor as possible ( debulking )
followed by radiotherapy with concomitant and adjuvant chemotherapy with Temodar  (temozolomide  TMZ ). Nearly
all patients diagnosed with GBM will relapse following first-line treatment, with a 1-year survival rate of approximately 25%
following failure of front-line therapy, with an average 5-year survival rate less than 3%.  

Avastin 
(bevacizumab, an anti-VEGF antibody) is approved as a single agent for patients with recurrent GBM following prior therapy as
an alternative to corticosteroids to relieve disease symptoms in the US, Canada, Australia and Japan. Avastin  carries a  black-box
warning  related to severe, sometimes fatal, side effects such as gastrointestinal perforations, wound healing complications
and hemorrhage. There are no data demonstrating an improvement in disease-related symptoms or increased survival in refractory
GBM with Avastin .  

TMZ and the nitrosoureas, including carmustine, lomustine,
and nimustine, are alkylating agents that readily cross the blood-brain-barrier and are used in the treatment of CNS cancers, including
GBM. Alkylating agents are among the oldest type of cancer chemotherapies in use today. Alkylating agents bind to DNA to cause
damage to cancer cells. Their anti-tumor mechanism is via alkylation of DNA resulting in base-pair mismatch or strand-mediated
cross links between base pairs. The DNA damage caused by alkylating agents mimics naturally occurring errors, resulting in apoptosis
and tumor cell death. 

The primary anti-cancer mechanism of TMZ and the nitrosoureas
is to attack the tumor s DNA via alkylation of the O 6 -position of the DNA base residue, guanine. TMZ treatment
causes DNA damage mainly by methylation at the O 6 -position of guanine resulting in guanine-thymine base pair mismatches
during replication. Nitrosoureas mediate their cytotoxic effect by methylation at the O 6 -position of guanine which produces
a cross-link to cytosine residues resulting in double-strand DNA breaks during mitosis. 

A
majority of GBM patients  tumors are resistant to TMZ or nitrosourea therapy due to high expression of a naturally occurring
enzyme called O 6 -DNA methylguanine methyl-transferase ( MGMT ) enzyme which repairs O 6 -guanine
lesions. MGMT repair in turn inhibits the activity of TMZ and nitrosoureas and allows a patients  GBM tumor to continue
to grow in spite of treatment.  

Consistent
with the importance of its repair activity, high expression of MGMT is strongly correlated with poor patient outcomes. Several
clinical studies have established that MGMT is an important prognostic indicator of response to TMZ and patient survival.  

We have demonstrated that VAL-083 forms inter-strand DNA
cross-links at the N 7  position of guanine   a building block of DNA. VAL-083 is active independent of MGMT which
is highly expressed in approximately 67% of GBM patients and correlated with resistance to temozolomide, the current front-line
chemotherapy in the treatment of GBM. Of patients tested in the DelMar trial, 84% exhibited high MGMT expression.

promoter = High MGMT Expression and Significantly Shorter Survival)   

VAL-083
in GBM    

VAL-083 is an alkylating agent which readily crosses the
blood-brain-barrier. Its primary cytotoxic mechanism, epoxide derived DNA cross-links at the N 7  position of guanine,
is distinct from TMZ or the nitrosoureas. 

Our
research demonstrates that VAL-083 s unique cytotoxic mechanism forms DNA cross-links at the N 7  position of guanine
and retains cytotoxic activity independent of MGMT expression in vitro. We have presented research at peer-reviewed scientific
meetings demonstrating that VAL-083 is active in patient-derived tumor cell lines and cancer stem cells that are resistant to
other chemotherapies. Of particular importance is resistance to Temodar  due to activity of the repair enzyme MGMT, which
results in chemoresistance in many GBM patients. We have presented data demonstrating that VAL-083 is active independent of MGMT
resistance in laboratory studies. VAL-083 has more potent activity against brain tumor cells in comparison to TMZ and overcome
resistance associated with MGMT suggesting the potential to surpass the current standard-of-care in the treatment of GBM.  

A
Summary of Our Data Demonstrating that VAL-083 s Anti-Tumor Mechanism is Distinct from, and can   
  Overcome, MGMT-Related Chemoresistance in the Treatment
of GBM   

In addition, historical NCI clinical trial data and our own
research support the activity of VAL-083 as a potentiator of radiotherapy. Radiotherapy in combination with temozolomide is the
current standard of care in the treatment of glioblastoma. Our research demonstrates that temozolomide and radiotherapy are ineffective
against GBM cells exhibiting a high expression of MGMT, whereas VAL-083 potentiates the tumor-killing effect of radiation in these
cells. Furthermore, the combination of VAL-083 and radiation has been demonstrated to be active against GBM tumor stem cells in
vitro. Tumor stem cells are often resistant to chemotherapy and form the basis for tumor recurrence and metastasis. 

VAL-083 s
more potent activity against brain tumor cells in comparison to TMZ, the ability to overcome MGMT-mediated resistance and activity
against GBM cancer stem cells suggests the potential of VAL-083 to surpass the current standard-of-care in the treatment of GBM.
We believe these data support a potential paradigm shift in the treatment of GBM where VAL-083 would be the chemotherapy of choice
in the treatment of the majority of GBM patients whose tumors are known to express MGMT and other factors correlated with resistance
to temozolomide or whose tumors become resistant to temozolomide over time.  

VAL-083 s activity in GBM has been established in historical
NCI-sponsored clinical studies as chemotherapy in the treatment of newly diagnosed and recurrent brain tumors and other cancers.
In general, tumor regression in brain cancer was achieved following therapy in greater than 40% of patients treated and stabilization
was achieved in an additional 20% to 30%. In published clinical studies VAL-083 has previously been shown to have a statistically
significant impact on median survival in high grade glioma brain tumors when combined with radiation versus radiation alone with
results similar or superior to other chemotherapies approved for use in GBM (p value =  0.05). 

A
Summary of Published Data adapted from Separate Sources Comparing the Efficacy of VAL-083    

   and
Other Therapies in the Treatment of GBM   

Additional
support for the differentiated profile of VAL-083 and TMZ comes from the results of studies with GBM cancer stem cells ( CSCs ).
GBM CSCs display strong resistance to TMZ, even where MGMT expression is low. However, our data demonstrates that GBM CSCs are
susceptible to VAL-083 independent of MGMT expression.  

Based
on historical data and our own research, we believe that VAL-083 has the potential to offer physicians and patients a new paradigm
in the treatment of GBM that will address significant unmet medical needs. In addition, the profile of VAL-083 offers the potential
of additive or synergistic benefit as a future combination therapy with existing chemotherapeutic agents or novel vaccines or
immunotherapy approaches currently under investigation.  

Interim
Phase I/II Results in Refractory GBM   

We
filed an investigational new drug ( IND ) application with the FDA and initiated human clinical trials with VAL-083
as a potential treatment for refractory GBM in 2011. Details of the study are available at http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01478178?term=VAL-083 rank=1)  

Our
clinical trial was a Phase I/II, open-label, single arm dose-escalation study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics
and anti-cancer activity of VAL-083 in patients with refractory GBM. To be eligible for our clinical trial, patients must have
been previously treated for GBM with surgery and/or radiation, if appropriate, and must have failed both bevacizumab (Avastin )
and temozolomide (Temodar ), unless either or both are contra-indicated. Response to treatment with VAL-083 was measured prior
to each treatment cycle.  

The
overall goal of our Phase I/II clinical trial was to determine a modernized dosing regimen for advancement into a registration
directed clinical trial. The Phase I portion of the study involved dose escalation cohorts until a maximum tolerated dose ( MTD )
was established in the context of modern care. A further 14-patient Phase II expansion was then enrolled at the MTD to gather
further safety data at our chosen therapeutic dose and to further explore the outcomes in this patient population.  

Forty-eight
(48) GBM patients were enrolled in our Phase I/II clinical trial at five centers: the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, the
Brain Tumor Center at University of California, San Francisco, the Sarah Cannon Cancer Research Center in Nashville, Tennessee,
Denver, Colorado, and the SCRI affiliate site at the Florida Cancer Specialist Research Institute in Sarasota, Florida.  

We
reported the results of our Phase I/II clinical trial at the 2016 ASCO annual meeting. In summary, these data are as follows:  

Pharmacokinetics    

Pharmacokinetic
( PK ) analyses showed dose-dependent linear systemic exposure with a short (1-2h) plasma terminal half-life; average
Cmax at 40 mg/m 2 /day was 781 ng/mL (5.3 M). The observed PK profile is comparable to published literature. Prior
NCI-sponsored studies demonstrated that VAL-083 readily crosses the blood brain barrier and has a long ( 20 hour) half-life
in the central nervous system ( CNS ).  

We
believe that this PK profile is optimal for the treatment of brain tumors: A long CNS half-life is expected to maximize exposure
of the drug in the brain increasing the likelihood of successful treatment outcomes, while a short plasma half-life is desirable
to minimize systemic side effects.  

Observed
pharmacokinetics from VAL-083 Phase 1 clinical trial dose vs. AUC   

Based
on observed and previously published pharmacokinetics, DelMar believes that therapeutic doses equal to, or above, 20 mg/m 2
 daily on days 1, 2 and 3 of a 21-day cycle should deliver sufficient levels of VAL-083 to brain tumors to achieve a therapeutic
benefit.  

Safety
and Tolerability    

In
the Phase I dose escalation regimen, no serious adverse events ( SAE ) related to VAL-083 were encountered at doses
up to 40 mg/m 2 /day.  

Increasing
frequency of, and higher grade, hematologic toxicities were observed at doses above 40 mg/m 2 /day. Consistent with the
published literature, the observed dose limiting toxicity for VAL-083 is primarily thrombocytopenia (low platelets). Observed
platelet nadir occurred at approximately day 18, and recovery was rapid and spontaneous following treatment.  

Based
on Phase I observations, fourteen additional patients were enrolled in a Phase II expansion cohort at 40mg/m 2 , which
was established at the MTD. Consistent with Phase I, the dose of VAL-083 of 40 mg/m 2  on days 1, 2 and 3 of a 21-day
cycle was generally well tolerated in Phase II. At this dose, one subject previously treated with CCNU, a nitrosourea agent, reported
severe (Grade 4) thrombocytopenia. As a result of this observation, the protocol inclusion criterion for platelet count was increased
from 100,000/ L to 150,000/ L for patients receiving prior nitrosoureas within 12 weeks preceding enrollment. No other dose
limiting toxicities were observed in Phase II.  

VAL-083
Safety Observations From Phase I/II Clinical Trial   

Based
on these data, we believe that the 40mg dose is the optimal dose to advance into registration-directed Phase III clinical trials
as it maximizes the amount of drug that can be delivered to the tumor while minimizing untoward toxicity.  

Doses
Achieved    

We
confirmed that we achieved doses of VAL-083 that are substantially higher than were utilized in the original published NCI-sponsored
clinical trials. A summary in comparison to the NCI s historical regimen is as follows:  

Daily
x 5 q 5wks refers to a dosing regimen of once per day for fsing regimen of once per day for three consecutive days every three weeks (21-day cycleive consecutive days every five weeks (35-day cycle); while daily x
3 q 3wks refers to a do).   

Our
optimized dosing regimen increases the amount of VAL-083 delivered to the CNS by 60% over historical regimens without increased
toxicity. Thus, the DelMar regimen achieves both a higher maximum concentration and higher overall exposure, which we believe
may increase the likelihood of successful treatment outcomes in glioblastoma and other brain tumors.  

Tumor
Response and Outcomes    

GBM
patients in our Phase I/II clinical trial were not re-resected prior to treatment with VAL-083 and therefore had a growing recurrent
GBM tumor at the time of enrollment. Patients were monitored for tumor response by MRI.  

Consistent
with un-resected refractory GBM, median progression free survival ( PFS ) was short at 1.2 months (range: 0.2  
20.1 months). Five GBM patients treated with VAL-083 were reported to have stable disease as their best response following treatment;
the remainder reported progressive disease.  

Disease progression is typical in a refractory GBM population
with non-resected tumors. However, we believe that slowed progression may provide meaningful clinical benefit in this patient population
through prolonged overall survival and improved quality of life. 

Ad-hoc
subgroup analysis of the Phase I dose-escalation data indicated a dose response trend. Increased survival was observed following
initiation of treatment in a high dose (30 and 40mg/m 2 ) sub-group vs. a low dose ( 5mg/m 2 ) sub-group.  

Observed
Survival Based on Sub-Group Analysis   

According
to published literature, GBM patients failing bevacizumab have a poor prognosis with expected survival under five months. To date,
more than half of patients receiving an assumed therapeutic dose of VAL-083 ( 20mg/m 2 ) have survived more than six
months following bevacizumab failure; more than 40% have survived for nine months or are currently alive, and more than 20% have
survived for twelve months or are currently alive with median survival of 8.35 months following bevacizumab failure.  

ASCO
2016: VAL-083 compared to published literature   

While
recognizing that our data are representative of a relatively small, non-controlled Phase I/II clinical trial, we believe these
outcomes support the potential of VAL-083 to offer meaningful clinical benefit to GBM patients who have failed bevacizumab, compared
to currently available therapy. We plan to further investigate these results in a randomized pivotal Phase III clinical trial.  

MGMT
  IDH1    

High
expression of DNA repair protein MGMT and wild-type form of the enzyme isocitrate dehydrogenase ( IDH1 ) have been
correlated with poor outcomes in GBM.  

The
methylation status of the MGMT promoter was characterized by PCR and/or ELISA for nineteen GBM patients enrolled in DelMar s
trial: IDH1 status was reported in eleven patients; both MGMT and IDH1 status were reported in four patients. Of patients tested,
84% exhibited high MGMT and 90% were wild-type IDH1. All patients whose samples were tested for both markers were MGMT unmethylated
by PCR and wild-type IDH1, a genotype that is correlated with particularly poor prognosis.  

MGMT
and IDH-1 have been previously shown to be diagnostic markers that correlate with resistance to currently available therapies
(e.g. temozolomide) and GBM patient outcomes. Measurement of these biomarkers has become routine in clinical practice. While the
science behind their importance in the disease pathway and their ultimate predictive value are still being explored, we believe
we will ultimately be able to use these markers in a prognostic fashion to select the patients most likely to respond to treatment
as we expand the clinical development of VAL-083.  

For
example, we have previously demonstrated that VAL-083 s anti-tumor mechanism is active independent from the MGMT status
in vitro. We can therefore utilize the measurement of MGMT to identify newly diagnosed GBM patients who are least likely to respond
to temozolomide. We believe that employing this strategy will allow us to focus our development and commercialization efforts
on GBM patients with the greatest unmet medical need.  

Additional
Planned Clinical Trials in GBM   

Registration-directed
Phase III Trial in Refractory GBM    

In May 2016, we held an end of Phase II meeting with the
FDA where design of a registration-directed clinical program for VAL-083 in refractory GBM was discussed. Based on input we received
from the FDA, the agency confirmed that it would consider the totality of data available, including data obtained from DelMar's
other planned clinical trials in related GBM populations, when assessing the New Drug Application ( NDA ). The FDA
also noted that DelMar can rely on prior NCI studies and historical literature to support non-clinical data required for an NDA
filing and that DelMar will have the option to file under a 505(b)(2) strategy which allows a sponsor to rely on already established
safety and efficacy data in support of an NDA. 

DelMar's
advanced development program will feature a single, randomized Phase III study measuring survival outcomes compared to a  physicians'
choice  control, which, if successful, would serve as the basis for an NDA submission for VAL-083. The control arm will consist
of a limited number of salvage chemotherapies currently utilized in the treatment of Avastin -failed GBM. The final pivotal
trial design will be confirmed with the FDA following further discussions with the Company's clinical advisors.  

Based
on historical development of other products in GBM, we believe that the FDA may grant Breakthrough Therapy, Fast Track, Accelerated
Approval and/or Priority Review status to VAL-083 for the treatment of refractory GBM. Breakthrough Therapy, Fast Track, Accelerated
Approval and Priority Review are expedited drug development designations established by the FDA that are intended to make therapeutically
important drugs available at an earlier time. Receiving such a designation would not only highlight the importance of VAL-083
to GBM patients but could also optimize its regulatory timeline and commercial availability.  

Data from our planned registration-directed Phase III trial
will form the basis of our application for FDA approval. Based on our current financial resources, initiation of the registration-directed
trial will require additional funding to support the expanded clinical operations necessary to conduct and manage the study. Subject
to guidance from the FDA, and availability of funding, we plan to initiate a registration-directed Phase III study as soon as practicable. 

Phase
II Trial in Newly Diagnosed GBM    

Based on our data supporting a unique cytotoxic mechanism
for VAL-083, we believe that this agent may be a potentially superior alternative to currently approved chemotherapies used in
the treatment of newly diagnosed GBM patients whose tumors express features, such as high expression of MGMT, that make them unlikely
to respond to currently available chemotherapy such as temozolomide. 

We
plan to conduct a single arm open-label Phase II study in newly diagnosed GBM patients whose tumors exhibit high-expression of
MGMT. In this study, VAL-083 will be combined with radiotherapy as a potential replacement for temozolomide in patients with high
expression of MGMT. The main goal of the trial will be to confirm the safety of DelMar s optimized dosing regimen in combination
of radiotherapy and to investigate outcomes of the combination therapy in GBM patients with high expression of MGMT. The trial
will be conducted at Sun Yat Sen University in Guangzhou China in collaboration with our partner in China, Guangxi Wuzhou Pharmaceutical
Group Co. Ltd. (Guangxi Wuzhou Pharma), who will provide funding for the trial. Sun Yat Sen University has completed scientific
review and our protocol has been approved by its independent ethics committee. We plan to initiate this clinical trial subject
to finalization of contractual obligations between DelMar, Guangxi Wuzhou Pharma and Sun Yat Sen University.  

Phase
II Study in First Recurrence of GBM in Collaboration with University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center    

In
January 2016, we entered into a collaboration with MD Anderson to accelerate the clinical development of VAL-083 for the treatment
of GBM. As part of the collaboration, MD Anderson will initiate a Phase II clinical study with VAL-083 in patients with GBM at
first recurrence/progression, prior to Avastin  (bevacizumab) exposure. MGMT promoter methylation status will be used as a
validated biomarker for enrollment and tumors must exhibit an un-methylated MGMT promoter for patients to be eligible for the
trial and patients eligible for the study will have recurrent GBM characterized by a high expression of MGMT.  

The primary endpoint of this trial with be overall survival
in comparison to historical data. The protocol has received Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) approval, and, subject
to finalization of contracts between DelMar and MD Anderson, the study. The Company expects to conduct a site initiation visit
and commence enrollment of patients in the coming weeks. 

Accurexa
Collaboration   

The
Company has entered into a collaboration agreement with Accurexa, Inc. ( Accurexa ). Accurexa is a biotechnology company
focused on developing novel neurological therapies to be directly delivered into specific regions of the brain. Under the terms
of the agreement, the Company and Accurexa will undertake collaborative research activities for the purpose of evaluating formulations
of VAL-083 and one or more of temozolomide and BCNU for local delivery. Under the terms of the agreement, DelMar will supply VAL-083
and Accurexa will conduct experiments related to the development and validation of a novel formulation for the combined local
delivery of VAL-083 and temozolomide. DelMar has been granted an exclusive right to license or acquire any product candidates
and related intellectual property that results from research conducted under the agreement for further development and commercialization
on an exclusive world-wide basis, or other terms that may be agreed upon between DelMar and Accurexa. The initial financial commitment
by DelMar is not significant.  

Other
Indications for VAL-083   

Central
Nervous System Metastases of Solid Tumors    

In
June 2013, we announced a plan to split our Phase I/II clinical trial protocol into two separate studies: one focusing solely
on refractory GBM and the other focusing on secondary brain cancers caused by other tumors that have spread to the brain. The
successful management of systemic tumors by modern targeted therapies has led to increased incidence of mortality due to CNS metastases
of lung cancer and other solid tumors.  

Based
on historical clinical activity and our own research, we believe that VAL-083 may be suitable for the treatment of patients with
CNS metastases who currently have limited treatment options. Subject to the availability of financial and operating resources,
we plan to develop a separate protocol for the continued exploration of VAL-083 in patients with secondary brain cancer caused
by a solid tumor spreading to the brain.  

VAL-083
in Lung Cancer    

Lung
cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality around the world and effective treatment for lung cancer remains a significant
global unmet need despite advances in therapy. In general, prognosis for lung cancer patients remains poor, with a 5-year survival
rate of less than 14% among males and less than 18% among females in most countries. Globally, the market for lung cancer treatment
may exceed $7 billion by 2019 according to a report published by Transparency Market research.  

Non-small
cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) is the most common type of lung cancer. There are three common forms of NSCLC: adenocarcinomas
are often found in an outer area of the lung; squamous cell carcinomas are usually found in the center of the lung next to an
air tube (bronchus); and large cell carcinomas, which can occur in any part of the lung and tend to grow and spread faster than
adenocarcinoma. NSCLC accounts for 85% of all lung cancer cases in the United States and approximately 90% of lung cancer cases
diagnosed in China.  

Smoking
is the most important risk factor in the development of lung cancer. According to the World Cancer Report (2008), 21% of cancer
deaths are related to smoking, especially lung cancer. Additionally, high levels of air pollution have been implicated as significant
causes of lung cancer. Incidence of lung cancer in the United States is approximately 59 per 100,000 with the majority (52:100,000)
being NSCLC.  

According
to The Nationwide Nutrition and Health Survey (2002), China has the world s largest smoking population, with a smoking rate
of 24.0% on average (50.2% for men and 2.8% for women), and a total number of 350 million smokers. The World Health Organization
reports that the incidence of lung cancer in China is 34 per 100,000 population. However, some estimates are much higher exceeding
120 per 100,000 population for males aged 55-60 in urban areas.  

According
to a survey conducted by the Chinese Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Science and Technology, smoking, poor diet, water
pollution and environmental problems have caused the nation's cancer death rate to rise 80 percent in the past 30 years and cancer
is now accountable for 25 percent of all urban deaths and 21 percent of all rural deaths. Based on these trends, the World Health
Organization projects that the incidence of lung cancer in China is expected to exceed one million (1,000,000) new cases per year
by 2025.  

The
activity of VAL-083 against solid tumors, including lung cancer, has been established in both pre-clinical and human clinical
trials conducted by the NCI. VAL-083 has been approved by the CFDA for the treatment of lung cancer. However, sales of VAL-083
in China have been limited by a lack of modern data, poor distribution, and preference for targeted therapies such as tyrosine
kinase inhibitors ( TKIs ) in the modern era.  

The
current standard of care for newly diagnosed NSCLC is platinum-based combination therapy or TKI therapy for patients whose cancer
exhibits epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) mutations. Patients exhibiting EGFR mutations have shown an initial
response rate to TKIs which exceeds the response rate for conventional chemotherapy. However, TKI resistance has emerged as an
important unmet medical need.  

We
believe VAL-083 s unique bi-functional alkylating mechanism of action could make it a valuable drug of choice in NSCLC patients
who are or become resistant to TKI therapy. In addition, VAL-083 readily crosses the blood brain barrier suggesting that it may
be possible for VAL-083 to treat patients whose lung cancer has spread to the brain.  

Based
on these beliefs, we have acquired certain commercial rights to VAL-083 in China where it is approved for the treatment of lung
cancer. We have begun to establish a strong scientific and clinical rationale to support the development of VAL-083 as a potential
treatment for NSCLC.  

We
plan to work with leading oncologists to develop new clinical and non-clinical data which will demonstrate the clinical utility
of VAL-083 in NSCLC patients who are resistant to TKIs. We believe this strategy will result in sales growth for VAL-083 in China
and generate future revenue for the Company through sales and marketing partnerships as well as position VAL-083 for global development
in lung cancer.  

We have announced results of pre-clinical studies designed
to evaluate the activity of VAL-083 in  in vivo  models of drug-resistant NSCLC in comparison to cisplatin. In an established
murine xenograft model of NSCLC, the activity of VAL-083 was compared to standard platinum-based therapy with cisplatin against
human NSCLC cell lines A549 (TKI-sensitive) and H1975 (TKI-resistant). In the study, VAL-083 demonstrated superior efficacy and
safety in the treatment of TKI-susceptible (A549) tumors and in TKI-resistant (H1975) tumors. Specifically, 

Treatment
    of TKI-sensitive (A549) NSCLC with 3 mg/kg of VAL-083 resulted in tumor growth delay of 26 days compared to untreated controls.
    Cisplatin (5 mg/kg) resulted in tumor growth delay of just four days. In addition, mean tumor volume on day 68 was significantly
    reduced in animals treated with 3 mg/kg VAL-083 (p=0.001) compared to untreated controls, and   

Treatment
    of TKI-resistant (H1975) NSCLC with 4 mg/kg of VAL-083 resulted in a statistically significant reduction in tumor volume (p=0.01)
    versus untreated control after 27 days. In the same model, treatment with 5 mg/kg of cisplatin failed to achieve statistically
    significant reduction in tumor volume (p=0.23) versus untreated control after 27 days. Longer-term safety assessments are
    ongoing in this model.   

In
April 2016, we presented new non-clinical data at the AACR annual meeting. We reported that VAL-083:  

induces
    apoptosis independent of p53 status, and appears to have a distinct mode of action from platinum-based chemotherapies widely
    used in the treatment of NSCLC and ovarian cancer;   

demonstrated
    an ability to circumvent cisplatin-resistance in all ovarian cell lines tested;   

was
    active against NSCLC tumors harboring T790M, p53 and/or KRAS mutations, known to confer resistance to currently available
    therapies; and   

demonstrated
    super-additivity or synergy in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy.   

These
data demonstrated that VAL-083 s mechanism is distinct from platinum-based chemotherapy, the current standard of care for
NSCLC. VAL-083 retains its high level of anti-cancer activity in p53 mutated NSCLC cell lines compared to cisplatin or oxaliplatin.  

The
p53 gene plays a central role in the protection of the human body from cancer and is responsible for initiating the process of
programmed cell death, or apoptosis, which directs a cell to commit suicide if it becomes damaged or cancerous. The p53 pathway
is also integral to the activity of many chemotherapy drugs. p53 is frequently mutated in NSCLC and p53 mutations are highly correlated
with resistance to chemotherapy and poor patient outcomes in NSCLC.  

In
November 2015 at the AACR-NCI-EORTC International Conference on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics we presented data on
the benefit of VAL-083 in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy regimens in the treatment of NSCLC. The results of the
study presented provide support for VAL-083 as a viable treatment option for NSCLC patients who fail to respond to standard-of-care
platinum-based therapy or TKI therapy, and support potential therapeutic benefits of a VAL-083 along with platinum combination
regimens in newly diagnosed patients. We demonstrated that the combination of VAL-083 with either cisplatin or oxaliplatin demonstrated
a superadditive (synergistic) effect against NSCLC cell lines, including those resistant to TKI therapy in vitro.  

These
results may have immediate implications in the treatment of NSCLC in China where VAL-083 is approved as a chemotherapy for the
treatment of lung cancer. The data also support exploring future clinical development of VAL-083 as a lung cancer therapy in the
rest of the world thereby providing DelMar with a potential opportunity to expand our clinical development focus beyond glioblastoma.  

As
a next step in the investigation of VAL-083 as a potential treatment for NSCLC, we have developed a protocol for a post-market
clinical study to be conducted by a leading cancer clinician in the context of the current approval in China.  

We
plan to conduct this trial in collaboration with Guangxi Wuzhou Pharmaceutical Group Co. Ltd. (Guangxi Wuzhou Pharma). Under the
terms of our collaboration agreement with Guangxi Wuzhou Pharma, we are responsible for establishing protocols for and conducting
clinical trials and Guangxi Wuzhou Pharma is responsible for the costs associated with clinical trials conducted in China. Our
goal is to initiate this clinical trial as soon as practicable with the aim of developing new data to support product growth in
China and to establish clinical proof of concept to expand our drug development efforts with VAL-083.  

Conducting
this clinical trial in China under our collaboration agreement with Guangxi Wuzhou Pharma will allow us to enhance the potential
value of VAL-083 without significantly increasing our own planned cash expenditures. We also believe that these new data will
support the potential to establish global partnerships and collaborations with larger pharmaceutical companies who have the resources
and commercial infrastructure to effectively develop and commercialize VAL-083 as a treatment for NSCLC on a world-wide basis.  

VAL-083
in Pediatric Brain Cancers    

In
November 2015 at AACR s - Advances in Pediatric Research: From Mechanisms and Models to Treatment and Survivorship we presented
data indicating that VAL-083 offers potential therapeutic alternatives in the treatment of pediatric brain tumors. In March, 2016
the FDA Office of Orphan Products Development (OOPD) granted orphan drug designation for VAL-083 in the treatment of medulloblastoma.  

VAL-083
in Ovarian Cancers    

We
have been researching the potential of VAL-083 as a treatment for ovarian cancer in collaboration with researchers at MD Anderson
Cancer Center. In October 2015 at the AACR s Advances in Ovarian Cancer Research: Exploiting Vulnerabilities Conference
and in September 2016, we presented additional data at the 11 th  Biennial Ovarian Cancer Research Symposium on this
collaboration. These data demonstrate the effectiveness of VAL-083 against cisplatin-resistant ovarian cancers and raise the potential
for VAL-083 as a treatment for ovarian cancers as a single-agent against platinum-resistant tumors or in combination with platinum-based
chemotherapeutic regimens or in combination with PARP inhibitors. In April, 2016 the FDA OOPD also granted orphan drug designation
for VAL-083 in the treatment of ovarian cancer.  

We
plan to work with our advisors to develop a strategy to advance VAL-083 into clinical trials for the treatment of ovarian cancer,
either as a single-agent or as in combination with other approved agents.  

Additional
Indications   

In
historical studies sponsored by the NCI in the United States, VAL-083 exhibited clinical activity against a range of tumor types
including central nervous system tumors, solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. VAL-083 is approved in China for the treatment
of CML and lung cancer. We have established new non-clinical data supporting the activity of VAL-083 in different types of cancer
that are resistant to modern targeted therapies and we believe that the unique cytotoxic mechanism of VAL-083 may provide benefit
to patients in a range of indications. We intend to continue to research these opportunities, and if appropriate, expand our clinical
development efforts to include additional indications.

Reverse
Stock Split   

On
May 16, 2016, the Company filed a Certificate of Change with the Secretary of State of Nevada that effected a 1-for-4 reverse
stock split of its common stock. The reverse split became effective on May 20, 2016. All warrants, stock options, conversion ratios,
and per share information in the consolidated condensed financial statements and management discussion and analysis give retroactive
effect to this 1-for-4 reverse stock split. The Company s authorized and issued preferred stock was not affected by the
split. However, the common stock conversion ratio on the Company s Series B preferred shares was adjusted as a result of
the reverse stock split.  

Outstanding
Securities   

As
of November 9, 2016, the Company has 10,421,112 shares of common stock issued and outstanding,1,014,011 shares of common stock
issuable upon exchange of the Exchangeable Shares of Exchangeco (which entitle the holder to require Exchangeco to redeem (or,
at the option of the Company or Callco, to have the Company or Callco purchase) the Exchangeable Shares, and upon such redemption
or purchase to receive an equal number of shares of common stock of the Company) (the Exchangeable Shares are recognized on an
as-exchanged for common stock basis for financial statement purposes), outstanding warrants to purchase 4,505,852 shares of common
stock, 889,863 outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock that are convertible into 2,224,667 shares of common stock, and
outstanding options to purchase 856,250 shares of common stock. All Exchangeable Shares, warrants, and options are convertible
or exercisable into one share of common stock. Each Series B convertible preferred share is convertible into 2.5 shares of common
stock.  

Related
Parties   

The
Company acquired its initial patents and technology rights from Valent Technologies, LLC, ( Valent ), an entity owned
by Dr. Dennis Brown, the Company s Chief Scientific Officer and Director. As a result Valent is a related party to the Company.   

The
following related party transactions and balances have been entered into by the Company.  

Pursuant
to consulting agreements with the Company s officers the Company recognized a total of $120,000 (2015 - $120,000) in compensation
expense during the three months ended September 30, 2016.  

The
Company recognized $45,000 (2015 - $41,750) in directors  fees during the three months ended September 30, 2016.  

At
September 30, 2016, there is an aggregate amount of $76,431 (June 30, 2016 - $43,444) owed to the Company s officers and
directors for fees and expenses.  

For
each of the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 the Company recorded $2,089 related to the dividend payable on the
Series A Preferred Stock held by Valent.  

Derivative
Liability   

The
Company has issued common stock purchase warrants. Based on the terms of certain of these warrants the Company determined that
the warrants were a derivative liability which is recognized at fair value at the date of the transaction and re-measured at fair
value each reporting period with the changes in fair value recorded in the consolidated condensed statement of loss and comprehensive
loss.  

2013
Investor Warrants    

During
the quarter ended March 31, 2013 the Company issued an aggregate of 3,281,250 units at a purchase price of $3.20 per unit, for
aggregate gross proceeds of $10,500,000 (the  Private Offering ). Each unit consisted of one share of common stock
and one five-year warrant (the  2013 Investor Warrants ) to purchase one share of common stock at an initial exercise
price of $3.20. The exercise price of the 2013 Investor Warrants was subject to adjustment in the event that the Company issues
common stock at a price lower than the warrant exercise price, subject to certain exceptions. The 2013 Investor Warrants are redeemable
by the Company at a price of $0.004 per 2013 Investor Warrant at any time subject to the conditions that (i) the Company s
common stock has traded for twenty (20) consecutive trading days with a closing price of at least $6.40 per share with an average
trading volume of 50,000 shares per day, and (ii) the underlying shares of common stock are registered.  

As
a result of the financing completed by the Company during the quarter ended September 30, 2015 the exercise price of the 2013
Investor Warrants was reduced from $3.20 to $3.144.  

2013
Investor Warrant exercises   

During
the three months ended September 30, 2016, 42,907 of the 2013 Investor Warrants were exercised for cash at an exercise price of
$3.144 per share. The Company received proceeds of $134,900 from these exercises. The warrants that have been exercised were revalued
at their respective exercise dates and then the reclassification to equity was recorded resulting in $181,008 of the derivative
liability being reclassified to equity.  

2013
Investor Warrant amendments   

During
the year ended June 30, 2016, the Company entered into amendments (the  2013 Investor Warrant Amendments ) with the
holders of certain 2013 Investor Warrants. During the three months ended September 30, 2016 pursuant to the 2013 Investor Warrant
Amendments, 15,944 of the 2013 Investor Warrants were amended to extend the expiration date to March 31, 2019 and remove the provision
requiring an adjustment of the exercise price in the event the Company sells common stock at a purchase price lower than the current
warrant exercise price. As a result of the 2013 Investor Warrant Amendments, the Company has reclassified $53,006 from the derivative
liability to equity. The 2013 Investor Warrants were revalued to their respective amendment dates and were then reclassified to
equity.  

2015
Agent Warrants    

As
part of the Company s financing completed during the quarter ended September 30, 2015, the Company issued 23,477 warrants
to certain placement agents ( 2015 Agent Warrants ) and recognized them as a derivative liability of $29,594 at the
time of issuance. The 2015 Agent Warrants are exercisable at a per share price equal to $3.00 until July 15, 2020. During the
three months ended September 30, 2016, 680 of the 2015 Agent Warrants were exercised for cash proceeds of $2,040 and 1,000 of
the 2015 Agent Warrants were exercised on a cashless basis for 594 shares of common stock. The total reclassification to equity
subsequent to revaluation at the respective exercise dates was $9,935.  

The
Company s derivative liability is summarized as follows:

Comparison
of the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015   

Research
and Development   

Research
and development expenses increased to $732,729 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $603,845 for the three months
ended September 30, 2015. The increase was largely attributable to an increase in intellectual property, pre-clinical research,
and non-cash expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015.
Excluding the impact of non-cash expense, research and development expenses increased to $676,892 during the current quarter from
$597,390 for the prior quarter. For the three months ended September 30, 2016 non-cash expense related to warrants issued for
services and stock option expense while for the three months ended September 30, 2015, non-cash expense related to stock option
expense only. The increase in non-cash expense to $55,837 during the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $6,455 during
the three months ended September 30, 2015 was due to a higher share price in the current period compared to the prior period resulting
in a higher expense due to revaluation.  

Intellectual
property costs increased in the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015 as
the Company continued to expand and advance its patent portfolio. New patents filed in previous periods require on-going costs
to advance those filings in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions. Patent costs can vary considerably depending on the
filing of new patents, conversion of the provisional applications to PCT applications, foreign office actions, and actual filing
costs. Pre-clinical research increased primarily due to an increase in the ongoing mechanism of action research that the Company
has undertaken in the current period.  

General
and Administrative   

General
and administrative expenses were $1,316,639 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $474,025 for the three months
ended September 30, 2015. The increase was primarily due to an increase in professional fees, facilities costs, and non-cash expenses.
In relation to general and administrative expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company incurred non-cash
expenses of $590,225 related to shares and warrants issued for services, and stock option expenses while during the three months
ended September 30, 2015 the Company incurred non-cash expenses relating to warrants issued for services and stock option expense.  

Excluding
the impact of non-cash expenses, general and administrative expenses increased in the three months ended September 30, 2016 to
$726,414 from $433,920 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Professional fees have increased during the three months
ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015 due to costs related to preparing for the Company s
uplisting of its common stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market as well as fees associated with one-time listing activities and filing
three registration statements that were all declared effective in September 2016. Facilities costs have increased in part due
to the initial fees to list our common stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Additional increases in facilities costs relate to expenses
to maintain our digital communications channels for a full quarter in 2016 compared to a partial quarter in 2015.  

Change
in fair value of stock option and derivative liabilities   

Based
on the terms of certain warrants issued by the Company, the Company determined that the warrants were a derivative liability which
is recognized at fair value at the date of the transaction and re-measured at fair value every reporting period with gains or
losses on the changes in fair value recorded in the consolidated condensed statement of loss and comprehensive loss. The balances
recognized during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were primarily due to changes in the Company s common
stock price between the date the warrants were last valued on June 30, 2016 and 2015 respectively which are the valuation dates
used for the quarters ended September 30.  

The
Company recognized a loss of $140,594 from the change in fair value of the derivative liability for the three months ended September
30, 2016.  

For
the three months ended September 30, 2015 the Company recognized a loss of $539,446 due to the change in fair value of the derivative
liability. In addition, the Company recognized a loss of $21,565 which resulted from the change in fair value of the 2013 Investor
Warrants and the 2013 Placement Agent Warrants when their respective exercise prices decreased as a result of the Company issuing
common stock below $3.20 per share due to the financing the Company completed during the quarter ended September 30, 2015.  

Changes
in the Company s common stock price can result in significant volatility in the Company s reported net loss due to
its impact on the fair value of the derivative liability. As a result of revaluation gains and losses, the Company expects that
its reported net income or loss will continue to fluctuate significantly.  

Certain
of the Company s stock options have been issued in CA$. Of these, a portion have been classified as a stock option liability
which is revalued at each reporting date. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recognized a revaluation
loss $85,094 relating to the revaluation of these stock options. During the three months ended September 30 2016, the Company
amended 43,750 of these stock options held by five optionees such that the exercise price of the options was adjusted to be denominated
in US$. No other terms of the stock options were amended. As a result of the amendment, $260,969 was reclassified to equity during
the quarter ended September 30, 2016.  

Foreign
Exchange Gain   

The
Company s functional currency at September 30, 2016 is the US$ but the Company incurs a portion of its expenses in CA$.
The foreign exchange gains and losses are reported in other loss (income) in the consolidated condensed interim statement of loss
and comprehensive loss.  

The
Company recognized a foreign exchange loss of $15,324 for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 compared to a gain of $17,473 for
the quarter ended September 30, 2015. The change was due to changes in the exchange rate between the CA$ and the US$ and to varying
levels of CA$ cash and accounts payable.  

Preferred
Share Dividends   

For
each of the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 the Company recorded $2,089 related to the dividend payable to Valent
on the Series A preferred stock. The dividend has been recorded as a direct increase in accumulated deficit for both periods.  

The
Company issued 50,793 shares of common stock on September 30, 2016 as a dividend on the Series B Preferred stock and recognized
$307,298 as a direct increase in accumulated deficit.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

Three
months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015   

Operating
Activities   

Net
cash used in operating activities increased to $1,613,082 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $1,401,881 for the
three months ended September 30, 2015. During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 the Company reported net losses
of $2,290,339 and $1,621,388 respectively. The loss from the revaluation of the derivative and stock option liabilities was $225,688
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to a loss of $539,446 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Excluding
the impact of changes in the fair value of the derivative and stock option liabilities, non-cash items relating to amortization,
warrants and shares issued for services, and stock option expense totaled $649,920 for the three months ended September 30, 2016.
Non-cash items relating to the loss due to changes in warrant terms, warrants issued for services and stock option expense totaled
$68,125 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The most significant changes in non-cash working capital for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 were cash used in a reduction of accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $178,161, cash used
for an increase in prepaid expenses of $33,208, and cash from an increase in related party payables of $32,987. The most significant
changes in non-cash working capital for the three months ended September 30, 2015 were cash used in a reduction of accounts payable
and accrued liabilities of $389,502, cash used in a reduction of related party payables of $52,046, and cash flow from a decrease
in prepaid expenses of $63,385.  

Financing
Activities   

During
the three months ended September 30, 2016 the Company received $256,940 from the exercise of warrants. During the three months
ended September 30, 2015 the Company received $2,453,633 in net proceeds from the completion of a public offering by the Company
of common stock and common stock purchase warrants. Including deferred costs recorded by the Company at June 30, 2015, the total
net cash proceeds of the offering was $1,903,514.  

In
addition, the Company recorded $2,089 related to the dividend payable to Valent during each of the three months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015 respectively.  

Operating
Capital and Capital Expenditure Requirements   

Liquidity
Risk    

(See
note 1 to the consolidated condensed interim financial statements)  

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company reported a loss of $2,290,339 and an accumulated deficit of $34,837,585
at that date. As at September 30, 2016, the Company had cash and cash equivalents on hand of $4,799,033. The Company does not
have the prospect of achieving revenues in the near future and the Company will require additional funding to maintain its research
and development projects and for general operations. There is a great degree of uncertainty with respect to the expenses the Company
will incur in executing its business plan. In addition, the Company has not begun to commercialize or generate revenues from its
product candidate.  

Consequently,
management is pursuing various financing alternatives to fund the Company s operations so it can continue as a going concern
in the medium to longer term. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company received $256,940 in proceeds from
the exercise of share purchase warrants. During the year ended June 30, 2016 the Company completed a convertible preferred share
private placement for net cash proceeds of $6,540,821 million. We believe, based on our current estimates, that we will be able
to fund our operations beyond the next twelve months.  

There
is no assurance that our cost estimates will prove to be accurate or that unforeseen events, problems or delays will not occur
with respect thereto. The ability of the Company to meet its obligations and continue the research and development of its product
candidate is dependent on its ability to continue to raise adequate financing. There can be no assurance that such financing will
be available to the Company in the amount required at any time or for any period or, if available, that it can be obtained on
terms satisfactory to the Company. The Company may tailor its drug candidate program based on the amount of funding the Company
raises.  

Our
future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including but not limited to:  

the
    rate of progress and cost of our clinical trials, preclinical studies and other discovery and research and development activities;   

the
    costs associated with establishing manufacturing and commercialization capabilities;   

the
    costs of acquiring or investing in businesses, product candidates and technologies;   

the
    costs of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights;   

the
    costs and timing of seeking and obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals;   

the
    effect of competing technological and market developments; and   

the
    economic and other terms and timing of any collaboration, licensing or other arrangements into which we may enter.   

Until
we can generate a sufficient amount of product revenue to finance our cash requirements, which we may never do, we expect to finance
future cash needs primarily through public or private equity offerings, debt financings or strategic collaborations. Although
we are not reliant on institutional credit finance and therefore not subject to debt covenant compliance requirements or potential
withdrawal of credit by banks, economic conditions may affect the availability of funds and activity in equity markets. We do
not know whether additional funding will be available on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are not able to secure additional
funding when needed, we may have to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our clinical trials or research and
development programs or make changes to our operating plan. In addition, we may have to seek a partner for one or more of our
product candidate programs at an earlier stage of development, which would lower the economic value of those programs to us.  

Critical
Accounting Policies    

The
preparation of financial statements, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, requires
companies to establish accounting policies and to make estimates that affect both the amount and timing of the recording of assets,
liabilities, revenues and expenses. Some of these estimates require judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and
therefore actual results may differ from those estimates.  

A
detailed presentation of all of the Company s significant accounting policies and the estimates derived there from is included
in Note 2 to the Company s consolidated financial statements for the year ended June 30, 2016 contained in our Form 10-K
filed with the SEC on September 13, 2016. While all of the significant accounting policies are important to the Company s
consolidated financial statements, the following accounting policies and the estimates derived therefrom have been identified
as being critical:  

Warrants
    and shares issued for services   

Stock
    options   

Derivative
    liability   

Warrants
and shares issued for services   

Periodically,
the Company has issued equity instruments for services provided by employees and nonemployees. The equity instruments are valued
at the fair value of the instrument granted.  

Stock
options   

The
Company accounts for these awards under ASC 718,  Compensation - Stock Compensation  ( ASC 718 ). ASC
718 requires measurement of compensation cost for all stock-based awards at fair value on the date of grant and recognition of
compensation over the requisite service period for awards expected to vest. Compensation expense for unvested options to non-employees
is revalued at each period end and is being amortized over the vesting period of the options. The determination of grant-date
fair value for stock option awards is estimated using the Black-Scholes model, which includes variables such as the expected volatility
of the Company s share price, the anticipated exercise behavior of its grantee, interest rates, and dividend yields. These
variables are projected based on the Company s historical data, experience, and other factors. Changes in any of these variables
could result in material adjustments to the expense recognized for non-cash expenses. Such value is recognized as expense over
the requisite service period, net of estimated forfeitures, using the straight-line attribution method. The estimation of stock
awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from current
estimates, such amounts are recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised. The Company considers many
factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including type of awards granted, employee class, and historical experience. Actual
results and future estimates may differ substantially from current estimates.    

Derivative
liability   

The
Company accounts for certain warrants under the authoritative guidance on accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed
to, and potentially settled in, a company s own stock, on the understanding that in compliance with applicable securities
laws, the warrants require the issuance of securities upon exercise and do not sufficiently preclude an implied right to net cash
settlement. The Company classifies warrants in its balance sheet as a derivative liability which is fair valued at each reporting
period subsequent to the initial issuance. As quoted prices for the derivative liability are not available, the Company uses a
simulated probability valuation model to value the warrants. Determining the appropriate fair-value model and calculating the
fair value of warrants requires considerable judgment. Any change in the estimates used may cause the value to be higher or lower
than that reported. The estimated volatility of the Company s common stock at the date of issuance, and at each subsequent
reporting period, is based on the historical volatility of similar life sciences companies. The risk-free interest rate is based
on rates published by the government for bonds with a maturity similar to the expected remaining life of the warrants at the valuation
date. The expected life of the warrants is assumed to be equivalent to their remaining contractual term.  

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements   

We
do not have any off balance sheet arrangements.

Not
required for a smaller reporting company.  

Item
4.   Controls and Procedures.    

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures   

Management,
with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation (as required by Rule
13a-15 under the Exchange Act) of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and
15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive
Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of the end of
the period covered by this report, due to the material weakness in internal control over financial reporting as discussed in the
Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2016, filed with the SEC on September 12, 2016.  

Changes
in internal controls    

There
have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2016
that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
