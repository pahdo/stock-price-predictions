PETROGRESS, INC.  

  NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (NOT REVIEWED ) 

Note 1 -  Organization   

Petrogress, Inc. (the  Company 
or  Petrogress ) was originally formed in the State of Florida under the name 800 Commerce, Inc. ( 800 Commerce )
on February 10, 2010. The Company was founded for the purpose of marketing credit card processing services on behalf of merchant
payment processing service providers. 

On February 29, 2016, 800 Commerce entered
into a Securities Exchange Agreement (the  SEA ) with an unrelated third party, Petrogres Co. Limited ( Petrogres ),
a Marshall Islands corporation, and its sole shareholder. The Company acquired 100% of Petrogres and its affiliated companies.
As consideration for the acquisition of Petrogres, the Company issued 136,000,000 shares of its common stock, in restricted form,
representing 85% of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company s common stock at closing of the transaction. The SEA
has been accounted for as a reverse acquisition and recapitalization of the Company whereby Petrogres is deemed to be the accounting
acquirer (legal acquiree) and the Company to be the accounting acquiree (legal acquirer).  The accompanying consolidated
financial statements are in substance those of Petrogres and its subsidiaries, with the assets and liabilities, and revenues and
expenses, of the Company being included effective from the date of stock exchange transaction.  The Company is deemed
to be a continuation of the business of Petrogres and its subsidiaries.  Accordingly, the financial position, results
of operations, and cash flows of the Petrogres (accounting acquirer) for all periods presented as if the recapitalization had occurred
at the beginning of the earliest period presented and the operations of the accounting acquiree from the date of stock exchange
transaction. 

As part of the transaction, the sole shareholder
and CEO of Petrogres, Christos Traios, was appointed to the Board of Directors and B. Michael Friedman resigned as an officer and
director. In addition, the Company s Board of Directors (the  Board ) approved an amendment to the Company s
Articles of Incorporation, increasing the authorized capital to 490,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 and 10,000,000
shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001. 

On March 9, 2016, the Company s Board
approved an amendment to the Company s Articles of Incorporation to change the name of the Corporation to Petrogress, Inc. 

Petrogres and its  subsidiaries business
operations includes purchasing, at the scene of mining and extraction, crude oil product to be loaded onto company ships for transport
of product either directly to customers or to independent processing refineries, with the company acting internationally as it
has been in business for seven (7) years. 

Note 2 -  Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies   

Basis of Presentation   

These interim condensed consolidated financial
statements have been prepared on the same basis as the annual financial statements and in the opinion of management, reflect all
adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly the Company's financial position, results
of operations and cash flows for the periods shown. The results of operations for such periods are not necessarily indicative of
the results expected for a full year or for any future period. 

Emerging Growth Company   

We qualify as an  emerging
growth company  under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the  JOBS Act ). Section 107 of the JOBS
Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B)
of the Securities Act of 1933 as amended (the  Securities Act ) for complying with new or revised accounting standards.
As an emerging growth company, we can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise
apply to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents   

The Company considers all highly liquid
investments with an original term of three months or less to be cash equivalents. 

Accounts Receivable   

The Company and its affiliates
are engaged primarily in the purchase, transport and processing of oil and petroleum products. The Company performs ongoing credit
evaluations of its customers' financial condition and, generally, requires no collateral from its customers. Financial instruments
that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of temporary cash investments and trade
accounts receivables. The Company places its temporary cash investments with financial institutions and limits the amount of credit
exposure to any one financial institution. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited due to the
short payment terms dictated by the industry and operating environment. As of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company
had no significant concentrations of credit risk. 

Inventory   

The Company's inventory,
which consists primarily of crude oil purchases on the vessel in transport, is valued at the lower of cost or market using the
mark-to-market method of valuation. 

Marketable Securities   

The Company classifies its marketable securities
as available-for-sale securities, which are carried at their fair value based on the quoted market prices of the securities with
unrealized gains and losses, net of deferred income taxes, reported as accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a separate
component of stockholders  equity. Realized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are included in net earnings
in the period earned or incurred. 

Property and Equipment   

Fixed assets consisted of the following as of
March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

Property and equipment are stated at cost,
and depreciation is provided by use of straight-line methods over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The estimated useful
lives of property and equipment are as follows: 

Vessels  
      15 years   
 
      Office equipment and furniture  
      10 years   
 
      Computer hardware  
      5 years   

Depreciation expense of $165,907 and $165,875
was recorded for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Revenue Recognition   

The Company recognizes revenues after product
is delivered to contracted customer. Product in transit at the end of an accounting period is recorded at an estimated value which
is adjusted upon load certification. The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board
( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 605, Revenue Recognition. ASC 605 requires that the
following four basic criteria are met (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (2) delivery of products and services has
occurred, (3) the fee is fixed or determinable and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. The Company recognizes revenue during
the month in which commissions are earned. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments   

Fair value measurements are determined
under a three-level hierarchy for fair value measurements that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair
value, distinguishing between market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of
the reporting entity ( observable inputs ) and the reporting entity s own assumptions about market participant
assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances ( unobservable inputs ). Fair value
is the price that would be received to sell an asset or would be paid to transfer a liability (i.e., the  exit price )
in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In determining fair value, the Company primarily
uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets ( market
approach ). The Company also considers the impact of a significant decrease in volume and level of activity for an asset
or liability when compared with normal activity to identify transactions that are not orderly. 

The highest priority is given to unadjusted
quoted prices in active markets for identical assets (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level
3 measurements). Securities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair
value measurement. 

The three hierarchy levels are defined
as follows: 

Level 1   Quoted
prices in active markets that is unadjusted and accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities; 

Level 2   Quoted
prices for identical assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in
active markets or financial instruments for which significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly; 

Level 3   Prices
or valuations that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable. 

Credit risk adjustments are applied to
reflect the Company s own credit risk when valuing all liabilities measured at fair value. The methodology is consistent
with that applied in developing counterparty credit risk adjustments, but incorporates the Company s own credit risk as observed
in the credit default swap market. 

The Company's financial instruments consist
primarily of cash, accounts receivable, inventory, marketable securities, accounts payable and accrued expenses and convertible
debt. The carrying amount of the Company s accounts payable approximate fair value to their short term. Marketable securities
are adjusted to fair value each balance sheet date, based on quoted prices; which are considered level 1 inputs (see Note 6). As
of March 31, 2016 the Company s marketable securities were $1,860. The Company s derivative liability is valued using
the level 3 inputs (see Note 7). The estimated fair value is not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company would realize
in a current market exchange or from future earnings or cash flows. 

The following table represents the Company s
financial instruments that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of March 31, 2016 for each fair value hierarchy level: 

The carrying amount of the Company s
accounts payable approximate fair value to their short term. 

Earnings (Loss) Per Share   

The Company reports earnings (loss) per
share in accordance with ASC 260,  Earnings per Share.  Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net income
(loss), after deducting preferred stock dividends accumulated during the period, by the weighted-average number of shares of common
stock outstanding during each period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number
of shares of common stock, common stock equivalents and other potentially dilutive securities outstanding during the period. Potentially
dilutive securities for the periods ended March 31, 2016 includes the Company s outstanding convertible debt that is convertible
into approximately 6,018,760 shares of common stock. 

Accounting for Stock-based Compensation    

The Company accounts for stock awards issued
to non-employees in accordance with ASC 505-50, Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees. The measurement date is the earlier of
(1) the date at which a commitment for performance by the counterparty to earn the equity instruments is reached, or (2) the date
at which the counterparty's performance is complete. Stock awards granted to non-employees are valued at their respective measurement
dates based on the trading price of the Company s common stock and recognized as expense during the period in which services
are provided. 

Use of Estimates   

The preparation of financial statements
in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities
and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues
and expenses during the reported period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

Income Taxes   

The Company accounts for income taxes in
accordance with ASC 740-10, Income Taxes. The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect the estimated future
tax effects, calculated at the tax rate expected to be in effect at the time of realization. The Company records a valuation allowance
related to a deferred tax asset when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of the changes in tax laws and rates of the date of enactment. 

ASC 740-10 prescribes a recognition threshold
that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements and provides guidance on recognition,
measurement, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition issues. The Company
classifies interest and penalties as a component of interest and other expenses. To date, the Company has not been assessed, nor
has the Company paid, any interest or penalties. 

The Company measures and records uncertain
tax positions by establishing a threshold for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected
to be taken in a tax return. Only tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold at the effective date may
be recognized or continue to be recognized. The Company s tax years subsequent to 2010 remain subject to examination by federal
and state tax jurisdictions. 

Comprehensive Income   

The Company has adopted ASC Topic 220,
 Comprehensive Income.  This statement establishes standards for reporting comprehensive income and its components in
a financial statement. Comprehensive income as defined includes all changes in equity (net assets) during a period from non-owner
sources. Items included in the Company s comprehensive loss consist of unrealized losses on available-for-sale securities. 

Note 3    Recent Accounting
Pronouncements   

Accounting standards that have been issued
or proposed by the FASB or other standards-setting bodies that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to
have a material impact on the financial statements upon adoption. 

Note 4    Sales Concentration and Concentration of
Credit Risk   

S     ales
and Accounts Receivable   

Following is a summary of customers who
accounted for more than ten percent (10%) of the Company s revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015 and
the accounts receivable balance as of March 31, 2016: 

Note 5    Marketable Securities   

The Company s
marketable securities consist solely of 600,000 shares of Agritek Holdings, Inc. s ( Agritek ) common stock,
issued to the Company in connection with the Company s formation in 2010. The Company classifies its marketable securities
as available-for-sale securities, which are carried at their fair value based on the quoted market prices of the securities with
unrealized gains and losses, net of deferred income taxes, reported as accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a separate
component of stockholders  equity. Realized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are included in net earnings
in the period earned or incurred. The fair value of the Company s holdings in Agritek s common stock totaled $1,860
as of March 31, 2016. 

The following
summarizes the carrying value of marketable securities as of March 31, 2016: 

Note 6    Convertible Notes
Payable   

Effective with the SEA, Petrogres assumed
and acquired two convertible promissory notes that were issued to Mammoth Corporation ( Mammoth ). Mammoth Note 1 had
a balance of $31,339 and Mammoth Note 2 had a balance of $38,280. Mammoth Note 1 and Mammoth Note 2 are referred to as the Mammoth
Notes. The Mammoth Notes are due September 9, 2016. 

The Company determined that the conversion
feature of the Mammoth Notes represent an embedded derivative since the Notes are convertible into a variable number of shares
upon conversion. Accordingly, the Mammoth Notes were not considered to be conventional debt under EITF 00-19 and the embedded conversion
feature was bifurcated from the debt host and accounted for as a derivative liability. Accordingly, the fair value of these derivative
instruments being recorded as a liability on the consolidated balance sheet with the corresponding amount recorded as a discount
to each Note. Such discount is being amortized from the date of issuance to the maturity dates of the Notes. The change in the
fair value of the liability for derivative contracts are recorded in other income or expenses in the consolidated statements of
operations at the end of each quarter, with the offset to the derivative liability on the balance sheet. The embedded feature included
in the Mammoth Notes resulted in a debt discount of $48,975 on the date the Mammoth Notes were assumed and a derivative liability
of $300,321.

Note 9    Income Taxes   

Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax
effects of operating loss and tax credit carry forwards and temporary differences between carrying amounts of assets and liabilities
for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets,
management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in
which temporary differences representing net future deductible amounts become deductible. Due to the uncertainty of the Company s
ability to realize the benefit of the deferred tax assets, the deferred tax assets are fully offset by a valuation allowance at
March 31, 2016.

and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  

The following discussion and analysis
of the results of operations and financial condition of Petrogres for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, should be
read in conjunction Petrogres s audited financial statements, and the notes to those financial statements that are included
in the Company s Current Report on Form 8-K/A filed with the SEC on May 13, 2016. Our discussion includes forward-looking
statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties, such as our plans, objectives, expectations and
intentions. Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements
as a result of a number of factors, including those set forth under the Risk Factors, Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking
Statements and Business sections on the Company s Form 10-K filed with the SEC on April 19, 2016. We use words such as  anticipate, 
 estimate,   plan,   project,   continuing,   ongoing,   expect,

Three Months Ended March 31, 2016 Compared to the Three
Months Ended March 31, 2015   

Net Sales  

Net sales for the three months ended March
31, 2016 and 2015 were $5,819,056 and $4,624,080, respectively, an increase of $1,194,976 or approximately 25.8%., were comprised
of the following: 

Cost of Sales  

Cost of goods sold for the three months
ended March 31, 2016 and 2015 were $4,206,536 and $3,320,861, respectively, an increase of $885,675, or approximately 26.7%, were
comprised of the following: 

Operating Expenses  

Total operating expenses for the three
months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015 were $1,220,283 and $906,635, respectively, an increase of $313,648, or approximately 34.6%.
The increase in operating expenses is primarily due to higher fleet operating expenses due to the increase of shipments of barrels
from approximately 85,000 in the 2015 period to 88,000 in the 2016 period in addition to the associated increase in management
expenses related thereto. Gas oil sales also increased (more shipments-more expenses), furthermore, as of mid-February a vessel
commenced her annual repairs and maintenance, resulting an additional increase of operating expenses. 

Net Income  

Net income for the years ended March 31,
2016 and 2015 was $464,053 and $376,755, respectively, as a result of the items discussed above. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources   

Liquidity is the ability of a company to
generate funds to support its current and future operations, satisfy its obligations, and otherwise operate on an ongoing basis.
Our net income has been sufficient to meet our working capital requirements for the level of business we are currently experiencing. 

Cash provided by operating activities was
$648,286 for the three months ended March 31, 2016 compared to cash used in operations of $131,521 for the three months ended March
31, 2015. The 2016 activity was a result of net income of $464,053, depreciation expense of $165,907, net changes in assets and
liabilities of $22,624 reduced by a gain in the change in the fair value of derivative liabilities. The 2015 activity was a result
of net income of $376,755 and depreciation and amortization of $165,875 reduced by changes in assets and liabilities of $674,151. 

For the three months ended cash used in
financing activities was $182,340 related the Company s expenditures adding to vessel s value for her maintenance/upgrade. 

Prior to the execution of the SEA (February
29, 2016) the Company paid a dividend to the sole shareholder (at the time of the payment) of $1,800,000. 

For the three months ended March 31, 2016,
cash and cash equivalents decreased by $1,427,312 compared to a decrease of $131,521 for the three months ended March 31, 2015.
Ending cash and cash equivalents at March 31, 2016 was $454,493 compared to $395,135 at March 31, 2015. 

We are not aware of any known trends or
any known demands, commitments or events that will result in our liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way. We are
not aware of any matters that would have an impact on future operations. 

Our liquidity may be negatively impacted
by the significant costs associated with our public company reporting requirements, costs associated with newly applicable corporate
governance requirements, including requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and other rules implemented by the Securities
and Exchange Commission. We expect all of these applicable rules and regulations to significantly increase our legal and financial
compliance costs and to make some activities more time consuming and costly. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

None. 

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  

Not applicable. 

Critical Accounting Policies  

The preparation of financial statements
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( US GAAP ) requires our
management to make assumptions, estimates, and judgments that affect the amounts reported, including the notes thereto, and related
disclosures of commitments and contingencies, if any. We have identified certain accounting policies that are significant to the
preparation of our financial statements. These accounting policies are important for an understanding of our financial condition
and results of operations. Critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition
and results of operations and require management s difficult, subjective, or complex judgment, often as a result of the need
to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Certain accounting
estimates are particularly sensitive because of their significance to financial statements and because of the possibility that
future events affecting the estimate may differ significantly from management s current judgments. We believe the following
critical accounting policies involve the most significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our financial
statements. 

Basis of Presentation   

These interim condensed consolidated financial
statements have been prepared on the same basis as the annual financial statements and in the opinion of management, reflect all
adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly the Company's financial position, results
of operations and cash flows for the periods shown. The results of operations for such periods are not necessarily indicative of
the results expected for a full year or for any future period. The financial statements included herein include the financial position
and results of operations of the following affiliated entities (all incorporated in the Republic of the Marshall Islands): 

Petrogres Co Liited 

 Shiba Ship Management
Ltd. 

 Danae Marine Ltd. 

 Invictus Marine S.
A.  

 Entus Marine Ltd. 

All intercompany balances and transactions
have been eliminated in consolidation. The entities are affiliated through common ownership and control. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents   

The Company considers all highly liquid
investments with an original term of three months or less to be cash equivalents. 

Accounts Receivable   

The Company and its affiliates are engaged
primarily in the purchase, transport and processing petroleum products. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its
customers' financial condition and, generally, requires no collateral from its customers. Financial instruments that potentially
subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of temporary cash investments and trade accounts receivables.
The Company places its temporary cash investments with financial institutions and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one
financial institution. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited due to the short payment terms
dictated by the industry and operating environment. As of March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had no significant
concentrations of credit risk. 

Inventory   

The Company's inventory, which consists
primarily of crude oil purchases on the vessel in transport, is valued at the lower of cost or market using the mark-to-market
method of valuation. 

Property and Equipment   

Fixed assets consisted of the following as of March 31, 2016
and December 31, 2015: 

Property and equipment are stated at cost,
and depreciation is provided by use of straight-line methods over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The estimated useful
lives of property and equipment are as follows: 

Vessels  
      15 years   
 
      Office equipment and furniture  
      10 years   
 
      Computer hardware  
      5 years   

Depreciation expense of $165,907 and $165,875
was recorded for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Revenue Recognition   

The Company recognizes revenues when product
is delivered to contracted customers. Product in transit at the end of an accounting period is recorded at an estimated value which
is adjusted upon load certification. The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board
( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) 605, Revenue Recognition. ASC 605 requires that the
following four basic criteria are met (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (2) delivery of products and services has
occurred, (3) the fee is fixed or determinable and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments   

Fair value measurements are determined
under a three-level hierarchy for fair value measurements that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair
value, distinguishing between market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of
the reporting entity ( observable inputs ) and the reporting entity s own assumptions about market participant
assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances ( unobservable inputs ). Fair value
is the price that would be received to sell an asset or would be paid to transfer a liability (i.e., the  exit price )
in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In determining fair value, the Company primarily
uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets ( market
approach ). The Company also considers the impact of a significant decrease in volume and level of activity for an asset
or liability when compared with normal activity to identify transactions that are not orderly. 

The highest priority is given to unadjusted
quoted prices in active markets for identical assets (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level
3 measurements). Securities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair
value measurement. 

The three hierarchy levels are defined
as follows: 

Level 1   Quoted
prices in active markets that is unadjusted and accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities; 

Level 2   Quoted
prices for identical assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in
active markets or financial instruments for which significant inputs are observable, either directly or indirectly; 

Level 3   Prices
or valuations that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable. 

Credit risk adjustments are applied to
reflect the Company s own credit risk when valuing all liabilities measured at fair value. The methodology is consistent
with that applied in developing counterparty credit risk adjustments, but incorporates the Company s own credit risk as observed
in the credit default swap market. 

The Company's financial instruments consist
primarily of cash, accounts receivable, inventory, marketable securities, accounts payable and accrued expenses and convertible
debt. The carrying amount of the Company s accounts payable approximate fair value to their short term. Marketable securities
are adjusted to fair value each balance sheet date, based on quoted prices; which are considered level 1 inputs (see Note 6). As
of March 31, 2016 the Company s marketable securities were $1,860. The Company s derivative liability is valued using
the level 3 inputs (see Note 7). The estimated fair value is not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company would realize
in a current market exchange or from future earnings or cash flows. 

The following table represents the Company s
financial instruments that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of March 31, 2016 for each fair value hierarchy level: 

The carrying amount of the Company s
accounts payable approximate fair value to their short term. 

Earnings Per Share   

The Company reports earnings per share
in accordance with ASC 260,  Earnings per Share.  Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income, after
deducting preferred stock dividends accumulated during the period, by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding
during each period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of shares of common
stock, common stock equivalents and other potentially dilutive securities outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive securities
for the periods ended March 31, 2016 includes the Company s outstanding convertible debt that is convertible into approximately
6,018,760 shares of common stock. 

Income Taxes   

The Company accounts for income taxes in
accordance with ASC 740-10, Income Taxes. The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect the estimated future
tax effects, calculated at the tax rate expected to be in effect at the time of realization. The Company records a valuation allowance
related to a deferred tax asset when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of the changes in tax laws and rates of the date of enactment. 

ASC 740-10 prescribes a recognition threshold
that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements and provides guidance on recognition,
measurement, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition issues. The Company
classifies interest and penalties as a component of interest and other expenses. To date, the Company has not been assessed, nor
has the Company paid, any interest or penalties. 

The Company measures and records uncertain
tax positions by establishing a threshold for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected
to be taken in a tax return. Only tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold at the effective date may
be recognized or continue to be recognized. The Company s tax years subsequent to 2010 remain subject to examination by federal
and state tax jurisdictions. 

Use of Estimates  

The preparation of financial statements
in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. Actual
results could differ from those estimates. Significant matters requiring the use of estimates and assumptions include, but may
not be limited to, accounts receivable allowances and evaluation of impairment of long lived assets and intangible assets. Management
believes that its estimates and assumptions are reasonable, based on information that is available at the time they are made. 

Depreciation  

The Company s vessels and other assets
are depreciated sing primarily the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives. 

Item 3.      Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk  

Not applicable to smaller reporting companies. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures  

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures
(as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ))
that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our filings under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. This information is accumulated to allow
our management to make timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Our President, who serves as our principal executive officer
and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period
covered by this report and he determined that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of March 31, 2016 due
to a control deficiency. During the period we did not have additional personnel to allow segregation of duties to ensure the completeness
or accuracy of our information. Due to the size and operations of the Company, we are unable to remediate this deficiency until
we acquire or merge with another company. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   

There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation
required by paragraph (d) of Rule 13a-15 or 15d-15 of the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended March 31, 2016 that
have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting. 

Part II.  Other Information   

Item 1 .  Legal
Proceedings  

We are not a party to any material litigation,
nor, to the knowledge of management, is any litigation threatened against us that may materially affect us. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors  

We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2
of the Securities Act of 1934 and are not required to provide the information under this item.
