  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

1. Organization and Business: 
  Throughout this report, the terms "PRA Group," "our," "we," "us," the "Company," or similar terms refer to PRA Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries. 
  PRA Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation, along with its subsidiaries, is a financial and business service company operating in the Americas and Europe. The Company's primary business is the purchase, collection and management of portfolios of nonperforming loans. The Company also services receivables on behalf of clients, provides business tax revenue administration, audit, discovery and recovery services for state and local governments in the United States, and provides class action claims settlement recovery services and related payment processing to corporate clients. 
  The consolidated financial statements of the Company are prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") and include the accounts of all of its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Under the guidance of the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 280 "Segment Reporting" ("ASC 280"), the Company has determined that it has several operating segments that meet the aggregation criteria of ASC 280, and, therefore, it has   one   reportable segment, accounts receivable management, based on similarities among the operating units including the nature of the products and services, the nature of the production processes, the types or class of customer for their products and services, the methods used to distribute their products and services and the nature of the regulatory environment. 
  The following table shows the amount of revenue generated for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and long-lived assets held at   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, both for the United States, the Company's country of domicile, and outside of the United States (amounts in thousands): 

Revenues are attributed to countries based on the location of the related operations. Long-lived assets consist of net property and equipment. The Company reports revenues earned from its debt purchasing and collection activities and its fee-based services. It is impracticable for the Company to report further breakdowns of revenues from external customers by product or service. 
  The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") and, therefore, do not include all information and disclosures required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of the Company, however, the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of the Company's consolidated balance sheet as of   September 30, 2016  , its consolidated income statements and statements of comprehensive income/(loss) for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , its consolidated statement of changes in equity for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , and its consolidated statements of cash flows for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  . The consolidated income statements of the Company for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   may not be indicative of future results. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified for consistency with the current period presentation. These unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company's   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed on February 26, 2016.

2. Finance Receivables, net: 
  Changes in finance receivables, net for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were as follows (amounts in thousands): 

(1) 
    Acquisitions of finance receivables are net of buybacks and include certain capitalized acquisition related costs.    
     At the time of acquisition, the life of each pool is estimated based on projected amounts and timing of future cash collections using the proprietary models of the Company. 
  Based upon current projections, cash collections applied to principal on finance receivables as of   September 30, 2016   are estimated to be as follows for the twelve months in the periods ending   September 30,   (amounts in thousands): 

At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had aggregate net finance receivables balances in pools accounted for under the cost recovery method of   $107.8 million  ; at   December 31, 2015  , the amount was   $21.0 million  . 
  Accretable yield represents the amount of income recognized on finance receivables the Company can expect to generate over the remaining life of its existing portfolios based on estimated future cash flows as of the balance sheet date. Additions represent the original expected accretable yield, on portfolios purchased during the period, to be earned by the Company based on its proprietary buying models. Net reclassifications from nonaccretable difference to accretable yield primarily result from the Company's increase in its estimate of future cash flows. When applicable, net reclassifications to nonaccretable difference from accretable yield result from the Company's decrease in its estimates of future cash flows and allowance charges that exceed the Company's increase in its estimate of future cash flows.

Changes in accretable yield for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were as follows (amounts in thousands): 

The following is a summary of activity within the Company's valuation allowance account, all of which relates to loans acquired with deteriorated credit quality, for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   (amounts in thousands): 

3. Investments: 
  Investments consist of the following at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   (amounts in thousands): 

Available-for-Sale  
  Investments in securitized assets  : The Company holds a majority interest in a closed-end Polish investment fund. The fund was formed in December 2014 to acquire portfolios of nonperforming consumer loans in Poland. The Company's investment consists of a   100%   interest in the Series B certificates and a   20%   interest in the Series C certificates. Each certificate comes with   one   vote and is governed by a co-investment agreement. Series C certificates, which share equally in the residual profit of the fund, are accounted for as debt securities classified as available-for-sale and are stated at fair value. Income is recognized using the effective yield method. There was no revenue recorded during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   from this investment. 
  Government bonds and fixed income funds:   The Company's investments in government bonds and fixed income are classified as available-for-sale and are stated at fair value. Fair value is estimated using the net asset value of the investment. Unrealized gains and losses are included in comprehensive income and reported in equity.

Held-to-Maturity 
  Investments in securitized assets  : The Company holds a majority interest in a closed-end Polish investment fund. The certificates, which provide a preferred return based on the expected net income of the portfolios, are accounted for as a beneficial interest in securitized financial assets and stated at amortized cost. The Company has determined it has the ability and intent to hold these certificates until maturity, which occurs when the fund terminates or liquidates its assets. The preferred return is not a guaranteed return. Income is recognized under FASB ASC Topic 325-40, "Beneficial Interest in Securitized Financial Assets" ("ASC 325-40"). Income is recognized using the effective yield method. The Company adjusts the yield for changes in estimated cash flows prospectively through earnings.  
  If the fair value of the investment falls below its carrying amount and the decline is deemed to be other than temporary, the investment is written down, with a corresponding charge to earnings. The underlying securities have both known principal repayment terms as well as unknown principal repayments due to potential borrower pre-payments. Accordingly, it is difficult to accurately predict the final maturity date of these investments. Revenues recognized on these investments are recorded in the Other Revenue line item in the income statement. During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , revenues recognized on these investments were   $1.5 million   and   $4.7 million  , respectively. During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , revenues recognized on these investments were   $1.8 million   and   $4.9 million   respectively. 
  Other Investments 
  Investments in private equity funds  : Investments in private equity funds represent limited partnerships in which the Company has less than a   3%   interest and are carried at cost. Distributions received from the partnerships are included in other revenue. Distributions received in excess of the Company's proportionate share of accumulated earnings are applied as a reduction of the cost of the investment. Distributions received from investments carried at cost were   $0.0 million   and   $0.6 million   during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . Distributions received from investments carried at cost were   $1.9 million   and   $7.0 million   during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
  The amortized cost and estimated fair value of available-for sale and held-to-maturity investments at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   were as follows (amounts in thousands):

  Domestic and Canadian Revolving Credit and Term Loan 
  On December 19, 2012, the Company entered into a credit facility with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, and a syndicate of lenders named therein (such agreement as later amended or modified, the "Credit Agreement"). On March 24, 2016, the Company entered into a Loan Modification Agreement and Seventh Amendment (the  Seventh Amendment ) to the Credit Agreement which (a) extended the maturity date of loans and commitments under the Credit Agreement in an aggregate principal amount of approximately   $745.9 million  , including a   $23.0 million   net increase in the commitments of the extending lenders, to the earlier of December 21, 2020 (the "Notes") or 91 days prior to the maturity of the Company s   3.00%   Convertible Senior Notes due August 1, 2020, (b) modified the accordion feature under the Credit Agreement to allow the Company to request from new and existing lenders up to an additional   $125.0 million   in loans and commitments under the Credit Agreement, (c) increased the credit given in the domestic borrowing base for estimated remaining collections of eligible asset pools, (d) increased the amounts available for permitted investments, equity repurchases and redemptions of the Company s convertible notes, and (e) increased the maximum permitted total leverage consolidated ratio of the Company and its subsidiaries to   2.25   to 1.0. 
  The total credit facility includes an aggregate principal amount of   $953.0 million   (subject to compliance with a borrowing base and applicable debt covenants), which consists of (i) a fully-funded   $155.0 million   term loan, (ii) a   $748.0 million   domestic revolving credit facility, and (iii) a   $50 million   Canadian revolving credit facility. The facility includes an optional increase in commitments for a   $125.0 million   accordion feature (at the option of the lenders) and also provides for up to   $20 million   of letters of credit that would reduce amounts available for borrowing. The facility matures on the earlier of December 21, 2020 or 91 days prior to the maturity of the convertible senior notes. The term and revolving loans accrue interest, at the option of the Company, at either the base rate or the Eurodollar rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) for the applicable term plus   2.50%   per annum in the case of the Eurodollar rate loans and   1.50%   in the case of the base rate loans. The base rate is the highest of (a) the Federal Funds Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus   0.50%  , (b) Bank of America's prime rate, and (c) the Eurodollar rate plus   1.00%  . As of   September 30,   2016, the unused portion of the domestic and Canadian revolving credit facilities was   $90.7 million  . Considering borrowing base restrictions, as of   September 30, 2016  , the amount available to be drawn was   $66.1 million  .

    the Company must maintain positive consolidated income from operations (as defined in the Credit Agreement) during any fiscal quarter; and 
                
    restrictions on changes in control. 
     The revolving credit facility also bears an unused line fee of   0.375%   per annum, payable quarterly in arrears. 
  The Company's outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement at   September 30, 2016   consisted of   $155.0 million   on the term loan with an annual interest rate of   3.02%   and   $707.3 million   on the revolving credit facilities with a weighted average interest rate of   3.04%  . At   December 31, 2015  , the Company's outstanding borrowings on the Credit Agreement consisted of   $170.0 million   on the term loan with an annual interest rate of   2.92%   and   $541.8 million   on the revolving credit facilities with a weighted average interest rate of   2.89%  . 
  Note Payable 
  In conjunction with the closing of the acquisition of Aktiv Kapital AS ("Aktiv") on July 16, 2014, the Company entered into a   $169.9 million   promissory note with an affiliate of the seller. The promissory note bore interest at the three-month London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") plus   3.75%  . On July 18, 2016, the Company paid the entire outstanding principal balance due of   $169.9 million   plus accrued interest.

  On October 23, 2014, the Company entered into a credit agreement with DNB Bank ASA for a Multicurrency Revolving Credit Facility (such agreement as later amended or modified, the "Multicurrency Revolving Credit Agreement").  On February 19, 2016, the Company entered into a Second Amendment to the Multicurrency Revolving Credit Agreement which provided for, (i) the extension of the final repayment date to February 19, 2021, (ii) an increase to the total commitments from   $750 million   to   $900 million  , subject to certain requirements, and (iii) an ERC ratio (as defined in the Multicurrency Revolving Credit Agreement) ranging from   32.2%   to   38.7%   depending on the mix of portfolios owned, subject to the payment of additional associated fees.  
  On September 2, 2016, the Company entered into a Third Amendment and Restatement Agreement to the Multicurrency Revolving Credit Agreement which provided for, (1) increasing the total commitments from   $900 million   to an aggregate of   $1.2 billion   by including a term loan facility of approximately   $300 million  , (2) replacing the estimated remaining collections ratio covenant with a loan-to-value ("LTV") covenant of   75%  , (3) changing the ratio of gross interest bearing debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (as more specifically defined in the Third Amendment) to   3.5  :1.0 until March 31, 2017 and   3.25  :1.0 thereafter, and (4) revising the applicable margin for the interest payable to   2.80%  -  3.90%   under the revolving facility, and   4.25%  -  4.50%   under the term loan facility, dependent on the LTV ratio. 
  Under the terms of the Multicurrency Revolving Credit Agreement, the credit facility includes an aggregate amount of   $1.2 billion   (subject to the borrowing base), of which approximately   $300 million   is a term loan, accrues interest at the Interbank Offered Rate ("IBOR") plus   2.80%  -  3.90%   under the revolving facility and   4.25%  -  4.50%   under the term loan facility (as determined by the LTV Ratio as defined in the Multicurrency Revolving Credit Agreement), bears an unused line fee of   35%   of the margin, currently   1.26%   per annum, payable monthly in arrears, and matures on February 19, 2021. The Multicurrency Revolving Credit Agreement also includes an Overdraft Facility in the aggregate amount of   $40 million   (subject to the borrowing base), which accrues interest (per currency) at the daily rates as published by the facility agent, bears a facility line fee of   0.125%   per annum, payable quarterly in arrears, and also matures February 19, 2021. As of   September 30, 2016  , the unused portion of the Multicurrency Revolving Credit Agreement (including the Overdraft Facility) was   $540.1 million  . Considering borrowing base restrictions and other covenants, as of   September 30, 2016  , the amount available to be drawn under the Multicurrency Revolving Credit Agreement (including the Overdraft Facility) was   $105.9 million  .

The Multicurrency Revolving Credit Agreement is secured by the shares of most of the Company's European subsidiaries and all intercompany loan receivables in Europe. The Multicurrency Revolving Credit Agreement also contains restrictive covenants and events of default including the following: 
             
    the LTV Ratio (as defined in the Multicurrency Revolving Credit Agreement) cannot exceed   75%  ; 
                
    the GIBD Ratio (as defined in the Multicurrency Revolving Credit Agreement) in Europe cannot exceed   3.5   to   1.0   as of the end of any fiscal quarter until March 31, 2017 and   3.25  :1.0 thereafter; 
                 
    Europe's cash collections must exceed   95%   of Europe's ERC for the same set of portfolios, measured on a quarterly basis. 
     At   September 30, 2016  , the outstanding balance on the Multicurrency Revolving Credit Agreement consisted of   $299.3 million   on the term loan with an annual interest rate of   4.25%   and   $399.9 million   on the revolving facility with a weighted average annual interest rate of   4.07%  . At   December 31, 2015  , the outstanding balance on the Multicurrency Revolving Credit Agreement consisted of   $576.4 million   on the revolving facility, with a weighted average annual interest rate of   3.64%  . 
  Convertible Senior Notes 
  On August 13, 2013, the Company completed the private offering of   $287.5 million   in aggregate principal amount of the Company's   3.00%   Convertible Senior Notes (the "Notes"). The Notes were issued pursuant to an Indenture dated August 13, 2013 (the "Indenture") between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee. The Indenture contains customary terms and covenants, including certain events of default after which the Notes may be due and payable immediately. The Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and mature on August 1, 2020. Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually, in arrears, on February 1 and August 1 of each year. Prior to February 1, 2020, the Notes will be convertible only upon the occurrence of specified events. On or after February 1, 2020, the Notes will be convertible at any time. Upon conversion, the Notes may be settled, at the Company's option, in cash, shares of the Company's common stock, or any combination thereof. Holders of the Notes have the right to require the Company to repurchase all or some of their Notes at   100%   of their principal amount, plus any accrued and unpaid interest, upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the Indenture). In addition, upon the occurrence of a make-whole fundamental change (as defined in the Indenture), the Company may, under certain circumstances, be required to increase the conversion rate for the Notes converted in connection with such a make-whole fundamental change. The conversion rate for the Notes is initially   15.2172   shares per   $1,000   principal amount of Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately   $65.72   per share of the Company's common stock, and is subject to adjustment in certain circumstances pursuant to the Indenture. The Company does not have the right to redeem the Notes prior to maturity. As of   September 30, 2016  , none of the conditions allowing holders of the Notes to convert their Notes had occurred. 
  As noted above, upon conversion, holders of the Notes will receive cash, shares of the Company's common stock or a combination of cash and shares of the Company's common stock, at the Company's election. However, the Company's current intent is to settle conversions through combination settlement (i.e  .,   the Notes would be converted     into cash up to the aggregate principal amount, and shares of the Company's common stock or a combination of cash and shares of the Company's common stock, at the Company's election, would be used to settle the remainder). As a result, and in accordance with authoritative guidance related to derivatives and hedging and earnings per share, only the conversion spread is included in the diluted earnings per share calculation, if dilutive. Under such method, the settlement of the conversion spread has a dilutive effect when the average share price of the Company's common stock during any quarter exceeds   $65.72  . 
  The Company determined that the fair value of the Notes at the date of issuance was approximately   $255.3 million  , and designated the residual value of approximately   $32.2 million   as the equity component. Additionally, the Company allocated approximately   $7.3 million   of the   $8.2 million   original Notes issuance cost as debt issuance cost and the remaining   $0.9 million   as equity issuance cost. 
  FASB ASC 470-20, "Debt with Conversion and Other Options" ("ASC 470-20"), requires that, for convertible debt instruments that may be settled fully or partially in cash upon conversion, issuers must separately account for the liability and equity components in a manner that will reflect the entity's nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized in subsequent periods. Additionally, debt issuance costs are required to be allocated in proportion to the allocation of the liability and equity components and accounted for as debt issuance costs and equity issuance costs, respectively.

The following table represents the changes in goodwill for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   (amounts in thousands): 

The   $1.2 million   addition to goodwill during the three months ended   September 30,   2016, was attributable to an immaterial acquisition. The goodwill recognized from this acquisition is expected to be deductible for U.S. income tax purposes. 
    
  The   $28.7 million   addition to goodwill during the   nine months ended     September 30,   2016, was mainly attributable to the acquisition of DTP during the second quarter of 2016 and the acquisition of Recovery Management Systems Corporation ("RMSC") in the first quarter of 2016. The goodwill recognized from the DTP acquisition is not expected to be deductible for U.S. income tax purposes while the goodwill recognized from the RMSC acquisition is expected to be deductible for U.S. income tax purposes. 
   
  7. Share-Based Compensation: 
  The Company has an Omnibus Incentive Plan (the "Plan") to assist the Company in attracting and retaining selected individuals to serve as employees and directors, who are expected to contribute to the Company's success and to achieve long-term objectives that will benefit stockholders of the Company. The Plan enables the Company to award shares of the Company's common stock to select employees and directors, as described in the Plan, not to exceed   5.4 million   shares, as authorized by the Plan.  
  Total share-based compensation expense was   $3.3 million   and   $9.5 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively. Total share-based compensation expense was   $3.9 million   and   $11.5 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively. Tax benefits resulting from tax deductions in excess of cumulative compensation cost and related deferred tax asset recognized under the provisions of FASB ASC Topic 718 "Compensation-Stock Compensation" ("ASC 718"), or windfall tax benefits, are credited to additional paid-in capital in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. Realized tax shortfalls, if any, are first offset against the cumulative balance of windfall tax benefits, if any, and then charged directly to income tax expense.     The total tax benefit realized from share-based compensation was approximately   $0.0 million   and   $2.5 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   $0.1 million   and   $7.9 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively. 
  Nonvested Shares 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , total future compensation costs related to nonvested share awards (not including nonvested shares granted under the Long-Term Incentive ("LTI") Program) is estimated to be   $8.0 million   with a weighted average remaining life for all nonvested shares of   1.6 years   (not including nonvested shares granted under the LTI program). With the exception of the awards made pursuant to the LTI program and a few employee and director grants, the nonvested shares vest ratably over   three   to   five   years and are expensed over the respective vesting period for the awards.

The total grant date fair value of shares vested during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $0.3 million   and   $4.5 million  , respectively. The total grant date fair value of shares vested during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   was   $0.7 million   and   $3.8 million  , respectively. 
  Long-Term Incentive Program 
  Pursuant to the Plan, the Compensation Committee may grant time-vested and performance based nonvested shares. All shares granted under the LTI program were granted to key employees of the Company. 
  The following summarizes all LTI program share transactions from   December 31, 2014   through   September 30, 2016   (share amounts in thousands): 

The total grant date fair value of shares vested during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $0.0 million   and   $6.1 million  , respectively. The total grant date fair value of shares vested during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   was   $0.0 million   and   $5.1 million  , respectively. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , total future compensation expense, assuming the current estimated performance levels are achieved, related to nonvested share awards granted under the LTI program is estimated to be approximately   $5.7 million  . The Company assumed a forfeiture rate for these grants of between   7.5%  -  10%   and the remaining shares have a weighted average life of   0.9 years   at   September 30, 2016  .

8. Income Taxes: 
  The Company follows the guidance of FASB ASC Topic 740 "Income Taxes" ("ASC 740") as it relates to the provision for income taxes and uncertainty in income taxes. The guidance prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. 
  For tax purposes, the Company utilizes the cost recovery method of accounting. Under the cost recovery method, collections on finance receivables are applied first to principal to reduce the finance receivables to zero before taxable income is recognized. The Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") examined the Company's 2005 through 2012 tax returns and has asserted that tax revenue recognition using the cost recovery method does not clearly reflect taxable income. The Company believes it has sufficient support for the technical merits of its position, and believes cost recovery to be an acceptable tax revenue recognition method for the Company's industry. The Company has received Notices of Deficiency for tax years ended December 31, 2005 through 2012. The proposed deficiencies relate to the cost recovery method of tax accounting. In response to the notices, the Company filed petitions in the U.S. Tax Court (the "Tax Court") challenging the deficiencies. On July 10, 2015 and July 21, 2015, the IRS filed Motions for Summary Judgment for tax years 2008 through 2012 and 2005 through 2007, respectively. On November 12, 2015 the Tax Court denied the IRS's Motions for Summary Judgment and set this matter for trial to begin on September 19, 2016. On July 5, 2016, the Tax Court granted the IRS s Motion for Continuance filed on June 28, 2016. On July 14, 2016, the Tax Court set the trial to begin on May 15, 2017. 
  If the Company is unsuccessful in the Tax Court and any potential appeals, it may be required to pay the related deferred taxes, and possibly interest and penalties. At   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, deferred tax liabilities related to this matter were   $253.7 million   and   $251.7 million  , respectively. Any adverse determination on this matter could result in the Company amending state tax returns for prior years, increasing its taxable income in those states. The Company files tax returns in multiple state jurisdictions; therefore, any underpayment of state tax will accrue interest in accordance with the respective state statute. At   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, the Company's estimate of the potential federal and state interest was   $106.2 million   and   $91.0 million  , respectively. 
  ASC 740 requires the recognition of interest if the tax law would require interest to be paid on the underpayment of taxes, and recognition of penalties if a tax position does not meet the minimum statutory threshold to avoid payment of penalties. The Company believes it has sufficient support for the technical merits of its position and that it is more likely than not this position will be sustained. Accordingly, the Company has not accrued for interest or penalties. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , the tax years subject to examination by the major federal, state and international taxing jurisdictions are 2003, 2005 and subsequent years. The 2003 tax year remains open to examination because of a net operating loss that originated in that year but was not fully utilized until the 2005 tax year. The examination periods for the 2005 through 2012 tax years are suspended until a decision of the Tax Court becomes final. 
  The Company intends to  permanently reinvest predominantly all foreign earnings in its foreign operations. If foreign earnings were repatriated, the Company would need to accrue and pay taxes, although foreign tax credits may be available to partially reduce U.S. income taxes. The amount of cash on hand related to foreign operations with permanently reinvested earnings was   $70.0 million   and   $51.5 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
   
  9. Earnings per Share: 
  Basic earnings per share ("EPS") are computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders of PRA Group, Inc. by weighted average common shares outstanding. Diluted EPS are computed using the same components as basic EPS with the denominator adjusted for the dilutive effect of the Notes and nonvested share awards, if dilutive. For the Notes, only the conversion spread is included in the diluted earnings per share calculation, if dilutive. Under such method, the settlement of the conversion spread has a dilutive effect when the average share price of the Company's common stock during any quarter exceeds   $65.72  , which did not occur during the period from which the Notes were issued on August 13, 2013 through   September 30, 2016  . Share-based awards that are contingent upon the attainment of performance goals are included in the computation of diluted EPS if the effect is dilutive. The dilutive effect of nonvested shares is computed using the treasury stock method, which assumes any proceeds that could be obtained upon the vesting of nonvested shares would be used to purchase common shares at the average market price for the period. The assumed proceeds include the tax benefit that would be realized upon assumed exercise.

  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

The following table provides a reconciliation between the computation of basic EPS and diluted EPS for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   (amounts in thousands, except per share amounts): 

There were   no   antidilutive options outstanding for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
   
  10. Commitments and Contingencies: 
  Employment Agreements: 
  The Company has entered into employment agreements, most of which expire on   December 31, 2017  , with all of its U.S. executive officers and with several members of its U.S. senior management group. Such agreements provide for base salary payments as well as bonuses that are based on the attainment of specific management goals. At   September 30, 2016  , estimated future compensation under these agreements is approximately   $15.4 million  . The agreements also contain confidentiality and non-compete provisions. Outside the United States, employment agreements are in place with employees pursuant to local country regulations. Generally, these agreements do not have expiration dates and therefore it is impractical to estimate the amount of future compensation under these agreements. Accordingly, the future compensation under these agreements is not included in the   $15.4 million   total above. 
  Leases: 
  The Company is party to various operating leases with respect to its facilities and equipment. The future minimum lease payments at   September 30, 2016   total approximately   $49.6 million  . 
  Forward Flow Agreements: 
  The Company is party to several forward flow agreements that allow for the purchase of nonperforming loans at pre-established prices. The maximum remaining amount to be purchased under forward flow agreements at   September 30, 2016   is approximately   $362.5 million  . 
  Finance Receivables: 
  Certain agreements for the purchase of finance receivables portfolios contain provisions that may, in limited circumstances, require the Company to refund a portion or all of the collections subsequently received by the Company on particular accounts. The potential refunds as of the balance sheet date are not considered to be significant. 
  Litigation and Regulatory Matters: 
  The Company is from time to time subject to routine legal claims, proceedings and regulatory matters, most of which are incidental to the ordinary course of its business. The Company initiates lawsuits against customers and is occasionally countersued by them in such actions. Also, customers, either individually, as members of a class action, or through a governmental entity on behalf of customers, may initiate litigation against the Company in which they allege that the Company has violated a state or  
  
   19 

PRA Group, Inc. 
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

federal law in the process of collecting on an account. From time to time, other types of lawsuits are brought against the Company. Additionally, the Company receives subpoenas and other requests or demands for information from regulators or governmental authorities who are investigating the Company's debt collection activities. The Company evaluates and responds appropriately to such requests. 
  The Company accrues for potential liability arising from legal proceedings and regulatory matters when it is probable that such liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. This determination is based upon currently available information for those proceedings in which the Company is involved, taking into account the Company's best estimate of such losses for those cases for which such estimates can be made. The Company's estimate involves significant judgment, given the varying stages of the proceedings (including the fact that many of them are currently in preliminary stages), the number of unresolved issues in many of the proceedings (including issues regarding class certification and the scope of many of the claims), and the related uncertainty of the potential outcomes of these proceedings. In making determinations of the likely outcome of pending litigation, the Company considers many factors, including, but not limited to, the nature of the claims, the Company's experience with similar types of claims, the jurisdiction in which the matter is filed, input from outside legal counsel, the likelihood of resolving the matter through alternative mechanisms, the matter's current status and the damages sought or demands made. Accordingly, the Company's estimate will change from time to time, and actual losses could be more than the current estimate. 
  The Company believes that the estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses in excess of the amount accrued for its legal proceedings outstanding at   September 30, 2016  , excluding the potential interest associated with the IRS matter described below, is from   $0   to   $81 million  . 
  In certain legal proceedings, the Company may have recourse to insurance or third-party contractual indemnities to cover all or portions of its litigation expenses, judgments, or settlements. Loss estimates and accruals for potential liability related to legal proceedings are typically exclusive of potential recoveries, if any, under the Company's insurance policies or third-party indemnities. The Company has not recorded any potential recoveries under the Company's insurance policies or third-party indemnities as of   September 30,   2016. 
  The matters described below fall outside of the normal parameters of the Company's routine legal proceedings. 
  Telephone Consumer Protection Act Litigation 
  The Company has been named as defendant in a number of putative class action cases, each alleging that the Company violated the Telephone Consumer Protection Act ("TCPA") by calling consumers' cellular telephones without their prior express consent. On December 21, 2011, the U.S. Judicial Panel on Multi-District Litigation entered an order transferring these matters into one consolidated proceeding in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California (the "Court"). On November 14, 2012, the putative class plaintiffs filed their amended consolidated complaint in the matter, now styled as In re Portfolio Recovery Associates, LLC Telephone Consumer Protection Act Litigation, case No. 11-md-02295 (the "MDL action"). Following the ruling of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission on June 10, 2015 on various petitions concerning the TCPA, the Court lifted the stay of these matters that had been in place since May 20, 2014. In January 2016, the parties reached a settlement agreement in principle ("the Settlement Agreement") under which the parties agreed to seek court approval of class certification and the proposed settlement. As required by the Settlement Agreement, which remains subject to final court approval, the parties sought preliminary Court approval of the Settlement Agreement, and the Company paid   $18 million   to resolve the MDL action during  the second quarter of 2016. The Company had fully accrued for the settlement amount as of December 31, 2015. 
  Internal Revenue Service Audit 
  The IRS examined the Company's 2005 through 2012 tax returns and has asserted that tax revenue recognition using the cost recovery method does not clearly reflect taxable income. The Company believes it has sufficient support for the technical merits of its position, and believes cost recovery to be an acceptable tax revenue recognition method for the Company's industry. The Company has received Notices of Deficiency for tax years ended December 31, 2005 through 2012. The proposed deficiencies relate to the cost recovery method of tax accounting for finance receivables. In response to the notices, the Company filed petitions in the Tax Court challenging the deficiencies. On July 10, 2015 and July 21, 2015, the IRS filed Motions for Summary Judgment for tax years 2008 through 2012 and 2005 through 2007, respectively. On November 12, 2015, the Tax Court denied the IRS's Motions for Summary Judgment and set this matter for trial to begin on September 19, 2016. On July 5, 2016, the Tax Court granted the IRS s Motion for Continuance filed on June 28, 2016. On July 14, 2016, the Tax Court set the trial to begin on May 15, 2017. If the Company is unsuccessful in the Tax Court and any potential appeals, it may ultimately be required to pay the related deferred taxes, and possibly interest and penalties. Deferred tax liabilities related to this matter were   $253.7 million   at   September 30, 2016  . Any adverse determination on this matter could result in the Company amending state tax returns for prior years, increasing its taxable income in those states. The Company files tax returns in multiple state jurisdictions; therefore, any  
  
   20 

PRA Group, Inc. 
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

underpayment of state tax will accrue interest in accordance with the respective state statute. The Company's estimate of the potential federal and state interest is   $106.2 million   as of   September 30, 2016  , which has not been accrued. 
  Portfolio Recovery Associates, LLC v. Guadalupe Mejia 
  On May 11, 2015, an unfavorable jury verdict was delivered against the Company in a matter pending in Jackson County, Missouri. The jury awarded Guadalupe Mejia   $251,000   in compensatory damages and   $82,009,549   in punitive damages for her counter-claim against the Company, alleging malicious prosecution and impermissible collection practices. The Company believes the verdict and magnitude of the award to be erroneous and appealed the award. Unless overturned or significantly reduced, the outcome could result in a loss of up to the amount of the award. 
   
  11. Fair Value: 
  As defined by FASB ASC Topic 820, "Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures" ("ASC 820"), fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. ASC 820 also requires the consideration of differing levels of inputs in the determination of fair values. 
  Those levels of input are summarized as follows: 
             
    Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. 
                
    Level 2: Observable inputs other than Level 1 quoted prices, such as quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market. 
                
    Level 3: Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity. Level 3 assets and liabilities include financial instruments whose value is determined using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques as well as instruments for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation.  
     The level in the fair value hierarchy within which a fair value measurement in its entirety falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. 
  Financial Instruments Not Required To Be Carried at Fair Value 
  In accordance with the disclosure requirements of FASB ASC Topic 825, "Financial Instruments" ("ASC 825"), the table below summarizes fair value estimates for the Company's financial instruments not required to be carried at fair value. The total of the fair value calculations presented does not represent, and should not be construed to represent, the underlying value of the Company. 
  The carrying amounts of the financial instruments in the following table are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   (amounts in thousands):

  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

Disclosure of the estimated fair values of financial instruments often requires the use of estimates. The carrying amount and estimates of the fair value of the Company's debt obligations outlined above do not include any related debt issuance costs associated with the debt obligations. The Company uses the following methods and assumptions to estimate the fair value of the financial instruments in the above table: 
  Cash and cash equivalents:   The carrying amount approximates fair value and quoted prices for identical assets can be found in active markets. Accordingly, the Company estimates the fair value of cash and cash equivalents using Level 1 inputs. 
  Held-to-maturity investments:   Fair value of the Company's investment in Series B certificates of a closed-end Polish investment fund is estimated using proprietary pricing models that the Company utilizes to make portfolio purchase decisions. Accordingly, the Company estimates the fair value of its held-to-maturity investments using Level 3 inputs as there is little observable market data available and management is required to use significant judgment in its estimates. 
  Other investments:   This class of investments consists of private equity funds that invest primarily in loans and securities including single-family residential debt; corporate debt products; and financially-oriented, real-estate-rich and other operating companies in the Americas, Western Europe, and Japan. These investments are subject to certain restrictions regarding transfers and withdrawals. The investments can never be redeemed with the funds. Instead, the nature of the investments in this class is that distributions are received through the liquidation of the underlying assets of the fund. The fair value of the Company's interest is valued by the fund managers; accordingly, the Company estimates the fair value of these investments using Level 3 inputs. The investments are expected to be returned through distributions as a result of liquidations of the funds' underlying assets over   1   to   4   years. 
  Finance receivables, net:   The Company records purchased receivables at cost, which represents a significant discount from the contractual receivable balances due. The Company computed the estimated fair value of these receivables using proprietary pricing models that the Company utilizes to make portfolio purchase decisions. Accordingly, the Company's fair value estimates use Level 3 inputs as there is little observable market data available and management is required to use significant judgment in its estimates. 
  Interest-bearing deposits:   The carrying amount approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of the deposits and the observable quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets. Accordingly, the Company uses Level 2 inputs for its fair value estimates. 
  Revolving lines of credit:   The carrying amount approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of the interest rate periods and the observable quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets. Accordingly, the Company uses Level 2 inputs for its fair value estimates. 
  Term loans:   The carrying amount approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of the interest rate periods and the observable quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets. Accordingly, the Company uses Level 2 inputs for its fair value estimates. 
  Notes and bonds payable:   The carrying amount approximates fair value due to the short-term nature of the loan terms and the observable quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets. Accordingly, the Company uses Level 2 inputs for its fair value estimates. 
  Convertible notes:   The Notes are carried at historical cost, adjusted for the debt discount. The fair value estimates for these Notes incorporates quoted market prices which were obtained from secondary market broker quotes which were derived from a variety of inputs including client orders, information from their pricing vendors, modeling software, and actual trading prices when they occur. Accordingly, the Company uses Level 2 inputs for its fair value estimates.

Financial Instruments Required To Be Carried At Fair Value 
  The carrying amounts in the following table are measured at fair value on a recurring basis in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   (amounts in thousands): 

Available-for-sale investments:   Fair value of the Company's investment in Series C certificates of a closed-end Polish investment fund is estimated using proprietary pricing models that the Company utilizes to make portfolio purchase decisions. Accordingly, the Company estimates the fair value of its available-for-sale investments using Level 3 inputs as there is little observable market data available and management is required to use significant judgment in its estimates. 
  Fair value of the Company's investment in government bonds and fixed income funds is estimated using quoted market prices. Accordingly, the Company uses Level 1 inputs. 
  Interest rate swap contracts:   The interest rate swap contracts are carried at fair value which is determined by using industry standard valuation models. These models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based observable inputs, including interest rate curves and other factors. Accordingly, the Company uses Level 2 inputs for its fair value estimates. 
   
  12. Recent Accounting Pronouncements: 
  In May 2014, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers"     ("ASU 2014-09") that updates the principles for recognizing revenue. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 also amends the required disclosures of the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. ASU 2014-09 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017, and can be adopted either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption, with early application not permitted. The Company is evaluating its implementation approach and the potential impacts of the new standard on its existing revenue recognition policies and procedures.  The Company does not expect the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on its Consolidated Financial Statements.  The Company believes that the revenue it classifies as Fee Income is within the scope of this standard.  The Company's fee income consists of revenue generated by its Claims Compensation Bureau, LLC ("CCB"), PRA Location Services, LLC ("PLS"), and PRA Government Services, LLC ("PGS") subsidiaries.  Based on the Company's evaluation, the Company does not believe the new standard will impact the accounting for its CCB and PLS revenue.  The Company has not completed its evaluation of the new standard as it relates to the accounting for its PGS revenue.  
  In June 2014, FASB issued ASU 2014-12, "Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period"     ("ASU 2014-12"). ASU 2014-12 requires that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition. As such, the performance target should not be reflected in estimating the grant-date fair value of the award. ASU 2014-12 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted ASU 2014-12 in the first quarter of 2016 which had no material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.

  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

In August 2014, FASB issued ASU 2014-15,  Disclosure of Uncertainties About an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern  ("ASU 2014-15"). ASU 2014-15 requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of an entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year of the date the financial statements are issued and provides guidance on determining when and how to disclose going concern uncertainties in the financial statements. Certain disclosures will be required if conditions give rise to substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern. ASU 2014-15 applies to all entities and is effective for annual and interim reporting periods ending after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The Company will adopt ASU 2014-15 during the fourth quarter of 2016 and does not expect the adoption will have an impact on the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  In February 2015, FASB issued ASU 2015-02, "Consolidation (Topic 810), Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis" ("ASU 2015-02"). The amendments under the new guidance modify the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are variable interest entities ("VIEs") or voting interest entities and eliminate the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership. ASU 2015-02 is effective for public business entities for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. The Company adopted ASU 2015-02 in the first quarter of 2016 which had no material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  In April 2015, FASB issued ASU 2015-03, "Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs" ("ASU 2015-03"). ASU 2015-03 requires an entity to present debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by the amendments in this update. For public business entities, this update is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years. An entity should apply the new guidance on a retrospective basis. The Company adopted ASU 2015-03 in the first quarter of 2016. Upon adoption, the Company reclassified its debt issuance costs from "Other assets" to "Borrowings" in its Consolidated Balance Sheets, which did not have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  In April 2015, FASB issued ASU 2015-05, "Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer's Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement" ("ASU 2015-05"). ASU 2015-05 provides explicit guidance to help companies evaluate the accounting for fees paid by a customer in a cloud computing arrangement. The new guidance clarifies that if a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, the customer should account for the license consistent with its accounting for other software licenses. If the arrangement does not include a software license, the customer should account for the arrangement as a service contract. For public business entities, this update is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company prospectively adopted ASU 2015-05 in the first quarter of 2016, which had no material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  In February 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-02, "Leases (Topic 842) Section A - Leases: Amendments to the FASB Account Standards Codification" ("ASU 2016-02"). ASU 2016-02 requires that a lessee should recognize a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term on the balance sheet. It is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years, using a modified retrospective approach and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption of the ASU on its Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  In March 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-09, "Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting" ("ASU 2016-09"). The amendments under the new guidance simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption of the ASU on its Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  In June 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-13, "Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326)" ("ASU 2016-13"). ASU 2016-13 requires the measurement of expected credit losses for financial instruments held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions and reasonable forecasts. The main objective of this ASU is to provide financial statement users with more decision-useful information about the expected credit losses on financial instruments and other commitments to extend credit held by a reporting entity at each reporting date. This ASU supersedes FASB's ASC Topic 310-30, "Loans and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality" ("ASC 310-30"). The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years and allows for early adoption as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption of the ASU on its Consolidated Financial Statements.

  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 

In August 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-15, "Statement of Cash Flows - Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (Topic 230)" ("ASU 2016-15"). ASU 2016-15 reduces diversity in practice of how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows. The new guidance clarifies the classification of cash activity related to debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs, settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments, contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims, proceeds from the settlement of corporate and bank-owned life insurance policies, distributions received from equity-method investments, and beneficial interests in securitization transactions. The guidance also describes a predominance principle in which cash flows with aspects of more than one class that cannot be separated should be classified based on the activity that is likely to be the predominant source or use of cash flow. ASU 2016-15 is effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period, but requires all elements of the amendments to be adopted at once rather than individually. The new standard must be adopted using a retrospective transition method. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption of the ASU on its Consolidated Financial Statements.

Our finance receivables amortization rate, excluding net allowance charges/reversals, was   41.9%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   42.3%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . Cash collections, which drive our finance receivable income, were   $371.7 million   in the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , down   2.4%  , or   $9.1 million  , as compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
  A summary of the sources of our revenue during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   is presented below (amounts in thousands):

Operating expenses were   $154.5 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , a decrease of   $20.8 million   or   11.9%  , as compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
  During the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we acquired finance receivables portfolios at an approximate cost of   $161.3 million   and   $344.6 million  , respectively. In any period, we acquire nonperforming loans that can vary dramatically in their age, type and ultimate collectability. We may pay significantly different purchase rates for purchased receivables within any period as a result of this quality fluctuation. In addition, market forces can drive pricing rates up or down in any period, irrespective of other quality fluctuations. As a result, the average purchase rate paid for any given period can fluctuate dramatically based on our particular buying activity in that period. However, regardless of the average purchase price and for similar time frames, we intend to target a similar internal rate of return, after direct expenses, in pricing our portfolio acquisitions during any quarter; therefore, the absolute rate paid is not necessarily relevant to the estimated profitability of a period's buying.

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016   Compared To   Three Months Ended September 30, 2015 
  Revenues 
  Total revenues were   $222.0 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , a decrease of   $7.4 million  , or   3.2%  , compared to total revenues of   $229.4 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
  Income Recognized on Finance Receivables, net 
  Income recognized on finance receivables, net was   $202.6 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , a decrease of   $5.6 million  , or   2.7%  , compared to income recognized on finance receivables, net, of   $208.2 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The decrease was primarily a result of a $9.1 million decrease in cash collections and a $1.8 million increase in net allowance charges.The decrease in cash collections was mainly caused by a decrease in our Insolvency portfolio collections partially offset by an increase in our collections in Europe. During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , we incurred   $13.1 million   in net allowance charges, compared with   $11.3 million   in the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . Our finance receivables amortization rate, including net allowance charges/reversals, was   45.5%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   45.3%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . Our finance receivables amortization rate, excluding net allowance charges/reversals, was   41.9%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   42.3%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . Cash collections, which drive our finance receivable income, were   $371.7 million   in the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , down   $9.1 million  , or   2.4%  , as compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
  Accretable yield represents the amount of income recognized on finance receivables the Company can expect to generate over the remaining life of its existing portfolios based on estimated future cash flows as of the balance sheet date. Additions represent the original expected accretable yield on portfolios purchased during the period to be earned by the Company based on its proprietary buying models. Net reclassifications from nonaccretable difference to accretable yield primarily result from the Company's increase in its estimate of future cash flows. Increases in future cash flows may occur as portfolios age and actual cash collections exceed those originally expected. If those cash flows are determined to be incremental to the portfolio's original forecast, future projections of cash flows are generally increased resulting in higher expected revenue and hence increases in accretable yield. When applicable, net reclassifications to nonaccretable difference from accretable yield result from the Company's decrease in its estimates of future cash flows and allowance charges that exceed the Company's increase in its estimate of future cash flows. During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company reclassified   $5.9 million   from nonaccretable difference to accretable yield primarily due to increased cash collection forecasts relating to pools acquired from 2009-2015. During the three months ended   September 30,     2015  , the Company reclassified   $139.9 million   from nonaccretable difference to accretable yield primarily due to increased cash collection forecasts relating to pools acquired from 2007-2014. 
  Income recognized on finance receivables, net, is shown net of changes in valuation allowances which are recorded for significant decreases in expected cash flows or a change in timing of cash flows which would otherwise require a reduction in the stated yield on a pool of accounts. For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , we recorded net allowance charges of   $13.1 million  . On our domestic Core portfolios, we recorded net allowance charges of $12.1 million on portfolios purchased mainly between 2012-2014. We also recorded allowance charges of $0.7 million on our European portfolios and $0.3 million on our Canadian portfolios. 
  For the three months ended   September 30,   2015, we recorded net allowance charges of   $11.3 million  . On our domestic Core portfolios, we recorded net allowance charges of $8.8 million on portfolios purchased mainly in 2011 and 2012. We also recorded an allowance charge of $2.5 million on our UK portfolios. 
  In any given period, we may be required to record valuation allowances due to pools of receivables underperforming our previous expectations. Factors that may contribute to the recording of valuation allowances may include both internal as well as external factors. External factors which may have an impact on the collectability, and subsequently to the overall profitability, of purchased pools of nonperforming loans include new laws or regulations relating to collections, new interpretations of existing laws or regulations, and the overall condition of the economy. Internal factors which may have an impact on the collectability, and subsequently the overall profitability, of purchased pools of nonperforming loans would include necessary revisions to initial and post-acquisition scoring and modeling estimates, operational activities (relating to the collection and movement of accounts on both our collection floor and external channels), and changes in productivity related to turnover and retention of our collection staff. 
  Fee Income 
  Fee income decreased to   $17.6 million   in the three months ended   September 30, 2016   from   $17.8 million   in the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . This was primarily due to a decrease in fee income from PRA Europe which was due primarily to an expected decline in the amount of contingent fee work provided to us by debt owners, and a decrease in fee income generated by  
  
   30 

Claims Compensation Bureau, LLC ( CCB"). This was offset by increases in fee income generated by PRA Location Services, LLC ( PLS ), PRA Government Services, LLC ( PGS"), RMSC, and RCB Investimentos S.A. ( RCB ). 
  Other Revenue 
  Other revenue decreased to   $1.7 million   in the three months ended   September 30, 2016   from   $3.4 million   in the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , primarily due to a decrease in revenue generated by our investments. 
  Operating Expenses 
  Operating expenses were   $154.5 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , a decrease of   $20.8 million   or   11.9%   compared to operating expenses of   $175.3 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in other operating expenses and legal collection fees offset by increases in legal collection costs and agency fees. Operating expenses were   39.7%   of cash receipts for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   44.0%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
  Compensation and Employee Services 
  Compensation and employee services expenses were   $65.9 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , a decrease of   $0.2 million  , or   0.3%  , compared to compensation and employee services expenses of   $66.1 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The decrease in compensation and employee services expenses was mainly due to a decrease in discretionary bonus and other incentive compensation expenses, including share-based compensation expenses offset by increases in normal salary expenses caused by an increase in employee headcount. Total full-time equivalents increased to   3,859   as of   September 30, 2016  , compared to   3,715   as of   September 30, 2015  . Compensation and employee services expenses as a percentage of cash receipts increased to   16.9%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , from   16.6%   of cash receipts for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
  Legal Collection Fees 
  Legal collection fees represent contingent fees incurred for the cash collections generated by our independent third party collection attorneys. Legal collection fees were   $9.3 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to legal collection fees of   $13.7 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The decrease was mainly attributable to a decrease in legal collection fees caused by a decrease in external legal collections. 
  Legal Collection Costs 
  Legal collection costs consist of costs paid to courts where a lawsuit is filed and the cost of documents received from sellers of nonperforming loans. Legal collection costs were   $24.1 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , an increase of   $5.2 million  , or   27.5%  , compared to legal collection costs of   $18.9 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase was mainly attributable to an increase in legal collection costs incurred by our European operations. 
  Agency Fees 
  Agency fees primarily represent third party collection fees and costs paid to repossession agents to repossess vehicles. Agency fees were   $12.0 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $8.0 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . This increase was mainly attributable to third-party collection fees incurred by our international operations where we utilize third party agencies. 
  Outside Fees and Services 
  Outside fees and services expenses were   $14.7 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , an increase of   $2.1 million  , or   16.7%  , compared to outside fees and services expenses of   $12.6 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . This increase was primarily due to a $0.9 million increase in corporate legal expenses and a $0.7 million increase in consulting fees. 
  Communication 
  Communication expenses were   $7.8 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to communication expenses of   $8.0 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . None of the increase was attributable to any significant identifiable items. 
  
   31 

Rent and Occupancy 
  Rent and occupancy expenses were   $3.9 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , an increase of   $0.2 million  , or   5.4%  , compared to rent and occupancy expenses of   $3.7 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase was primarily due to additional rental expenses incurred as a result of our acquisition of RCB, RMSC and DTP as well as the additional rent expense associated with the expansion of our headquarters in Norfolk, Virginia. 
  Depreciation and Amortization 
  Depreciation and amortization expenses were   $6.2 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , an increase of   $0.8 million  , or   14.8%  , compared to depreciation and amortization expenses of   $5.4 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase was primarily due to the amortization expense incurred on intangible assets acquired in connection with the acquisition of RCB and RMSC. 
  Other Operating Expenses  
  Other operating expenses were   $10.5 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , a decrease of   $28.5 million  , or   73.1%  , compared to other operating expenses of   $39.0 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The decrease was primarily due to $28.8 million in expenses incurred during the three months ended September 30, 2015 relating to the Consent Order entered into with the CFPB. 
  Interest Expense 
  Interest expense was   $19.3 million   during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , an increase of   $2.5 million   or   14.9%  , compared to   $16.8 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase was primarily due to an increase in average borrowings during the three months ended   September 30,   2016 compared to the three months ended   September 30,   2015. 
  Net Foreign Currency Transaction Gains/(Losses) 
  Net foreign currency transaction gains were   $5.0 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to net foreign currency transaction losses of   $3.2 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . In any given period, our foreign entities conduct operations in currencies different from their functional currency which generate foreign currency transaction gains and losses. 
  Provision for Income Taxes 
  Provision for income taxes was   $16.7 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , an increase of   $0.1 million  , or   0.6%  , compared to provision for income taxes of   $16.6 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase is primarily due to a   55.6%   increase in income before taxes for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . This was offset by a decrease in our effective tax rate. During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , our effective tax rate was   31.3%  , compared to   48.6%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The decrease was due primarily to the non-tax deductible payments made pursuant to the Consent Order entered into with the CFPB and unfavorable tax provision to tax return adjustments during the three months ended September 30, 2015, in addition to favorable tax provision to tax return adjustments during the three months ended September 30, 2016. 
  We intend to permanently reinvest predominantly all foreign earnings in our foreign operations. If foreign earnings were repatriated, we would need to accrue and pay taxes, although foreign tax credits may be available to partially reduce U.S. income taxes. The amount of cash on hand related to foreign operations with permanently reinvested earnings was   $70.0 million   and   $48.4 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.

The decrease was primarily due to a $18.1 million increase in net allowance charges in addition to a decrease in cash collections on our finance receivables to   $1,143.2 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , from   $1,170.1  
  
   32 

million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , a decrease of   $26.9 million  , or   2.3%  . The decrease in cash collections was mainly caused by a decrease in our Insolvency portfolio collections partially offset by an increase in our collections in Europe. Our finance receivables amortization rate, including net allowance charges, was   46.4%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   43.9%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .

  Income recognized on finance receivables, net, is shown net of changes in valuation allowances which are recorded for significant decreases in expected cash flows or a change in timing of cash flows which would otherwise require a reduction in the stated yield on a pool of accounts. For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we recorded net allowance charges of   $36.0 million  . On our domestic Core portfolios, we recorded net allowance charges of $31.7 million on portfolios purchased mainly between 2011 and 2014. On our Insolvency portfolios, we recorded net allowance charges of $0.5 million on our domestic portfolios. We also recorded net allowance charges of $3.8 million on our foreign portfolios, primarily on our UK and Italian portfolios. For the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , we recorded net allowance charges of   $17.9 million  . On our domestic Core portfolios, we recorded net allowance reversals of $0.8 million on portfolios purchased between 2006 and 2008, offset by allowance charges of $15.7 million on portfolios purchased between 2010 and 2013. On our Insolvency portfolios, we recorded net allowance reversals of $0.2 million on our domestic portfolios. We also recorded an allowance charge of $3.2 million on our UK portfolios. No allowance charges or reversals were recorded on any of our other foreign portfolios. 
  In any given period, we may be required to record valuation allowances due to pools of receivables underperforming our previous expectations. Factors that may contribute to the recording of valuation allowances may include both internal as well as external factors. External factors which may have an impact on the collectability, and subsequently to the overall profitability, of purchased pools of nonperforming loans include new laws or regulations relating to collections, new interpretations of existing laws or regulations, and the overall condition of the economy. Internal factors which may have an impact on the collectability, and subsequently the overall profitability, of purchased pools of nonperforming loans would include necessary revisions to initial and post-acquisition scoring and modeling estimates, non-optimal operational activities (relating to the collection and movement of accounts on both our collection floor and external channels), and decreases in productivity related to turnover of our collection staff. 
  Fee Income 
  Fee income increased to   $56.2 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from   $44.7 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , primarily due to an increase in fee income by CCB, mainly related to one case, as well as increases in fee income generated by PLS and PGS and the fee income generated by RMSC, which we acquired in the first quarter of 2016, and the fee income generated by RCB, which we acquired in the third quarter of 2015. This was offset by a decrease in fee income from PRA Europe which is due primarily to an expected decline in the amount of contingent fee work provided to us by debt owners. 
  Other Revenue 
  Other revenue decreased to   $6.0 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from   $10.4 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , primarily due to a decrease in revenue earned on our investments.

This decrease was due primarily to a $25.7 million decrease in other operating expenses and a $4.2 million decrease in legal collection fees. This was offset by a  
  
   33 

$10.2 million increase in agency fees, a $8.6 million increase in outside fees and services and a $3.4 million increase in depreciation and amortization. Operating expenses were   38.7%   of cash receipts for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   38.9%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .

The decrease was mainly attributable to a decrease in legal collection fees incurred by our domestic operations caused by a decrease in domestic external legal collections. 
  Legal Collection Costs 
  Legal collection costs consist of costs paid to courts where a lawsuit is filed and the cost of documents received from sellers of nonperforming loans. Legal collection costs were   $60.1 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , an increase of   $0.8 million  , or   1.3%  , compared to legal collection costs of   $59.3 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .

The decrease was primarily due to $28.8 million in expenses incurred during the three months ended September 30, 2015 relating to the Consent Order entered into with the CFPB. 
  Interest Expense 
  Interest expense was   $59.8 million   and   $45.0 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The increase was primarily due to an increase in average borrowings during the   nine months ended     September 30,   2016 compared to the   nine months ended     September 30,   2015.

  Net foreign currency transaction gains were   $5.2 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to net foreign currency transaction gains of   $7.2 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . In any given period, our foreign entities conduct operations in currencies different from their functional currency which generate foreign currency transaction gains and losses. 
  Provision for Income Taxes 
  Provision for income taxes was   $50.2 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , a decrease of   $24.0 million  , or   32.3%  , compared to provision for income taxes of   $74.2 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The decrease is primarily due to a   22.3%   decrease in income before taxes for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , our effective tax rate was   32.1%  , compared to   36.9%   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The decrease was due primarily to the non-tax deductible payments made pursuant to the Consent Order entered into with the CFPB and unfavorable tax provision to tax return adjustments during the nine months ended September 30, 2015, in addition to favorable tax provision to tax return adjustments during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 
  We intend to permanently reinvest predominantly all foreign earnings in our foreign operations. If foreign earnings were repatriated, we would need to accrue and pay taxes; however, foreign tax credits would be available to partially reduce U.S. income taxes. The amount of cash on hand related to foreign operations with permanently reinvested earnings was   $70.0 million   and   $48.4 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.

Supplemental Performance Data 
  Finance Receivables Portfolio Performance 
  The following tables show certain data related to our finance receivables portfolio. These tables describe the purchase price, actual cash collections, estimates of future cash collections, income recognized on finance receivables (gross and net of allowance charges/(reversals)), principal amortization, allowance charges/(reversals), net finance receivable balances, and the ratio of total estimated collections to purchase price (which we refer to as purchase price multiple) as well as the original purchase price multiple. Certain adjustments, as noted in the footnotes to these tables, have been made to reduce the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on purchase price multiples. 
  Further, these tables disclose our Americas and European Core and Insolvency portfolios. The accounts represented in the Insolvency tables are those portfolios of accounts that were in an insolvency status at the time of purchase. This contrasts with accounts in our Core portfolios that file for bankruptcy/insolvency protection after we purchase them, which continue to be tracked in their corresponding Core portfolio. Core customers sometimes file for bankruptcy/insolvency protection subsequent to our purchase of the related Core portfolio. When this occurs, we adjust our collection practices accordingly to comply with bankruptcy/insolvency rules and procedures; however, for accounting purposes, these accounts remain in the related Core portfolio. Conversely, Insolvency accounts may be dismissed voluntarily or involuntarily subsequent to our purchase of the related Insolvency portfolio. Dismissal occurs when the terms of the bankruptcy are not met by the petitioner. When this occurs, we are typically free to pursue collection outside of bankruptcy procedures; however, for accounting purposes, these accounts remain in the related Insolvency pool. 
  Purchase price multiples can vary over time due to a variety of factors including pricing competition, supply levels, age of the receivables purchased, and changes in our operational efficiency. For example, increased pricing competition during the 2005 to 2008 period negatively impacted purchase price multiples of our Core portfolio compared to prior years. Conversely, during the 2009 to 2011 period, pricing disruptions occurred as a result of the economic downturn. This created unique and advantageous purchasing opportunities, particularly within the Insolvency market, relative to the prior four years. 
  Purchase price multiples can also vary among types of finance receivables. For example, we generally incur lower collection costs on our Insolvency portfolio compared with our Core portfolio. This allows us, in general, to pay more for an Insolvency portfolio and experience lower purchase price multiples, while generating similar internal rates of return, net of expenses, when compared with a Core portfolio. 
  When competition increases and/or supply decreases, pricing often becomes negatively impacted relative to expected collections, and yields tend to trend lower. The opposite tends to occur when competition decreases and/or supply increases. 
  Within a given portfolio type, to the extent that lower purchase price multiples are the result of more competitive pricing and lower yields, this will generally lead to higher amortization rates and lower profitability. As portfolio pricing becomes more favorable on a relative basis, our profitability will tend to increase. Profitability within given Core portfolio types may also be impacted by the age and quality of the receivables, which impact the cost to collect those accounts. 
  The numbers presented in the following tables represent gross cash collections and do not reflect any costs to collect; therefore, they may not represent relative profitability. We continue to make enhancements to our analytical abilities, with the intent to collect more cash at a lower cost. To the extent we can improve our collection operations by collecting additional cash from a discrete quantity and quality of accounts, and/or by collecting cash at a lower cost structure, we can positively impact profitability. 
  Revenue recognition under ASC 310-30 is driven by estimates of total collections as well as the timing of those collections. We record new portfolio purchases based on our best estimate of the cash flows expected at acquisition, which reflects the uncertainties inherent in the purchase of past due loans and the results of our underwriting process. Subsequent to the initial booking, as we gain collection experience and confidence with a pool of accounts, we continuously update ERC. These processes, along with the aforementioned operational enhancements, have tended to cause the ratio of ERC to purchase price for any given year of buying to gradually increase over time. As a result, our estimate of total collections has often increased as pools have aged. Thus, all factors being equal in terms of pricing, one would typically tend to see a higher collection to purchase price ratio from a pool of accounts that was six years from purchase than say a pool that was just two years from purchase. 
  Due to all the factors described above, readers should be cautious when making comparisons of purchase price multiples among periods and between types of receivables.

    Excludes the $27.9 million and $34.7 million investment in a securitized fund in Poland during the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively, which is included in "Investments" on our consolidated balance sheets.    
     Our ability to profitably purchase and liquidate pools of Insolvency accounts provides diversity to our distressed asset acquisition business. Although we generally purchase Insolvency portfolios from many of the same consumer lenders from whom we acquire Core customer portfolios, the volumes and pricing characteristics as well as the competitors are different. Based upon market dynamics, the profitability of portfolios purchased in the Insolvency and Core markets may differ over time. We have found periods when Insolvency accounts were more profitable and other times when Core accounts were more profitable. A primary driver of portfolio profitability is determined by the amount of purchase price relative to the expected returns of the acquired portfolios. When pricing becomes more competitive due to reduced portfolios available for purchase or increased demand from competitors entering or increasing their presence in the market, prices tend to go up, driving down the purchase price multiple and lowering the overall expected returns. When pricing relaxes due to market dynamics, purchase price multiples tend to increase, thereby increasing the overall expected returns. 
  In order to collect our Core portfolios, we generally need to employ relatively higher amounts of labor and incur additional collection costs to generate each dollar of cash collections as compared with Insolvency portfolios. In order to achieve acceptable levels of net return on investment (after direct expenses), we are generally targeting a higher total cash collections to purchase price multiple for Core portfolios. On the other hand, Insolvency accounts generate the majority of their cash collections through the efforts of bankruptcy courts and trustees. In this process, cash is remitted to our Company with no corresponding cost other than the cost of filing claims at the time of purchase, court fees associated with the filing of ownership claim transfers and general administrative costs for monitoring the progress of each account through the bankruptcy process. As a result, overall collection costs are much lower for us when liquidating a pool of Insolvency accounts as compared to a pool of Core accounts, but conversely the price we pay for Insolvency accounts is generally higher than Core accounts. We generally target similar net returns on investment (measured after direct expenses) for Insolvency and Core portfolios at any given point in the market cycles. However, because of the lower related collection costs, we can pay more for Insolvency portfolios, which causes the estimated total cash collections to purchase price multiples of Insolvency pools generally to be lower. In summary, compared to a similar investment in a pool of Core accounts, to the extent both pools had identical targeted net returns on investment (measured after direct expenses), the Insolvency pool would be expected to generate less revenue, less direct expenses, similar operating income, and a higher operating margin. From time to time, especially in Europe, we purchase Core portfolios which consist of a majority of paying previously charged-off accounts. These portfolios have some of the same financial dynamics as Insolvency accounts, with lower collection costs and lower purchase price multiples. 
  As a result of these purchase price and collection cost dynamics, the mix of our portfolios impacts the relative profitability we realize in a given year. We minimize the impact of higher pricing, to the degree possible, with increased analytics used to score Core accounts and determine on which of those accounts to focus our collection efforts. 
  We utilize a long-term approach to collecting our receivables. This approach has historically caused us to realize significant cash collections and revenues from purchased portfolios of finance receivables years after they are originally acquired. As a result, we have in the past been able to temporarily reduce our level of current period acquisitions without a material negative current period impact on cash collections and revenue.

     Collections Productivity (Domestic Portfolio) 
  The following tables display various collections productivity measures that we track. 

(1) 
    Represents total cash collections less Insolvency cash collections from trustee-administered accounts. This metric includes cash collections from Insolvency accounts administered by the Core call center as well as cash collections generated by our internal staff of legal collectors. This calculation does not include hours paid to our internal staff of legal collectors or to employees processing the required notifications to trustees on Insolvency accounts.    
              (2) 
    Represents total cash collections (assigned and unassigned) divided by total hours paid (including holiday, vacation and sick time) to collectors (including those in training).    
              (3) 
    Represents total cash collections less external legal cash collections. This metric includes internal legal collections and all insolvency collections and excludes any hours associated with either of those functions.    
              (4) 
    Represents total cash collections less external legal cash collections and less Insolvency cash collections from trustee-administered accounts. This metric does not include any labor hours associated with the Insolvency or legal (internal or external) functions but does include internally-driven cash collections from the internal legal channel.    
     
   41 

Seasonality 
  Cash collections in the Americas tend to be higher in the first and second quarters of the year and lower in the third and fourth quarters of the year; by contrast, cash collections in Europe tend to be higher in the third and fourth quarters of the year. Customer payment patterns are affected by seasonal employment trends, income tax refunds and holiday spending habits geographically. 
  The following table displays our quarterly cash collections by geography and portfolio type, for the periods indicated. 

The following table provides additional details on the composition of our U.S. Core cash collections for the periods indicated.

Portfolio Purchases by Stratifications (Domestic Only) 
  The following table categorizes our life-to-date domestic portfolio purchases as of   September 30, 2016   into major asset type, delinquency category, and geographic location. 

(1) 
    Represents the original face amount purchased from sellers and has not been reduced by any adjustments, including payments and buybacks.    
              (2)

              (3) 
    Each state included in "Other" represents less than 2% of the face value of total life-to-date domestic purchases.    
     Investments in Securitized Assets 
  We hold a majority interest in a closed-end Polish investment fund. The fund was formed in December 2014 to acquire portfolios of nonperforming loans in Poland. Our investment consists of a 100% interest in the Series B certificates and a 20% interest in the Series C certificates. Each certificate comes with one vote and is governed by a co-investment agreement. Series C certificates, which share equally in the residual profit of the fund, are accounted for as debt securities classified as available-for-sale and are stated at fair value. Income is recognized using the effective yield method. 
  
   43 

The total initial investment by the Polish investment fund in finance receivables is $62.6 million. The gross estimated remaining collections and gross total estimated collections, related to our proportional ownership of the fund are   $95.7 million   and   $126.3 million  , respectively at   September 30, 2016  . 
  Estimated Remaining Collections 
  The following chart shows our ERC by geographical region at   September 30, 2016   (amounts in millions). 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Historically, our primary sources of cash have been cash flows from operations, bank borrowings, and convertible debt and equity offerings. Cash has been used for acquisitions of finance receivables portfolios, corporate acquisitions, repurchases of our common stock, repayments of bank borrowings, operating expenses, purchases of property and equipment, and working capital to support our growth. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , cash and cash equivalents totaled   $91.8 million  , compared to   $71.4 million   at   December 31, 2015  . Included in cash and cash equivalents are funds held on the behalf of others arising from the collection of accounts placed with us. The balance of the funds held on behalf of others was $5.5 million and $3.9 million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. There is an offsetting liability that is included in "Other liabilities" on our consolidated balance sheets. We had approximately   $1.8 billion   in borrowings outstanding as of   September 30, 2016  , with   $630.8 million   of availability under all of our credit facilities, subject to compliance with borrowing base and applicable debt covenants. Considering borrowing base restrictions and other covenants, the aggregate amount available to be drawn on all of our credit facilities was $172.0 million. See the "Borrowings" section below for more information.  
  Obligations during the twelve month period ending   September 30,   2017 include forward flow portfolio purchase commitments and payment of principal and interest on our borrowings. We have in place forward flow and other commitments for the purchase of nonperforming loans in which the maximum amount that could be purchased is approximately   $362.5 million   as of   September 30, 2016  . We may also enter into new or renewed flow commitments and close on spot transactions in addition to the aforementioned flow agreements. We believe that funds generated from operations and from cash collections on finance receivables, together with existing cash and available borrowings under our credit facilities will be sufficient to finance our operations, planned capital expenditures, forward flow purchase commitments, and additional portfolio purchasing during the next twelve months. Business acquisitions, adverse outcomes in pending litigation or higher than expected levels of portfolio purchasing could require additional financing from other sources. 
  For domestic income tax purposes, we recognize revenue from the collections of finance receivables using the cost recovery method. The IRS has audited and issued Notices of Deficiency for the tax years ended December 31, 2005 through 2012. It has asserted that tax revenue recognition using the cost recovery method does not clearly reflect taxable income. We have filed petitions  
  
   44 

in the U.S. Tax Court (the "Tax Court") challenging the deficiencies and believe we have sufficient support for the technical merits of our positions. On July 10, 2015 and July 21, 2015, the IRS filed Motions for Summary Judgment for tax years 2008 through 2012 and 2005 through 2007 respectively. On November 12, 2015, the Tax Court denied the IRS's Motions for Summary Judgment and set this matter for trial to begin on September 19, 2016. On July 5, 2016, the Tax Court granted the IRS s Motion for Continuance filed on June 28, 2016. On July 14, 2016, the Tax Court set the trial to begin on May 15, 2017. If we are unsuccessful in the Tax Court and any potential appeals, we may ultimately be required to pay the related deferred taxes, and possibly interest and penalties, which may require additional financing from other sources. Deferred tax liabilities related to this matter were   $253.7 million   at   September 30, 2016  . Our estimate of the potential federal and state interest is   $106.2 million   as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  On October 22, 2015, our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program to purchase up to $125 million of our outstanding shares of common stock on the open market. Repurchases depend on prevailing market conditions and other factors. The repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued at any time. During 2015, we purchased 2,072,721 shares of our common stock under the new share repurchase program at an average price of $38.60 per share. At   September 30, 2016  , the maximum remaining purchase price for share repurchases under the new program is approximately $45.0 million. 
  Cash generated from operations is dependent upon our ability to collect on our finance receivables. Many factors, including the economy and our ability to hire and retain qualified collectors and managers, are essential to our ability to generate cash flows. Fluctuations in these factors that cause a negative impact on our business could have a material impact on our future cash flows. 
  Our operating activities provided cash of   $117.9 million   and   $125.5 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. In these periods, cash from operations was generated primarily from net income earned through cash collections recognized as revenue and fee income received for the period. In addition, changes in other accounts related to our operating activities impacted our cash from operations. 
  Our investing activities used cash of   $236.3 million   and   $215.4 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Cash used in investing activities is primarily driven by acquisitions of finance receivables, business acquisitions, and purchases of property and equipment. Cash provided by investing activities is primarily driven by cash collections applied to principal on finance receivables. The majority of the increase in cash used in investing activities was due to an increase in business acquisitions, net of cash acquired, to   $67.0 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , from   $1.4 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , offset by a decrease in acquisitions of finance receivables, to   $697.8 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , from   $730.0 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . 
  Our financing activities provided cash of   $94.1 million   and   $129.5 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Cash for financing activities is normally provided primarily by draws on our line of credit and proceeds from long-term debt. Cash used in financing activities is primarily driven by principal payments on our lines of credit, principal payments on long-term debt and repurchases of our common stock. The decrease in cash provided by financing activities was primarily driven by net repayments on our lines of credit of   $36.8 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to net draws on our lines of credit of   $238.9 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . This was offset by net draws on long-term debt of $110.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to net payments on long-term debt of $43.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  In addition, during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , we repurchased   $85.5 million   of our common stock compared to   $0   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .  
  Cash paid for interest was   $49.5 million   and   $38.3 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Interest was paid on our revolving credit facilities, long-term debt, convertible debt and interest rate swap agreements. The increase was the result of a higher average balance on our borrowings. Cash paid for income taxes was   $59.2 million   and   $70.5 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  Borrowings 
  Domestic Revolving Credit and Term Loan 
  On December 19, 2012, we entered into a credit facility with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, and a syndicate of lenders named therein (such agreement as later amended or modified, the "Credit Agreement"). On March 24, 2016, we entered into a Loan Modification Agreement and Seventh Amendment (the  Seventh Amendment ) to the Credit Agreement which (a) extended the maturity date of loans and commitments under the Credit Agreement in an aggregate principal amount of approximately $745.9 million, including a $23.0 million net increase in the commitments of the extending lenders, to the earlier of December 21, 2020 or 91 days prior to the maturity of our 3.00% Convertible Senior Notes due August 1, 2020 (the "Notes"), (b) modified the accordion feature under the Credit Agreement to allow us to request from new and existing lenders up to an additional $125.0 million in loans and commitments under the Credit Agreement, (c) increased the credit given in the domestic borrowing base for estimated remaining collections of eligible asset pools, (d) increased the amounts available for permitted investments, equity  
  
   45 

repurchases and redemptions of our convertible notes, and (e) increased our maximum permitted total consolidated leverage ratio to 2.25 to 1.0. 
  The total credit facility includes an aggregate principal amount of   $953.0 million   (subject to compliance with a borrowing base and applicable debt covenants), which consists of (i) a fully funded   $155.0 million   term loan, (ii) a   $748.0 million   domestic revolving credit facility, and (iii) a   $50 million   Canadian revolving credit facility. Our facility includes an optional increase in commitments for a   $125.0 million   accordion feature, and also provides for up to   $20 million   of letters of credit that would reduce amounts available for borrowing. The facility matures on the earlier of December 21, 2020 or 91 days prior to the maturity of the Notes. As of   September 30,   2016, the unused portion of the domestic and Canadian revolving credit facilities was   $90.7 million  . Considering borrowing base restrictions, as of   September 30,   2016, the amount available to be drawn was   $66.1 million  . The Credit Agreement is secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of our assets. 
  Borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement at   September 30, 2016   consisted of   $155.0 million   outstanding on the term loan with an annual interest rate of   3.02%   and   $707.3 million   outstanding on the revolving credit facilities with a weighted average interest rate of   3.04%  . At December 31, 2015, borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement consisted of   $170.0 million   outstanding on the term loan with an annual interest rate of   2.92%   and   $541.8 million   outstanding on the revolving credit facility with a weighted average interest rate of   2.89%  . 
  Note Payable 
  In conjunction with the closing of the acquisition of the Aktiv business on July 16, 2014, we entered into a $169.9 million promissory note with an affiliate of the seller in the Aktiv transaction. The promissory note bore interest at the three-month London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") plus 3.75%. On July 18, 2016, we paid the outstanding balance due of $169.9 million plus accrued interest. 
  Multicurrency Revolving Credit Facility 
  On October 23, 2014, we entered into a credit agreement with DNB Bank ASA for a Multicurrency Revolving Credit Facility (such agreement as later amended or modified, "the Multicurrency Revolving Credit Agreement"). On February 19, 2016, we entered into a Second Amendment to the Multicurrency Revolving Credit Agreement which provided for, (i) the extension of the final repayment date to February 19, 2021, (ii) an increase to the total commitments from $750 million to $900 million, subject to certain requirements, (iii) an ERC ratio (as defined in Multicurrency Revolving Credit Agreement) ranging from 32.2% to 38.7% depending on the mix of portfolios owned, subject to the payment of additional associated fees.  On September 2, 2016, we entered into a Third Amendment and Restatement Agreement to the Multicurrency Revolving Credit Agreement which provided for, (1) increasing the total commitments from $900 million to an aggregate of $1.2 billion by including a term loan facility of approximately $300 million, (2) replacing the estimated remaining collections ratio covenant with a LTV covenant of 75%, (3) changing the ratio of gross interest bearing debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (as more specifically defined in the Third Amendment) to 3.5:1.0 until March 31, 2017 and 3.25:1.0 thereafter, and (4) revising the applicable margin for the interest payable to 2.80%-3.90% under the revolving facility, and 4.25%-4.50% under the term loan facility, dependent on the LTV ratio. 
  Under the terms of the Multicurrency Revolving Credit Agreement, the credit facility includes an aggregate amount of $900.0 million (subject to the borrowing base), accrues interest at the IBOR plus 2.80-  3.90%   under the revolving facility and 4.25-4.50% under the term loan facility (as determined by the ERC Ratio as defined in the Multicurrency Revolving Credit Agreement), bears an unused line fee of 35% of the margin, currently 1.26% per annum, payable monthly in arrears, and matures on February 19, 2021. The Multicurrency Revolving Credit Agreement also includes an Overdraft Facility in the aggregate amount of $40.0 million (subject to the borrowing base), which accrues interest (per currency) at the daily rates as published by the facility agent, bears a facility line fee of 0.125% per annum, payable quarterly in arrears, and also matures February 19, 2021. As of   September 30,   2016, the unused portion of the Multicurrency Revolving Credit Agreement (including the Overdraft Facility) was $540.1 million. Considering borrowing base restrictions and other covenants, as of   September 30,   the amount available to be drawn under the Multicurrency Revolving Credit Agreement (including the Overdraft Facility) was $106.0 million.  
  The Multicurrency Revolving Credit Agreement is secured by i) the shares of most of the subsidiaries of Aktiv, and ii) all intercompany loans to Aktiv's subsidiaries. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , the outstanding balance on the Multicurrency Revolving Credit Agreement consisted of   $299.3 million   on the term loan with an annual interest rate of   4.25%   and   $399.9 million   on the revolving facilities with a weighted average annual interest rate of   4.07%  . At December 31, 2015, the balance on the Multicurrency Revolving Credit Agreement was $576.4 million, with a weighted average annual interest rate of 3.64%.

Convertible Senior Notes 
  On August 13, 2013, we completed the private offering of $287.5 million in aggregate principal amount of the Notes. The Notes were issued pursuant to an Indenture, dated August 13, 2013 between us and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee. The Indenture contains customary terms and covenants, including certain events of default after which the Notes may be due and payable immediately. The Notes are our senior unsecured obligations and mature on August 1, 2020. Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually, in arrears, on February 1 and August 1 of each year, beginning as of February 1, 2014. Prior to February 1, 2020, the Notes are convertible only upon the occurrence of specified events. On or after February 1, 2020, the Notes will be convertible at any time. Upon conversion, the Notes may be settled, at our option, in cash, shares of our common stock, or any combination thereof. Holders of the Notes have the right to require us to repurchase all or some of their Notes at 100% of their principal amount, plus any accrued and unpaid interest, upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the Indenture). In addition, upon the occurrence of a make-whole fundamental change (as defined in the Indenture), we may, under certain circumstances, be required to increase the conversion rate for the Notes converted in connection with such a make-whole fundamental change. The conversion rate for the Notes is initially 15.2172 shares per $1,000 principal amount of Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $65.72 per share of our common stock, and is subject to adjustment in certain circumstances pursuant to the Indenture. We do not have the right to redeem the Notes prior to maturity. As of   September 30, 2016  , none of the conditions allowing holders of the Notes to convert their Notes had occurred. 
  Polish Revolving Credit and Bonds Payable 
  With the acquisition of DTP in the second quarter of 2016, we assumed the outstanding debt of DTP which included revolving credit facilities and bonds. On July 29, 2016, we repaid the outstanding balance on the facilities and any fees and terminated the credit facilities. As of   September 30, 2016  , the outstanding balance of the bonds, which mature on June 25, 2017, was   $1.3 million  , with a weighted average interest rate of   5.91%  . 
  We believe we were in compliance with the covenants of our material financing arrangements as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 
  Undistributed Earnings of Foreign Subsidiaries 
  We intend to use remaining accumulated and future undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries to expand operations outside the United States; therefore, such undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries are considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. Accordingly, no provision for federal and state income tax has been provided thereon. If management's intentions change and eligible undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries are repatriated, we would be subject to additional U.S. income taxes, net of a possible adjustment for foreign tax credits, and withholding taxes payable to various foreign jurisdictions, where applicable. This could result in a higher effective tax rate in the period in which such a decision is made to repatriate accumulated or future undistributed foreign earnings. The amount of cash on hand related to foreign operations with permanently reinvested earnings was   $70.0 million   and   $51.5 million   as of   September 30,   2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Refer to the Notes of the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information related to our income taxes and undistributed foreign earnings. 
  Stockholders' Equity Attributable to PRA Group, Inc. 
  Stockholders' equity attributable to PRA Group, Inc. was   $937.7 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   $800.5 million   at   December 31, 2015  . The increase was primarily attributable to   $102.7 million   in net income during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and a $29.0 million increase in accumulated net foreign currency translation gains. 
  
   47 

Contractual Obligations 
  Our contractual obligations as of September 30, 2016 were as follows (amounts in thousands): 

(1) 
    This amount includes estimated interest and unused line fees due on our revolving credit and assumes that the outstanding balances on the revolving credit remain constant from the   September 30,   2016 balances to maturity. 
              (2) 
    This amount includes scheduled interest and principal payments on our term loans, our bonds payable and our convertible debt. 
              (3) 
    This amount includes the maximum remaining amount to be purchased under forward flow and other contracts for the purchase of defaulted finance receivables in the amount of approximately   $362.5 million  . 
     Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined by Item 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). 
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
  For a summary of recent accounting pronouncements and the anticipated effects on our consolidated financial statements see Note 12 "Recent Accounting Pronouncements" to the Consolidated Financial Statements as included in this Quarterly Report. 
   
  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
  Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements of our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on February 26, 2016. Our significant accounting policies are fundamental to understanding our results of operations and financial condition because they require that we use estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets, and liabilities. 
  Three of these policies are considered to be critical because they are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results, and because they require management to make judgments and estimates that are difficult, subjective, and complex regarding matters that are inherently uncertain. 
  We base our estimates on historical experience, current trends and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. If these estimates differ significantly from actual results, the impact on our consolidated financial statements may be material. 
  Management has reviewed these critical accounting policies with the Company's Audit Committee. 
  Revenue Recognition - Finance Receivables 
  We account for our investment in finance receivables under the guidance of ASC 310-30. Revenue recognition for finance receivables accounted for under ASC 310-30 involves the use of estimates and the exercise of judgment on the part of management. These estimates include projections of the quantity and timing of future cash flows and economic lives of our pools of finance receivables. Significant changes in such estimates could result in increased or decreased revenue or the incurrence of allowance charges. 
  
   48 

We implement the accounting for income recognized on finance receivables under ASC 310-30 as follows: 
  We create each accounting pool using our projections of estimated cash flows and expected economic life. We then compute the effective yield that fully amortizes the pool over a reasonable expectation of its economic life based on the current projections of estimated cash flows. As actual cash flow results are recorded, we balance those results to the data contained in our proprietary models to ensure accuracy, then review each pool watching for trends, actual performance versus projections and curve shape (a graphical depiction of the timing of cash flows), regularly re-forecasting future cash flows utilizing our statistical models. The review process is primarily performed by our finance staff; however, our operational and statistical staff are also involved, providing updated statistical input and cash projections to the finance staff. Significant judgment is used in evaluating whether overperformance is due to an increase in projected cash flows or an acceleration of cash flows (a timing difference). If determined to be a significant increase in expected cash flows, we will recognize the effect of the increase prospectively first through an adjustment to any previously recognized valuation allowance for that pool and then through an increase in yield. If the overperformance is determined to be due to a timing difference, we will: a) adjust estimated future cash flows downward which effectively extends the amortization period to fall within a reasonable expectation of the pool's economic life, b) adjust future cash flow projections as noted previously coupled with an increase in yield in order for the amortization period to fall within a reasonable expectation of the pool's economic life, or c) take no action at all if the amortization period falls within a reasonable expectation of the pool's expected economic life. To the extent there is underperformance, we will record an allowance if the underperformance is significant and will also consider revising estimated future cash flows based on current period information, or take no action if the pool's amortization period is reasonable and falls within the currently projected economic life. 
  Valuation of Acquired Intangibles and Goodwill 
  In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 350, "Intangibles-Goodwill and Other" ("ASC 350"), we amortize intangible assets over their estimated useful lives. Goodwill, pursuant to ASC 350, is not amortized but rather evaluated for impairment annually and more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist. Goodwill is reviewed for potential impairment at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment. 
  Goodwill is evaluated for impairment either under the qualitative assessment option or the two-step test approach depending on facts and circumstances of a reporting unit, including the excess of fair value over carrying amount in the last valuation or changes in business environment. If the Company qualitatively determines it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, the two-step impairment test is unnecessary. Otherwise, goodwill is evaluated for impairment using the two-step test, where the carrying amount of a reporting unit is compared to its fair value in Step 1; if the fair value exceeds the carrying amount, Step 2 is unnecessary. If the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit s fair value, this could indicate potential impairment and Step 2 of the goodwill evaluation process is required to determine if goodwill is impaired and to measure the amount of impairment loss to recognize, if any. When Step 2 is necessary, the fair value of individual assets and liabilities is determined using valuations (which in some cases may be based in part on third-party valuation reports), or other observable sources of fair value, as appropriate. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, the excess is recognized as an impairment loss. 
  We determine the fair value of a reporting unit by applying the approaches prescribed under the fair value measurement accounting framework, the income approach, the market approach, and the transaction approach. Depending on the availability of public data and suitable comparables, we may or may not use the market approach and the transaction approach or we may emphasize the results from the approaches differently. Under the income approach, we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows and a residual terminal value. Cash flow projections are based on management's estimates of revenue growth rates, operating margins, necessary working capital, and capital expenditure requirements, taking into consideration industry and market conditions. The discount rate used is based on the weighted-average cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with business-specific characteristics and the uncertainty related to the reporting unit's ability to execute on the projected cash flows. Under the market approach, we estimate fair value based on market multiples of revenue and earnings derived from comparable publicly-traded companies with operating and investment characteristics similar to the reporting unit. Under the transaction approach, we estimate fair value based on market multiples from comparable transactions where the acquisition target has similar operating and investment characteristics to the reporting unit. The transaction approach is less likely to be used given the lack of publicly available detailed data on transactions for comparable companies. 
  Income Taxes 
  We are subject to the income tax laws of the various jurisdictions in which we operate, including U.S. federal, state, local, and international jurisdictions. These tax laws are complex and are subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant government taxing authorities. When determining our domestic and foreign income tax expense, we must make judgments about the application of these inherently complex laws. 
  
   49 

We follow the guidance of FASB ASC Topic 740 "Income Taxes" ("ASC 740") as it relates to the provision for income taxes and uncertainty in income taxes. Accordingly, we record a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations. In accordance with ASC 740, the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carry-forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. The evaluation of a tax position in accordance with the guidance is a two-step process. The first step is recognition: the enterprise determines whether it is more-likely-than-not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. In evaluating whether a tax position has met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, the enterprise should presume that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that would have full knowledge of all relevant information. The second step is measurement: a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Tax positions that previously failed to meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold should be recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is met. Previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold should be derecognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met. We record interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. 
  In the event that all or part of the deferred tax assets are determined not to be realizable in the future, a valuation allowance would be established and charged to earnings in the period such determination is made. If we subsequently realize deferred tax assets that were previously determined to be unrealizable, the respective valuation allowance would be reversed, resulting in a positive adjustment to earnings in the period such determination is made. The establishment or release of a valuation allowance does not have an impact on cash, nor does such an allowance preclude the use of loss carry-forwards or other deferred tax assets in future periods. The calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with our expectations could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. 
  For domestic income tax purposes, we recognize revenue using the cost recovery method with respect to our debt purchasing business. We believe cost recovery to be an acceptable method for companies in the bad debt purchasing industry. Under the cost recovery method, collections on finance receivables are applied first to principal to reduce the finance receivables to zero before any income is recognized. 
  Our international expansion requires the use of material estimates and interpretations of complex tax laws in multiple jurisdictions, and increases the complexity of our accounting for income taxes. 
   
  Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
  Interest Rate Risk 
  We are subject to interest rate risk from outstanding borrowings on our variable rate credit facilities. As such, our consolidated financial results are subject to fluctuations due to changes in the market rate of interest. We assess this interest rate risk by estimating the increase or decrease in interest expense that would occur due to a change in short-term interest rates. The borrowings on our variable rate credit facilities were approximately   $1.6 billion   as of   September 30, 2016  . Assuming a 25 basis point decrease in interest rates, for example, interest expense over the following twelve months would decrease by an estimated   $3.1 million  . Assuming a 50 basis point increase in interest rates, interest expense over the following twelve months would increase by an estimated   $6.7 million  . 
  To reduce the exposure to changes in the market rate of interest, we have entered into interest rate swap agreements for a portion of our floating rate financing arrangements. The terms of the interest rate swap agreements require us to receive a variable interest rate and pay a fixed interest rate. For the majority of our floating rate financing arrangements, we have no interest rate swap agreements in place. The sensitivity calculations above consider the impact of our interest rate swap agreements. 
  The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements was a net liability of   $4.1 million   at   September 30, 2016  . A hypothetical 25 basis point decrease in interest rates would cause a decrease in the estimated fair value of our interest rate swap agreements and the resulting estimated fair value would be a liability of   $5.7 million   at   September 30, 2016  . Conversely, a hypothetical 50 basis point increase in interest rates would cause an increase in the estimated fair value of our interest rate swap agreements and the resulting estimated fair value would be a liability of   $0.3 million   at   September 30, 2016  . 
  
   50 

Currency Exchange Risk 
  We operate internationally and enter into transactions denominated in foreign currencies, including the euro, the Great British pound, the Canadian dollar, Norwegian kroner, Swiss franc, Danish kroner, Swedish krona, Polish zloty, Israeli shekel, and Brazilian real. In the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , we generated   $68.9 million   of revenues from operations outside the United States and used nine functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Weakness in one particular currency might be offset by strength in other currencies over time. 
  As a result of our international operations, fluctuations in foreign currencies could cause us to incur foreign currency exchange gains and losses, and could adversely affect our comprehensive income and stockholders' equity. Additionally, our reported financial results could change from period to period due solely to fluctuations between currencies. 
  Foreign currency exchange gains and losses are primarily the result of the re-measurement of account balances in certain currencies into an entity's functional currency. Foreign currency gains and losses are included as a component of other income and (expense) in our consolidated income statements. 
  When an entity's functional currency is different than the reporting currency of its parent, foreign currency translation adjustments may occur. Foreign currency translation adjustments are included as a component of other comprehensive (loss)/income in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income and as a component of equity in our consolidated balance sheets. 
  We have taken measures to mitigate the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. We have restructured our European operations so that portfolio ownership and collections generally occur within the same entity. Our European credit facility is a multi-currency facility, allowing us to borrow in the same currency as our entity's functional currency. We strive to maintain the distribution of our European borrowings within defined thresholds based on the currency composition of our finance receivables portfolios. When those thresholds are exceeded, we engage in foreign exchange spot transactions to mitigate our risk. 
   
  Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.   We maintain disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. We conducted an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on this evaluation, the principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that, as of   September 30, 2016  , our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.  
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting.   There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Part II. Other Information 
   
  Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
  For information regarding legal proceedings as of   September 30, 2016  , refer to Note 10 "Commitments and Contingencies" of our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report. 
   
  Item 1A. Risk Factors 
  There have been no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 26, 2016, except as follows: 
    
  The vote by the United Kingdom to leave the European Union, and the ultimate exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union, could adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. 
    
  On June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom ( UK ) voted to leave the European Union ( EU ).  Although the vote was advisory and had no binding legal effect, it nevertheless has adversely impacted global markets and resulted in a decline in the value of the British pound as compared to the US dollar and other currencies.  The UK s actual exit from the EU, commonly referred to as "Brexit", could take several years because the UK must first give notice to the EU of its intention to leave and the parties have two years from the date the notice is given to complete exit negotiations.  However, perceptions concerning the impact of the UK s withdrawal from the EU may adversely affect business activity, political stability and economic conditions in the UK, the EU and globally, which could in turn adversely affect European or worldwide political, regulatory, economic and financial market conditions. 
    
  As of   September 30,   2016, the total ERC of our UK portfolios constituted approximately 14% of our consolidated ERC.  We expect volatility in exchange rates in the short term as the UK negotiates its exit from the EU.  A weaker British pound compared to the US dollar during a reporting period could cause local currency results of our UK operations to be translated into fewer US dollars.  In the longer term, any impact from Brexit on our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on the final terms negotiated by the UK and the EU, including arrangements concerning taxes and financial services regulation.

    If all or part of a Facility A Loan is to be repaid from the proceeds of all or part of a new Facility A Loan to be made to the Borrowers then, as between each Lender and the Borrowers, the amount to be repaid by the Borrowers shall be set off against the amount to be advanced by that Lender in relation to the new Facility A Loan and the party to whom the smaller amount is to be paid shall pay to the other party a sum equal to the difference between the two amounts (in the currency of the outstanding Facility A Loan for the first Interest Period). 
              7.1.4 
    Subject to any terms of this Agreement expressly providing otherwise, the Borrowers may not prepay any Facility A Loan before the end of its Interest Period. On the Final Repayment Date the Borrowers shall repay any Facility A Loan then outstanding under this Agreement in full, together with all other sums due and outstanding under the Finance Documents at such date (if any). 
              7.2 
    Repayment of Facility B Loan 
     The Borrower shall repay the Facility B Loan in full on the Final Repayment Date.  
           7.3 
    Mandatory prepayment on Change of Control  
              7.3.1 
    Unless otherwise agreed by the Facility Agent (acting on the instructions of the Majority Lenders), ninety (90) days from the date a Change of Control occurs (a    Prepayment     Date   ): 
              a. 
    all Loans together with all incurred interest and all other amounts owing to under this Agreement shall be repaid in full; and 
              b. 
    the Lenders  obligations shall be terminated and each Lender s Commitments shall be cancelled. 
              7.3.2 
    For the purposes of this Agreement a    Change     of     Control    will occur if the Parent ceases to control directly or indirectly 2/3 of the voting rights of the Borrowers. 
              7.3.3 
    The Borrowers shall give the Facility Agent prompt notice when it becomes aware of a Change of Control or a proposed Change of Control. 

7.4 
    Mandatory prepayment - Disposal  
     Upon a Disposal of whole or part of an Existing Loan Portfolio or Approved Loan Portfolio (directly or indirectly through a sale of a Portfolio Owner or otherwise) the Borrowers shall no later than five (5) Business Days prior to such Disposal document to the Facility Agent s satisfaction that the Group will be in compliance with the LTV Ratio immediately after such Disposal.  
           7.5 
    Application of prepayments 
     Each mandatory prepayment shall be applied in pro rata in order of maturity.  
           7.6 
    Voluntary prepayment of Loans 
              7.6.1 
    The Borrowers may, by giving the Facility Agent not less than five (5) Business Days  prior notice, prepay the whole or part (but if in part, in a minimum amount of USD 1,000,000 and an integral multiple of USD 1,000,000 or such whole amount as, the Facility Agent may agree) of any Loan, however so that the Facility B Loan cannot be prepaid before all Facility A Loans have been prepaid and the Total Facility A Commitments have been cancelled in full. 
              7.6.2 
    Any notice of prepayment shall be irrevocable, shall specify the date on which the prepayment is to be made and the amount of the prepayment, and shall oblige the Borrowers to make that prepayment. The Facility Agent shall promptly notify the Lenders of receipt of any such notice. 
              7.7 
    Prepayment and breakage costs 
              7.1.1 
    Any prepayment shall be made together with accrued interest on the amount prepaid and any amounts payable under Clause 24.1 (  Breakage     costs     indemnity  ). 
              7.8 
    Voluntary cancellation of Facility 
              7.8.1

              7.8.2 
    Any notice of cancellation shall be irrevocable and shall specify the date on which the cancellation shall take effect and the amount of the cancellation. The Facility Agent shall promptly notify the Lenders of receipt of any such notice. 
              7.8.3 
    The Borrowers may not utilise any part of the Facility which has been cancelled. Any cancellation of the Facility shall reduce each Lender s Commitment rateably and shall reduce the Facility by the aggregate amount so cancelled. 
              8. 
    CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES 
               8.1.1 
    If it is or becomes illegal (including under any Sanctions Law) for a Lender to maintain all or part of its Commitment or to continue to make available or fund or maintain its Participation in all or any part of the Facility, then: 
              a. 
    that Lender shall notify the Facility Agent and Borrowers; 
              b. 
    the Commitment of that Lender shall be cancelled immediately; and 
              c. 
    the Obligors shall prepay to the Facility Agent (for the account of that Lender) that Lender s Participation in all Loans (together with accrued interest on the amount prepaid and all other amounts owing to that Lender under  

this Agreement) within fifteen (15) Business Days of demand by that Lender (or, if permitted by the relevant law, on the last day of the Interest Period of the relevant Loans);  
  Any such prepayment shall be subject to Clause 24.1 (  Breakage     costs     indemnity  ). 
            8.2.1 
    If a Change occurs which causes an Increased Cost (as defined in Clause 8.2.3) to a Lender (or any company of which that Lender is a Subsidiary) then each Obligor shall pay (as additional interest) to the Facility Agent (for the account of that Lender) within ten (10) Business Days of demand all amounts which that Lender certifies to be necessary to compensate that Lender (or any company of which that Lender is a Subsidiary) for the Increased Cost. 
              8.2.2 
    Any demand made under Clause 8.2.1 shall be made by the relevant Lender through the Facility Agent and shall set out in reasonable detail so far as is practicable the basis of computation of the Increased Cost. 
         Increased     Cost    means any cost to, or reduction in the amount payable to, or reduction in the return on capital or regulatory capital achieved by, a Lender (or any company of which that Lender is a Subsidiary) to the extent that it arises, directly or indirectly, as a result of the Change and is attributable to the Commitment of that Lender or its Participation in the Facility or the funding of that Lender s Participation in any Loan including but not limited to: 
           a. 
    any Tax Liability (other than Tax on Overall Net Income) incurred by that Lender; 
              b. 
    any changes in the basis or timing of Taxation of that Lender in relation to its Commitment or Participation in the Facility or to the funding of that Lender s Participation in any Loan; 
              c. 
    the cost to that Lender (or any company of which that Lender is a Subsidiary) of complying with, or the reduction in the amount payable to or reduction in the return on capital or regulatory capital achieved by that Lender (or any company of which that Lender is a Subsidiary) as a result of complying with, any capital adequacy or similar requirements howsoever arising, including as a result of an increase in the amount of capital to be allocated to the Facility or of a change to the weighting of that Lender s Commitment or Participation in that Facility; 
              d. 
    the cost to that Lender of complying with any reserve, cash ratio, special deposit or liquidity requirements (or any other similar requirements); and 
              e. 
    the amount of any fees payable by that Lender to any supervisory or regulatory authority. 
        Tax     Liability    means   inter     alia  , in respect of any person: 
           a. 
    any liability or any increase in the liability of that person to make any payment of or in respect of Tax; 

b. 
    the loss of any relief, allowance, deduction or credit in respect of Tax which would otherwise have been available to that person; 
              c. 
    the setting off against income, profits or gains or against any Tax liability of any relief, allowance, deduction or credit in respect of Tax which would otherwise have been available to that person; and 
              d. 
    the loss or setting off against any Tax liability of a right to repayment of Tax which would otherwise have been available to that person. 
     For the purposes of this definition of  Tax Liability , any question of whether or not any relief, allowance, deduction, credit or right to repayment of Tax has been lost or set off, and if so, the date on which that loss or set off took place, shall be conclusively determined by the relevant person. 
     Tax on Overall Net Income    means, in relation to a Lender, Tax (other than Tax deducted or withheld from any payment) imposed on the net profits of that Lender or its lending office by the jurisdiction in which its lending office or its head office is situated. 
           8.2.4 
    The Obligors shall not be obliged to make a payment in respect of an Increased Cost under this Clause 8.2 if and to the extent that the Increased Cost has been compensated for by the operation of Clause 19.9 (  Grossing-up  ) or the cost is attributable to a FATCA Deduction required to be made by an Obligor or a Finance Party. 
              8.2.5 
    If the Obligors are required to pay any amount to a Lender under this Clause 8.2, then, without prejudice to that obligation and so long as the circumstances giving rise to the relevant Increased Cost are continuing and subject to the Borrowers giving the Facility Agent and that Lender not less than 10 days  prior notice (which shall be irrevocable), the Obligors may prepay all, but not part, of that Lender s Participation in the Loans together with accrued interest on the amount prepaid. Any such prepayment shall be subject to Clause 24.1 (  Breakage costs indemnity  ). On any such prepayment the Commitment of the relevant Lender shall be automatically cancelled. 
               8.3.1 
    If, in relation to a Loan and a particular Interest Period: 
              a. 
    at or about noon on the second Business Days prior to the relevant Interest Period,  the Screen Rate is not available and none or only one of the Reference Banks supplies a rate to the Facility Agent to determine the relevant IBOR for the relevant currency and Interest Period; or 
              b. 
    the Facility Agent has been notified by a group of Lenders, who together exceed 40 per cent of the Total Commitments, that in their opinion: 
              i. 
    matching deposits would not be available to them in the relevant interbank market in the ordinary course of business to fund their Participations in that Loan for that Interest Period; or 
              ii. 
    the cost to them of obtaining matching deposits in the relevant interbank market would be in excess of IBOR for that Interest Period, 
     the Facility Agent shall promptly notify the Borrowers and the Lenders of that event (such notice being a    Market Disruption Notice   ). 

8.3.2 
    If a Market Disruption Notice applies to a proposed Loan, that Loan shall not be made. Instead, the Facility Agent and the Borrowers shall immediately enter into negotiations for a period of not more than 30 days with a view to agreeing a substitute basis for calculating the interest rate for the Loan or for funding the Loan. Any substitute basis agreed by the Facility Agent (with the consent of all the Lenders) and the Borrowers shall take effect in accordance with its terms and be binding on all the Parties. 
              8.3.3 
    If a Market Disruption Notice applies to an outstanding Loan then: 
              a. 
    the Facility Agent and the Borrowers shall immediately enter into negotiations for a period of not more than 30 days with a view to agreeing a substitute basis for calculating the rate of interest for the Loan or for funding the Loan; 
              b. 
    any substitute basis agreed under Clause 8.3.3(a) by the Facility Agent (with the consent of all the Lenders) and the Borrowers shall take effect in accordance with its terms and be binding on all the Parties; 
              c. 
    if no substitute basis is agreed under Clause 8.3.3(a), then, subject to Clause 8.3.4, each Lender shall (through the Facility Agent) certify before the last day of the Interest Period to which the Market Disruption Notice relates a substitute basis for maintaining its Participation in the Loan which shall reflect the cost to the Lender of funding its Participation in the Loan from whatever sources it selects plus the Applicable Margin; and 
              d. 
    each substitute basis so certified shall be binding on the relevant Obligor and the certifying Lender and treated as part of this Agreement. 
              8.3.4 
    If no substitute basis is agreed under Clause 8.3.3(a), then, so long as the circumstances giving rise to the Market Disruption Notice continue and subject to the Borrowers giving the Facility Agent and the Lenders not less than ten (10) days  prior notice (which shall be irrevocable), the relevant Obligor may prepay the Loan to which the Market Disruption Notice applies together with accrued interest on the amount prepaid. Any such prepayment shall be subject to Clause 24.1 (  Breakage costs indemnity  ). 
               8.4.1 
    If any circumstances arise in respect of any Lender which would, or upon the giving of notice would, result in the operation of Clause 19.9 (  Grossing-up  ),6.6 (  Minimum interest  ), 8.1 (  Illegality  ), 8.2 (  Increased     Costs  ) or 8.3 (  Market     disruption  ) to the detriment of any Obligor, then that Lender shall: 
              a. 
    promptly upon becoming aware of those circumstances and their results, notify the Facility Agent and the Borrowers; and 
              b. 
    in consultation with the Facility Agent and the Borrowers, take all such steps as are reasonably open to it to mitigate the effects of those circumstances (including changing its lending office in a manner which will avoid the circumstances in question and on terms acceptable to the Facility Agent, the Borrowers and that Lender), 
     provided that no Lender shall be obliged to take any steps which in its opinion would be likely to have an adverse effect on its business or financial condition or the management of its Tax affairs or cause it to incur any material costs or expenses without being reimbursed therefor. 

8.4.2 
    Nothing in this Clause 8.4 shall limit, reduce, affect or otherwise qualify the rights of any Lender or the obligations of the Obligors under Clauses 19.9 (  Grossing-up  ), 6.6 (  Minimum interest),   8.1 (  Illegality  ), 8.2 (  Increased Cost  s) or 8.3 (  Market disruption  ). 
      The certificate or notification of the Facility Agent or, as the case may be, the relevant Lender as to any of the matters referred to in this Clause 8 shall be in reasonable detail and shall be conclusive and binding on the Obligors except for any manifest error. 
           9. 
    FEES AND EXPENSES 
      The Borrowers shall on demand (including a specification) pay all evidenced expenses properly incurred (including legal fees, valuation and accounting fees and other out-of-pocket expenses, but only to the extent the same are reasonable in amount), and any VAT (direct or by reverse charge) on those expenses incurred: 
           a. 
    by the Bookrunner in connection with the negotiation, preparation, syndication and execution of the Finance Documents and the other documents contemplated by the Finance Documents; 
              b. 
    by an Agent in connection with the taking of any security in accordance with Clause 11.10.4(a) (  Security  ); 
              c. 
    by an Agent or the Lenders in connection with the granting of any release, waiver or consent or in connection with any amendment or variation of any Finance Document;  
              d. 
    by an Agent or the Lenders in enforcing, perfecting, protecting or preserving (or attempting so to do) any of their rights, or in suing for or recovering any sum due from an Obligor or any other person under any Finance Document, or in investigating any Default or Potential Default;  
              e. 
    by an Agent in connection with any cost of engaging any person in connection with any due diligence process to be performed pursuant to the terms of this Agreement;  
              f. 
    any default by any Obligor in the performance of any of the obligations expressed to be assumed by it in the Finance Documents; and 
              g. 
    by an Agent in connection with any cost of engaging an Auditor pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.  
      The Borrowers shall pay the fees as set out in the Fee Letter(s). 
   Where in any Finance Document an Obligor has an obligation to indemnify or reimburse an Agent, the Bookrunner or a Lender in respect of any loss or payment, the calculation of the amount payable by way of indemnity or reimbursement shall take account of the Tax treatment in the hands of the Agent, the Bookrunner or the relevant Lender, as the case may be, (as conclusively determined by the relevant party) of the amount payable by way 

of indemnity or reimbursement and of the loss or payment in respect of which that amount is payable. 
           10. 
    Taxes And tax Indemnities 
      In this Agreement: 
     Protected Party    means a Finance Party which is or will be subject to any liability or required to make any payment for or on account of Tax in relation to a sum received or receivable (or any sum deemed for the purposes of Tax to be received or receivable) under a Finance Document. 
     Tax Credit    means a credit against, relief or remission for, or repayment of, any Tax. 
     Tax Deduction    means a deduction or withholding for or on account of Tax from a payment under a Finance Document, other than a FATCA Deduction. 
     Tax Payment    means either the increase in a payment made by an Obligor to a Finance Party under Clause 6.6 (Minimum interest) Clause 10.2 (  Taxes  ) or a payment under Clause 10.3 (  Tax indemnity  ). 
            a. 
    All payments by an Obligor under the Finance Documents shall be made free and clear of and without deduction or withholding for or on account of any Tax or any other governmental or public payment imposed by the laws of any jurisdiction from which or through which such payment is made, unless a Tax deduction or withholding is required by law.  
              b. 
    Any Obligor shall promptly upon becoming aware that it must make a Tax deduction or withholding (or that there is any change in the rate or the basis of a Tax deduction or withholding) notify the Agent accordingly. Similarly, a Lender shall notify the Agent on becoming so aware in respect of a payment payable to that Lender. If the Agent receives such notification from a Lender it shall notify the relevant Obligor. 
              c. 
    If a Tax deduction or withholding is required by law to be made by an Obligor: 
              i. 
    the amount of the payment due from that Obligor shall be increased to an amount which (after making any Tax deduction or withholding) leaves an amount equal to the payment which would have been due if no Tax deduction or withholding had been required (tax gross-up); and 
              ii. 
    the Obligor shall make that Tax deduction or withholding within the time allowed and in the minimum amount required by law.  
              d. 
    Within thirty (30) days of making either a Tax deduction or withholding or any payment required in connection with that Tax deduction or withholding, the Borrowers shall deliver to the Agent for the Finance Party entitled to the payment evidence reasonably satisfactory to that Finance Party that the Tax deduction or  

withholding has been made or (as applicable) any appropriate payment paid to the relevant taxing authority. 
            a. 
    The Borrowers shall (within three Business Days of demand by the Agent) pay to a Protected Party an amount equal to the loss, liability or cost which that Protected Party determines will be or has been (directly or indirectly) suffered for or on account of Tax by that Protected Party in respect of a Finance Document. 
              b. 
    Paragraph (a) above shall not apply: 
              i. 
    with respect to any Tax assessed on a Finance Party: 
              a. 
    under the law of the jurisdiction in which that Finance Party is incorporated or, if different, the jurisdiction (or jurisdictions) in which that Finance Party is treated as resident for tax purposes; or 
              b. 
    under the law of the jurisdiction in which that Finance Party s Facility Office is located in respect of amounts received or receivable in that jurisdiction, 
     if that Tax is imposed on or calculated by reference to the net income received or receivable (but not any sum deemed to be received or receivable) by that Finance Party; or 
           ii. 
    to the extent a loss, liability or cost is compensated for by an increased payment under Clause 6.6 (  Minimum interest  ), Clause 10.2 (  Taxes  ) or relates to a FATCA Deduction required to be made by a Party 
              c. 
    A Protected Party making, or intending to make a claim under paragraph (a) above shall promptly notify the Agent of the event which will give, or has given, rise to the claim, following which the Agent shall notify the Borrowers. 
              d. 
    A Protected Party shall, on receiving a payment from an Obligor under this Clause 10.3, notify the Agent. 
      If an Obligor makes a Tax Payment and the relevant Finance Party determines that: 
           a. 
    a Tax Credit is attributable either to an increased payment of which that Tax Payment forms part or to that Tax Payment; and 
              b. 
    that Finance Party has effectively and definitively obtained, utilised and retained that Tax Credit, 
     the Finance Party shall pay an amount to the Obligor which that Finance Party determines will leave it (after that payment) in the same after-Tax position as it would have been in had the Tax Payment not been required to be made by the Obligor. Nothing in this clause shall interfere with the corresponding Finance Party s right to arrange its tax affairs in whatever manner it thinks fit.  

The Parent shall pay and, within three Business Days of demand, indemnify each Secured Party and Arranger against any cost, loss or liability that Secured Party or Arranger incurs in relation to all transfer tax, stamp duty, judicial duties, registration and other similar Taxes payable in respect of the formalisation, execution, performance or enforcement of any Finance Document. 
            a. 
    All amounts set out, or expressed to be payable under a Finance Document shall be deemed to be exclusive of any VAT. If VAT is chargeable, the relevant Obligor shall pay to the Agent for the account of such Finance Party (in addition to the amount required pursuant to the Finance Documents) an amount equal to such VAT. 
              b. 
    Where a Finance Document requires any Party to reimburse or indemnify a Finance Party for any cost or expense, that Party shall reimburse or indemnify (as the case may be) such Finance Party for the full amount of such cost or expense, including such part thereof as represents VAT, save to the extent that such Finance Party reasonably determines that it is entitled to credit or repayment in respect of such VAT from the relevant tax authority. 
              c. 
    Any relation to any supply made by a Finance Party to any other Party under a Finance Document, as requested by such Finance Party, that Party must promptly provide such Finance Party with details of that Party s VAT registration and such other information as is reasonably requested in connection with such Finance Party s VAT reporting requirements in relation to such supply.  
              d. 
    Any reference in this Clause 10.6 to any Party shall, at any time when such Party is treated as a member of a group for VAT purposes, include (where appropriate and unless the context requires otherwise) a reference to the person who is treated as that time as making the supply, or (as appropriate) receiving the supply, under the grouping rules (provided for in Article 11 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC (or as implemented by the relevant member state of the European Union) so that a reference to a Party shall be construed as a reference to that Party or the relevant group or entity (or fiscal unity) of which that Party is a member for VAT purposes at the relevant time or the relevant representative member (or representative or head) of that group or entity at the relevant time (as the case may be).  
               a. 
    Subject to paragraph (c) below, each Party shall, within ten (10) Business Days of a reasonable request by another Party: 
              i. 
    confirm to that other Party whether it is: 
              a. 
    a FATCA Exempt Party; or 
              b. 
    not a FATCA Exempt Party;  
              ii. 
    supply to that other Party such forms, documentation and other information relating to its status under FATCA as that other Party reasonably requests for the purposes of that other Party s compliance with FATCA. 

iii. 
    supply to that other Party such forms, documentation and other information relating to its status as that other Party reasonably requests for the purposes of that other Party s compliance with any other law, regulation, or exchange of information regime.  
              b. 
    If a Party confirms to another Party pursuant to 10.7 (i) above that it is a FATCA Exempt Party and it subsequently becomes aware that it is not, or has ceased to be a FATCA Exempt Party, that Party shall notify that other Party reasonably promptly. 
              c. 
    Paragraph (a) above shall not oblige any Finance Party to do anything, and paragraph (a)(iii) above shall not oblige any other Party to do anything, which would or might in its reasonable opinion constitute a breach of: 
              i. 
    any law or regulation; 
              ii. 
    any fiduciary duty; or 
              iii. 
    any duty of confidentiality.  
              d. 
    If a Party fails to confirm whether or not it is a FATCA Exempt Party or to supply forms, documentation or other information requested in accordance with paragraph (a)(i) or (ii) above (including, for the avoidance of doubt, where paragraph (c) above applies), then such Party shall be treated for the purposes of the Finance Documents (and payments under them) as if it is not a FATCA Exempt Party until such time as the Party in question provides the requested confirmation, forms, documentation or other information. 
               a. 
    Each Party may make any FATCA Deduction it is required to make by FATCA, and any payment required in connection with that FATCA Deduction, and no Party shall be required to increase any payment in respect of which it makes such a FATCA Deduction or otherwise compensate the recipient of the payment for that FATCA Deduction. 
              b. 
    Each Party shall promptly, upon becoming aware that it must make a FATCA Deduction (or that there is any change in the rate or the basis of such FATCA Deduction), notify the Party to whom it is making the payment and, in addition, shall notify the Company and the Agent and the Agent shall notify the other Finance Parties. 
      The Borrowers shall (or shall procure that an Obligor will), within three Business Days of demand, indemnify each Finance Party against any cost, loss or liability incurred by that Finance Party as a result of: 
           a. 
    the occurrence of any Default; 
              b. 
    a failure by an Obligor to pay any amount due under a Finance Document on its due date, including without limitation, any cost, loss or liability arising as a result of Clause 17; 

c. 
    funding, or making arrangements to fund, its participation in a Loan requested by a Borrower (or the Parent on its behalf) in a Utilisation Request but not made by reason of the operation of any one or more of the provisions of this Agreement (other than by reason of default or negligence by that Finance Party alone); 
              d. 
    any claim, action, civil penalty or fine against, any settlement, and any other kind of loss or liability, and all reasonable costs and expenses under any Finance Documents (including reasonable counsel fees and disbursements) incurred by the Agent or any Finance Party as a result of conduct of any Obligor or any of their partners, directors, officers or employees, that violates any Sanctions Laws; or 
              e. 
    a Loan (or part of a Loan) not being prepaid in accordance with a notice of prepayment given by a Borrower. 
              11. 
    ON DEMAND GUARANTEE AND INDEMNITY 
      Each Guarantor hereby irrevocably and unconditionally jointly and severally, but subject to any limitations set out in Clause 11.10 (  Limitations  ) or any equivalent limitations set out in any Accession Agreement by which such Guarantor became party hereto; 
           a. 
    guarantees to each Finance Party, as and for its own debt as principal obligor and not merely as a surety, punctual performance by each Obligor of all that Obligor s obligations under the Finance Documents; 
              b. 
    undertakes with each Finance Party that whenever another Obligor does not pay any amount when due under or in connection with any Finance Document, that Guarantor shall immediately on demand pay that amount as if it was the principal obligor; and 
              c. 
    undertakes to indemnify each Finance Party it will, as an independent and primary obligation, on the Facility Agent s first demand against any cost, loss, expense, damage or liability suffered by that Finance Party if any obligation guaranteed by it is or becomes unenforceable, invalid or illegal. The amount of the cost, loss or liability shall be equal to the amount which that Finance Party would otherwise have been entitled to recover. 
     A statement in writing by the Agent setting out the amount due and payable hereunder is binding and conclusive evidence against the Guarantor as to the obligation to pay such amount subject to the maximum amount stated in paragraph (b) above. 
   This guarantee is a continuing guarantee and will extend to ultimate balance of sums payable by any Obligor under the Finance Documents, regardless of any intermediate payment or discharge in whole or in part. 
   There is no limit on the number of claims that may be made by the Agent (on behalf of the Finance Parties) under this Agreement. 

If any payment by an Obligor or any discharge given by a Finance Party (whether in respect of the obligations of any Obligor or any security for those obligations or otherwise) is avoided or reduced as a result of insolvency or any similar event: 
           a. 
    the liability of each Obligor shall continue as if the payment, discharge, avoidance or reduction had not occurred; and 
              b. 
    each Finance Party shall be entitled to recover the value or amount of that security or payment from each Obligor, as if the payment, discharge, avoidance or reduction had not occurred. 
      The obligations of each Guarantor under this Clause 10 will not be affected by any act, omission, matter or thing which would reduce, release or prejudice any of its obligations under this Clause 10 (without limitation and whether or not known to it or any Finance Party) including but not limited to: 
           a. 
    any time, waiver or consent granted to, or composition with, any Obligor or other person; 
              b. 
    the release of any other Obligor or any other person under the terms of any composition or arrangement with any creditor of any member of the Group, including for the avoidance of doubt the liquidation of the Dormant Companies as set out in Clause 13.3.12 (b) and the increase of the Total Commitment in accordance with Clause 2.3; 
              c. 
    the taking, variation, compromise, exchange, renewal or release of, or refusal or neglect to perfect, take up or enforce, any rights against, or security over assets of, any Obligor or other person or any non-presentation or non-observance of any formality or other requirement in respect of any instrument or any failure to realise the full value of any security; 
              d. 
    any incapacity or lack of power, authority or legal personality of or dissolution or change in the members or status of an Obligor or any other person; 
              e. 
    any amendment (however fundamental) or replacement of a Finance Document or any other document or security, including for the avoidance of doubt the liquidation of the Dormant Companies as set out in Clause 13.3.12 (b) and the increase of the Total Commitment in accordance with Clause 2.3; 
              f. 
    any unenforceability, illegality or invalidity of any obligation of any person under any Finance Document or any other document or security; or 
              g. 
    any insolvency or similar proceedings. 
      Each Guarantor waives any right it may have of first requiring any Finance Party (or any agent on its behalf) to proceed against or enforce any other rights or security or claim payment from any person before claiming from that Guarantor under this Clause 10. This waiver applies irrespective of any law or any provision of a Finance Document to the contrary. 

Each Guarantor incorporated under the laws of Spain waives its rights of benefits of execution (  excusion  ), order (  orden  ) and division (  division  ).  
   Until all amounts which may be or become payable by the Obligors under or in connection with the Finance Documents have been irrevocably paid in full, each Finance Party and (or any agent on its behalf) may: 
           a. 
    refrain from applying or enforcing any other moneys, security or rights held or received by that Finance Party (or any agent on its behalf) in respect of those amounts, or apply and enforce the same in such manner and order as it sees fit (whether against those amounts or otherwise) and no Guarantor shall be entitled to the benefit of the same; and 
              b. 
    hold in an interest-bearing suspense account any moneys received from any Guarantor or on account of any Guarantor s liability under this Clause 10. 
      Until all amounts which may be or become payable by the Obligors under or in connection with the Finance Documents have been irrevocably paid in full and unless the Facility Agent otherwise directs, no Guarantor will exercise any rights which it may have by reason of performance by each of its obligations under the Finance Documents: 
           a. 
    to be indemnified by an Obligor and/or any Group Company; 
              b. 
    to claim any contribution from any other guarantor of any Obligor s and/or Group Company s obligations under the Finance Documents;  
              c. 
    to take the benefit (in whole or in part and whether by way of subrogation or otherwise) of any rights of the Finance Parties under the Finance Documents or of any other guarantee or security taken pursuant to, or in connection with, the Finance Documents by any Finance Party; and/or 
              d. 
    to make any objection to pay on first demand. 
      This guarantee is in addition to and is not in any way prejudiced by any other guarantee or security now or subsequently held by any Finance Party.  
    As required by Section 61 (2) of the Norwegian Financial Contracts Act 1999, the following information is given to each Guarantor: 

a. 
    in addition to the guarantees created under this Clause 10, Clause 12.1 (  Security     Documents  ) to this Agreement contains a list of all pledges, mortgages, guarantees and other security created as at the date of this hereof pursuant to this Agreement; 
              b. 
    as of the date of this Agreement, no Default Notice has been issued pursuant to this Agreement; and 
              c. 
    the guarantee created by each Guarantor hereunder is created in respect of obligations which have not been incurred prior to the creation of such guarantee. 
              11.10.2 
    The obligations of each Guarantor shall furthermore be limited to such mandatory provisions of law applicable to such Guarantor limiting the legal capacity or ability of the relevant Guarantors to grant a guarantee hereunder, it being understood by each Guarantor that if a limitation no longer is applicable such limitation will no longer be applicable to the guarantee set out herein.   
              11.10.3 
    If a payment by a Guarantor has been made in contravention of the limitations contained in Clause 11.10, the Finance Parties shall not be liable for any damages in relation thereto and the maximum amount repayable by the Finance Parties as a consequence of such contravention shall be the amount received from the Guarantor. 
               a. 
    The obligations of a Guarantor incorporated in Norway (each a    Norwegian Guarantor   ) under the Guarantees will be limited by mandatory provisions of law applicable to the Norwegian Guarantor limiting the legal capacity or ability of the Norwegian Guarantor to provide a guarantee as provided for under this Clause 11 (including, but not limited to, the provisions of Sections 8-7 and 8-10, cf. 1-3, of the Norwegian Companies Acts of 1997.  
              b. 
    The limitations set out in paragraph (a) above shall apply mutatis mutandis to any Security provided by any Norwegian Guarantor under the Finance Documents and to any guarantee, undertaking, obligation, indemnity and payment, including but not limited to distributions, cash-sweeps, credits, loans and set-offs, pursuant to or permitted by the Finance Documents in relation to a Norwegian Guarantor; 
              c. 
    If a payment or the honouring of any Security by a Norwegian Guarantor has been made in contravention of the limitations contained in this Clause 11, the Finance Parties shall not be liable for any damages in relation thereto, and the maximum amount repayable by the Finance Parties as a consequence of such contravention shall be the amount received from that Norwegian Guarantor; and 
              d. 
    If any limitation is no longer applicable as a mandatory provision under Norwegian law, such limitation will no longer apply to the Guarantee or Security provided by a Norwegian Guarantor. 
      Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to create any obligation of a Guarantor incorporated in Austria (an    Austrian Guarantor   ) to act in violation of mandatory Austrian capital maintenance rules (Kapitalerhaltungsvorschriften), including, without limitation,   82 et seq. of the Austrian Act on Limited Liability Companies (Gesetz  ber Gesellschaften mit beschr nkter Haftung - GmbHG) and   52 et seq. of the Austrian Act on Joint Stock Companies (Aktiengesetz - AktG) (the "  Austrian Capital Maintenance Rules  "), and all obligations of an Austrian Guarantor under this Clause 11  

(  On Demand Guarantee and Indemnity  ) and under any other provision in a Finance Document shall be limited in accordance with Austrian Capital Maintenance Rules. 
  If and to the extent the payment obligations of an Austrian Guarantor under this Clause 11 and/or under any other provision in a Finance Document would not be permitted under Austrian Capital Maintenance Rules, then such payment obligations shall be limited to the maximum amount permitted to be paid under Austrian Capital Maintenance Rules. According to the Parties' understanding of the Austrian Capital Maintenance Rules as of the date hereof, the amount secured is not less than (i) that Austrian Guarantor's balance sheet profit (including retained earnings) (Bilanzgewinn) as defined in   224 (3) lit A no. IV of the Austrian Enterprise Code (Unternehmensgesetzbuch - UGB) as calculated by reference to the most recent (audited, if applicable) financial statements of that Austrian Guarantor then available, plus (ii) any other amounts which are freely available or can be converted into amounts freely available for distribution to the shareholder(s) under the GmbHG or AktG (as the case may be) and the UGB (such as, for instance, unrestricted reserves (freie R cklagen)) at the time or times payment under or pursuant to this Clause 11 is requested from an Austrian Guarantor, plus, (iii) to the extent applicable, the equivalent of the aggregate Loans (plus any accrued interest, commission and fee thereon) borrowed by that Austrian Guarantor in its capacity as Borrower, plus (iv) to the extent applicable, the equivalent of the aggregate Loans (plus any accrued interest, commission and fees thereon) borrowed by any other Obligor under this Agreement and made available to that Austrian Guarantor and/or its Subsidiaries plus (v) the amount of any indebtedness capable of being discharged by way of setting-off that Austrian Guarantor's recourse claim following an enforcement of this guarantee against any indebtedness owed by that Austrian Guarantor to another Obligor. 
  If and to the extent the assumption or enforcement of any such payment obligation or liability of an Austrian Guarantor under this Clause 11 and/or under any other provision in a Finance Document would expose any officer of an Austrian Guarantor to personal liability or criminal responsibility such obligation or liability shall be limited to the maximum amount then permissible under Austrian Capital Maintenance Rules. 
  No reduction of an amount enforceable hereunder pursuant to these limitations will prejudice the rights of the Finance Parties or the Agent acting for and on behalf of the Finance Parties to continue enforcing their or his rights under this guarantee (subject always to the limitations set out in this Clause 11) until full satisfaction of the Obligors' obligations under the Finance Documents. 
            a. 
    If and to the extent that a Guarantor incorporated in Switzerland (a "  Swiss Guaranto  r") becomes liable under the Finance Documents for obligations of its Affiliates other than its Subsidiaries and if complying with such obligations would be restricted under then applicable Swiss corporate law (the "  Restricted Obligations  "), the aggregate liability of the Swiss Guarantor for Restricted Obligations shall be limited to the amount of unrestricted equity capital surplus (including the unrestricted portion of general and statutory reserves, other free reserves, retained earnings and, to the extent permitted by then applicable law, current net profits) available for distribution as dividends to the shareholders of the Swiss Guarantor (the "  Maximum Amount  "), provided that this is a requirement under then applicable mandatory Swiss law and understood that such limitation shall not free the  

Swiss Guarantor from its obligations in excess of the Maximum Amount, but that it shall merely postpone the performance date of those obligations until such time or times as performance is again permitted. 
           b. 
    Immediately after having been requested to perform the Restricted Obligations under the Finance Documents, the Swiss Guarantor shall (i) perform any obligations which are not affected by the above limitations, and (ii) in respect of any balance, if and to the extent requested by the Facility Agent or required under then applicable Swiss law, provide the Facility Agent with an interim balance sheet audited by the statutory auditors of the Swiss Guarantor setting out the Maximum Amount, take any further corporate and other action as may be required by the Facility Agent (such as board and shareholders' approvals and the receipt of any confirmations from the Swiss Guarantor's statutory auditors) and other measures required to allow the Swiss Guarantor to make the payments agreed hereunder with a minimum of limitations and, immediately thereafter, pay up to the Maximum Amount to the Facility Agent. 
              c. 
    In relation to payments made hereunder in satisfaction of Restricted Obligations, the Swiss Guarantor shall: 
              i. 
    if and to the extent required by applicable law and subject to any applicable double tax treaties in force at the relevant time: 
              (A) 
    deduct Swiss Withholding Tax at the rate of 35 per cent. (or such other rate as is in force at that time) from any such payment; 
              (B) 
    pay any such deduction to the Swiss Federal Tax Administration; and 
              (C) 
    notify and provide evidence to the Facility Agent that the Swiss Withholding Tax has been paid to the Swiss Federal Tax Administration; 
              ii. 
    as soon as possible after a deduction for Swiss Withholding Tax is made as required by applicable law: 
              (A) 
    ensure that any person which is entitled to a full or partial refund of the Swiss Withholding Tax, is in a position to be so refunded; and 
              (B) 
    in case it has received any refund of the Swiss Withholding Tax, pay such refund to the Agent promptly upon receipt thereof. 
              d. 
    For the avoidance of doubt, where a deduction for Swiss Withholding Tax is required pursuant to paragraph (c) above, the obligations of the Obligors under Clause 6.5 (  Minimum interest  ), Clause 10.2 (  Taxes  ), Clause 19.9 (  Grossing-up  ) and Clause 10.3 (  Tax indemnity  ) of this Agreement shall remain applicable, save to the extent and for as long as that would cause the Maximum Amount to be exceeded. 
              e. 
    If the enforcement of Restricted Obligations would be limited due to the effects referred to in this Clause 11.10.6, then the Swiss Guarantor shall (i) to the extent permitted by applicable law, revalue and/or realize any of its assets that are shown on its balance sheet with a book value that is significantly lower than the market value of such assets, and (ii) reduce its share capital to the minimum allowed under then applicable law. 

a. 
    To the extent that the guarantee and indemnity created under this Clause 11 (the "  Guarantee  ") is granted by a German guarantor incorporated in Germany as a limited liability company (  GmbH  ) (each a "  German Guarantor  ") and the Guarantee of the German Guarantor guarantees amounts which are owed by direct or indirect shareholders of the German Guarantor or Subsidiaries of such shareholders (with the exception of Subsidiaries which are also Subsidiaries of the German Guarantor), the Guarantee of the German Guarantor shall be subject to the limitations set out in the following paragraphs of this Clause 11.10.7. In relation to any other amounts guaranteed, the Guarantee of the German Guarantor remains unlimited. 
              b. 
    Subject to paragraphs (d) to(n) below, the Agent shall not be entitled to enforce the Guarantee to the extent that the German Guarantor demonstrates before the enforcement that such enforcement has the effect of: 
              i. 
    reducing the German Guarantor's net assets (  Nettoverm gen   within the German law meaning of that term) (the "  Net Assets  ") to an amount less than its stated share capital (  Stammkapital   within the German law meaning of that term) (such reduction being a   Begr ndung einer Unterbilanz   within the German law meaning of that term); or 
              ii. 
    (if its Net Assets are already lower than its stated share capital) causing such amount to be further reduced (  Vertiefung einer Unterbilanz   within the German law meaning of that term), 
              c. 
    and thereby contravenes the obligatory preservation of its stated share capital according to    30, 31 German GmbH-Act (  GmbH-Gesetz  ) (the "  GmbH-Act  ") ("  Limitation on Enforcement  " or "  Limitation Event  "). For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent the enforcement of the Guarantee will result in a fully valuable recourse claim (  vollwertiger R ckgriffsanspruch  ) within the meaning of sentence 2 of paragraph 1 of   30 GmbH-Act ("  Recourse Claim  ") of the German Guarantor against a third party including a shareholder or another member of the Group, no Limitation on Enforcement applies and no Limitation Event occurs. 
              d. 
    The value of the Net Assets shall be determined in accordance with German GAAP consistently applied by the German Guarantor in preparing its unconsolidated balance sheets (  Jahresabschluss   according to   42 GmbH-Act,    242, 264 German Commercial Code (Handelsgesetzbuch - HGB)) in the previous years, save that: 
              i. 
    the amount of any increase of the stated share capital (  Stammkapita  l) of the German Guarantor registered after the date of this Agreement without the prior written consent of the Majority Lenders shall be deducted from the relevant stated share capital; 
              ii. 
    loans provided to the relevant German Guarantor by a member of the Group or by a direct or indirect shareholders of that German Guarantor shall be disregarded if they are subordinated by an agreement in the sense of   19 para. 2, 2nd sentence of the German Insolvency Code (  Insolvenzordnung  ); and 

iii. 
    loans and other liabilities incurred in violation of the provisions of any Finance Document shall be disregarded. 
              e. 
    The Limitation on Enforcement shall only apply if and to the extent that the managing director(s) (  Gesch ftsf hrer  ) on behalf of the respective German Guarantor have confirmed in writing to the Agent within ten Business Days following the Agent's demand under the Guarantee (i) the amount of the German Guarantor's Net Assets and (ii) to what extent the demanded payment would lead to the occurrence of a Limitation Event (the "  Management Determination  "), provided that until and including the earlier of (A) the date falling ten Business Days after the Agent's demand under the Guarantee and (B) the date of delivery of the Management Determination to the Agent, the right to enforce the Guarantee (whether in full or in part) shall be suspended. 
              f. 
    If the Agent disagrees with the Management Determination, the Agent (acting on behalf of the Finance Parties) shall nevertheless be entitled to enforce the Guarantee up to such amount, which is undisputed between itself and the relevant German Guarantor in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (e) above, provided that the Agent may only distribute any proceeds of such enforcement to any other Finance Party (in accordance with the relevant provisions of this Agreement) after receipt, and, subject to paragraph (l) below, on the basis of, the Auditor's Determination (as defined below). In relation to the amount which is disputed, the Agent and such German Guarantor shall instruct a firm of auditors of international standing and reputation to determine within 45 calendar days (or such longer period as has been agreed between the Company and the Agent) from the date the Agent has contested the Management Determination in writing to the relevant German Guarantor (i) the amount of the German Guarantor's Net Assets and (ii) to what extent the demanded payment would lead to the occurrence of a Limitation Event (the "  Auditor's Determination  "). If the Agent and the German Guarantor do not agree on the appointment of a joint auditor within five (5) Business Days from the date the Agent has disputed the Management Determination in writing to the relevant German Guarantor, the Agent shall be entitled to appoint auditors of international standing and reputation in its reasonable discretion. Without prejudice to paragraph (l) below, the amounts determined in the Auditor's Determination shall be (except for manifest error) binding on all Parties. The costs of the Auditor's Determination shall be borne by the Borrowers. 
              g. 
    If the amount which is enforceable under the Guarantee as determined by the Auditor's Determination (calculated as of the date the demand under the Guarantee was made and in accordance with paragraph (d) above) is lower than as determined by the Management Determination (the excess amount, the "  Excess Amount  "), but the Guarantee has been enforced on the basis of the amount determined by the Management Determination, then the Agent (acting on behalf of the Finance Parties) shall, within five (5) Business Days of receipt by the Agent of a written demand from the relevant German Guarantor  

i. 
    repay the Excess Amount (if and to the extent the amounts enforced on the basis of the Management Determination have not been received by any other Finance Party), and  
              ii. 
    if and to the extent the amounts enforced on the basis of the Management Determination have been received by any other Finance Party, notify that Finance Party of the Excess Amount and forthwith pass on any amounts actually returned to the Agent by the Finance Parties in respect of the Excess Amount,  
              h. 
    in each case provided a demand for repayment of the Excess Amount is made by the relevant German Guarantor to the Agent within one Month from the earlier of (i) the date of receipt by the Agent of the Auditor's Determination and (ii) the date falling 45 calendar days (or such longer period as has been agreed between the Borrowers and the Agent) from the date the Agent has contested the Management Determination in writing to the relevant German Guarantor (it being understood that any demand for repayment needs to specify the Excess Amount and can therefore only be made by the relevant German Guarantor once the Auditor's Determination is available). For the avoidance of doubt, each Finance Party shall only be liable to return such portion of the Excess Amount actually received (and, in the case of the Agent, not on-paid) by it and nothing set out in this paragraph (g) shall establish any joint and several liability of the Finance Parties in respect of any Excess Amount. 
              i. 
    If pursuant to the Auditor's Determination the amount payable under the Guarantee is higher than set out in the Management Determination the relevant German Guarantor shall pay the difference to the Finance Parties within five (5) Business Days after receipt of the Auditor's Determination. 
              j. 
    If the German Guarantor intends to demonstrate that the enforcement of the Guarantee would lead to the occurrence of a Limitation Event, then the German Guarantor shall, if the Agent so requests acting upon instruction of the Majority Lenders (each such request a "  Realisation Request  "), within two Months (or such longer period as the Agent may specify) following receipt by the German Guarantor of the Realisation Request, realise at arm's length terms to the extent necessary to satisfy the amounts demanded under this Guarantee any and all of its assets that: 
              i. 
    are shown in its balance sheet with a book value (  Buchwert   within the German law meaning of that term) which is significantly lower than their market value; and  
              ii. 
    are not operationally necessary to continue its existing business or are capable to be replaced by the German Guarantor by way of sale and lease-back, the purchase of services from third parties or otherwise, (the "  Relevant Assets  "). 
              k. 
    The German Guarantor shall within one Month following the Agent's Realisation Request provide to the Agent a list of all Relevant Assets. If the German Guarantor has not realised the Relevant Assets within two Months following the Agent's Realisation Request (the "  Realisation Period  ") but delivered a Management Determination to the Agent, and (A) has omitted to undertake reasonable endeavours to effect such realisation or (B) has not provided reasonably detailed evidence to the Agent that it has undertaken reasonable endeavours to effect such realisation, until the last day of the Realisation Period, the Agent may instruct the auditor instructed to prepare  

the Auditor's Determination to prepare within fifteen calendar days an Auditor's Determination (regardless whether an Auditor's Determination has already been provided), taking into account any not realised Relevant Assets at 70 per cent. of their market value. Without prejudice to paragraph (l) below, the amounts determined in that Auditor's Determination shall be (except for manifest error) binding for all Parties. The costs of that Auditor's Determination shall be borne by the Borrowers. 
           l. 
    The Limitation on Enforcement does not affect the right of the Finance Parties to claim again any outstanding amount at a later point in time if and to the extent that paragraph (b) would allow this at that later point. 
              m. 
    The Limitation on Enforcement does not apply in relation to amounts that correspond to funds that have been on-lent to the relevant German Guarantor or any of its Subsidiaries. The burden of demonstrating that no amounts have been on-lent is on the German Guarantor, provided that an up-to-date financial statement of the German Guarantor prepared in accordance with the principles applicable to its unconsolidated balance sheet (  Jahresabschluss   according to   42 GmbH-Act,    242, 264 German Commercial Code) and setting out in reasonable detail in its annex (Anhang) any such on-lending (including to its Subsidiaries) or confirming its non-existence, shall constitute prima facie evidence for this purpose. 
              n. 
    The Limitation on Enforcement does not apply to any amounts payable under the Guarantee by a German Guarantor during the existence of a domination and/or profit and loss transfer agreement with the relevant German Guarantor as controlled entity (in accordance with   291 of the German Stock Corporation Act (  Aktiengesetz  ) other than where the existence of such domination and/or profit and loss transfer agreement has not the effect as set out in sentence 2 of paragraph 1 of section 30 GmbH-Act. 
              o. 
    This Clause 11.10.7 shall apply mutatis mutandis, if the Guarantee is granted by a German Guarantor organised as a limited partnership (  Kommanditgesellschaft  ,   KG  ) or general partnership (  offene Handelsgesellschaft  ,   OHG  ) with a limited liability company incorporated under German law (  Gesellschaft mit beschr nkter Haftung, GmbH  ) as general partner (Komplement r   bzw  .   unbeschr nkt haftender Gesellschafter   within the German law meaning of that term) (a "  Relevant General Partner  ") of such Guarantor, in respect of such Relevant General Partner. 
              p. 
    The restrictions under this Clause 11.10.7 shall not apply if, at the time of enforcement of the Guarantee, as a result of a change in the laws or German supreme court jurisprudence (  h chstrichterliche Rechtsprechung  ), the granting or enforcement of the Guarantee can no longer result in a personal liability of the German Guarantor's or, as applicable, the Relevant General Partner's managing directors with a view to the obligatory preservation of its stated share capital according to    30, 31 German GmbH-Act or any substitute provision.  
               a. 
    Notwithstanding anything set out to the contrary in this Agreement or any other Finance Document, the obligations and liabilities of any Guarantor incorporated in Spain under this Agreement or any other Finance Document to which it is a party shall be deemed to have been given only to the extent such guarantee does not violate articles 143 or 150 of the Spanish Capital Companies Act (Real Decreto Legislativo 1/2010, de 3 de Julio, por el que se  

aprueba el texto refundido de la Ley de Sociedades de Capital), governing, inter alia, unlawful financial assistance, and the liability of each such Guarantor only applies to the extent permitted by such provisions. 
           b. 
    The limitation set out in paragraph (a) above shall apply mutatis mutandis to any security created by any Obligors incorporated in Spain under the Security Documents and to any guarantee, undertaking, obligation, indemnity and payment, including (but not limited to) distributions, cash sweeps, credits, loans and set-offs, pursuant to or permitted by the Finance Documents and made by each such Obligor. 
               a. 
    The guarantee and the liability of any Guarantor incorporated in Poland under this guarantee shall:

    Accounts of the Security Agent and of the Lenders 
     For the purposes of enforcing or foreclosing, pursuant to Spanish law, this Agreement (including any Guarantee provided by any Guarantor incorporated in Spain pursuant to Clause 11 or under the Security Documents), the Security Agent, in its capacity as such (and on behalf of the Lenders), shall open and maintain a special credit facility account in its books on behalf of the Obligors, from which all interest, fees, expenses, default interest, additional costs and any other amounts that the Obligors owe to the Lenders under the Finance Documents will be debited and into which all amounts received by or on account of the Lenders from the Obligors under the Finance Documents will be credited, so that the balance of the credit account represents the amount owed from time to time by the Obligors to the Lenders.

In the event of assignment as provided in Clause 23, the assignor will totally or partially cancel the referenced accounts, with corresponding accounts to be opened by the assignee. 
  Any failure to keep the records referred to in the two preceding Clauses or any error in doing so will not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of the Lenders to pay any amount owed pursuant to the Finance Documents. 
   In the event of any discrepancy between the accounts and records maintained by any Lender and the accounts and records of the Security Agent corresponding to such matters, the Security Agent s accounts and records will take precedence in the absence of manifest error.  

12.5.3 
    If any of the events of termination by maturity or acceleration of the Facility occurs, the Security Agent or, if applicable, a Lender who brings the action separately, will settle the accounts referred to in Clause 12.5.1(  Accounts of the Security Agent     and of the     Lenders  ).

              (iii)

              (iv)

              12.5.6

              d. 
    the Facility Agent shall treat the Excess Amount as if it were a payment by an Obligor under Clause 19 (  Payments  ) and shall pay the Excess Amount to the Finance Parties (other than the Sharing Lender) in accordance with such clause; and 
              i. 
    on a redistribution of payments under Clause 17.1(d) above, the Sharing Lender shall be subrogated to the rights of each Finance Party which have shared in the redistribution; 
              ii.

              iii. 
    if and to the extent that the Sharing Lender is not able to rely on its rights under Clause 17.1(d)(i) and 17.1(d)(ii) above, each Finance Party (other than the Sharing Lender) hereby agrees to indemnify the Sharing Lender against any loss which the Sharing Lender may subsequently suffer by reason of this Clause 17 including but not limited to any such redistribution having to be refunded or having made such payment of the Excess Amount to the Facility Agent or any loss resulting from the Sharing Lender not being able to claim its pro rata share of the Loans. 
      Notwithstanding Clause 17.1 (  Redistribution  ), no Sharing Lender shall be obliged to share any Excess Amount which it receives or recovers pursuant to legal proceedings taken by it to recover any sums owing to it under this Agreement with any other Finance Party which has a legal right to, but does not, either join in such proceedings or commence and diligently pursue separate proceedings to enforce its rights, unless the proceedings instituted by the Sharing Lender are instituted by it without prior notice having been given to such Finance Party through the Facility Agent and an opportunity to such Finance Party to join in such proceedings. 

If any Excess Amount subsequently has to be wholly or partly refunded to an Obligor by a Sharing Lender which has paid an amount equal to that Excess Amount to the Facility Agent under Clause 17.1 (  Redistribution  ), each Finance Party to which any part of that amount was distributed shall on request from the Sharing Lender repay to the Sharing Lender that Finance Party s proportionate share of the amount which has to be so refunded by the Sharing Lender.

              18.13.3 
    Where any part of any Lender Outstandings is denominated in a currency other than USD, any calculation for the purposes of this Clause 18.13 shall be made on the basis of the USD Equivalent of that part calculated at the date of distribution.

               18.14

    Where a sum is to be paid to the Facility Agent under this Agreement for another Party, the Facility Agent is not obliged to pay that sum to that Party until it has established that it has actually received that sum. The Facility Agent may, however, assume that the sum has been paid to it in accordance with this Agreement, and, in reliance on that assumption, make available to that Party a corresponding amount. If the sum has not been made available but the Facility Agent has paid a corresponding amount to another Party, that Party shall immediately on demand by the Facility Agent refund the corresponding amount together with interest on that amount from the date of payment to the date of receipt, calculated at a rate determined by the Facility Agent to reflect its cost of funds. 
      If a payment under this Agreement is due on a day which is not a Business Day, the due date for that payment shall instead be the next Business Day in the same calendar month (if there is one) or the preceding Business Day (if there is not).

    first, in or towards payment of any unpaid costs and expenses of the Facility Agent and/or the Security Agent under this Agreement or the Security Documents; 
              b. 
    second, in or towards payment   pro     rata   of any accrued interest due by that Obligor but unpaid under this Agreement; 
              c. 
    third, in or towards payment   pro     rata   any other sum due by that Obligor but unpaid under the Finance Documents.

              c.

              d. 
    promptly deliver or procure the delivery to the relative payee of receipts evidencing each deduction or withholding which has been made.

    If the Facility Agent is obliged to make any deduction or withholding from any payment to any Lender (an    Agency     Payment   ) which represents an amount or amounts received by that Agent from an Obligor under any Finance Document, that Obligor shall pay directly to that Lender such sum (an    Agency Compensating Sum   ) as shall, after taking into account any deduction or withholding which that Obligor is obliged to make from the Agency Compensating Sum, enable that Lender to receive, on the due date for payment of the Agency Payment, an amount equal to the Agency Payment which that Lender would have received in the absence of any obligation to make any deduction or withholding. 
              19.9.4 
    If any Lender determines that it has received, realised, utilised and retained a Tax benefit by reason of any deduction or withholding in respect of which an Obligor has made an increased payment or paid an Agency Compensating Sum under this Clause 19.9, that Lender shall, provided that each Finance Party have received all amounts which are then due and payable by the Obligors under any Finance Document, pay to that Obligor (to the extent that that Lender can do so without prejudicing the amount of the benefit or repayment and the right of that Lender to obtain any other benefit, relief or allowance which may be available to it) such amount, if any, that will leave that Lender in no worse position than it would have been in if the deduction or withholding had not been required, provided that: 
              a. 
    each Lender shall have an absolute discretion as to the time at which and the order and manner in which it realises or utilises any Tax benefit and shall not be obliged to arrange its business or its Tax affairs in any particular way in order to be eligible for any credit or refund or similar benefit; 
              b. 
    no Lender shall be obliged to disclose any information regarding its business, Tax affairs or Tax computations; 
              c. 
    if a Lender has made a payment to an Obligor pursuant to this Clause 19.9.4 on account of any Tax benefit and it subsequently transpires that that Lender did not receive that Tax benefit, or received a lesser Tax benefit, that Obligor shall, on demand, pay to that Lender such sum as that Lender may determine as being necessary to restore its after-tax position to that which it would have been had no adjustment under this Clause 19.9.4 been made. 
              19.9.5 
    No Lender shall be obliged to make any payment under Clause 19.9.4 if, by doing so, it would contravene the terms of any applicable law or any notice, direction or requirement of any governmental or regulatory authority (whether or not having the force of law). 

19.9.6 
    If an Obligor is required to make an increased payment for the account of a Lender under Clause 19.9.2, then, without prejudice to that obligation and so long as such requirement exists and subject to the Borrowers giving the Facility Agent and that Lender not less than ten (10) days  prior notice (which shall be irrevocable), the Obligors may prepay all, but not part, of that Lender s Participation in the Loans together with accrued interest on the amount prepaid. Any such prepayment shall be subject to Clause 24.1 (  Breakage costs indemnity  ). On any such prepayment, the Commitment of the relevant Lender shall be automatically cancelled. 
              20. 
    AMENDMENTS AND WAIVERS 
               20.1.1 
    Subject to Clause 20.2 (  All     Lenders  ), any term of any Finance Document, save for any Finance Documents relating thereto, may be amended or waived with the written agreement of the Borrowers and the Majority Lenders. The Facility Agent and the Security Agent (as applicable) may effect and are irrevocably authorised, on behalf of the Finance Parties, to execute an amendment or waiver to which the Majority Lenders have agreed. 
              20.1.2 
    The Facility Agent shall promptly notify the Borrowers and each Lender of any amendment or waiver effected under Clause 20.1.1 and any such amendment or waiver shall be binding on the Borrowers, each Obligor, each Group Company and each Finance Party. 
      An amendment or waiver which relates to: 
           a. 
    the definition of  Majority Lenders  in Clause 1.1 (  Definitions  ); 
              b. 
    an extension of the date for, or a decrease in an amount or a change in the currency of, any payment under any Finance Document; 
              c. 
    an increase in a Lender s Commitment; 
              d. 
    a term of any Finance Document which expressly requires the consent of each Lender; or 
              e. 
    Clauses 6 (  Interest  ), 7 (  Reduction, Repayment, prepayment and cancellation  ) , 17 (  Pro     rata     sharing  ), or this Clause 20 (  Amendments and Waivers  ), 
     may not be effected without the prior written consent of each Lender. 
   An amendment or waiver which affects the rights and/or obligations of the Security Agent in that capacity may not be effected without the prior written consent of the Security Agent. 
           20.4 
    No implied waivers; remedies cumulative 
     The rights of the Finance Parties under the Finance Documents: 
           a. 
    may be exercised as often as necessary; 
              b. 
    are cumulative and not exclusive of its rights under the general law; and 
              c. 
    may be waived only in writing and specifically. 

Delay in exercising or non-exercise of any such right is not a waiver of that right. 
    If any provision of this Agreement is or becomes illegal, invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, that shall not affect: 
           a. 
    the legality, validity or enforceability in that jurisdiction of any other provision of this Agreement; or 
              b. 
    the legality, validity or enforceability in any other jurisdiction of that or any other provision of this Agreement. 
      This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and this shall have the same effect as if the signatures on the counterparts were on a single copy of this Agreement. 
   The obligations of the Parties who have executed this Agreement shall not be affected by the fact that not all of the Parties have validly executed this Agreement. 
    Each notice or other communication to be given under this Agreement shall be given in writing in English and, unless otherwise provided, shall be made by e-mail or letter. 
   Any notice or other communication to be given by one Party to another under this Agreement shall (unless one Party has by ten (10) days  notice to the other Party specified another   address  ) be given to that other Party, in the case of the Borrowers, the Obligors, the Facility Agent, the Security Agent, at the respective addresses given in Clause 22.3 (  Addresses  ), in the case of the Lenders, at the respective addresses given in Schedule 1 or, as the case may be, the schedule to its relevant Transfer Certificate and in the case of any Borrower or Obligor (other than the Borrowers) as set out in the schedule to its relevant Accession Agreement.

    Assignments and transfers by Obligors 
     No Obligor shall be entitled to assign or transfer any of its rights or obligations under the Finance Documents. 

23.3.1 
    Any Lender may assign, in accordance with this Clause 23.3, any of its rights and obligations under this Agreement to (i) any other Lender, (ii) any company being controlled by any Lender or under the control of the same legal entity as any Lender (where control shall have the same meaning mutatis mutandis as set out in the definition of  Subsidiary ), (iii) to any other financial institution upon the occurrence of a Default, or (iv) to any other financial institution, in a minimum amount of USD 2,000,000, provided, in each case, that such assignment does not result in a breach of the Swiss Ten Non-Bank Rule, and provided in each case that: 
              a. 
    The consent of the Borrowers is required for any assignment, unless the Lender Transferee (as defined in Clause 23.3.2) falls within one of the categories set out under (i), (ii) or (iii) above. 
              b. 
    The consent of the Borrowers must not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.  The Borrowers will be deemed to have given its consent three Business Days after the Borrowers is given notice of the request unless it is expressly refused by the Borrowers within that time. 
              c. 
    The consent of the Borrowers to an assignment must not be withheld solely because the assignment is to a person who is a Swiss Non-Qualifying Bank, provided that each assignment must be in compliance with the Swiss Ten Non-Bank Rule. 
              23.3.2 
    If any Lender (the  Existing Lender ) wishes to assign all or any part of its Commitment or Participation in the Facility to another Lender or other financial institution (the  Lender Transferee ), such transfer may be effected by delivery to, and the execution by, the Facility Agent or the Security Agent (as applicable) of a duly completed Transfer Certificate and the transfer must be done on a pro rata basis.  
              23.3.3 
    On the date specified in the Transfer Certificate: 
     to the extent that in the Transfer Certificate the Existing Lender seeks to assign its Commitment or Participation in the Facility or interest under any Finance Document, the Obligors and the Existing Lender shall each be released from further obligations to each other under this Agreement and their respective rights against each other shall be cancelled (such rights and obligations being referred to in this Clause 23.3.3 as    Discharged Rights and     Obligations    
           a. 
    the Obligors and the Lender Transferee shall each assume obligations towards each other and/or acquire rights against each other which differ from the Discharged Rights and Obligations only insofar as the Obligors and the Lender Transferee have assumed and/or acquired the same in place of the Obligors and the Existing Lender; 
              b. 
    each of the Parties and the Lender Transferee shall acquire the same rights and assume the same obligations among themselves as they would have acquired and assumed had the Lender Transferee been a party under this Agreement as a Lender with the rights and/or the obligations acquired or assumed by it as a result of the transfer; 
              c. 
    a proportion of the Existing Lender s rights under the Security Documents, equal to the proportion of the Existing Lender s rights under this Agreement being transferred, shall automatically be transferred to the Lender Transferee; and 

d. 
    the Existing Lender s rights and benefits under the Security Documents shall be transferred by the relevant and necessary transfer certificates. 
              23.3.4 
    The Facility Agent and/or the Security Agent (as applicable) shall promptly complete a Transfer Certificate on request by an Existing Lender and upon payment by the Lender Transferee of a fee of USD 3,000 to the Facility Agent. Each Party irrevocably authorises each Agent to execute any duly completed Transfer Certificate on its behalf provided that such authorisation does not extend to the execution of a Transfer Certificate on behalf of either the Existing Lender or the Lender Transferee named in the Transfer Certificate. 
              23.3.5 
    The Facility Agent and/or the Security Agent (as applicable) shall promptly notify the Borrowers of the receipt and execution on its behalf by the relevant Agent of any Transfer Certificate. 
              23.3.6 
    Each Obligor undertakes to sign and execute any Transfer Certificate or other document necessary to complete a transfer of any interest under any Finance Document if so requested by the Facility Agent or the Security Agent. 
              23.4 
    Further assurance for assignments or transfers 
              23.4.1 
    The Obligors undertake to procure that in relation to any assignment by a Lender of all or part of its Commitment and/or its Participation in the Facility under this Agreement, the Group Companies shall at the request of the relevant assignor or transferor execute (at the cost and expense of the Borrowers) such documents as may be reasonably necessary to ensure that the relevant assignee or, as the case may be, transferee, attains the benefit of the Security Documents. 
              23.4.2 
    Without prejudice to Clause 23.3.5, each Lender shall notify the Agents and Borrowers (on behalf of itself and the other Obligors) of any assignment or transfer by such Lender of all or part of its Commitment or Participation in the Facility or interest under the Finance Documents. 
              23.4.3 
    In the case of any assignment, transfer or novation by an Existing Lender to a Lender Transferee of all or any part of its rights and obligations under the Finance Documents, the Existing Lender and the Lender Transferee agree that, for the purpose of Article 1278 of the Luxembourg Civil Code (to the extent applicable), the securities created under the Finance Documents and securing the rights assigned, transferred or novated thereby will be preserved for the benefit of the Lender Transferee. 
      The Obligors shall be under no obligation to pay any greater amount under this Agreement following an assignment or transfer by a Lender of any of its rights or obligations pursuant to this Clause 23 if, in the circumstances existing at the time of such assignment or transfer, such greater amount would not have been payable but for the assignment or transfer. 
   The Facility Agent, the Security Agent, the Bookrunner and each Lender may disclose to each other, to their professional advisers and to any person with whom they are proposing to enter, or have entered into, any kind of assignment, transfer, participation or other agreement in relation to this Agreement or any other Finance Document provided such person has entered into an appropriate confidentiality undertaking in writing, any information which the Facility Agent, the Security Agent, the Bookrunner or that Lender has acquired under or in connection with any Finance Document. 

The accession to this Agreement of each additional Guarantor shall take effect on the Facility Agent countersigning the relevant Accession Agreement which they are hereby irrevocably authorised to do by the Parties to this Agreement. The Parties hereto agree that this authorisation is given to secure the interest of the Parties under this Agreement and is accordingly irrevocable. After the execution of an Accession Agreement the acceding party shall be bound by this Agreement in relation to the other Parties and the Parties to this Agreement, not being the acceding party, shall be bound in relation to the acceding party. 
           23.8 
    Exposure transfer transactions 
     Nothing herein restricts the Lenders from entering into any arrangement with another person under which such Lender substantially transfers its credit risk exposure under this Agreement to that other person, unless under such arrangement (and for the duration of such arrangement): 
           (a) 
    the relationship between the Lender and that other person is that of a debtor and creditor (including in the event of the bankruptcy or similar event of the Lender or an Obligor); 
              (b) 
    the other person will have no proprietary interest in the benefit of this Agreement or in any monies received by the Lender under or in relation to this Agreement; 
              (c) 
    the other person will under no circumstances (other than pursuant to a transfer or assignment permitted under Clause 23.3.1) be subrogated to, or substituted in respect of, the Lender's claims under this Agreement; and 
              (d) 
    the other person will under no circumstances (other than pursuant to a transfer or assignment permitted under Clause 23.3.1) otherwise have any contractual relationship with, or rights against, an Obligor under or in relation to this Agreement. 
      In addition to the other rights provided to Lenders under this Clause 23, each Lender may, without consulting with or obtaining consent from any Obligor, at any time charge, assign or otherwise create security in or over (whether by way of collateral or otherwise) all or any of its rights under any Finance Document to secure obligations of that Lender including, without limitation: 
           (a) 
    any charge, assignment or other security to secure obligations to a federal reserve or central bank; and 
              (b) 
    in the case of any Lender which is a fund, any charge, assignment or other security granted to any holders (or trustee or representatives of holders) of obligations owed, or securities issued, by that Lender as security for those obligations or securities, 
     except that no such charge, assignment or security shall: 
           (A) 
    release a Lender from any of its obligations under the Finance Documents or substitute the beneficiary of the relevant charge, assignment or security for the Lender as a party to any of the Finance Documents 

(B) 
    require any payments to be made by an Obligor other than or in excess of, or grant to any person any more extensive rights than, those required to be made or granted to the relevant Lender under the Finance Documents; or 
              (C) 
    result in a breach of the Swiss Ten Non-Bank Rule. 
       Each Obligor shall, to the extent legally possible, indemnify each Finance Party on demand against any loss or expense (including any loss or expense on account of funds borrowed, contracted for or utilised to fund any amount payable under this Agreement, any amount repaid or prepaid under this Agreement or any Loan) which that Finance Party properly has sustained or incurred as a consequence of: 
           a. 
    a Loan not being made following the service of a Drawdown Notice (except as a result of the failure of that Finance Party to comply with its obligations under this Agreement); 
              b. 
    the failure of an Obligor to make payment on the due date of any sum due under this Agreement; 
              c. 
    the occurrence of any Default or by the operation of Clause 15.2 (  Acceleration  ,   etc  .); or 
              d. 
    any prepayment or repayment of a Loan otherwise than on the last day of the Interest Period in relation to that Loan. 
               24.2.1 
    Any payment made to or for the account of or received by an Agent or any Lender in respect of any moneys or liabilities due, arising or incurred by an Obligor to an Agent or any Lender in a currency (the  Currency of Payment ) other than the currency in which the payment should have been made under this Agreement (the  Currency of Obligation ) in whatever circumstances (including as a result of a judgement against an Obligor) and for whatever reason shall constitute a discharge to that Obligor only to the extent of the Currency of Obligation amount which an Agent or that Lender, as the case may be, is able on the date of receipt of such payment (or if such date of receipt is not a Business Day, on the next succeeding Business Day) to purchase with the Currency of Payment amount at its spot rate of exchange (as conclusively determined by the relevant Agent or that Lender) in the relevant foreign exchange market. 
              24.2.2 
    If the amount of the Currency of Obligation which an Agent or that Lender is so able to purchase falls short of the amount originally due to an Agent or that Lender, as the case may be, under this Agreement, then the relevant Obligor shall immediately on demand indemnify the relevant Agent or that Lender, as the case may be, against any loss or damage arising as a result of that shortfall by paying to the relevant Agent or that Lender, as the case may be, that amount in the Currency of Obligation certified by the relevant Agent or that Lender, as the case may be, as necessary so to indemnify it. 

24.3.1 
    Each indemnity in this Clause 24 shall constitute a separate and independent obligation from the other obligations contained in this Agreement or any other Finance Document and shall give rise to a separate and independent cause of action, shall apply irrespective of any indulgence granted from time to time and shall continue in full force and effect notwithstanding any judgement or order for a liquidated sum or sums in respect of amounts due under this Agreement or any other Finance Document or under any such judgement or order. 
              24.3.2 
    The certificate of an Agent or the relevant Lender as to the amount of any loss or damage sustained or incurred by it shall be conclusive and binding on the Obligors except for any manifest error. 
               25.1.1 
    No Finance Party shall be held responsible for any damage arising out of any Norwegian or foreign legal enactment, or any measure undertaken by a Norwegian or foreign public authority, or war, strike, lockout, boycott, blockade or any other similar circumstance. The reservation in respect of strikes, lockouts, boycotts and blockades applies even if a Finance Party takes such measures, or is subject to such measures. 
              25.1.2 
    Any damage that may arise in other cases shall not be indemnified by a Finance Party if it has observed normal care. A Finance Party shall not in any case be held responsible for any indirect damage. Should there be an obstacle as described above for any of the parties set out above in this Clause 25 to take any action in compliance with any Finance Document, such action may be postponed until the obstacle has been removed. 
              26. 
    LAW AND JURISDICTION 
               26.2.1 
    This Agreement is governed by and shall be construed in accordance with Norwegian law. 
               26.2.1 
    Subject to Clause 26.2.2 below, the courts of Norway shall have exclusive jurisdiction over matters arising out of or in connection with this Agreement. Oslo tingrett shall be the court of first instance. 
              26.2.2 
    The submission to the jurisdiction of Norwegian Courts shall not limit the right of a Finance Party to take proceedings against any Obligor in any court which may otherwise exercise jurisdiction over any Obligor or any of its assets. 
               26.3.1 
    Without prejudice to any other mode of service allowed under any relevant law, each Obligor (other than an Obligor incorporated in Norway): 
              a. 
    irrevocably appoints PRA Group Europe AS (formerly Aktiv Kapital AS) (represented by the chairman of the board of directors from time to time) as its agent for service of process in relation to any proceedings before the Norwegian courts in connection with any Finance Document governed by Norwegian law; and 
              b. 
    agrees that failure by a process agent to notify the relevant Obligor of the process will not invalidate the proceedings concerned. 

26.3.2 
    If any process agent appointed pursuant to this Clause 26.3 (Service of process) (or any successor thereto) shall cease to exist for any reason where process may be served, the Obligor will forthwith appoint another process agent with an office in Norway where process may be served and will forthwith notify the Agent thereof. 

IN WITNESS   whereof the Parties have caused this Agreement to be duly executed on the date set out above.

    Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the periods covered by this report;

    Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report; 
       
           4. 
    The registrant's other certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have: 
       
           (a) 
    Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared; 
              (b) 
    Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;

    Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant's most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant's fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal control over financial reporting; and 
       
           5. 
    The registrant's other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions): 
       
           (a) 
    All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and 
              (b) 
    Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting.

    Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the periods covered by this report; 
       
           3. 
    Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report; 
       
           4. 
    The registrant's other certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have: 
       
           (a) 
    Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared; 
              (b) 
    Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; 
              (c) 
    Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and 
              (d) 
    Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant's most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant's fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal control over financial reporting; and 
       
           5. 
    The registrant's other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions): 
       
           (a) 
    All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and 
              (b) 
    Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting.
