1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION

The unaudited interim financial statements of Rorine International Holdings Corp. . (the  Company ) as of May 31, 2016  and for the three and six month period then ended have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In the opinion of management, such information contains all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of the results of such periods. The results of operations for the three and six month periods ended May 31, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full fiscal year ending November 30, 2016. The Company was a "shell" company as defined by SEC Rule 12b-2 until it began development stage operations on September 1, 2012. The Company was a development stage entity through May 31, 2013 when it discontinued development operations and reverted back to  shell  status. The Company functional currency is US dollars.

On July 9, 2015 we merged with our wholly owned Nevada subsidiary, 3 Shine Technologies Inc.  As a result of this merger, our corporate name was changed to 3 Shine Technologies, Inc and the trading symbol for our common stock changed to  TSHN. 

On September 14, 2015, the Company completed a merger with Rorine International Holding Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary incorporated in the State of Nevada. This resulted in a corporate name change of the Company to  Rorine International Holding Corporation .  This corporate action was approved by the Company s Board of Directors as authorized by Nevada corporate law. The corporate name change effected by the merger was effective on October 7, 2015 upon final approval by FINRA which was granted on October 6, 2015.  The Company s trading symbol changed to  RIHC  as a result of the corporate name change The subsidiary was newly formed on September 4, 2015 and merged into the parent public company ten days later on September 14, 2015. The subsidiary had no formal business activities as of November 30, 2015.Selling general and administrative expense consist mainly of professional fees.

On  January 12,  2016, Rorine International Holding Corporation Inc successfully entered in a marketing and distribution agreement with RICH Group based in South East Asia. The agreement was negotiated and announced by Rorine s Chief Financial Officer Mr Tan Sew. According to Mr Tan this agreement has taken several months to plan and negotiate and  will give Rorine an excellent opportunity to market Eastern alternative medical packages related to Type II Diabetes outside of China to non-traditional markets such as in the West. 

The agreement was signed between Rorine International Holding Corporation and RICH Group who had previously acquired Guangzhou Huanai Nutrition and Health Information Co. Ltd and Guangzhou Tongde Hospital. One of RICH Group s diversified investment holdings has been in alternative medicine   treatment for Type II Diabetes, specifically in China where roughly 10% of the population is susceptible to it. They have a non-invasive treatment program based on the combination of traditional Chinese medicine and modern hyperthermia, elemental balance therapy, psychotherapy, resulting in complete restoration to normal health and diet. They currently have a separate marketing and distribution company specifically for the China market. This new agreement allows them to move outside of China into new and growing markets specifically targeting western patients.

According to this agreement, Rorine will setup and prepare a marketing strategy and platform as well as liaise with hospitals, clinics and associations in order to bring this unique product to markets in the West where Diabetes is also on the rise.

The agreement is part of a long term strategy initiated by the Board of Directors of Rorine International Holding Corporation, faithfully guided by its Chief Officer Mr Tesheb Casimir. Part of this turn around occurred when the Board decided to appoint Mr Tan Sew as its CFO in late 2015. Mr Tan has been involved in new project finance and development in South East Asia for the past 20 years.

On March 14, 2016, an Amendment to the Company s Articles of Incorporation was filed with the Nevada Secretary of State which increased the Company s authorized shares of common stock to 2,000,000,000 shares from 100,000,000 shares.  The amendment was approved by owners of 66.96% of the Company s common stock and by the owner of 100% of the Company s preferred stock.  The amendment was effective upon filing on March 14, 2016.

Accounts payable consist of vendor payables at May 31, 2016 and November 30, 2015.

2. SUPPLEMENTAL CASH FLOWS INFORMATION

There was no cash paid for either interest or income taxes during either of the periods presented. There were no non-cash investing or financing activities during either of the periods presented.

3. GOING CONCERN

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As shown in the financial statements, the Company has experienced continued losses, has a working capital deficiency of $218,967 has an accumulated deficit of $7,036,576 and does not presently have sufficient resources to accomplish its objectives during the next twelve months. On August 1, 2012, the Company began a new business.  The new business enterprise was initiated with the creation of a wholly owned subsidiary, Unwall Technologies Holdings, Sdn. Ghd (Technologies), a Malaysian corporation incorporated on July 12, 2012.  The Company plans to introduce applications for mobile devices in the first half of 2013 and web applications later in the year.  The Company is considered a development stage entity because this new business enterprise is in the process of platform development and has not derived significant revenue from operations..

In November, 2011, the Company name was changed to Unwall International Inc.  These factors raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. The financial statements do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue in operation. The Company s present plans, the realization of which cannot be assured, are to raise necessary funds through shareholder loans.

4. CONTINGENCY

The Company does not carry Directors and Officer s insurance.

5. SHAREHOLDER LOANS

The shareholder loans are non-interest bearing demand loans and are properly classified on the balance sheet as a current liability.

6. PRINCIPLE OF CONSOLIDATION

The consolidated financial statements represent the combined results of Rorine International Holdings Corp. and its wholly owned subsidiary, Unwall Technologies Holdings, SdnGhd. All intercompany balances have been eliminated.

7. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

The Company began development stage activities through its wholly owned Malaysian subsidiary, Unwall Technologies Holdings, SdnGhd. on September 1, 2012.  Operations of the Malaysian subsidiary effectively ceased on May 31, 2013, and closed by August 31, 2013.  The equipment and software owned by this subsidiary had no material value and were either abandoned or given to employees.  Unwall International has assumed responsibility for any remaining accounts payable of the subsidiary.  A planned social lending division was terminated with no viable development before October 31, 2013.

ITEM 2.        MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OR PLAN OF OPERATION.

This section of this report includes a number of forward- looking statements that reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance. Forward-looking statements are often identified by words like: believe, expect, estimate, anticipate, intend, project and similar expressions, or words which, by their nature, refer to future events. You should not place undue certainty on these forward-looking statements, which apply only as of the date of this report. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical results or our predictions.

Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation 

From November 30, 2007 until April 2009, our operations were that of distribution of alternative health products. Upon further market research, it was determined that pursuing the marketing and sale of such product was not as profitable as previously projected. Therefore, all efforts relating to the distribution and marketing were ceased. In April 2009, we commenced operations relating to the distribution of the certain systems which were intended to convert a variety of waste materials to marketable by-products. This business was discontinued by March 31, 2011.

On October 30, 2012, we completed the incorporation and registration of Unwall Technologies Holdings SDN.BHD, a wholly-owned Malaysian subsidiary ( Unwall Technologies ), which commenced operations to offer mobile apps through its website,    www.uwii.org    .  the company planned to introduce applications for mobile devices in the first half of 2013 and web applications later in the year.  This venture was discontinued May 31, 2013 and the business closed by August 31, 2013.  The subsidiary does still exist with no assets or liabilities remaining. 

Development began on a web based social lending platform.  So far, this business has not proceeded beyond initial plans for a joint venture and, as a result, the Company has reverted to shell company status.

We have not been involved in any bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceeding.

The following is an analysis of our revenues and gross profit, details and analysis of components of expenses, and variances comparing the three months ended May 31, 2016 to three months ended May 31, 2015.

Expenses 

Our expenses for the six months ended May 31, 2016 and May 31, 2015 were as follows:

9 

For the six months ended May 31, 2016, our total operating expenses were $6,970_ as compared to $6,235 for the three months ended May 31, 2015. The change in operating expenses is primarily due to professional fees.

Professional Fees 

We incurred a total of $6,520 in professional fees for the three months ended May 31, 2016 as compared to $6,235 during the three months ended May 31, 2015.  Professional fees include audit and review fees, bookkeeping fees and legal fees consisting mostly of preparation of SEC filings. Our audit and legal fees are expected to vary.

Liquidity and Capital Resource 

Working Capital Deficit 

Cash Flows 

Working Capital Needs:

As of May 31, 2016, we had working capital of $218,967. Over the next 12 months, we will require approximately $25,000 to sustain our working capital needs as a public reporting company (not including any working capital required by our proposed social lending business), as follows:

11 

Sources of Capital:

We expect to obtain financing through shareholder loans. Shareholder loans will be without stated terms of repayment or interest. We will not consider taking on any long-term or short-term debt from financial institutions in the immediate future. Shareholders loans may be granted from time to time as required to meet current working capital needs. We have no formal agreement that ensures that we will receive such loans. We may exhaust this source of funding at any time.

Cash Flows

Operating Activities: 

Net cash consumed by operating activities was $14,150 for the six months ended May 31, 2016 and $13,185 for the six months ended May 31, 2015.  Cash consumption is expected to remain stable until the Company once again commences active business operations.

Investing and Financing Activities: 

We had no investing activities from continuing operations in either the 2016 period or the 2015 period.  Our Board of Directors previously approved a sale of 75,000,000 shares of our Common Stock to Great On Technologies Holdings Ltd., our majority shareholder, for $75,000.  However, as of May 31, 2016, the shares had not yet been issued.

Our cash flows from financing activities during the six month period ended May 31, 2016 were $14,150 compared to the six months ended May 31, 2015 when such cash flows were $13,185.  All such cash flows from financing activities were provided by shareholder loans to fund our working capital needs. Additional capital is required in order to fund our working capital needs and we may receive additional financing through shareholder loans although we have no formal commitments from any shareholders at this time. We will not be considering taking on any long-term or short-term debt from financial institutions in the immediate future. Shareholder and consultant loans may be granted from time to time as required to meet current working capital needs. We have no formal agreement that ensures that we will receive such loans. We may exhaust this source of funding at any time.

Material Commitments 

We do not have any material commitments for capital expenditures.

Seasonal Aspects 

Management is not currently aware of any seasonal aspects which would affect the results of our operations during any particular time of year.

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We have no off balance sheet arrangements.

Going Concern 

We anticipate that additional funding will be required in the form of equity financing from the sale of our common stock. At this time, we cannot provide investors with any assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient funding from the sale of our common stock or through a loan from our directors to meet our obligations over the next twelve months. We do not have any arrangements in place for any future debt or equity financing.

12 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
