   DISCLOSURES REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS   
     
  This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q ( Quarterly Report ) includes  forward-looking statements  about the Trust, SandRidge and other matters discussed herein that are subject to risks and uncertainties within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ).  All statements other than statements of historical fact included in this document, including, without limitation, statements under  Management s Discussion  and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  in Item 2 of Part I and elsewhere herein regarding the Trust s or SandRidge s plans and objectives for future operations, are forward-looking statements. Actual outcomes and results may differ materially from those projected. Forward-looking statements are generally accompanied by words such as  estimate,   target,   project,   predict,   believe,   expect,   anticipate,   potential,   could,   may,   foresee,   plan,   goal,   should,   intend  or other words that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes. We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations and assumptions about future events. These statements are based on certain assumptions made by us in light of our experience and our perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments as well as other factors we believe are appropriate under the circumstances. However, whether actual results and developments will conform with our expectations and predictions is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including the risk factors discussed in Item 1A of the Trust s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 (the  2015 Form 10-K ), which could affect the future results of the energy industry in general, and the Trust and SandRidge in particular, and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in such forward-looking statements. The actual results or developments anticipated may not be realized or, even if substantially realized, they may not have the expected consequences to or effects on SandRidge s business or the Trust s results. Such statements are not guarantees of future performance and actual results or developments may differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements. The Trust undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements.

   NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     
   (Unaudited)   
     
   1.      Organization of Trust  
     
  SandRidge Permian Trust (the  Trust ) is a statutory trust formed under the Delaware Statutory Trust Act pursuant to a trust  agreement, as amended and restated, by and among SandRidge Energy, Inc. ( SandRidge ), as Trustor, The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as Trustee (the  Trustee ), and The Corporation Trust Company, as Delaware Trustee (the  Delaware Trustee ). 
     
  The Trust holds Royalty Interests in specified oil and natural gas properties located in Andrews County, Texas (the  Underlying Properties ). The Royalty Interests were conveyed by SandRidge to the Trust concurrent with the initial public offering of the Trust s common units in August 2011. As consideration for conveyance of the Royalty Interests, the Trust remitted the proceeds of the offering, along with 4,875,000 Trust common units and 13,125,000 Trust subordinated units, to certain wholly owned subsidiaries of SandRidge. At September 30, 2016, SandRidge owned 13,125,000 Trust units, or 25% of all Trust units.  
     
  The Royalty Interests entitle the Trust to receive 80% of the proceeds (after deducting post-production costs and any applicable taxes) from the sale of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids ( NGL ) production attributable to SandRidge s net revenue interest in 517 oil and natural gas wells developed as of April 1, 2011, including 21 wells awaiting completion at that time (the  Initial Wells ), and 70% of the proceeds (after deducting post-production costs and any applicable taxes) from the sale of oil, natural gas and NGL production attributable to SandRidge s net revenue interest in 888 development wells drilled thereafter (the  Trust Development Wells ) within an area of mutual interest. Pursuant to a development agreement entered into between the Trust and SandRidge, SandRidge was obligated to drill, or cause to be drilled, the Trust Development Wells by March 31, 2016. SandRidge fulfilled this obligation in  November 2014. 
     
  The Trust is passive in nature and neither the Trust nor the Trustee has any control over, or responsibility for, any operating or capital costs related to the Underlying Properties.  The business and affairs of the Trust are administered by the Trustee. The trust agreement generally limits the Trust s business activities to owning the Royalty Interests and activities reasonably related thereto, including activities required or permitted by the terms of the conveyances related to the Royalty Interests. 
     
  The Trust makes quarterly cash distributions of substantially all of its cash receipts, after deducting amounts for the Trust s administrative expenses, property tax and Texas franchise tax and cash reserves withheld by the Trustee , on or about the 60th day following the completion of each quarter. Due to the timing of the payment of production proceeds to the Trust, each distribution covers production from a three-month period consisting of the first two months of the most recently ended quarter and the final month of the quarter preceding it. 
     
  On January 1, 2016, the subordinated units, initially issued to SandRidge, automatically converted into common units on a one-for-one basis as a result of SandRidge having met its drilling obligation to the Trust in  November 2014. Prior to this conversion, the common and subordinated units had identical rights and privileges, except with respect to their rights to receive distributions. 
     
  Prior to their conversion to common units, the subordinated units, all of which were held by SandRidge, constituted 25% of the Trust units issued and were entitled to receive pro rata distributions from the Trust each quarter if and to the extent there was sufficient cash to provide a cash distribution on the common units that was no less than 80% of  the target distribution for the corresponding quarter ( Subordination Threshold ). If there was not sufficient cash to fund such a distribution on all of the common units, the distribution made with respect to the subordinated units was reduced or eliminated for such quarter in order to make a distribution, to the extent possible, of up to the Subordination Threshold amount on all of the common units. As owner of the subordinated units, SandRidge was entitled to receive incentive distributions equal to 50% of the amount by which the cash available for distribution on all of the Trust units in any quarter exceeded 120% of the target distribution for such quarter ( Incentive Threshold ). As a result of the conversion of the subordinated units to common units in January 2016, SandRidge s right to receive incentive distributions in respect of subsequent periods terminated. Beginning with the Trust s May 2016 distribution, distributions made on common units no longer have the benefit of the Subordination Threshold, nor are the common units subject to the Incentive Threshold, and all Trust unitholders share on a pro rata basis in the Trust s distributions.

   NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUED

  The Trust will dissolve and begin to liquidate on March 31, 2031 (the  Termination Date ) and will soon thereafter wind up its affairs and terminate. At the Termination Date, 50% of the Royalty Interests will revert automatically to SandRidge. The remaining 50% of the Royalty Interests will be sold  at that time, with the net proceeds of the sale, as well as any remaining Trust cash reserves, distributed to the unitholders on a pro rata basis. SandRidge has a right of first refusal to purchase the Royalty Interests retained by the Trust at the Termination Date. The Trust will not dissolve until the Termination Date unless any of the following occurs: (a) the Trust sells all of the Royalty Interests; (b) cash available for distribution for any four consecutive quarters, on a cumulative basis, is less than $5.0 million; (c) Trust unitholders approve an earlier dissolution of the Trust; or (d) the Trust is judicially dissolved. In the case of any of the foregoing, the Trustee would then sell all of the Trust s assets, either by private sale or public auction, and distribute the net proceeds of the sale to the Trust unitholders after payment, or reasonable provision for payment, of all Trust liabilities. 
     
   2. Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   
     
   Basis of Accounting.   The financial statements of the Trust differ from financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) as the Trust records revenues when cash is received (rather than when earned) and expenses when paid (rather than when incurred) and may also establish cash reserves for contingencies, which would not be accrued in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. This comprehensive basis of accounting other than GAAP corresponds to the accounting permitted for royalty trusts by the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) as specified by Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 12:E,  Financial Statements of Royalty Trusts . Amortization of investment in royalty interests, calculated on a unit-of-production basis, and any impairments are charged directly to trust corpus. Distributions to unitholders are recorded when declared. 
     
   Significant Accounting Policies.   Most accounting pronouncements apply to entities whose financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP, which may require such entities to accrue or defer revenues and expenses in a period other than when such revenues are received or expenses are paid. Because the Trust s financial statements are prepared on the modified cash basis as described above, most accounting pronouncements are not applicable to the Trust s financial statements. 
     
  The Trust is treated for federal and applicable state income tax purposes as a partnership.  For U.S. federal income tax purposes, a partnership is not a taxable entity and incurs no U.S. federal income tax liability. With respect to state taxation, a partnership is typically treated in the same manner as it is for U.S. federal income tax purposes. However, the Trust s activities result in the Trust having nexus in Texas and, therefore, make it subject to Texas franchise tax. Texas franchise tax is treated as an income tax for financial statement purposes. The Trust is required to pay Texas franchise tax each year at a maximum effective rate (subject to changes in the statutory rate) of 0.525% of its gross income apportioned to Texas for 2015 and future years and 0.7% of its gross income apportioned to Texas for 2014 and prior years. The Trust records Texas franchise tax when paid. 
     
   Impairment of Investment in Royalty Interests.    On a quarterly basis, the Trust evaluates the carrying value of the Investment in Royalty Interests by comparing the undiscounted cash flows expected to be realized from the Royalty Interest to the carrying value. If the expected future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value, the Trust recognizes an impairment loss for the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value of the Royalty Interest. There were no impairments in the carrying value of the Investment in Royalty Interests during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. Material write-downs in subsequent periods may occur if commodity prices decline. Any impairment would result in a non-cash charge to trust corpus and would not affect the Trust s distributable income. See  Risks and Uncertainties  in Note 5 below for further discussion. 
     
   Distributable Income Per Common and Subordinated Unit.   For the periods prior to the conversion of the Trust s subordinated units to common units, the Trust calculated distributable income per common and subordinated unit using the two-class method. In accordance with this method, undistributed earnings in the accompanying unaudited statements of distributable income were allocated to the common and subordinated units based upon the subordinated units  contractual participation rights as if all of the distributable income for the periods presented had been distributed. Distributable income per unit amounts as calculated for the periods presented in the accompanying unaudited statements of distributable income may differ from declared distribution amounts per unit due to the timing of the Trust s receipt or payment of settlements on novated derivative contracts. See Note 4 for a discussion of the Trust s derivative contracts. Beginning with the Trust s May 2016 distribution, distributions made on common units no longer have the benefit of the Subordination Threshold, nor are the common units subject to the Incentive Threshold, and all Trust unitholders share on a pro rata basis in the Trust s distributions.

   Interim Financial Statements.   The accompanying unaudited interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the accounting policies stated in the audited financial statements contained in the 2015 Form 10-K and reflect all adjustments that are, in the opinion of the Trustee, necessary to state fairly the information in the Trust s unaudited interim financial statements. The accompanying statement of assets and trust corpus as of December 31, 2015 has been derived from audited financial statements. The unaudited interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto included in the 2015 Form 10-K. 
     
   3.      Distributions to Unitholders  
     
  The Trust makes quarterly cash distributions of substantially all of its cash receipts, after deducting amounts for the Trust s administrative expenses,  property tax and Texas franchise tax and cash reserves withheld by the Trustee, on or about the 60th day following the completion of each quarter. Distributions cover a three-month production period. See Note 6 for discussion of the Trust s quarterly distribution to be paid in November 2016. A summary of the Trust s distributions to unitholders during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 and the year ended December 31, 2015 is as follows: 

4. Related Party Transactions   
     
   Trustee Administrative Fee.   Under the terms of the trust agreement, the Trust pays an annual administrative fee of $150,000 to the Trustee, which will be adjusted for inflation by no more than 3% in any year beginning in 2017. The Trustee s administrative fees paid during each of the three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, totaled approximately $38,000. The Trustee s administrative fees paid during each of the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 totaled approximately $113,000. 
     
   Registration Rights Agreement  . The Trust is party to a registration rights agreement pursuant to which the Trust has agreed to register the offering of the Trust units held by SandRidge and certain of its affiliates and permitted transferees upon request by SandRidge. The holders have the right to require the Trust to file no more than five registration statements in aggregate, one of which has been filed to date. The Trust does not bear any expenses associated with such transactions. 
     
   Administrative Services Agreement.   The Trust is party to an administrative services agreement with SandRidge that obligates the Trust to pay SandRidge an annual administrative services fee for accounting, tax preparation, bookkeeping and informational services performed by SandRidge on behalf of the Trust. Additionally, the administrative services agreement designated SandRidge as the Trust s hedge manager, pursuant to which SandRidge had authority to administer the derivative contracts underlying the derivatives agreement (described below), and, on behalf of the Trust, to administer the Trust s derivative contracts with unaffiliated third parties. For its services under the administrative services agreement, SandRidge receives an annual fee of $300,000, which is payable in equal quarterly installments and will remain fixed for the life of the Trust. SandRidge is also entitled to receive reimbursement for its out-of-pocket fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with the provision of any of the services under this agreement. The administrative services agreement will terminate on the earliest to occur of: (i) the date the Trust shall have dissolved and commenced winding up in accordance with the trust agreement, (ii) the date that all of the Royalty Interests have been terminated or are no longer held by the Trust, (iii) pertaining to services to be provided with respect to any Underlying Properties transferred by SandRidge, the date that either SandRidge or the Trustee may designate by delivering 90-days  prior written notice, provided that the transferee of such Underlying Properties assumes responsibility to perform the services in place of SandRidge and (iv) a date mutually agreed to by SandRidge and the Trustee. During the three-month period ended September 30, 2016, the Trust paid administrative fees to SandRidge equal to $75,000. There were no amounts paid to SandRidge during the three-month period ended September 30, 2015, as

  the related quarterly administrative fee was paid during a prior 2015 period. Administrative fees paid to SandRidge for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 totaled $150,000 and $225,000, respectively.  
     
   Derivatives Agreement.   The Trust and SandRidge were parties to a derivatives agreement that provided the Trust with the economic effect of certain oil derivative contracts between SandRidge and a third party for production through March 31, 2015. Under the derivatives agreement, SandRidge paid the Trust amounts it received from its counterparty and the Trust paid SandRidge any amounts that SandRidge was required to pay such counterparty. Substantially concurrent with the execution of the derivatives agreement and in 2013 and 2012, SandRidge novated certain of the derivative contracts underlying the derivatives agreement to the Trust. As a party to these contracts, the Trust received payment directly from the counterparty and was required to pay any amounts owed directly to the counterparty. To secure its obligations under these novated contracts, the Trust entered into a collateral agency agreement and granted the counterparty a lien on the Royalty Interests. Under the collateral agency agreement, the Trust paid a $15,000 annual fee to the collateral agent through 2015. The Trust s derivative contracts consisted of fixed price swaps. The Trust does not have the ability to enter into additional derivative contracts. 
     
   5. Commitments and Contingencies   
     
   Loan Commitment.   Pursuant to the trust agreement, if at any time the Trust s cash on hand (including available cash reserves) is not sufficient to pay the Trust s ordinary course administrative expenses as they become due, SandRidge will, at the Trustee s request, loan funds to the Trust necessary to pay such expenses. Any funds loaned by SandRidge pursuant to this commitment will be limited to the payment of current accounts payable or other obligations to trade creditors in connection with obtaining goods or services or the payment of other current liabilities arising in the ordinary course of the Trust s business, and may not be used to satisfy Trust indebtedness, or to make distributions. If SandRidge loans funds pursuant to this commitment, unless SandRidge agrees otherwise, no further distributions will be made to unitholders (except in respect of any previously determined quarterly cash distribution amount) until such loan is repaid. Any such loan will be on an unsecured basis, and the terms of such loan will be substantially the same as those which would be obtained in an arm s length transaction between SandRidge and an unaffiliated third party. There was no such loan outstanding with SandRidge at September 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015. 
     
   Risks and Uncertainties.   The Trust s revenue and distributions are substantially dependent upon the prevailing and future prices for oil and natural gas, each of which depends on numerous factors beyond the Trust s control such as overall oil and natural gas production and inventories in relevant markets, economic conditions, the global political environment, regulatory developments and competition from other energy sources. Oil and natural gas prices historically have been volatile and may be subject to significant fluctuations in the future. Low levels of future production, continued low commodity prices and the absence of any derivative arrangements would continue to reduce the Trust s revenues and distributable income available to unitholders. 
     
  The Trust is highly dependent on its Trustor, SandRidge, for multiple services, including the operation of the Trust wells, remittance of net proceeds from the sale of associated production to the Trust, administrative services such as accounting, tax preparation, bookkeeping and informational services performed on behalf of the Trust. The ability to operate the properties depends on the Trustor s future financial condition and economic performance, access to capital, and other factors, many of which are out of the control of the Trustor.  On May 16, 2016, the Trustor and certain of its direct and indirect subsidiaries (collectively, the  Debtors ) filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the  Bankruptcy Code ) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas (the  Bankruptcy Court ). The cases are jointly administered under the caption In re: SandRidge Energy Inc., et al. The Debtors continue to operate the business as  debtors-in-possession  under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and orders of the Bankruptcy Court. On September 9, 2016, the Bankruptcy Court approved the Debtors  Plan of Reorganization, and the Debtors emerged from bankruptcy on October 4, 2016.

   ITEM 2.  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations      
     
   Introduction   
     
  The following discussion and analysis is intended to help the reader understand the financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources of SandRidge Permian Trust (the  Trust ). This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Trust s unaudited interim financial statements and the accompanying notes included in this Quarterly Report and the Trust s audited financial statements and the accompanying notes included in the 2015 Form 10-K.  
     
   Overview   
     
  The Trust is a statutory trust created under the Delaware Statutory Trust Act. The business and affairs of the Trust are administered by the Trustee and, as necessary, the Delaware Trustee. The Trust s purpose is to hold the Royalty Interests, to distribute to the Trust unitholders cash that the Trust receives in respect of the Royalty Interests and the derivatives agreement (described in Note 4 to the unaudited interim financial statements contained in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report) and to perform certain administrative functions in respect of the Royalty Interests and the Trust units. Other than the foregoing activities, the Trust does not conduct any operations or activities. The Trustee has no involvement with, control or authority over, or responsibility for, any aspect of the operations on or relating to the properties in which the Trust has an interest. The Trust derives all or substantially all of its income and cash flow from the Royalty Interests and, during its term, the derivatives agreement. The Trust is treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. The Trust s activities result in the Trust having nexus in Texas and, therefore, make it subject to Texas franchise tax. The Trust is required to pay Texas franchise tax each year at a maximum effective rate (subject to changes in the statutory rate) of 0.525% of its gross income apportioned to Texas for 2015 and future years and 0.7% of its gross income apportioned to Texas for 2014 and prior years.  
     
  SandRidge fulfilled its drilling obligation to the Trust during November 2014. Accordingly, on January 1, 2016, the subordinated units automatically converted into common units, and distributions made on common units in respect of subsequent periods no longer have the benefit of the Subordination Threshold.  
     
   Commodity Price Volatility.   The Trust s quarterly cash distributions are highly dependent upon the prices realized from the sale of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids ( NGL ). The markets for these commodities are volatile and experienced significant pricing declines beginning in the latter half of 2014. Although distributions relating to production through March 31, 2015 were partially supported by hedging arrangements, no such arrangements are in place for production attributable to periods thereafter, and consequently distributions relating to production attributable to periods thereafter should be expected to be lower than distributions for periods prior to March 31, 2015. The Trust received net settlement proceeds of approximately $3.0 million and $26.6 million during the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2015, respectively. 
     
   Properties.   As of September 30, 2016, the Trust s properties consisted of Royalty Interests in the Initial Wells and the Trust Development Wells, all of which are located in Andrews County, Texas. 
     
   Distributions.   The Trust makes quarterly cash distributions of substantially all of its cash receipts, after deducting amounts for the Trust s administrative expenses, property tax and Texas franchise tax and cash reserves withheld by the Trustee, on or about the 60th day following the completion of each quarter. Prior to their conversion to common units in January 2016, the Trust s subordinated units were entitled to receive pro rata distributions from the Trust each quarter, up to and including the February 2016 distribution, if and to the extent there was sufficient cash to provide a cash distribution on the common units that was at least equal to the Subordination Threshold. If there was not sufficient cash to fund such a distribution on all of the common units (including the common units SandRidge owned), the distribution made with respect to the subordinated units was reduced or eliminated for such quarter in order to make a distribution, to the extent possible, to all of the common units (including the common units held by SandRidge, if any) up to the Subordination Threshold. However, there was no minimum distribution. If the cash available for distribution on all of the Trust units in any quarter exceeded the Incentive Threshold for the corresponding quarter, SandRidge, as holder of the Trust s subordinated units, was entitled to 50% of the amount by which the cash available for distribution exceeded the Incentive Threshold. As a result of the conversion of the subordinated units to common units in January 2016, SandRidge s right to receive incentive distributions in respect of subsequent periods terminated. Beginning with the Trust s May 2016 distribution, distributions made to common units no longer have the benefit of the Subordination Threshold, nor are the common units subject to the Incentive Threshold, and the holders of all 52,500,000 common units share on a pro rata basis in the Trust s distributions. 
     
  Pursuant to Internal Revenue Code ( IRC ) Section 1446, withholding tax on income effectively connected to a United States trade or business allocated to foreign partners should be made at the highest marginal rate. Under IRC Section 1441, withholding tax on fixed, determinable, annual, periodic income from United States sources allocated to foreign partners should be made at 30% of gross income unless the rate is reduced by treaty. This is intended to be a qualified notice to nominees and brokers as provided for

  under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1446-4(b) by the Trust, and while specific relief is not specified for IRC Section 1441 income, this disclosure is intended to suffice. Nominees and brokers should withhold  at the highest marginal rate, currently 39.6% for individuals, on the distribution made to foreign partners. 
     
   Results of Trust Operations   
     
  The primary factors affecting the Trust s revenues and costs are the quantity of oil, natural gas and NGL production attributable to the Royalty Interests, the prices received for such production and amounts paid or received as net settlements under the derivatives agreement during its term. Royalty income, post-production expenses, certain taxes and derivative settlements are recorded on a cash basis when net revenue distributions are received by the Trust from SandRidge and net derivative settlements are received from or paid to the Trust s derivative counterparty. Information regarding the Trust s production, pricing and costs for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 is presented below.

    Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2015    
     
   Revenues   
     
   Royalty Income.   Royalty income received during the three-month period ended September 30, 2016 totaled $7.1 million compared to $12.6 million received during the three-month period ended September 30, 2015. Royalty income is a function of production volumes sold attributable to the Royalty Interests and associated prices received. Approximately $3.3 million of the total decrease in royalty income was attributable to the decrease in total volumes produced, caused by a reduction in the average number of producing wells and natural declines in production, and approximately $2.2 million was attributable to a decrease in prices received. The average number of producing wells decreased by 58 during the three-month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three-month period ended September 30, 2015 because wells that could not economically produce due to continued depressed pricing were shut-in. Royalty income received during the three-month period ended September 30, 2016 was based upon production attributable to the Royalty Interests of 176 MBbls of oil, 24 MBbls of NGL and 80 MMcf of natural gas, or 214 MBoe of combined production, for the period from March 1, 2016 to May 31, 2016. Royalty income received during the three-month period ended September 30, 2015 was based upon production attributable to the Royalty Interests of 242 MBbls of oil, 24 MBbls of NGL and 74 MMcf of natural gas, or 279 MBoe of combined production, for the period from March 1, 2015 to May 31, 2015. The average price received for oil decreased to $37.82 per Bbl during the three-month period ended September 30, 2016 from $49.92  per Bbl during the same period in 2015, while the average price received for NGL decreased to $14.74 per Bbl during the three-month period ended September 30, 2016 from $16.23 per Bbl during the same period in 2015. The average price received for natural gas decreased to $1.40 per Mcf during the three-month period ended September 30, 2016 from $1.97 per Mcf during the same period in 2015. 
     
   Derivative Settlements.   The Trust s derivatives agreement with SandRidge reduced the Trust s exposure to commodity price volatility attributable to a portion of production from the Royalty Interests through March 31, 2015 by the use of oil fixed price swaps. No such arrangements are in place for production attributable to periods thereafter. During the three-month period ended September 30, 2015, the Trust received approximately $3.0 million in net cash settlements related to the conveyed contracts for production attributable to the Royalty Interests from March 1, 2015 to March 31, 2015. Total net derivative settlements received by the Trust for production from March 1, 2015 to March 31, 2015 were $5.5 million, including approximately $2.5 million received in May 2015 from the counterparty to the novated contracts, which effectively increased the average price received for oil production for the three-month period by $22.93 per Bbl to $72.85 per Bbl. 
     
   Expenses   
     
   Post-Production Expenses.   The Trust bears post-production expenses attributable to production from the Royalty Interests. Post-production expenses generally consist of costs incurred to gather, store, compress, transport, process, treat, dehydrate and market natural gas produced. Post-production expenses for the three-month period ended September 30, 2016 totaled approximately $17,000 compared to approximately $15,000 for the three-month period ended September 30, 2015. 
     
   Production Taxes.   Production taxes are calculated as a percentage of oil and natural gas revenues, excluding the effects of derivative settlements and net of any applicable tax credits. Production taxes for the three-month period ended September 30, 2016 totaled approximately $0.3 million, or $1.59 per Boe, and were approximately 4.8% of royalty income. Production taxes for the three-month period ended September 30, 2015 totaled approximately $0.6 million, or $2.13 per Boe, and were approximately 4.7% of royalty income.

   Trust Administrative Expenses.   Trust administrative expenses generally consist of fees paid to the Trustee and the Delaware Trustee, administrative services fees paid to SandRidge, tax return and related form preparation fees, legal and accounting fees, and other expenses incurred as a result of being a publicly traded entity. Trust administrative expenses for each of the three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 totaled approximately $0.2 million. 
     
   Distributable Income   
     
  Distributable income for the three-month period ended September 30, 2016 was $6.3 million, which included a net addition to the cash reserve for payment of future Trust expenses of approximately $0.3 million (approximately $0.5 million withheld from the August 2016 cash distribution to unitholders partially offset by approximately $0.2 million used to pay Trust expenses during the period). Distributable income for the three-month period ended September 30, 2015 was $14.1 million, which included a net addition to the cash reserve for payment of future Trust expenses of approximately $0.7 million (approximately $0.9 million withheld from the August 2015 cash distribution to unitholders partially offset by approximately $0.2 million used to pay Trust expenses during the period).  
     
   Distributions to Holders of Common and Subordinated Units.   Holders of Trust common units received greater distributions than holders of Trust subordinated units during the three-month periods ended September 30, 2015 as a result of the Trust s subordination provisions. Because income available for distribution on all Trust units for the August 2015 distribution was below the Subordination Threshold, reduced distributions were paid to the subordinated units. As a result of the subordination provisions, holders of common units received approximately $4.2 million more in distributions for the three-month period ended September 30, 2015, than such holders would have received had the subordination provisions not existed. Income available for distribution for the August 2016 distribution was shared on a pro rata basis among all units due to the termination of the subordination and incentive provisions upon conversion of the subordinated units to common units in January 2016. 
     
    Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015    
     
   Revenues   
     
   Royalty Income.   Royalty income received during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 totaled $22.2 million compared to $49.7 million received during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015. Approximately $14.2 million of the total decrease in royalty income was attributable to the decrease in total volumes produced, caused by a reduction in the average number of producing wells and natural declines in production, and approximately $13.3 million was attributable to a decrease in prices received. The average number of producing wells decreased by 47 during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015 because wells that could not economically produce due to continued depressed pricing were shut-in. Royalty income received during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 was based upon production attributable to the Royalty Interests of 558 MBbls of oil, 69 MBbls of NGL and 230 MMcf of natural gas, or 665 MBoe of combined production, for the period from September 1, 2015 to May 31, 2016. Royalty income received during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015 was based upon production attributable to the Royalty Interests of 789 MBbls of oil, 80 MBbls of NGL and 258 MMcf of natural gas, or 912 MBoe of combined production, for the period from September 1, 2014 to May 31, 2015. The average price received for oil decreased to $37.39 per Bbl during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 from $60.17 per Bbl during the same period in 2015, while the average price received for NGL decreased to $13.64 per Bbl during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 from $20.09 per Bbl during the same period in 2015. The average price received for natural gas decreased to $1.67 per Mcf during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 from $2.59 per Mcf during the same period in 2015. 
     
   Derivative Settlements.   Net cash settlements received related to the Trust s derivatives during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015 were approximately $26.6 million, and included (i) approximately $15.0 million received related to the conveyed contracts for production attributable to the Royalty Interests from September 1, 2014 to March 31, 2015 and (ii) approximately $11.6 million received from the counterparty to the novated contracts for production attributable to the Royalty Interests from October 1, 2014 to March 31, 2015. Total net derivative settlements received by the Trust for production from September 1, 2014 to March 31, 2015 were $27.0 million, including approximately $0.4 million received in 2014 from the counterparty to the novated contracts for September 2014 production, which effectively increased the average price received for oil production for the nine-month period by $34.28 per Bbl to $94.45 per Bbl. 
     
   Expenses   
     
   Post-Production Expenses.   Post-production expenses for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 decreased to approximately $48,000 from approximately $57,000 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015 due to decreased natural gas production.

Table of Contents   
     
   Property Taxes  . The Trust paid approximately $1.7 million of its 2015 property tax assessment during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016. The Trust paid approximately $2.0 million of its 2014 property tax assessment during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015. 
     
   Production Taxes.   Production taxes for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 totaled approximately $1.1 million, or $1.58 per Boe, and were approximately 4.7% of royalty income. Production taxes for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015 totaled approximately $2.3 million, or $2.57 per Boe, and were approximately 4.7% of royalty income. 
     
   Texas Franchise Tax.   The Trust paid its Texas franchise tax for the year ended December 31, 2015 of approximately $0.1 million, or approximately 0.2% of 2015 royalty income, during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016. The Trust paid its Texas franchise tax for the year ended December 31, 2014 of approximately $0.4 million, or approximately 0.3% of 2014 royalty income, during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015. 
     
   Trust Administrative Expenses.   Trust administrative expenses for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 totaled approximately $1.0 million compared to approximately $1.3 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015. 
     
   Distributable Income   
     
  Distributable income for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 was $18.6 million, which included a net reduction to the cash reserve for payment of future Trust expenses of approximately $0.4 million (approximately $2.9 million used to pay Trust expenses during the period partially offset by approximately $2.5 million withheld from the February 2016, May 2016 and August 2016 cash distributions to unitholders). Distributable income for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015 was $71.1 million, which included a net reduction to the cash reserve for payment of future Trust expenses of approximately $0.9 million (approximately $3.7 million used to pay Trust expenses during the period partially offset by approximately $2.8 million withheld from the February 2015, May 2015  and August 2015 cash distributions to unitholders).  
     
   Distributions to Holders of Common and Subordinated Units.   Holders of Trust common units received greater distributions than holders of Trust subordinated units during the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 as a result of the Trust s subordination provisions. Because income available for distribution on all Trust units for the February 2016, August 2015, May 2015 and February 2015 distributions were below the Subordination Threshold, reduced distributions or no distributions were paid to the subordinated units for those periods. As a result of the subordination provisions, holders of common units received approximately $1.9 million and $14.1 million more in distributions for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, than such holders would have received had the subordination provisions not existed. 
     
   Liquidity and Capital Resources   
     
  The Trust s principal sources of liquidity and capital are cash flow generated from the Royalty Interests and, during the term of the derivatives agreement, the Trust s derivative contracts, and borrowings to fund administrative expenses, including any amounts borrowed under SandRidge s loan commitment described in Note 5 to the unaudited interim financial statements contained in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report. The Trust s primary uses of cash are distributions to Trust unitholders, including, if applicable, payment of amounts owed under the Trust s derivative contracts during the term of the derivatives agreement, payment of Trust administrative expenses, including any reserves established by the Trustee for future liabilities, payment of applicable taxes and payment of expense reimbursements to SandRidge for out-of-pocket expenses incurred on behalf of the Trust. The incentive distribution provisions terminated concurrently with the subordination provisions. Under the conveyances granting the Royalty Interests, the Trust does not have any operating or capital cost requirements related to the wells.  
     
  Administrative expenses include payments to the Trustee and the Delaware Trustee as well as a quarterly fee of $75,000 to SandRidge pursuant to an administrative services agreement. Each quarter, the Trustee determines the amount of funds available for distribution. Available funds are the excess cash, if any, received by the Trust from the sale of production attributable to the Royalty Interests that quarter over the Trust s expenses for the quarter, subject to the subordination and incentive provisions as applicable. If at any time the Trust s cash on hand (including available cash reserves) is not sufficient to pay the Trust s ordinary course administrative expenses as they become due, the Trust may borrow funds from the Trustee or other lenders, including SandRidge, to pay such expenses. The Trustee does not intend to lend funds to the Trust. If such funds are borrowed, no further distributions will be made to unitholders (except in respect of any previously determined quarterly distribution amount) until the borrowed funds have been repaid, except that if SandRidge loans such funds, SandRidge may permit the Trust to make distributions prior to SandRidge being repaid.  There was no such loan outstanding at September 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015. 
     
  The Trust is highly dependent on its Trustor, SandRidge, for multiple services, including the operation of the Trust wells, remittance of net proceeds from the sale of associated production to the Trust, administrative services such as accounting, tax

  preparation, bookkeeping and informational services performed on behalf of the Trust. The ability to operate the properties depends on the Trustor s future financial condition and economic performance, access to capital, and other factors, many of which are out of the control of the Trustor.  On May 16, 2016, the Trustor and certain of its direct and indirect subsidiaries (collectively, the  Debtors ) filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the  Bankruptcy Code ) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas (the  Bankruptcy Court ). The cases are jointly administered under the caption In re: SandRidge Energy Inc., et al.  The Debtors continue to operate the business as  debtors-in-possession  under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and orders of the Bankruptcy Court. On September 9, 2016, the Bankruptcy Court approved the Debtors  Plan of Reorganization, and on October 4, 2016, the Debtors emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy.  
     
   2016 Trust Distributions to Unitholders.   During the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, the Trust s distributions to unitholders were as follows: 

Future Trust Distributions to Unitholders.   During the three-month production period from June 1, 2016 to August 31, 2016, total sales volumes were slightly lower than the previous period; however, oil, natural gas and NGL prices increased. On October 27, 2016, the Trust declared a cash distribution of $0.134 per unit covering production for the period. The distribution will be paid on or about November 25, 2016  to record unitholders as of November 11, 2016  and was calculated as follows (in thousands, except for unit and per unit amounts): 

(1)                     Includes amounts withheld for payment of future Trust administrative expenses. 
     
  As the Trust cannot acquire or cause additional wells to be drilled on its behalf, the Trust s production is expected to decline each quarter during the remainder of its life.  
     
   ITEM 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk      
     
   Commodity Price Risk.   Because the Trust s primary asset and source of income is the Royalty Interests, which generally entitle the Trust to receive a portion of the net proceeds from sales of production from the Underlying Properties, the Trust s most significant market risk relates to the prices received for oil, natural gas and NGL production. Revenue derived from the Royalty Interests, and therefore the amount of cash flow available for distribution to the Trust unitholders, depends substantially on prevailing oil, natural gas and NGL prices. Lower prices may also reduce the amount of oil, natural gas and NGL that can be economically produced from the Underlying Properties. 
     
  T he Trust was party to a derivatives agreement with SandRidge that provided the Trust with the economic effect of certain oil derivative contracts for production through March 31, 2015 (which had effects extending into the August 2015 distribution to unitholders) and mitigated a portion of the variability of oil prices received for the Trust s share of production. The Trust does not have the ability to enter into additional derivative contracts. The Trust received net settlement proceeds of approximately $26.6 million related to the derivatives agreement during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015.

   ITEM 4.  Controls and Procedures      
     
   Disclosure Controls and Procedures   
     
  The Trustee conducted an evaluation of the Trust s disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act, designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Trust in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and such information is accumulated and communicated as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on this evaluation, the Trustee has concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures of the Trust are effective as of the end of the period covered by this report. In its evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures, the Trustee has relied, to the extent considered reasonable, on information provided by SandRidge.  
     
  Due to the nature of the Trust as a passive entity and in light of the contractual arrangements pursuant to which the Trust was created, including the provisions of (i) the trust agreement, (ii) the administrative services agreement, (iii) the development agreement and (iv) the conveyances granting the Royalty Interests, the Trustee s disclosure controls and procedures related to the Trust necessarily rely on (A) information provided by SandRidge, including information relating to results of operations, the costs and revenues attributable to the Trust s interests under the conveyance and other operating and historical data, plans for future operating and capital expenditures, reserve information, information relating to projected production, and other information relating to the status and results of operations of the Underlying Properties and the Royalty Interests, and (B) conclusions and reports regarding reserves by the Trust s independent reserve engineers.
