  (1)   Organization 
    
  ICON ECI Fund Sixteen (the  Fund ) was formed on October 11, 2012 as a Delaware statutory trust. When used in these notes to consolidated financial statements, the terms  we,   us,   our  or similar terms refer to the Fund and its consolidated subsidiaries. 
    
  We are a direct financing fund that primarily makes investments in or that are collateralized by equipment and other corporate infrastructure (collectively,  Capital Assets ). The investments are in companies that utilize Capital Assets to operate their businesses. These investments are primarily structured as debt and debt-like financings such as loans, leases and other structured financing transactions in or that are collateralized by Capital Assets that ICON MT 16, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and our managing owner (the  Managing Owner ), believes will provide us with a satisfactory, risk-adjusted rate of return. Our Managing Owner makes investment decisions on our behalf and manages our business. 
    
  Our investment objectives are to preserve investors  capital, provide distributions and provide a favorable total return. To meet our investment objectives, we have used the net proceeds from our offering and will use the cash generated from our investments to originate or acquire a diverse pool of investments described above, as well as other strategic investments collateralized by Capital Assets. ICON Capital, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and our affiliate, is our investment manager (the  Investment Manager ). Our Investment Manager originates and services our investments. Wilmington Trust, National Association (the  Trustee ) serves as our sole trustee pursuant to our Third Amended and Restated Trust Agreement (the  Trust Agreement ). The Trustee delegated to our Managing Owner all of the power and authority to manage our business and affairs and has only nominal duties and liabilities to us. 
    
  Our offering period commenced on July 1, 2013 and ended on December 31, 2014. Our Managing Owner determined to cease our offering period earlier than originally anticipated as a result of lower than expected offering proceeds being raised. Our operating period commenced on January 1, 2015. We offered to sell to the public any combination of   two   classes of shares, Class A shares and Class I shares (collectively, the  Shares ), on a  best efforts  basis with the intention of raising up to   $250,000,000   of capital, of which $  9,000,000   had been reserved for issuance pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan (the  DRIP ). Other than differing allocable fees and expenses, Class A shares and Class I shares have identical rights and privileges, such as identical voting and distribution rights. 
    
  As of November 12, 2013 (the  Initial Closing Date ), we raised a minimum of   $1,200,000   from the sale of our Shares, at which time shareholders were admitted and we commenced operations. As of June 13, 2014, we raised the   $12,500,000   minimum offering amount for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Subsequent to the Initial Closing Date, we returned the initial capital contribution of   $1,000   to CION Investment Group, LLC (formerly, ICON Investment Group, LLC) (the  Initial Shareholder ). From the commencement of our offering on July 1, 2013 through December 31, 2014, we sold   17,189   Class A shares to   351   Class A shareholders and   410   Class I shares to   six   Class I shareholders, of which   404   Class A shares and   12   Class I shares were issued pursuant to the DRIP, representing an aggregate of   $17,469,610   of capital contributions.  From the Initial Closing Date through December 31, 2014, we incurred sales commissions to third parties of   $1,198,531   and dealer-manager and distribution fees of   $347,547   to C ON Securities, LLC (formerly, ICON Securities, LLC), the dealer-manager of our offering and an affiliate of our Investment Manager ( C ON Securities ). In addition, organization costs of   $8,418   and offering expenses of   $161,422   were incurred by us during such period. Organization costs were expensed when incurred and offering expenses were recorded as a reduction of shareholders  equity.  
   
  (2)   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
    
  Basis of Presentation and Consolidation 
    
  Our accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP ) for interim financial information and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) for Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. In the opinion of our Managing Owner, all adjustments, which are of a normal recurring nature, considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included.  These consolidated financial statements should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and notes included in our

Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. The results for the interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results for the full year. 
    
  Credit Quality of Notes Receivable and Finance Leases and Credit Loss Reserve 
    
  Our Investment Manager monitors the ongoing credit quality of our financing receivables by (i) reviewing and analyzing a borrower s financial performance on a regular basis, including review of financial statements received on a monthly, quarterly or annual basis as prescribed in the loan or lease agreement, (ii) tracking the relevant credit metrics of each financing receivable and a borrower s compliance with financial and non-financial covenants, (iii) monitoring a borrower s payment history and public credit rating, if available, and (iv) assessing our exposure based on the current investment mix. As part of the monitoring process, our Investment Manager may physically inspect the collateral or a borrower s facility and meet with a borrower s management to better understand such borrower s financial performance and its future plans on an as-needed basis.  
    
  As our financing receivables, generally notes receivable and finance leases, are limited in number, our Investment Manager is able to estimate the credit loss reserve based on a detailed analysis of each financing receivable as opposed to using portfolio-based metrics. Our Investment Manager does not use a system of assigning internal risk ratings to each of our financing receivables. Rather, each financing receivable is analyzed quarterly and categorized as either performing or non-performing based on certain factors including, but not limited to, financial results, satisfying scheduled payments and compliance with financial covenants. A financing receivable is usually categorized as non-performing only when a borrower experiences financial difficulties and has failed to make scheduled payments. Our Investment Manager then analyzes whether the financing receivable should be placed on a non-accrual status, a credit loss reserve should be established or the financing receivable should be restructured. As part of the assessment, updated collateral value is usually considered and such collateral value can be based on a third party industry expert appraisal or, depending on the type of collateral and accessibility to relevant published guides or market sales data, internally derived fair value. Material events would be specifically disclosed in the discussion of each financing receivable held.  
    
  Financing receivables are generally placed on a non-accrual status when payments are more than 90 days past due. Additionally, our Investment Manager periodically reviews the creditworthiness of companies with payments outstanding less than 90 days and based upon our Investment Manager s judgment, these accounts may be placed on a non-accrual status. 
    
  In accordance with the cost recovery method, payments received on non-accrual financing receivables are applied to principal if there is doubt regarding the ultimate collectability of principal. If collection of the principal of non-accrual financing receivables is not in doubt, interest income is recognized on a cash basis. Financing receivables on non-accrual status may not be restored to accrual status until all delinquent payments have been received, and we believe recovery of the remaining unpaid receivable is probable. 
    
  When our Investment Manager deems it is probable that we will not be able to collect all contractual principal and interest on a non-performing financing receivable, we perform an analysis to determine if a credit loss reserve is necessary. This analysis considers the estimated cash flows from the financing receivable, and/or the collateral value of the asset underlying the financing receivable when financing receivable repayment is collateral dependent. If it is determined that the impaired value of the non-performing financing receivable is less than the net carrying value, we will recognize a credit loss reserve or adjust the existing credit loss reserve with a corresponding charge to earnings.  We then charge off a financing receivable in the period that it is deemed uncollectible by reducing the credit loss reserve and the balance of the financing receivable. 
    
  Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  In January 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2015-01,   Income Statement   Extraordinary and Unusual Items: Simplifying Income Statement Presentation by Eliminating the Concept of Extraordinary Items   ( ASU 2015-01 ), which simplifies income statement presentation by eliminating the concept of extraordinary items.

the consolidation analysis by reducing the frequency of application of related party guidance and excluding certain fees in the primary beneficiary determination. We adopted ASU 2015-02 on January 1, 2016, which did not have an effect on our consolidated financial statements. 
  In April 2015, FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03,   Interest       Imputation of Interest: Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs   ( ASU 2015-03 ), which requires debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of such debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. In August 2015, FASB issued ASU No. 2015-15,   Interest   Imputation of Interest: Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements   ( ASU 2015-15 ), which further specifies the SEC staff s view on the presentation and subsequent measurement of debt issuance costs associated with line of credit arrangements. We adopted ASU 2015-03 on January 1, 2016, which did not have an effect on our consolidated financial statements. In addition, we adopted ASU 2015-15 on January 1, 2016 and continue to present debt issuance costs associated with our revolving line of credit as other assets on our consolidated balance sheets. 
  Other Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  In May 2014, FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09  , Revenue from Contracts with Customers   ( ASU 2014-09 ), requiring revenue to be recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received in exchange for goods and services. This new revenue standard may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented, or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date of adoption. In August 2015, FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers   Deferral of the Effective Date   ( ASU 2015-14 ), which defers implementation of ASU 2014-09 by one year. Under such deferral, the adoption of ASU 2014-09 becomes effective for us on January 1, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted, but not before our original effective date of January 1, 2017. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2014-09 on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In August 2014, FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15,   Presentation of Financial Statements   Going Concern: Disclosure of     Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern   ( ASU 2014-15 ), which provides guidance about management's responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. The adoption of ASU 2014-15 becomes effective for us on our fiscal year ending after December 31, 2016, and all subsequent annual and interim periods. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2014-15 is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In January 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01,   Financial Instruments - Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities   ( ASU 2016-01 ), which provides guidance related to accounting for equity investments, financial liabilities under the fair value option, and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. In addition, FASB clarified guidance related to the valuation allowance assessment when recognizing deferred tax assets resulting from unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities. The adoption of ASU 2016-01 becomes effective for us on January 1, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-01 on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In February 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases   ( ASU 2016-02 ), which requires lessees to recognize assets and liabilities for leases with lease terms greater than twelve months on the balance sheet and disclose key information about leasing arrangements. ASU 2016-02 implements changes to lessor accounting focused on conforming with certain changes made to lessee accounting and the recently released revenue recognition guidance. The adoption of ASU 2016-02 becomes effective for us on January 1, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-02 on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In March 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-07,   Investments   Equity Method and Joint Ventures: Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting   ( ASU 2016-07 ), which eliminates the retroactive adjustments to an investment upon it qualifying for the equity method of accounting as a result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence by the investor. ASU 2016-07 requires that the equity method investor add the cost of acquiring the additional interest in the investee to the current basis of the investor s previously held interest and adopt the equity method of accounting as of the date the investment qualifies for equity method accounting. The adoption of ASU 2016-07 becomes effective for us on January 1, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2016-07 is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.

In June 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,   Financial Instruments   Credit Losses   ( ASU 2016-13 ), which modifies the measurement of credit losses by eliminating the probable initial recognition threshold set forth in current guidance, and instead reflects an entity s current estimate of all expected credit losses. The measurement of expected credit losses is based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. An entity will apply the amendments within ASU 2016-13 through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. The adoption of ASU 2016-13 becomes effective for us on January 1, 2020, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-13 on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In August 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows: Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments   ( ASU 2016-15 ), which provides guidance on how certain cash receipts and cash payments are to be presented and classified in the statement of cash flows.  The adoption of ASU 2016-15 becomes effective for us on January 1, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted. An entity will apply the amendments within ASU 2016-15 using a retrospective transition method to each period presented.  We are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-15 on our consolidated financial statements.

(5)   Investment in Joint Ventures 
    
  On October 29, 2015, Murray Energy Corporation and certain of its affiliates purchased mining equipment from a joint venture owned   19.8%   by us pursuant to the terms of the lease for   $2,991,400  .

  Overview 
    
  We are a direct financing fund that primarily makes investments in domestic and international businesses, which investments are primarily structured as debt and debt-like financings (such as loans, leases and other structured financing transactions) in or that are collateralized by Capital Assets utilized by such companies to operate their businesses, as well as other strategic investments in or collateralized by Capital Assets that our Managing Owner believes will provide us with a satisfactory, risk-adjusted rate of return. We were formed as a Delaware statutory trust and are treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. 
    
  Our offering period commenced on July 1, 2013 and ended on December 31, 2014. Our Managing Owner determined to cease our offering period earlier than originally anticipated as a result of lower than expected offering proceeds being raised. Our operating period commenced on January 1, 2015. As of the Initial Closing Date, we raised a minimum of $1,200,000 from the sale of our Shares, at which time shareholders were admitted and we commenced operations. As of June 13, 2014, we raised the $12,500,000 minimum offering amount for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Subsequent to the Initial Closing Date, we returned the initial capital contribution of $1,000 to the Initial Shareholder. From the commencement of our offering on July 1, 2013 through December 31, 2014, we sold 17,189 Class A shares to 351 Class A shareholders and 410 Class I shares to six Class I shareholders, of which 404 Class A shares and 12 Class I shares were issued pursuant to the DRIP, representing an aggregate of $17,469,610 of capital contributions. From Initial Closing Date through December 31, 2014, we incurred sales commissions to third parties of $1,198,531 and dealer-manager and distribution fees to C ON Securities of $347,547. In addition, organization costs of $8,418 and offering expenses of $161,422 were incurred by us during such period. 
    
  After the net offering proceeds were invested, additional investments have been and will continue to be made with the cash generated from our initial investments to the extent that cash is not used for our expenses, reserves and distributions to our shareholders. The investment in additional Capital Assets in this manner is called  reinvestment.  We anticipate investing and reinvesting in Capital Assets from time to time during our five year operating period, which may be extended, at our Managing Owner s discretion, for up to an additional three years. After the operating period, we will then sell our assets and/or let our investments mature in the ordinary course of business, during a time frame called the  wind down period.  
    
  Our Trustee serves as our sole trustee pursuant to the Trust Agreement and has delegated to our Managing Owner all of the power and authority to manage our business and affairs, including, but not limited to, our investments in Capital Assets.  Pursuant to the terms of our investment management agreement, our Managing Owner has engaged our Investment Manager to, among other things, originate and service our investments.

During the 2016 Quarter and the 2015 Quarter, certain customers generated significant portions (defined as 10% or more) of our total finance income as follows: 

(1) Upon the prepayment by Premier Trailer of its secured term loan during the 2016 Quarter, a loss was recorded as a result of the write-off of the remaining unamortized initial direct costs. 
    
  Interest income and prepayments fees from our net investment in note receivable and finance income from our net investment in finance lease are included in finance income in our consolidated statements of operations. 
    
  Revenue and other income for the 2016 Quarter and the 2015 Quarter is summarized as follows: 

Total revenue and other income for the 2016 Quarter decreased $  163,690  , or   40.5%  , as compared to the 2015 Quarter. The decrease in finance income was primarily due to (i) the prepayment of the secured term loan by Premier Trailer in the 2016 Quarter, of which a loss was recorded as a result of the write-off of the remaining unamortized initial direct costs and (ii) damage to certain assets on lease to Geokinetics, Inc. ( Geokinetics ) primarily in 2015, which accelerated income recognition related to such assets, and the declining nature of recognizing income using the effective interest rate method. 
    
  Expenses for the 2016 Quarter and the 2015 Quarter are summarized as follows: 

Total expenses for the 2016 Quarter increased $  72,098  , or   35.2%  , as compared to the 2015 Quarter. The increase was primarily due to increases in (i) general and administrative expenses due to higher system support and legal fees incurred during the 2016 Quarter as compared to the 2015 Quarter and (ii) management fees due to the prepayment of the secured term loan by Premier Trailer during the 2016 Quarter. 
    
  Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests 
    
  Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased $  37,499  , from $  94,838   in the 2015 Quarter to $  57,339   in the 2016 Quarter. The decrease was a result of a decrease in net income generated by our finance lease related to Geokinetics during the 2016 Quarter as compared to the 2015 Quarter. 
    
  Net (Loss) Income Attributable to Fund Sixteen 
    
  As a result of the foregoing factors, net (loss) income attributable to us for the 2016 Quarter and the 2015 Quarter was $  (93,859)   and $  104,430  , respectively.

Results of Operations for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 (the  2016 Period ) and 2015 (the  2015 Period ) 
  The following percentages are only as of a stated period and are not expected to be comparable in future periods. Further, these percentages are only representative of the percentage of finance income as of each stated period, and as such are not indicative of the concentration of any asset type or customer by the amount of equity invested or our investment portfolio as a whole. 
    
  Financing Transactions 
  During the 2016 Period and the 2015 Period, certain customers generated significant portions (defined as 10% or more) of our total finance income as follows:   

Interest income and prepayment fees from our net investment in note receivable and finance income from our net investment in finance lease are included in finance income in our consolidated statements of operations.     
    
  Revenue and other income for the 2016 Period and the 2015 Period is summarized as follows: 

Total revenue and other income for the 2016 Period decreased $  105,116  , or   8.4%  , as compared to the 2015 Period. The decrease in finance income was due to (i) damage to certain assets on lease to Geokinetics primarily in 2015, which accelerated income recognition related to such assets, and the declining nature of recognizing income using the effective interest rate method and (ii) the prepayment of the secured term loan by Premier Trailer in the 2016 Period, of which a loss was recorded as a result of the write-off of the remaining unamortized initial direct costs. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in income from investment in joint ventures primarily as a result of entering into new joint ventures subsequent to the 2015 Period and the gain on sale of investment in joint ventures as a result of the sale of our interests in ICON Challenge and ICON Challenge III during the 2016 Period.  
    
  Expenses for the 2016 Period and the 2015 Period are summarized as follows:  

Total expenses for the 2016 Period increased $  166,576  , or   22.7%  , as compared to the 2015 Period. The increase was primarily due to increases in (i) general and administrative expenses due to higher bank and audit fees and (ii) management fees due to the prepayments of the lease by D T and the secured term loan by Premier Trailer, each during the 2016 Period as compared to the 2015 Period.

Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests 
    
  Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased   $101,842  , from   $305,056   in the 2015 Period to   $203,214   in the 2016 Period. The decrease was a result of a decrease in net income generated by our finance lease related to Geokinetics during the 2016 Period as compared to the 2015 Period. 
    
  Net Income Attributable to Fund Sixteen 
    
  As a result of the foregoing factors, net income attributable to us for the 2016 Period and the 2015 Period was $  42,134   and $  211,984  , respectively. Net income attributable to us per weighted average additional Class A share and Class I share outstanding for the 2016 Period was $  2.36   and $  2.96  , respectively.

  Financial Condition 
    
  This section discusses the major balance sheet variances at September 30, 2016 compared to December 31, 2015. 
    
  Total Assets    
  Total assets decreased $  3,847,362  , from $  19,122,189   at December 31, 2015 to $  15,274,827   at September 30, 2016. The decrease was primarily due to the use of existing cash, cash generated by and returned from our investments, and from the sale of our interests in certain joint ventures being partially used to (i) pay distributions to our shareholders and noncontrolling interests, (ii) repay the total amount outstanding on our Facility and (iii) repay certain of our related party payable, each during the 2016 Period. 
    
  Total Liabilities    
  Total liabilities decreased $  2,037,906  , from $  2,625,490   at December 31, 2015 to $  587,584   at September 30, 2016. The decrease was primarily due to the repayment of the total amount outstanding on our Facility and certain of our related party payable during the 2016 Period. 
    
  Equity    
  Equity decreased $  1,809,456  , from $  16,496,699   at December 31, 2015 to $  14,687,243   at September 30, 2016. The decrease was primarily due to distributions to our shareholders and noncontrolling interests, partially offset by our net income in the 2016 Period. 
    
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  Summary 
    
  At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had cash of $  7,297,772   and $  1,672,868  , respectively. Pursuant to the terms of our offering, we have established a cash reserve in the amount of 0.50% of the gross offering proceeds from the sale of our Shares. As of September 30, 2016, the cash reserve was $87,348. During our operating period, which commenced on January 1, 2015, our main source of cash will be from the collection of income and principal on our finance lease and distributions from our joint ventures. Our main use of cash will be for distributions to our shareholders and noncontrolling interests. Our liquidity will vary in the future, increasing to the extent cash flows from investments and proceeds from the sale of our investments exceed expenses and decreasing as we make new investments, pay distributions to our shareholders and noncontrolling interests and to the extent that expenses exceed cash flows from operations and proceeds from the sale of our investments. 
    
  We believe that cash generated from the expected results of our operations will be sufficient to finance our liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future, including distributions to our shareholders and noncontrolling interests, general and administrative expenses, new investment opportunities, management fees and administrative expense reimbursements. 
     
  Our ability to generate cash in the future is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors that affect us and our borrowers  and lessees  businesses that are beyond our control. 
    
  We have used the net proceeds of our offering and will use the cash generated from our investments to invest in Capital Assets located in North America and other developed markets, including those in Asia and elsewhere.  We have sought and continue to seek to acquire a portfolio of Capital Assets that is comprised of transactions that generate (a) current cash flow from payments  
  
   19 

     Table of Contents  

of principal and/or interest (in the case of secured loans and other financing transactions) and rental payments (in the case of leases), (b) deferred cash flow by realizing the value of Capital Assets or interests therein at the maturity of the investment, or (c) a combination of both from other structured investments. 
    
  Unanticipated or greater than anticipated operating costs or losses (including a borrower s inability to make timely loan payments or a lessee s inability to make timely lease payments) would adversely affect our liquidity. To the extent that working capital may be insufficient to satisfy our cash requirements, we anticipate that we would fund our operations from cash flow generated by investing and financing activities. At September 30, 2016, we had $  1,469,652   available under the Facility pursuant to the borrowing base to fund our short-term liquidity needs. For additional information, see  Financings and Borrowings   Revolving Line of Credit, Recourse  below and Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements. Our Managing Owner does not intend to fund any cash flow deficit of ours or provide other financial assistance to us. 
    
  Cash Flows 
    
  Operating Activities  
    
  Cash used in operating activities decreased $  295,181  , from $  404,418   in the 2015 Period to $  109,237   in the 2016 Period. The decrease was primarily due to (i) less cash being used to repay the amount due to our Investment Manager during the 2016 Period as a result of the timing of the payments of and the reduction in expenses incurred on our behalf by our Investment Manager, (ii) the recording of a certain estimated tax receivable during the 2015 Period, of which a portion was collected in the 2016 Period and (iii) an increase in distributions from our joint ventures during the 2016 Period as compared to the 2015 Period. 
    
  Investing Activities       
    
  Cash provided by investing activities increased $  7,197,592  , from $  2,167,821   in the 2015 Period to $  9,365,413   in the 2016 Period. The increase was primarily due to (i) proceeds from the sale of our interests in ICON Challenge and ICON Challenge III, (ii) principal received on notes receivable due to the prepayment by Premier Trailer in the 2016 Period and (iii) no cash being used to make new investments in the 2016 Period as compared to the 2015 Period, partially offset by a decrease in distributions from our joint ventures in excess of profits during the 2016 Period as compared to the 2015 Period.  
    
  Financing Activities      
    
  Cash used in financing activities increased $  1,391,006  , from $  2,240,266   in the 2015 Period to $  3,631,272   in the 2016 Period. The increase was primarily due to the repayment of the total amount outstanding on our Facility during the 2016 Period, partially offset by a decrease in distributions paid to our shareholders. 
    
  Financings and Borrowings 
    
  Revolving Line of Credit, Recourse 
    
  We have an agreement with CB T for our Facility, which is secured by all of our assets not subject to a first priority lien.  Amounts available under the Facility are subject to a borrowing base that is determined, subject to certain limitations, by the present value of the future receivables under certain loans and lease agreements in which we have a beneficial interest.  
    
  The interest rate for general advances under the Facility is CB T s prime rate. We may elect to designate up to five advances on the outstanding principal balance of the Facility to bear interest at LIBOR plus 2.5% per year. In all instances, borrowings under the Facility are subject to an interest rate floor of 4.0% per year. In addition, we are obligated to pay an annualized 0.5% fee on unused commitments under the Facility. On February 9, 2016 and March 29, 2016, we repaid $1,000,000 and $500,000, respectively, of the total outstanding balance under the Facility. At September 30, 2016, there were no obligations outstanding under the Facility and we were in compliance with the covenants related to the Facility.  
    
  At September 30, 2016, we had $  1,469,652   available under the Facility pursuant to the borrowing base. 
    
  Distributions 
    
  We, at our Managing Owner s discretion, pay monthly distributions to our shareholders beginning with the first month after each such shareholder s admission and expect to continue to pay such distributions until the termination of our operating period. During the 2016 Period, we paid distributions to our Managing Owner, Class A additional shareholders and Class I  
  
   20 

     Table of Contents  

shareholders of   $8,901  ,   $860,699  , and   $20,528  , respectively. We also paid distributions to our noncontrolling interests of   $1,164,676   in the 2016 Period. 
    
  Commitments and Contingencies and Off-Balance Sheet Transactions 
    
  Commitments and Contingencies 
    
  At the time we acquire or divest of our interest in Capital Assets, we may, under very limited circumstances, agree to indemnify the seller or buyer for specific contingent liabilities.  Our Managing Owner believes that any liability of ours that may arise as a result of any such indemnification obligations may or may not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole. We are a party to the Facility, as discussed in  Financings and Borrowings   Revolving Line of Credit, Recourse  above. We had no borrowings under the Facility at September 30, 2016. 
    
  Off-Balance Sheet Transactions 
    
  None.

  Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
    
  Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures 
    
  In connection with the preparation of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended September 30, 2016, our Managing Owner carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the management of our Managing Owner, including its Co-Chief Executive Officers and the Principal Financial and Accounting Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our Managing Owner s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.  Based on the foregoing evaluation, the Co-Chief Executive Officers and the Principal Financial and Accounting Officer concluded that our Managing Owner s disclosure controls and procedures were effective. 
    
  In designing and evaluating our Managing Owner s disclosure controls and procedures, our Managing Owner recognized that disclosure controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met.  Our Managing Owner s disclosure controls and procedures have been designed to meet reasonable assurance standards. Disclosure controls and procedures cannot detect or prevent all error and fraud. Some inherent limitations in disclosure controls and procedures include costs of implementation, faulty decision-making, simple error and mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based, in part, upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all anticipated and unanticipated future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with established policies or procedures. 
    
  Evaluation of internal control over financial reporting 
    
  There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II     - OTHER INFORMATION 
   
  Item 1. Legal Proceedings       
    
  In the ordinary course of conducting our business, we may be subject to certain claims, suits, and complaints filed against us.  In our Managing Owner s opinion, the outcome of such matters, if any, will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.  We are not aware of any material legal proceedings that are currently pending against us or against any of our assets.
