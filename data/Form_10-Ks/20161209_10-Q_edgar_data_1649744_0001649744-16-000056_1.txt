1  .          NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND   BASIS OF PRESENTATION 

A.      Nature of Operations 

Duluth Holdings Inc. ( Duluth   Trading    or the  Company )  ,   a Wisconsin corporation,   is   a   lifestyle brand of men s and women s casual wear, workwear and accessories sold exclusively through the Company s own direct and retail channels. The direct segment, consisting of the   Co  mpany s website and catalogs,     offers products natio  nwide  . In 2010, the Comp  any added retail to   it  s omni-channel   platform   with the opening of its first store. Since then, Duluth   Trading   has expanded its retail presence, and as of   October 30, 2016  , the Company operated   12   retail stores and   tw  o   outlet stores   across   the Midwestern   and Eastern   United States  . The Company s products are marketed   under the Duluth Trading   brand, with the majority   of     products   being exclusively devel  oped and sold as Duluth Trading     branded merchandise.  

The Company has   two   cla  sses of authorized common stock:   Class A common stock and Class B common stock. The rights of holders of Class A common stock and Class B common stock are i  dentical, except for   voting and conversion rights.   Each share of Class A common stock is entitled to ten votes per share and is convertible   at any time   into one share of Class B common stock. Each share of Class B common stock is entitled to one vote per share.     The Company s Class B common stock trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol  DLTH.  

On November 25  , 2015  ,   the Company converted from a  n    S  corporation to a  C  corporation for federal income tax purposes under Section 1362 of the Internal Revenu  e Code   of 1986  , as amended (the  Code ),   and   the Company completed its initial pub  lic offering ( IPO ).   Refer to the Company s consolidated financial statements and notes included in the Company s annual report on Form 10-K for the   fiscal   year ended January 31, 2016, for additional information related to the Company s IPO. During the first quarter of fiscal 2016  , the Company paid the remaining $0.  2   million balance of its final  S  corporation distribution, which resulted in a total final distribution of $  46.  6   million   from the termination of the Company s  S  corporation status.    

B.      Basis of Presentation 

The   condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( U.S. GAAP ).   The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the parent, Duluth Holdings Inc., and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Duluth Trading Company, LLC.   Effective October 3, 2016, Duluth Trading Company, LLC was dissolved and no longer consolidated  ,    which did not impact   the Company s consolidated financial statements  .    The Company also consolidates Schlecht Retail Ventures LLC ( SRV ) as a variable interest entity (see Note   4    Variable Interest Entity   ).   All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated  . 

The   Company s fiscal   year ends on the Sunday nearest   to January 31 of the following year.   Fiscal 2016   is a 52-we  ek period and ends on January 29, 2017  .    Fiscal 2015   was a 52-w  eek period and ended on January 31, 2016. The three   and nine     months of fiscal 201  6   and fiscal 201  5   represe  nt the Company s 13   and 39  -  week   periods ended   October 30, 2016   and   November 1, 2015  , respectively  .    

The   accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for the   three   and nine   months ended   October 30, 2016   and   November 1, 2015     have been prepared by the Company, without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) and, in the opinion of the Company, include all adjustments (which are normal and recurring in nature) necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the Company for the interim periods presented. Certain information and note disclosures normally included in consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such SEC rules and regulations as of and for the   three   an  d nine     months ended   October 30, 2016   and   November 1, 2015  .   These interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included in the   Company s annual r  eport on Form 10-K   for the     fiscal   year ended January 31, 2016  .   

C.    Seasonality of Business 

The Company s business is affected by the pattern of seasonality common to most retail apparel businesses. Historically, the Company has recognized a significant portion of its revenue and operating profit in the fourth fiscal quarter of each year as a result of increased sales during the holiday season.  

D  .      Pro Forma     Net Income Information 

For the three   and nine     months ended   November 1, 2015  , the   pro forma net income information gives effect to the conversion of the Company to a  C  corporation   on November 25  , 2015  . Prior to such conversion, the Company   was an    S   

8   

Table of Contents   

DULUTH HOLDINGS INC.   Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 

corporation and generally not subject to income taxes. The pro forma net income, therefore, includes an adjustment for income tax expense on the income attributable to controlling interest as if the Company had been a  C  corporation as of February 4, 2013 at an assumed combined federal, state and local effective tax rate of   40%  , which approximates the calculated stat  utory rate for each period. No p  ro forma income tax expense was calculated on the income attributable to noncontrolling interest because this entity did not convert to a  C  corporation. 

For the three   and nine   months ended   November 1, 2015  , the   pro forma basic and diluted net income per share   of   Class A and Class B   common stock     is c  omputed using the   pro   forma net income, as discussed above. 

E.    Restricted Cash 

The Company s restricted cash is held in   an   escrow   account     and is used to pay   a portion of the construction   loan  s   entered i  nto by   third party l  andlord  s   (the    Landlord  s   ) in connection with   the Company s     retail   store lease  s  . The restricted cash   is disburs  ed based on   the   escrow agreement   entered into by and among the Landlord  s  , the Company and   the   escrow agent  . 

F.    Build-to-Suit Lease 

The Company may at times be involved in   the   construction of store  s    to be   leased   by the Company   and  ,   depending on the extent to which the Company is involved,   the Company may be deemed the owner of the leased premises for accounting purposes during the   store   construction   period.     For leases that   the Company is deemed the owner of the property during   the   construction   period  , upon commencement of the construction project, the Company is required to capitalize the cash and non-cash assets contributed by the landlord for construction as property and equipment on the Company s   Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.     U  pon   the   completion   of the construction project  , the Company performs an analysis on the lease to   determine if the Company qualifies   for sale-leaseback treatment. For those qualifying leases, the deemed landlord financing liability and the associated property and equipment are removed and the difference is reclassified to either prepaid or deferred rent and amortized over the lease term as an increase or decrease to rent expense. If the lease does not qualify for sale-leaseback treatment, the deemed landlord financing liability is amortized over the lease term based on the rent payments in the lease agreement. 

As of October 30, 2016, the Company capitalized   $2.0   million in property and equipment and recorded a corresponding non-current liability related to build-to-suit lease transactions in which the Company is considered the owner for accounting purposes. 

2  .    DEBT AND LINE OF CREDIT

In May 2014, the Company assumed a mortgage note ( Mortgage 2017 Note ) from Schlecht Enterprises LLC ( SE ) in conjunction with the Company s acquisition of certain related real property from SE, an entity that was previously consolidated through May 21, 2014.

Schlecht Retail Ventures LLC 

SRV entered into a mortgage note ( SRV 2017 Note ) with an original balance of $  0.8   million. The SRV 2017 Note expires in   September 2017   and requires monthly payments of $  3,300   plus interest at   3.1%  , with a final balloon payment due in September 2017.

SRV entered into a mortgage note ( SRV 2016 Note ) with an original balance of $  0.5   million. The SRV 2016 Note expired in   August 2016   and required monthly payments of $  3,400  , including interest at   4.5%  , with a final balloon payment due in August 2016. On August 5, 2016, SRV paid off the remaining SRV 2016 Note in the amount of $  0.4   million. 

Line of Credit 

On October 7, 2016, the Company amended and restated its existing Amended and Restated Loan Agreement dated as of June 13, 2011, as amended (the  Amended and Restated Agreement ). The Amended and Restated Agreement provides for b  orrowing availability of up to   $  40.0   million from October 7, 2016 through July 31, 2017, up to $  50.0   million from August 1, 2017 through July 31, 2018, and up to $  60.0   million from August 1, 2018 through July 31, 2019. The Amended and Restated Agreement   matures on   July 31, 2019  , and bears interest, payable monthly, at   a rate equal to the   adjusted LIBOR rate  , as defined in the Amended and Rested Agreement   (effective rate of   1.8%   at October   30, 2016). The Amended and Restated Agreement is secured by essentially all Company assets and requires the Company to maintain compliance with certain financial and non-financial covenants, including minimum tangible net worth and a minimum trailing twelve month EBITDA. In addition, the Amended and Restated Agreement does   not   contain borrowing base limits. 

As of October 30, 2016 and for the nine months then ended, the Company was in compliance with all financial and non-financial covenants for all debts discussed above.

DULUTH HOLDINGS INC.   Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 

4  .      VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY 

Based upon the criteria set for  th   in ASC 810,   Consolidation  , the Company has determined that it was the primary beneficiary of   one   variable interest   entity ( VIE ) as of   October 30, 2016   and January 31, 2016  , as the Company absorbs significant economics of the entity and has the power to direct the activities that are considered most significant to the entity. 

The Company leases certain retail store facilities and office buildings from SRV, a VIE whose primary purpose and activity is to own this real property. SRV is a Wisconsin limited liability company that is owned by the majority shareholder of the Company. The Company considers itself the primary beneficiary for SRV as the Company is expected to receive a majority of SRV s expected residual returns based on the activity of SRV. As the Company is the primary beneficiary, it c  onsolidates SRV and the leases are   eliminated in consolidation.  

The condensed consolidated balance sheets include the following amounts as a result of the consolidation of SRV as of   October 30, 2016   and   January 31, 2016  : 

5  .      EARNINGS PER SHARE 

Earnings per share is computed under the provisions of   ASC   260  , Earnings Per Share  . Basic earnings per share is based on   the   weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method. Dilutive potential common shares include outstanding restricted stock.   The reconciliation of the numerator and denominator of the basic and diluted earnings per share calculation is as follows:

6  .      STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION 

The Company accounts for its stock-based compensation plan in accordance with ASC 718,   Stock Compensation  , which requires   the Company to measure   al  l share-  based payments at   grant date   fair value and recognize   the cost over the requisite service period of the award. 

Total stock compensation expense associated with restricted stock recognized by the C  ompany during the three   and nine   months e  nded   October 30, 2016   was   $0.4   million and   $1.0   million, respectively  . Total stock compensation expense associated with restricted stock recognized by the   Company during the three and nine   months ended   November 1, 2015   was $  0.  2   million and   $0.  5     million, respectively. The Company s total stock compensation expense   is included in selling, general and administrative expenses on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations. 

A summary of th  e activity in the Company s un  vested   r  estricted stock during the nine   months ended   October 30, 2016   is as follows: 

At   October 30, 2016  , the Company had   unrecognized compensation   expense of $  2  .  2   million related to the restricted stock awards, which is expected to be recognized ove  r a weighted average period of   2  .  0   years. 

7  .      PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT 

Property and equipment consist of the following: 

8  .      SEGMENT REPORTING 

The Company has   two     operating   segments, which are also its reportable segments: direct and retail. The   direct segment include  s   net sales   from the Company s website and catalogs. The   retail segment include  s   net sales   from the Company s retail and outlet stores. These two operating segments are components of the Company for which separate financial information is  

12   

Table of Contents   

DULUTH HOLDINGS INC.   Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 

available and for which operating results are evaluated on a regular basis by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance of the segments.  

Interest expense, income tax expense,   and   corporate expenses, which include but are not limited to: human resources, legal, finance, information technol  ogy, design and other corporate-  related expenses are included in the Company s direct segment. Depreciation and amortization, and property and equipment expenditures  ,    a  re recognized in each   segment.   Advertising expenses are generally included in the Company s direct segment, except for specific store advertising, which is included in the Company s retail segment. 

Variable allocations of assets are not made for segment reporting. The Company does not have any assets outside of the United States. Sales outside of the United States were insignificant. 

Segment information is presented in the following tables: 

Segment total assets 

9  .      INCOME TAXES 

Prior to November 25, 2015, the Company was taxed as an  S  corp  oration for federal income tax   purposes under Section 1362 of the Code, and therefore was not subject to federal and state income taxes. On November 25, 2015, the Company s  S  corporation status terminated, and the Company became   subject to corporate-level federal and state income tax  es at prevailing corporate tax rates  . 

The provision   for income taxes for the interim period is based on an estimate of the annual effective tax rate adjusted to reflect the impact of   discrete items. Management judgment is required in projecting ordinary income to estimate the Company s annual effective tax r  ate. The effective tax rate   related to controlling interest   for   the three   and nine   months ended   October 30, 2016  , was     39.8  %   and   39.0%  , respectively  . The income from SRV was excluded from the   calculation of the   Company   s effective tax rate, as SRV   is an  S  corporation and not subject to income taxes.

10  .      RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 

Revenue from Contracts with Customers 

In May 2014, the   Financial Accounting Standards Board (   FASB   )   issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)     ( ASU 2014-09 ), which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC Topic 605,   Revenue Recognition  .    ASU 2014-09 requires revenue recognition to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The new revenue recognition model requires identifying the contract, identifying the performance obligations, determining the transaction price, allocating the transaction price to performance obligations and recognizing the revenue upon satisfaction of t  he performance obligations.   ASU 2014-09 also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and change in judgments, and assets recognized from costs incurred to ob  tain or fulfill a contract.   ASU 2014-09 can be applied either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the update recognized at the date of the initial application along with additional disclosures. On July 9, 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09 for one year. ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual   and interim   reporting periods begin  ning after December 15, 2017  . Accordingly, the Company will adopt ASU 2014-09 on January 29, 2018, the first day of the Company s first quarter for the fiscal year ending February 3, 2019, the Company s fiscal year 2018. The Company has not selected a method for adoption nor determined the potential effects on the Company s consolidated financial statements  .   

Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory 

In July 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-11, Simplifying the Measurem  ent of Inventory (Topic 330)   ( ASU 2015-11 ), which changes the measurement principle for inventory from the lower of cost or market to the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is defined as the  estimated selling prices in the ordinary   course   of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transporta  tion.    ASU 2015-11 eliminates the guidance that entities consider replacement cost or net realizable value less an approximately normal profit margin in the subsequent measurement of inventory when cost is determined on a first-in, first-out or average cost basis. The provisions of ASU 2015-11 are effective for public entities with fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. Accordingly, the Company will adopt ASU 2015-11 on January 30, 2017, the first day of the Company s first quarter for the fiscal year ending January 28, 2018, the Company s fiscal year 2017. The Company   does not expect the adoption of ASU 2015-11 to have a significant impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements  . 

Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes 

In November 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-17,   Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes   (Topic 740) ( ASU 2015-17 ), which requires the classification of all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent on the balance sheet instead of separating deferred taxes into current and noncurrent amounts. In addition, an allocation of valuation allowances between current and noncurrent deferred tax assets is not required, because the allowances will be classified as noncurrent. The provisions of ASU 2015-17 are effective for public entities with fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The Company has adopted ASU 2015-17 as of January 31, 2016 and has reported deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent on the   consolidated   balance sheet  s  .     

Leases 

In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02,   Leases   (Topic 842) ( ASU 2016-02 ), which requires lessees to recognize most leases on the balance sheets, but recognize expenses on the income statements in a manner which is similar to the current lease standard. The provisions of ASU 2016-02 are effective for public entities with fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted. Accordingly, the Company will adopt ASU 2016-02 on February 4, 2019, the first day of the Company s first quarter for the fiscal year ending February 2, 2020, the Company s fiscal year 2019. The Company has not determined the impact of this new accounting guidance on the Company s consolidated financial statements.    

Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting 

In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09,   Compensation   Stock Compensation   (Topic 718):   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting   ( ASU 2016-09 ), which is intended to improve the accounting for share-based payment transac  tions. ASU 2016-09 changes certain   aspects of the accounting for share-based

Overview 

We are a rapidly growing lifestyle brand of men s and women s casual wear, workwear and accessories sold exclusively through our own direct and retail channels. The direct segment, consisting of our website and catalogs, offers products nationwide and repr  esented 87.6% of our fiscal 2015   net sales. In 2010, we added retail to our omni-channel platform with the opening of our first store. Since then, we   have   expanded our retail pres  ence, and as of   October 30, 2016  , we   operated 12   retail stores and two outlet stores. Net sales for the retail segment   represented 22.0  %   and 17.4  % of consolidated n  et sales for the three   and nine     months ended     October 30, 2016     respectively, and 15.8% and 13.8  % of consolidated   net sales for the three and nine   months ended     November 1, 2015  , respectively  . 

We offer a comprehensive line of innovative, durable and functional product, such as our Longtail T      shirts, Buck Naked  TM   underwear, and Fire Hose      work pants, which reflect our position as the Modern, Self-Reliant American Lifestyle brand. Our brand has a heritage in workwear that transcends tradesmen and appeals to a broad demographic for everyday and on-the-job use.  

From our heritage as a catalog for those working in the building trades, Duluth Trading has become a widely recognized brand and proprietary line of innovative and functional apparel and gear. Over the last decade, we have created strong brand awareness, built a loyal customer base and generated robust sales momentum. We have done so by sticking to our roots of  there s gotta be a better way  and through our relentless focus on providing our customers with quality, functional products.  

A summary of our financial results is as follows:

Table of Contents   

While we have achieved 27 consecutive quarters of increased net sales year-over-year, third-quarter net sales fell sh  ort of our expectations   due to unseasonably warm weather and a highly promotional retail environment, which we experienced in the latter half of the third quarter and into the beginning of the fourth quarter;     

Net income in fiscal 2016 third   quarter decreased   by   69.4  % over the prior year third   quar  ter to $0.5   million   and net inc  ome in   the   fiscal 2016     nine months   decreased by 26.0  % over   the prior year     nine months   to $7.3   million  ;     Adjusted for income taxes, as if we   had been a  C  corporation at a   combined federal, state and local effective income tax rate of 40.0%,   net income in fiscal 2016   third   quarter decreased by   49  .0  % over the prior year third   quarter   pro forma net income   and net income in   the   fiscal 2016   nine months   increased 23.3  % over the   prior year nine months   pro forma net income  ;        

Adjusted EBITDA in fiscal   2016 third   quarter     de  creased   by   7.9  %   over the prior year third   quarter to   $2.5   million   and adjusted EBITDA in   the   fiscal   2016     nine months   increased by 18.8  % over the   prior year nine months   to $16.5   million  ;   and     

Our retail stores have achieved an average payback of less than two years.     

See  Reconciliation of Net Income to   EBITDA and EBITDA to   Adjusted EBITDA  section for a reconciliation of our net income   to EBITDA and EBITDA   to Adjusted EBITDA,   both of which are   non-U.S. GAAP financial measure  s  . See also the information under the heading  Adjusted EBITDA  in the section  How We Assess the Performance of Our Business  for our definition of Adjusted EBITDA. 

Our business is seasonal, and as a result, our net sales fluctuate from quarter to quarter, which often affects the comparability of our results between quarters. Net sales are historically higher in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year due to the holiday selling season. 

We are pursuing several strategies to continue our profitable growth, including building brand awareness to continue customer acquisition, accelerating retail expansion, selectively broadening assortments in certain men s product categories and growing our women s business. 

How We Assess the Performance of Our Business 

In assessing the performance of our business, we consider a variety of financial and operating measures that affect our operating results. 

Net Sales 

Net sales reflect our sale of merchandise plus shipping and handling revenue collected from our customers, less returns and discounts. Direct sales are recognized upon customer receipt of the product, while retail sales are recognized at the point of sale. 

Comparable Store Sales 

Comparable store sales are generally calculated based upon retail stores that were open at least twelve full fiscal months as of the end of the reporting period. Our outlet stores are not included in the comparable store sales calculations.  

Comparable store sales allow us to evaluate how our retail store base   is per  forming by measuring the change   in period over-period net sales in stores that have been open for twelve fis  cal months or more. Some of our   competitors and other retailers calculate comparable store sales different  ly than we do; as a result, our   comparable store sales may not be comparable to similar data made available by   other companies. W  e have excluded c  omparable store sales data from this Form 10-Q   due to the limited number of comparab  le   retail stores as of   October 30, 2016  . Although   retail store   expansion is part of our growth strategy,   we expect a majority   percentage of   our net sales to come from our   direct segment for the foreseeable future. 

Gross Profit 

Gross profit is equal to our net sales   less cost of goods sold. Gross profit as a   percentage of our net sales is   referred to as gross margin. Cost of goods sold includes the direct cost of p  urchased merchandise; inventory   shrinkage; inventory adjustments due to obsolescence, including excess and slo  w-moving inventory and lower of   cost or market reserves; inbound freight; and freight from our distribution ce  nters to our retail stores. The   primary drivers of the costs of individual goods are raw material costs. We expect   gross profit to increase to the   extent that we successfully grow our net sales. Given the size of our direct segment   sales relative to our total net   sales, shipping and handling revenue has had a significant impact on our gross   profit and gross profit margin.   Historically, this revenue has partially offset shipping and handling expense included in selling, general and     administrative expenses. Declines in shipping and handling revenues may have a   material adverse effect on our   gross profit

Table of Contents   

and gross profit margin, as well as Adjusted EBITDA to the ex  tent there are not commensurate   declines, or if there are increases, in our shipping and handling expense. Our gro  ss profit may not be comparable   to other retailers, as we do not include distribution network and store occupanc  y expenses in calculating gross   profit, but instead we include them in selling, general and administrative expenses. 

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 

Selling  , general and administrative expenses include all operating costs not   included in cost of goods sold.   These expenses include all payroll and payroll-related expenses and occupancy exp  enses related to our stores and   to our operations at our headquarters, including utilities, depreciation and   amortization. They also include   marketing expense, which primarily includes television advertising, catalo  g production, mailing and print   advertising costs, as well as all logistics costs associated with shipping product to our customers, consulting and     software expenses and professional services fees. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of     net sales is usually higher in lower-volume quarters and lower in higher-volume qu  arters because a portion of the   costs are relatively fixed  .   

Our historical sales growth has been accompanied by increased selling, gener  al and administrative expenses.   The most significant components of these increases are advertising, market  ing and payroll costs. While we   expect these expenses to increase as we continue to open new stores, increa  se brand awareness and grow our   organization to support our growing business, we believe these expenses will de  crease as a percentage of sales   over time. 

Adjusted EBITDA 

We believe Adjusted EBITDA is a useful measure of operating performance, as it provides a clearer picture of operating results by excluding the effects of financing and investing activities by eliminating the effects of interest and depreciation costs and eliminating expenses that are not reflective of underlying business performance. We use Adjusted EBITDA to facilitate a comparison of our operating performance on a consistent basis from period-to-period and to provide for a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business.  

We define Adjusted EBITDA as consolidated net income (loss) before depreciation and amortization, interest expense and provision for income taxes adjusted for the impact of certain items, including non-cash and other items we do not consider representative of our ongoing operating performance.   We believe   Adjusted EBITDA is less susceptible to variances in actual performance resulting from depreciation, amortization and other items.

The unaudited pro forma net in  come information for the three   and nine months ended November 1  , 2015,   gives effect to an adjustment for income tax expense on the income attributable to controlling interest as if we had been a  C  corporation at an assumed combined federal, state and local effective income tax rate, which approximates our statutory income tax rate, of 40.0%. No pro forma income tax expense was calculated on the income attributable to noncontrolling i  nterest because this entity did   not convert to a  C  corporation.

visits increased   16.7  % in the thr  ee months ended October 30  , 2016   compared to t  he t  hree months ended November 1  , 2015  . The increase   in retail net sales was primarily at  tributable to the opening of   five   new retail stores   during   the second and third   quarter  s   of fiscal 2016  ,   along with the opening of a retail store and outlet store in the prior year third and fourth quarters  .    

Gross Profit 

Gross profit increased $7.1 million, or 22.6%, to $38.7   million in the   thr  ee months ended October 30, 2016 compared to $31.6   million in    t  he three months ended November 1  , 2015  . As a percen  tage of net s  ales, gross margin   increased 6  0   basis points to 57.8  % of net sales in the thr  ee months end  ed October 30  , 2016  ,   compared to   57.2  % of net sales in the three m  onths e  nded November 1  , 2015  . Th  e increase in gross profit   was primarily driven by an increase in net sales   as discussed above. The increase in gross margin   rate   occurred in   our direct and retail segments,   and was primarily attributable to     improved initial product costs due to increased volume,   coupled with   a    product mix   shift to higher margin products  . 

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 

Selling, general and administrative expenses   increased $8.  0 million, or 26.6%, to $37.9   million in   th  e three months ended October 30  , 2016  ,   compared to $30.0   million in the   three months   ended November 1  , 2015  .    Selling, general and administrative expenses as a   percentage of net sales   in  c  reased 240   basis points to   56.6  % in the three months ended October 30, 2016, compared to 54.2  % in the thr  ee months ended November 1  , 2015.   The increase in selling, general a  nd   administrative expenses was    a  tt  ributable to an increase of $1  .  7   million in adver  tising and marketing costs,   $4.6   million in general and   administrative expenses and $1.7   million in selling expenses.    

As   a percentage of net sales, advertising and marketing   costs decreased   15  0 basis points to   21.8  % in the three mo  nths ended October 30  , 2016, compared to   23.3  % in the   three   months ended November 1  , 2015  .    The 15  0 basis point de  crease in advertising and marketing costs as a percentage of net sales, was primarily driven by   a de  crease   in television advertising   primarily attributable   to the timing of   our women s advertising campaign  ,   coupled with   a    decrease   in catalog costs   primarily   due to our planned   decrease in catalog spend as a percentage of net sales  ,    which was   partially offset by an increase in on-line advertising  . 

The $4.6   million increase in general and administrative expenses w  as   primarily due t  o     $1.2   million increase in personnel expenses, $1.7   million increase in   rent expense and related store opening costs  ,    and $0.8 million increase in consulting   expenses.   The $1.2   million increase in personne  l ex  penses was primarily due to new headcount required to support the   growth of our business  .    The $1.7   million increase in rent expense and related store opening   costs was   primaril  y att  r  ibutable to an increase of six     retail stores   during the three   months ended October 30  , 2016, compare  d to November 1  , 2015  .   As a percentage of net sales, general and    a  dmi  nistrative expenses increased 410 basis points to 19.7  % in   the t  hree months ended October 30, 2016, compared to 15.6  % in   the three months ended November 1  , 2015  .    The   480   basis point increase was   primarily   a  ttributable to an increase of 22  0   basis   points in rent expense and related store opening costs  ,    an increase of   70   bas  is points in personnel expenses   and an increase of 70 basis points in consulting expense  s   due to the factors discussed above. 

The $1.7   million increase in sellin  g expenses was primarily due to     $0.9   million   increase   in personnel  ,   primarily due   to the growth in retail  , coupled with $0.3 million increase in distribution costs as a result of increased net sales  . As a percentage o  f net sales, selling expenses de  creased   10 basis points to 15.2  %    i  n the three months ended October 30, 2016, compared to 15.3  %   in   the three months ended November 1  , 2015, primarily due   to an increase of 80 basis points in customer service due to growth in r  etail, offset by a decrease of 6  0 basis points in shipping expenses due to favorable shipping rates and   a decrease of   4  0 basis points in   distribution costs due to the   efficient utilization   of our   expanded   Belleville distribution center versus the two third party logistics providers ( 3PLs ) in the three months ended October 30, 2016  ,   compared to the three months ended November 1, 2015  . 

Interest Expense 

Interest expense was $0.  03   million   in the three months ended October 30, 2016, compared to $0.1   million in th  e three months ended   November 1  , 2015  .   

Provision for Income Taxes  

Income tax expense was $0.3   million in the three months ended   October 30  , 2016 and o  ur effective tax   rate   related to controlling interest   was 39.8  %.   Prior to November 25, 2015, we had been classified as an  S  corporation for federal and state income tax purposes and therefore, we had not been subject to income taxes. Prior to that date, our shareholders had been subject to   income tax on their distributable   share of our earnings. In connection with our IPO, we converted to a  C  corporation. On a pro f  orma basis, if we had been taxed   as a  C  corporation at an estimated 40% effective tax rate, income taxes would have   decreased $0.3 million, or 49.5  %, to $0.3   million in the three months ended October 30, 2016 from   $0.6   million in     the three months ended November 1  ,    2015.

Net sales increase  d $37.7   million,   or 23.  0%, to $201  .5   million   in the   nine months ended October 30  , 2016   compared to   $163.8 million in the nine months ended November 1  ,    2015, driven by gains in   both direct and retail segments of   $25.2 million, or 17.8%, and $12.5 million, or 55.4  %, respectively, with gains achieved across virtually all product categories. The direct net sales gains were due to customers continuing to respond positively to our marketing efforts, which resulted in greater e-commerce traffic to our website and sales through our call center. Our website visits   increased 16.9  % in   the nine months ended October 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended November 1  , 2015. The increase in retail net sales was primarily attributable to the   same factors discussed above fo  r the three months ended October   30  , 2016 compared   to   the three months ended November 1  , 2015  .

Th  e increase in gross profit   was primarily driven by an increase in net sales as discussed above. The increase in gross margin rate   was primarily due to the factors discussed above for the   three months ended October 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended November 1, 2015.

Selling, general and administrative expenses   increased $20.6 million, or 24.4%, to $105.2   million in the nine months ended October 30, 2016  ,   compared to $84.6 million in the nine   months   ended November 1  , 2015. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net   sales   increased 6  0   basis points to   52.2  %   in the nine months ended October 30, 2016, compared to 51.6% in the nine months ended November 1  , 2015. The increase in selling, general an  d    administrative expenses   of $20.6   million was att  ributable to an increase   of $6.5   million in advertising and marketing costs  , $8.6   million in general and   administrative expenses and $5.5   million in selling expenses.  

As a percentage of net sales, advertising and   marketing costs decreased 100 basis points to 21.6% in the nine months ended October 30, 2016, compared to 22.6% in the nine months ended November 1, 2015. The 100   basis point   decline in advertising and marketing costs were     primarily attributable to the same factors discussed above for the three months ended October 30, 2016, compared to the three months ended November 1, 2015. 

The $8.6   million increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to   $2.9   million increase in rent expense and r  elated store opening costs, $1.5   million increase in   personnel expenses, $1.8 million increase in   consultin  g    expenses, and   $1  .  2   million in  crease   in depreciation expense  .   The increase  s   in rent expense   a  nd related store opening costs,   personnel expenses   and depreciation expense,   were   primarily attributable to the   factors   discussed above for the three months ended October 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended N  ovember 1, 2015.   As a percentage of net sales, general and adm  inistrat  ive expenses increased 15  0 basis points to 16.6  % in the nine months ended October 30  , 2016, compared to 15.1  % in the nine months ended November 1  , 2015.   The     nine months ended November 1  , 2015   included a $1.1 million payment related to a portion of the grantees  tax liabilities associated with the grant of restricted stock awards. Excluding this $1.1 million payment, as a percentage of net sales, general and admi  nistrative expenses increased 2  2  0 basis points primarily due to the factors discussed above. 

The $5.5   million increase in selling expenses was prim  arily due to an increase of $1.4   million in shipping expenses due   to sales growth,     $1.6   million increase in distribution costs due   increased sales and   the use of   two 3PLs, coupled with a $1.6   million increase in customer service primarily attributable to the growth in retail  . As a percentage of net sale  s, selling expenses increased 10 basis points to 14.0% in the nine months ended October 30  , 2016, compared to 13.  9% in the nine months ended November 1  , 2015, primarily due to a  n increase in   customer service and   distribu  tion costs of 3  0 and 20 basis points

respectively  ,   as discussed above,   which was partially offset by   a    decrease   of 40 basis points   in shipping expenses due to favorable shipping rates as result of being closer to   our customers due to our use of the   3PLs.    

Interest Expense 

Interest expense was $0.1 million in the nine   months en  ded October 30, 2016, compared to $0.2 million in the nine months ended November 1  , 2015.  

Provision for Income Taxes  

Income tax e  xpense was $4.  7   million in the nine months ended October 30  , 2016 and   our effective tax rate   related to controlling interest   was 39.0  %. Prior to November 25, 2015, we had been classified as an  S  corporation for federal and state income tax purposes and therefore, we had not been subject to income taxes. Prior to that date, our shareholders had been subject to income tax on their distributable share of our earnings. In connection with our IPO, we converted to a  C  corporation. On a pro forma basis, if we   had been taxed as a  C  corporation at an estimated 40% effective tax rate, income   ta  xes would have increased by $0.7 million, or 23.3%, to $4.7     million   in   the nine months ended October 30  , 2016 from $4.0 million in the nine months ended November 1  , 2015. 

Net Income 

Net income   decreased $2.6 million, or 26.0  %  ,   to $7.  3   million in the nine months ended October 30, 2016  ,   compared to $9.9   mill  ion in the nine months ended November 1  , 2015, primarily due to the factors discussed above. Applying a pro forma 40%  C  corporation   effective tax rate to the nine months ended November 1  , 2015, rather than the  S  corporation tax rate that actually applied to us, net income increased $1.  4 million, or 23.3%, to $7.3   million in the nine months ended October 30, 2016 from $5.9 million in the nine months ended November 1  , 2015. 

Reconciliation of Net Income to   EBITDA and EBITDA to   Adjusted EBITDA 

The following table   presents reconciliations of net income to EBITDA and EBITDA to Adjusted EBITDA,   both of which are   non-  G  AAP financial measure  s  , for the periods indicated below. See the above section titled  How We Assess the Performance of Our Business,  for our definition of Adjusted EBITDA. 

As a result of the factors discussed above in the  Results of Operations    section,   A  djusted EBITDA   de  creased   $0  .  2 million, or 7.9%, to $2.5   million in the thr  ee months ended   October 30, 2016   compared to $2.7   million in t  he three months ended   November 1, 2015  . As a percentage of net sales,   A  djusted EBITDA   decreased 110 basis points to 3.7  % of net sales in the thr  ee months ended   October 30, 2016   compared to 4.8  % of net sales in the thr  ee months ended   November 1, 2015  .    

As a result of the factors discussed above in the  Results of Operations  section  ,    A  djusted EBITDA   increased $2.6 million, or 18.8%, to $16.5   million in the   nine   months ende  d October 30  , 2016 compared to $13.9   milli  on in the nine months ended November 1  , 2015. As a percentage of net sales,   A  dju  sted EBITDA decreased 3  0 basis poi  nts to 8.2  % of net sales in the nine months ended October 30  , 2016   compared to   8.5% of net sales in the nine   months ended   November 1  , 2015  .

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

General 

Our business relies on cash from operating activities as well as cash on hand and a $40 million revolving line of credit as our primary sources of liquidity. Our primary cash needs have been for inventory,   marketing and advertising,   payroll, store leases, capital expenditures associated with opening new stores, infrastructure and information technol  ogy  . The most significant components of our working capital are cash, inventory, accounts payable and other current liabilities.  

We expect to spend   approximatel  y $25.0 million to $26  .0 million in fiscal 2016   on capi  tal expe  nditures, including a   total of approximately $13  .0 million to $1  4  .0 million for new retail store expansion. We expect it will take approximately $2.0 million to $2.6 million in capital expenditures and startin  g inventory to open a new store. At     October 30, 2016  , our   net   working capital was $  69.5   million,     including $0.2 million   of cash  . Due to the seasonality of our business, a significant amount of cash from operating activities is generated during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. During the first three quarters of our fiscal year, we typically are net users of cash in our operating activities as we acquire inventory in anticipation of our peak selling season, which occurs in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. We also use cash in our investing activities for capital expenditures throughout all four quarters of our fiscal year.  

We believe that   our   cash   balance as of   October 30, 2016  , combined with cash   flow from operating activities   and   the availability of cash under our revolving line of credit will be sufficient to cover working capital requirements and anticipated capital expenditures and for funding our growth strategy for the foreseeable future.  

Cash Flow Analysis 

A summary of operating, investing and financing activities is shown in the following table. 

Net Cash Used in Operating Activities 

Operating activities consist primarily of net income adjusted for non-cash items that include depreciation and amortization, loss on disposal of property, equipment and other assets, stock-based compensation and the effect of changes in assets and   liabilities. 

While our cash flow  s   from operations for the nine months ended October 30, 2016 is negative, primarily driven by the seasonal nature of our business, we expect cash flow  s   from operations for the full year fiscal 2016 to be positive from normal operating performance and seasonal reductions in working capital during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year, which is consistent with previous full fiscal years. 

For the nine months ended October 30  , 2016  , net cash used in operating activities was $26.8   million, which   primarily   consisted of net income of $7.  5   million, non-cash depre  ciation and   amortization of $3.2   million and   stock based compensation of $1.0   million, offset by cash used in operating   assets and liabilities of $38.6   million. The cash used in operatin  g   assets and liabilities of $38.6   mil  lion primarily co  nsisted of     $4  0.9   million   increase in i  nventory  ,    due to building up of inventory   for   our peak   season, coupled with the increase in   retail stores   during   fiscal 2016,   and   $3.0   million increase in other receivables p  rimarily due to refunds   for excess income tax payments,   which was partially offset by a $6.7 million increase in trade accounts payable, primarily due to seasonality and timing of payments. 

For the nine months ended November 1, 2015, net cash used in operating activities was $17.3 million,   which consisted of net income of $10.0 million, non-cash depreciation and amortization of $2.0 million and stock based compensation of $0.5 million, offset by cash used in operating assets and liabilities of $29.8 million. The cash used in operating assets and liabilities of $29.8 million primarily consisted of $31.2 million and $1.2 million increases in inventory and prepaid expenses, respectively, and a decrease of $1.9 million in accrued expenses and deferred rent obligations, which was partially offset by a $4.9 million increase in trade accounts payable. The increases in inventory and trade accounts payable were primarily due to seasonality and growth of our business coupled with timing of payments.

Net Cash Used in Investing Activities 

Investing activities consist primarily of capital expenditures for growth related to new store openings, information technology and enhancements for our distribution and corporate facilities  , coupled with changes in restricted cash,   which is   related to our retail store leasing agreements  .   

For the nine months ended October 30  , 2016  , net cash used in inves  ting activities was $22.5   million and was primarily driven by capital expenditures   of $21.0   million   for the   expansion of our Belleville distribution cente  r,   the opening of five     new retail stores  , and information technology  . 

For the nine months ended November 1, 2015, net cash used in investing activities was $6.6 million and was primarily driven by capital expenditures for the opening of two new stores and the implementation of a new warehouse management system. 

Net Cash Provided by   Financing Activities 

Financing activities consist primarily of borrowings and payments related to our revolving line of credit and other long-term debts, as well as distributions to   the individuals and entities that were   our   shareholders   prior to our IPO   and holders of noncontrolling intere  st in variable interest entity   and capital con  tributions to   Schlecht Retail Ventures LLC. 

For the nine   months   ended October 30  ,    2016, net cash provided by financing activities was $11.6    m  illion, primarily consisting of   proceeds of $13.2 million, net from our revolving line of credit  , $2.1 million in change in bank overdraft  ,   and $0.7 million for capital contributions to SRV, offset by uses of $4.2 million for payments on long-term debt. 

For the nine months ended November 1, 2015, net cash provided by financing activities was $16.2 million, primarily consisting of proceeds of $29.7 million, net from our revolving line of credit, $0.8 million from long-term debt and $0.3 million for capital contributio  ns to variable interest entity  , offset by uses of $13.7 million in tax distributions to our shareholders due to our  S  corporation status, $0.5 million for payments on long-term debt, $0.3 million for payments on capital leases and $0.3 million in distributions to holders of noncontrolling intere  st in variable interest entity  . 

Line of Credit 

On October 7, 2016, we amended and restated our   existing Amended and Restated Loan Agreement dated as of June 13, 2011, as amended (the  Amended and Restated Agreement ). The Amended and Restated Agreement provides for bo  rrowing availability of up to $  40.0   million from October 7, 2016 through July 31, 2017, up to $  50.0   million from Augus  t 1, 2017 through July 31, 2018   and up to $  60.0   million from August 1, 2018 through July 31, 2019. The Amended and Restated Agreement matures on   July 31, 2019  , and bears interest, payable monthly, a  t a rate equal to the   adjusted LIBOR rate  , as defined in the Amended and Rested Agreement   (effective   rate of 1.8% at October   30, 2016). The Amended and Restated Agreement is secured by essentially all Company   assets and requires that we   maintain compliance with certain financial and non-financial covenants, including minimum tangible net worth and a minimum trailing twelve month EBITDA. In addition, the Amended and Restated Agreement does   not   contain borrowing base limits.     As of October 30, 2016 and for the nine months then en  ded, we were   in compliance with all financial and non-financial covenant  s, and we expect to be in compliance with all financial and non-financial covenants for the remainder of fiscal 2016.  

Contractual Obligations  

There have been no significant   changes to our contractual obligations   as described in   our   Annual Report on Form 10-K for the   fiscal   year ended January 31, 2016. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We are not a party to any off-balance sheet arrangements, except for operating leases  . 

Critical Accounting Policies and Critical Accounting Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with   U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, as well as the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities   at the date of the financial statements  . We evaluate our accounting policies, estimates, and judgments on an on-going basis. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors that  

24   

Table of Contents   

are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions and such differences could be material to the consolidated financial   statements  . 

As of the date of this filing,   there   were no   significant changes to any of the critical accounting policies and estimates   described in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the   fiscal   year ended January 31, 2016  . 

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 

Revenue from Contracts with Customers 

In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)   ( ASU 2014-09 ), which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in ASC Topic 605,   Revenue Recognition  . ASU 2014-09 requires revenue recognition to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The new revenue recognition model requires identifying the contract, identifying the performance obligations, determining the transaction price, allocating the transaction price to performance obligations and recognizing the revenue upon satisfaction of the performance obligations. ASU 2014-09 also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and change in judgments, and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. ASU 2014-09 can be applied either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the update recognized at the date of the initial application along with additional disclosures. On July 9, 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09 for one year. ASU 2014-09 is effective for annual   and interim   reporting periods begin  ning after December 15, 2017  . Accordingly, we will adopt ASU 2014-09 on January 29, 2018, the first day of our first quarter for the fiscal year ending February 3, 2019, our fiscal year 2018. We have not selected a method for adoption nor determined the potential effects on our consolidated financial statements  .   

Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory 

In July 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-11,   Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory (Topic 330)   ( ASU 2015-11 ), which changes the measurement principle for inventory from the lower of cost or market to the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is defined as the  estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation.  ASU 2015-11 eliminates the guidance that entities consider replacement cost or net realizable value less an approximately normal profit margin in the subsequent measurement of inventory when cost is determined on a first-in, first-out or average cost basis. The provisions of ASU 2015-11 are effective for public entities with fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. Accordingly, we will adopt ASU 2015-11 on January 30, 2017, the first day of our first quarter for the fiscal year ending January 28, 2018, our fiscal year 2017.   We do not expect the adoption of ASU 2015-11 to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements  . 

Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes 

In November 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-17,   Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes (Topic 740)   ( ASU 2015-17 ), which requires the classification of all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent on the balance sheet instead of separating deferred taxes into current and noncurrent amounts. In addition, an allocation of valuation allowances between current and noncurrent deferred tax assets is not required, because the allowances will be classified as noncurrent. The provisions of ASU 2015-17 are effective for public entities with fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. We have adopted ASU 2015-17 as of January 31, 2016 and have reported deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent on the   consolidated   balance sheet  s  .

Leases 

In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02,   Leases   (Topic 842) ( ASU 2016-02 ), which requires lessees to recognize most leases on the balance sheets, but recognize expenses on the income statements in a manner which is similar to the current lease standard. The provisions of ASU 2016-02 are effective for public entities with fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted. Accordingly, we will adopt ASU 2016-02 on February 4, 2019, the first day of our first quarter for the fiscal year ending February 2, 2020, our fiscal year 2019. We have not determined the impact of this new accounting guidance on our consolidated financial statements.     

Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting 

In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09,   Compensation   Stock Compensation   (Topic 718):   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting   ( ASU 2016-09 ), which is intended to improve the accounting for share-based payment transac  tions. ASU 2016-09 changes certain   aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions, including: (1) accounting for income taxes; (2) classification of excess tax benefits on the statement of cash flows; (3) forfeitures; (4) minimum statutory tax withholding requirements;   and   (5) classification of employee taxes paid on   the statement of cash flows when an employer withholds shares for tax-withholding purposes  .    The provisions of ASU 2016-09 are effective for public entities with fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those year  s, early adoption is permitted. We have   adopted ASU 20  16-09 as of May 1, 2016 and   there was no significant impact to our consolidated financial statements  . 

Item 3.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

Interest Risk Factors 

We are subject to interest rate risk in connection with borrowings under our revolving line of credit, which bears interest at a rate equal to the   adjusted LIBOR rate, as defined in the Amended and Restated Agreement (effective rate of 1.8% at October 30, 2016)  . As of   October 30, 2016  ,    $13.2   million   was outstanding under the revolving   line of credit. As of   October 30, 2016  , the undrawn borrowing availability under the revolving line of credit     was   $26.8   million  . Based on the average interest rate on the revolving line     of credit during the first nine   months of fiscal 2016  , and to the extent that borrowings were outstanding, we do not believe that a 10% change in the interest rate would have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition.    

Impact of Inflation  

Our results of operations and financial condition are presented based on historical cost. While it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation due to the imprecise nature of the estimates required, we believe the effects of inflation, if any, on our results of operations and financial condition have been immaterial. We cannot assure you our business will not be affected in the future by inflation.  

Foreign Exchange Rate Risk  

We source a substantial majority of our merchandise from various suppliers in Asia and the vast majority of purchases are denominated in U.S. dollars. We do not hedge foreign currency risk using any derivative instruments, and historically we have not been impacted by changes in exchange rates.  

Item 4.    C  ontrols and Procedures 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  

Section 13a-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), requires management of an issuer subject to the Exchange Act to evaluate, with the participation of the issuer s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, the effectiveness of the issuer s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act), as of the end of each fiscal quarter. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  

There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(d) and 15d-15(d) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.  

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1.    Legal Proceedings 

From time to time, we are subject to certain legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business. We are not presently party to any legal proceedings the resolution of which we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results or cash flows. We establish reserves for specific legal matters when we determine that the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome is probable and the loss is reasonably estimable. 

Item 1A.   Risk Factors 

We operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks that   may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.   For a detailed discussion of the risks that affect our business, please refer to the section entitled  Risk Factors  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2016. There have been no material changes to our risk factors as previously disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Item 2.    Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 

On November 25, 2015, we closed our IPO, in which we registered and sold 7,666,667 shares of Class B common stock at a price of $12.00 per share. The aggregate offering price for shares sold in the offering was approximately $92.0 million. The offer and sale of all the shares in the IPO were registered under the Securities Act   of 1933, as amended   pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-207300), which was declared effective by the SEC on November 19, 2015. We raised approximately $83.9 million in net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of approximately $6.4 million and other offering expenses of approximately $1.7 million. 

Through   October 30, 2016  , the   total   net proceeds from our IPO have been applied as follows: $46.3 million to pay in full a short term note previously borrowed from a bank to pay a   portion of the distribution of 100% of the cumulative undistributed taxable earnings to our then existing shareholders from the date of our formation through the date of termination of our  S  corporation status,   $14.2 million for retail stores, $9.7   million for inf  rastructure and technology, $3.6 million for early debt payoff  s  ,    $0.3   mil  lion for our final  S  corporation distribution  , and $9.8 million for general corporate expenses.
