Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements 
  This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (the  Quarterly Report ) contains  forward-looking statements  within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  Securities Act ), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ). All statements, other than statements of historical fact included in this Quarterly Report, regarding our strategy, future operations, financial position, estimated revenues and income/losses, projected costs, prospects, plans and objectives of management are forward-looking statements. When used in this Quarterly Report, the words   could,   may,   assume,   forecast,   position,   predict,   strategy,   expect,   intend,   plan,   estimate,   anticipate,   believe,   project,   budget,   potential,  or  continue,  and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements contain such identifying words. These forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions about future events and are based on currently available information as to the outcome and timing of future events. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. You should also understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and should not consider the following list to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. When considering forward-looking statements, you should keep in mind the risk factors and other cautionary statements described under the heading  Item 1A. Risk Factors  included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   (the    2015   Annual Report ) and in this Quarterly Report on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ).  
  Forward-looking statements may include statements about: 
             
    successful integration and future performance of acquired assets and operations, including the assets and operations acquired in the Vantage Acquisition (defined herein); 
                
    our business strategy; 
                
    our reserves; 
                
    our financial strategy, liquidity and capital required for our development program; 
                
    realized natural gas, natural gas liquid ( NGL ) and oil prices; 
                
    timing and amount of future production of natural gas, NGLs and oil; 
                
    our hedging strategy and results; 
                
    our future drilling plans; 
                
    competition and government regulations; 
                
    pending legal or environmental matters; 
                
    our marketing of natural gas, NGLs and oil; 
                
    our leasehold or business acquisitions; 
                
    costs of developing our properties and conducting our gathering and other midstream operations; 
                
    operations of Rice Midstream Partners LP, including the integration of midstream assets acquired in the Vantage Acquisition; 
                
    monetization transactions, including asset sales to Rice Midstream Partners LP; 
                
    general economic conditions; 
                
    credit and capital markets; 
                
    uncertainty regarding our future operating results; and 
                
    plans, objectives, expectations and intentions contained in this Quarterly Report that are not historical. 
     We caution you that these forward-looking statements are subject to all of the risks and uncertainties, most of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control, incident to the exploration for and development, production, gathering and sale of natural gas, NGLs and oil. These risks include, but are not limited to: commodity price volatility; inflation; lack of availability of drilling and production equipment and services; environmental risks; drilling and other operating risks; regulatory changes; the uncertainty inherent in estimating natural gas reserves and in projecting future rates of production, cash flow and access to capital; the timing of development expenditures; risks relating to joint venture operations; and the other risks described under the heading  Item 1A. Risk Factors  in our   2015   Annual Report and in this Quarterly Report. 
  Reserve engineering is a process of estimating underground accumulations of natural gas, NGLs and oil that cannot be measured in an exact way. The accuracy of any reserve estimate depends on the quality of available data, the interpretation of such data and price and cost assumptions made by reserve engineers. In addition, the results of drilling, testing and production activities may justify revisions of estimates that were made previously. If significant, such revisions could change the schedule of any further production and development drilling. Accordingly, reserve estimates may differ significantly from the quantities of natural gas, and NGLs and oil that are ultimately recovered. 
  Should one or more of the risks or uncertainties described in this Quarterly Report occur, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, our actual results and plans could differ materially from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. 
  All forward-looking statements, expressed or implied, included in this Quarterly Report are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. This cautionary statement should also be considered in connection with any subsequent written or oral forward-looking statements that we or persons acting on our behalf may issue. 
  Except as otherwise required by applicable law, we disclaim any duty to update any forward-looking statements, all of which are expressly qualified by the statements in this section, to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Quarterly Report.

    Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation  
     The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of Rice Energy Inc. (the  Company ) have been prepared by the Company s management in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and applicable rules and regulations promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ). Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for annual financial statements. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included herein contain all adjustments which are, in the opinion of management, necessary to present fairly the Company s financial position as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   and its condensed consolidated statements of operations for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   and of cash flows for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
  The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the financial results of the Company, its wholly-owned subsidiaries and certain variable interest entities in which the Company is the primary beneficiary. See Note 11 for additional discussion of variable interest entities. 
  These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes therein for the year ended December 31,   2015  , as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) by the Company in its Annual Report on Form 10-K (the    2015   Annual Report ). Certain prior period financial statement amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  
   
           2.  
    Accounts Receivable 
     Accounts receivable are primarily from the Company s joint interest partners and natural gas marketers. The Company extends credit to parties in the normal course of business based upon management s assessment of their creditworthiness. A valuation allowance is provided for those accounts for which collection is estimated as doubtful; uncollectible accounts are written off and charged against the allowance. In estimating the allowance, management considers, among other things, how recently and how frequently payments have been received and the financial position of the party. There was no allowance recorded for any of the periods presented in the condensed consolidated financial statements. Accounts receivable as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   are detailed below.

    Long-Term Debt  
     Long-term debt consists of the following as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  :    

  Senior Notes 
  6.25%   Senior Notes Due   2022   (a) 
  On   April 25, 2014  , the Company issued   $900.0 million   in aggregate principal amount of   6.25%   senior notes due   2022   (the  2022 Notes ) in a private placement to eligible purchasers under Rule 144A and Regulation S of the Securities Act, which resulted in net proceeds of   $882.7 million  , after deducting expenses and the initial purchasers  discounts of approximately   $17.3 million  .  
  The   2022   Notes will mature on   May 1, 2022  , and interest is payable on the   2022   Notes on each   May 1   and   November 1  . At any time prior to   May 1, 2017  , the Company may redeem up to   35%   of the 2022 Notes at a redemption price of   106.25%   of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date, with the proceeds of certain equity offerings, so long as the redemption occurs within   180   days of completing such equity offering and at least   65%   of the aggregate principal amount of the   2022   Notes remains outstanding after such redemption. Prior to   May 1, 2017  , the Company may redeem some or all of the notes for cash at a redemption price equal to   100%   of their principal amount plus an applicable make-whole premium and accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined in the indenture governing the   2022   Notes), unless the Company has given notice to redeem the   2022   Notes, the holders of the   2022   Notes will have the right to require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of the 2022 Notes at a price equal to   101%   of the aggregate principal amount of the   2022   Notes, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase. On or after   May 1, 2017  , the Company may redeem some or all of the   2022   Notes at redemption prices (expressed as percentages of principal amount) equal to   104.688%   for the twelve-month period beginning on May 1, 2017,   103.125%   for the twelve-month period beginning May 1, 2018,   101.563%   for the twelve-month period beginning on May 1, 2019 and   100.000%   beginning on May 1, 2020, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. 
  7.25%   Senior Notes Due   2023   (b) 
  On   March 26, 2015  , the Company issued   $400.0 million   in aggregate principal amount of   7.25%   senior notes due   2023   (the    2023   Notes ) in a private placement to eligible purchasers under Rule 144A and Regulation S of the Securities Act, which resulted in net proceeds of   $389.3 million  , after deducting expenses and the initial purchasers  discounts of approximately   $10.7 million  . The original issuance discount of   $3.1 million   related to the   2023   Notes is recorded as a reduction of the principal amount. 
  The   2023   Notes will mature on   May 1, 2023  , and interest is payable on the   2023   Notes on each   May 1   and   November 1  , commencing on   November 1, 2015  . At any time prior to   May 1, 2018  , the Company may redeem up to   35%   of the 2023 Notes at a redemption price of   107.250%   of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date, with the proceeds of certain equity offerings so long as the redemption occurs within   180   days of completing such equity offering and at least   65%   of the aggregate principal amount of the   2023   Notes remains outstanding after such redemption. Prior to   May 1, 2018  , the Company may redeem some or all of the notes for cash at a redemption price equal to   100%   of their principal amount plus an applicable make-whole premium and accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined in the indenture governing the   2023   Notes), unless the Company has given notice to redeem the   2023   Notes, the holders of the   2023   Notes will have the right to require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of the   2023   Notes at a price equal to   101%   of the aggregate principal amount of the   2023   Notes, plus any accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase. On or after   May 1, 2018  , the Company may redeem some or all of the   2023   Notes at redemption prices (expressed as percentages of principal amount) equal to   105.438%   for the twelve-month period beginning on May 1, 2017,   103.625%   for the twelve-month  
  
   13 

period beginning May 1, 2019,   101.813%   for the twelve-month period beginning on May 1, 2020 and   100.000%   beginning on May 1, 2021, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. 
  The   2022   Notes and the   2023   Notes (collectively, the  Notes ) are the Company s senior unsecured obligations, rank equally in right of payment with all of the Company s existing and future senior debt, and will rank senior in right of payment to all of the Company s future subordinated debt. The Notes will be effectively subordinated to all of the Company s existing and future secured debt to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness. The Notes are jointly and severally, fully and unconditionally, guaranteed by the Company s Guarantors.  
  Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility (c) 
  In April 2013, the Company entered into a Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility (the  Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility ) with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and a syndicate of lenders. In April 2014, the Company, as borrower, and Rice Drilling B LLC ( Rice Drilling B ), as predecessor borrower, amended and restated the credit agreement governing the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility (the  Amended Credit Agreement ) to, among other things, assign all of the rights and obligations of Rice Drilling B as borrower under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility to the Company. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the borrowing base was   $875.0 million   (with a   $750.0 million   lender commitment amount) and the sublimit for letters of credit was   $250.0 million  . The Company had   zero   borrowings outstanding and   $220.4 million   in letters of credit outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement as of   September 30, 2016  , resulting in availability of   $529.6 million  . As of September 30, 2016, the maturity date of the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility was January 29, 2019.  
  In connection with the closing of the Vantage Acquisition, on October 19, 2016, the Company entered into a Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the  Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement ) effective upon the closing of the Vantage Acquisition to, among other things, (i) permit the completion of the Vantage Acquisition, (ii) extend the maturity date of the credit facility from January 29, 2019 to October 19, 2021, (iii) increase the borrowing base from   $875.0 million   to   $1.0 billion   without giving effect to the oil and gas properties acquired pursuant to the Vantage Acquisition, (iv) add the Company as a guarantor, (v) increase the minimum required mortgage percentage (as it applies to proved reserves) to be   85%   of proved reserves, (vi) amend the restricted payments covenant to permit certain distributions by Rice Energy Operating to its members, (vii) replace the interest coverage ratio with a consolidated total leverage ratio or consolidated net leverage ratio, as applicable, to commence with the last day of the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2016 and (viii) adjust the interest rate payable on amounts borrowed thereunder (as described below). 
  Following the effectiveness of the Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, Eurodollar loans under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus an applicable margin ranging from   225   to   325   basis points, depending on the percentage of borrowing base utilized, and base rate loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the greatest of (i) the agent bank s reference rate, (ii) the federal funds effective rate plus   50   basis points and (iii) the rate for one month Eurodollar loans plus   100   basis points, plus an applicable margin ranging from   125   to   225   basis points, depending on the percentage of borrowing base utilized.  
  The Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility also contains certain financial covenants and customary events of default. If an event of default occurs and is continuing, the lenders may declare all amounts outstanding under the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility to be immediately due and payable.

    Derivative Instruments 
     The Company uses derivative commodity instruments that are placed with major financial institutions whose creditworthiness is regularly monitored. Substantially all of the Company s derivative counterparties share in the Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility collateral. The Company has entered into various derivative contracts to manage price risk and to achieve more predictable cash flows. As a result of the Company s hedging activities, the Company may realize prices that are greater or less than the market prices that it would have received otherwise.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company has entered into derivative instruments with various financial institutions, fixing the price it receives for a portion of its future sales of produced natural gas. The Company s fixed price derivatives primarily include swap and collar contracts that are tied to the commodity prices on NYMEX. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company has entered into NYMEX hedging contracts through   December 31, 2020  , hedging a total of approximately   964   Bcf of its projected natural gas production at a weighted average price of   $3.06   per MMBtu. Additionally, the Company has entered into basis swap contracts to hedge the difference between the NYMEX index price and various local index prices. The fixed price and basis hedging contracts the Company has entered into through   December 31, 2020   at other various sales points cover a total of approximately   687   Bcf. 
    
  The Company recognizes all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value per FASB ASC 815.   The Company s derivative commodity instruments have not been designated as hedges for accounting purposes; therefore, all gains and losses are recognized currently in earnings. The following tables present the gross amounts of recognized derivative assets and liabilities, the amounts offset under netting arrangements with counterparties, and the resulting net amounts presented in the consolidated balance sheets for the periods presented, all at fair value: 

5. 
    Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
     The Company determines the fair value of its financial instruments, which are comprised primarily of derivative instruments, on a recurring basis as these instruments are required to be recorded at fair value for each reporting amount. Certain amounts in the Company s financial statements were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, including discounts associated with long-term debt. Fair value is based on quoted market prices, where available. If quoted market prices are not available, fair value is based upon models that use as inputs market-based parameters, including but not limited to forward curves, discount rates, broker quotes, volatilities and nonperformance risk. 
  The Company has categorized its fair value measurements into a three-level fair value hierarchy, based on the priority of the inputs to the valuation technique. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The Company s fair value measurements relating to derivative instruments are included in Level 2. Since the adoption of fair value accounting, the Company has not made any changes to its classification of financial instruments in each category. 
  Items included in Level 3 are valued using internal models that use significant unobservable inputs. Items included in Level 2 are valued using management s best estimate of fair value corroborated by third-party quotes.  
  
   16 

The following assets and liabilities were measured at fair value on a recurring basis during the period (refer to Note 4 for details relating to derivative instruments): 

The carrying value of cash equivalents approximates fair value due to the short maturity of the instruments. The Company s non-financial assets, such as property, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets are recorded at fair value upon business combination and are remeasured at fair value only if an impairment charge is recognized. To the extent necessary, the Company applies unobservable inputs and management judgment due to the absence of quoted market prices (Level 3) to the valuation methodologies for these non-financial assets.  
  The estimated fair value and carrying amount of long-term debt as reported on the condensed consolidated balance sheets   as of September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   is shown in the table below (refer to Note 3 for details relating to the debt instruments). The fair value was estimated using Level 2 inputs based on rates reflective of the remaining maturity as well as the Company s financial position. The carrying value of the revolving credit facilities approximates fair value for the periods presented below.

    Financial Information by Business Segment 
     As a result of changes to the Company s operations in the first quarter of 2016, management has evaluated how the Company is organized and operates and has identified the Exploration and Production segment, the Rice Midstream Holdings segment and the Rice Midstream Partners segment as separate operating segments. As a result of the changes to the Company s operating segments, all prior period information has been revised to reflect the new operating segment structure. Operating segments are evaluated on their contribution to the Company s consolidated results based on operating income. Other income and expenses, interest and income taxes are managed on a consolidated basis. The segment accounting policies are the same as those described in Note 1 to the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31,   2015   contained in its   2015   Annual Report.  
   The operating results of the Company s reportable segments were as follows for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  :

    Commitments and Contingencies 
     On   October 14, 2013  , the Company entered into a Development Agreement and Area of Mutual Interest Agreement (collectively, the  Utica Development Agreements ) with Gulfport Energy Corporation ( Gulfport ) covering approximately   50,000   aggregate net acres in the Utica Shale in Belmont County, Ohio. Pursuant to the Utica Development Agreements, the Company had approximately   68.7%   participating interest in acreage currently owned or to be acquired by the Company or Gulfport located within Goshen and Smith Townships (the  Northern Contract Area ) and an approximately   48.2%   participating interest in acreage currently owned or to be acquired by the Company or Gulfport located within Wayne and Washington Townships (the  Southern Contract Area ), each within Belmont County, Ohio. The majority of the remaining participating interests are held by Gulfport. The participating interests of the Company and Gulfport in each of the Northern and Southern Contract Areas approximated the Company s then-current relative acreage positions in each area.  
  The Utica Development Agreements have terms of   ten   years and are terminable upon   90   days  notice by either party; provided that, with respect to interests included within a drilling unit, such interests shall remain subject to the applicable joint operating agreement and the Company and Gulfport shall remain operators of drilling units located in the Northern and Southern Contract Areas, respectively, following such termination.  
  The Company has commitments for gathering and firm transportation under existing contracts with third parties. Future payments under these contracts   as of September 30, 2016   totaled   $4.8 billion   (remainder of   2016   -   $33.4 million  ,   2017   -   $153.8 million  ,   2018   -   $229.2 million  ,   2019   -   $224.9 million  ,   2020   -   $224.6 million  ,   2021   -   $224.2 million   and thereafter -   $3.7 billion  ).  
  As of September 30, 2016, the Company had   three   horizontal rigs under contract, of which   two   expire in 2017 and   one   expires in 2018. As of September 30, 2016, the Company also had   one   tophole drilling rig under contract, which expires in 2018. Future payments under these contracts   as of September 30, 2016   totaled   $43.6 million   (remainder of 2016 -   $8.5 million  , 2017 -   $26.1 million   and 2018 -   $9.0 million  ). Any other rig performing work for the Company is performed on a well-by-well basis and  
  
   19 

therefore can be released without penalty at the conclusion of drilling on the current well, the costs of which have not been included in the amounts above. The values above represent the gross amounts that the Company is committed to pay without regard to its proportionate share based on its working interest.  
    
  Litigation 
  From time to time the Company is party to various legal and/or regulatory proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. While the ultimate outcome and impact to the Company cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company believes that all such matters are without merit and involve amounts which, if resolved unfavorably, either individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. When it is determined that a loss is probable of occurring and is reasonably estimable, the Company accrues an undiscounted liability for such contingencies based on its best estimate using information available at the time. The Company discloses contingencies where an adverse outcome may be material, or in the judgment of management, the matter should otherwise be disclosed.  
  The Company is currently negotiating a settlement with the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection ( DEP ) relating to civil penalties for certain Notices of Violations received from December 2011 through April 2016 under the Clean Streams Law, the 2012 Oil and Gas Act, the Solid Waste Management Act, and the Dam Safety and Encroachments Act. As of September 30, 2016, the Company has accrued   $3.6 million   for contingencies associated with these settlement negotiations with the DEP. 
   
           8. 
    Mezzanine Equity 
     On   February 17, 2016  , the Company, Midstream Holdings and Rice Midstream GP Holdings LP, a Delaware limited partnership ( GP Holdings ) and subsidiary of Midstream Holdings, entered into a securities purchase agreement (the  Securities Purchase Agreement ) with EIG Energy Fund XVI, L.P., EIG Energy Fund XVI-E, L.P., and EIG Holdings (RICE) Partners, LP (collectively, the  Investors ) pursuant to which (i) Midstream Holdings agreed to issue and sell   375,000   Series B Units ( Series B Units ) with an aggregate liquidation preference of   $375.0 million   and (ii)  GP Holdings agreed to issue and sell common units representing an   8.25%   limited partner interest in GP Holdings ( GP Holdings Common Units ) for aggregate consideration of   $375.0 million   in a private placement (the  Midstream Holdings Investment ) exempt from the registration requirements under the Securities Act. In conjunction with the Securities Purchase Agreement, Midstream Holdings issued   1,000   Series A Units to Rice Energy Operating LLC ( Rice Energy Operating  or  REO ), a subsidiary of the Company formerly known as Rice Energy Appalachia, LLC. The Midstream Holdings Investment closed on   February 22, 2016   (the  Closing Date ). 
  In connection with the closing, on February 22, 2016, (i) REO and the Investors entered into the Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of Midstream Holdings, which defines the preferences, rights, powers and duties of holders of the Series B Units (the  LLC Agreement ) and (ii) Rice Midstream GP Management LLC ( GP Management ), as general partner of GP Holdings, and Midstream Holdings and the Investors, as limited partners, entered into the Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of GP Holdings, which defines the preferences, rights, powers and duties of holders of the GP Holdings Common Units (the  GP Holdings A R LPA ). 
  In connection with the Midstream Holdings Investment, Midstream Holdings received gross proceeds of   $375.0 million   less transaction fees and expenses of approximately   $6.2 million  . Midstream Holdings used approximately   $69.0 million   of the proceeds to reduce outstanding borrowings under the Midstream Holdings Revolving Credit Facility and   $300.0 million   was distributed to the Company. 
  Series B Units 
  Pursuant to the LLC Agreement, the Series B Units rank senior to all other equity interests in Midstream Holdings with respect to the payment of distributions and distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution and winding up. The Series B Units will pay quarterly distributions at a rate of   8%   per annum, payable in cash or  in-kind  through the issuance of additional Series B Units, subject to certain exceptions, at Midstream Holdings  option for the first   two   years, and in cash thereafter. Distributions are payable on January 1, April 1, July 1 and October 1 of each year that the Series B Units remain outstanding. For purposes of the October 1, 2016 quarterly distribution, the Company paid   $3.3 million   in cash in September 2016 and elected to distribute approximately   4,361   Series B Units in lieu of cash distributions of   $4.4 million  .   
  The Investors holding Series B Units have the option to require Midstream Holdings to redeem the Series B Units on or after the tenth anniversary of the Closing Date at an amount equal to   $1,000   per Series B Unit plus any accrued and unpaid distributions (the  Liquidation Preference ). The Series B Units are subject to an optional cash redemption by Midstream Holdings after the third anniversary of the Closing Date, at an amount equal to the Liquidation Preference. If any of the  
  
   20 

Company, the Partnership or Midstream Holdings undergoes a Change in Control (as defined in the Securities Purchase Agreement), the Investors have the right to require Midstream Holdings to repurchase any or all of the Series B Units for cash, and Midstream Holdings has the right to repurchase any or all of the Series B Units for cash. The holders of the Series B units do not have the power to vote or dispose of the equity interest in the Partnership held by GP Holdings. 
  In relation to the Series B Units, the occurrence of certain events or violations of certain financial and non-financial restrictions will constitute  Triggering Events  that may result in various consequences, including additional restrictions on the activities of Midstream Holdings, including the termination of the Investor s additional commitment, increases in the distribution rate, additional governance rights for the Investors and other measures depending on the applicable Triggering Event. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company views the likelihood of the occurrence of a Triggering Event to be remote.    
  In the event that Midstream Holdings or GP Holdings pursues an initial public offering, Midstream Holdings may redeem the Series B Units at a redemption price equal to the Liquidation Preference on the date of the closing of the applicable initial public offering plus all additional distributions that would have otherwise been paid through the third anniversary of the Closing Date. Midstream Holdings may satisfy this redemption price in cash or common equity interests of the entity that completes an initial public offering. In the event of any liquidation and winding up of Midstream Holdings, profits and losses will be allocated to the holders of the Series B Units so that, to the maximum extent possible, the capital accounts of the Series B unitholders will equal the aggregate Liquidation Preference. 
  GP Holdings Common Units 
  Pursuant to the GP Holdings A R LPA, the holders of the GP Holdings Common Units are entitled to distributions of GP Holdings in proportion to their pro rata share of the outstanding GP Holdings Common Units. Distributions will occur upon GP Holdings receipt of any distributions of cash in respect of the equity interests in the Partnership held by GP Holdings. 
  The Investors holding GP Holdings Common Units have tag-along rights in connection with a sale of the common equity interests in GP Holdings to a third-party. The holders of GP Holdings Common Units will have drag-along rights in connection with a sale of the majority of the common equity interests in GP Holdings to a third-party, subject to the achievement of an agreed-upon minimum return. If a qualifying initial public offering of GP Holdings is not consummated prior to the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date, the holders of the GP Holdings Common Units shall have the right to require GP Holdings to repurchase all of their GP Holdings Common Units for cash in an aggregate purchase price of   $125.0 million  . In the event of a Change in Control or a GP Change in Control (as each term is defined in the GP Holdings A R LPA) of the Company, Midstream Holdings or GP Holdings, the Purchasers shall have the right to require GP Holdings to repurchase all of their GP Holdings Common Units for an aggregate purchase price of   $125.0 million  . The holders of the GP Holdings Common Units do not have the power to vote or dispose of the Partnership s units held by GP Holdings. 
  In the event GP Holdings sells any of its assets, subject to certain exceptions, GP Holdings may only make distributions of such proceeds to the extent that GP Holdings meets certain requirements, including the requirement to retain a certain amount of cash or cash equivalents following the sale of such assets. In the event of any liquidation and winding up of GP Holdings, GP Management, in its capacity as general partner, will appoint a liquidator to wind up the affairs and make final distributions as provided for in the GP Holdings A R LPA. 
  From September 30, 2016 until the   eighteen  -month anniversary of the closing of the Midstream Holdings Investment, upon the satisfaction of certain financial and operational metrics, Midstream Holdings has the right to require the Investors to purchase additional Series B Units and GP Holdings Common Units. Midstream Holdings may require the Investors to purchase at least   $25.0 million   of additional units on up to   three   occasions, up to a total aggregate amount of   $125.0 million  . Pursuant to the Securities Purchase Agreement, Midstream Holdings is required to pay the Investors a quarterly cash commitment fee of   2%   per annum on any undrawn amounts of the additional   $125.0 million   commitment. The commitment fee paid in cash was approximately   $0.6 million   and   $1.5 million   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  . No additional units have been purchased by the Investors since the closing of the Midstream Holdings Investment. 
  As the Investors have an option to redeem the Series B Units and GP Holdings Common Units for cash at a future date, the proceeds from the redeemable noncontrolling interest (net of accretion and issuances costs and fees) are not considered to be a component of stockholder s equity on the condensed consolidated balance sheet, and such Series B Units and GP Holdings Common Units are reported as mezzanine equity on the condensed consolidated balance sheet. The following table represents  
  
   21 

the value allocated to the Series B Units and GP Holdings Common Units at inception.    

  While the Series B Units are not currently redeemable, the initial value allocated to them will be accreted to their full redemption value through February 22, 2026 using the effective interest rate method, as it is considered probable that they will become redeemable. The following table represents detail of the balance of redeemable noncontrolling interest, net on the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of   September 30, 2016  .

    Stockholders  Equity 
     The Company s Board of Directors did not declare or pay a dividend for the three months or   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .

On   October 20, 2016  , the Board of Directors of the Partnership s general partner declared a cash distribution to the Partnership s unitholders for the third quarter of 2016 of   $0.2370   per common and subordinated unit. The cash distribution will be paid on   November 10, 2016   to unitholders of record at the close of business on   November 1, 2016  . Also on   November 10, 2016  , a cash distribution of   $0.4 million   will be made to GP Holdings related to its incentive distribution rights in the Partnership in accordance with the partnership agreement.  
  On April 15, 2016, the Company issued and completed a public offering (the  April 2016 Equity Offering ) of an aggregate of   29,858,891   shares of common stock at a price to the public of   $16.35   per share, which included   20,000,000   shares sold by the Company and   9,858,891   shares sold by NGP Rice Holdings LLC ( NGP Holdings ). On April 21, 2016, NGP Holdings sold an additional   4,478,834   shares of common stock pursuant to the exercise of the underwriter s option to purchase additional shares. After deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of   $15.0 million   and transaction costs, the Company received net proceeds of   $311.8 million  . The Company received no proceeds from the sale of shares by NGP Holdings. The Company intends to use the net proceeds of the April 2016 Equity Offering for general corporate purposes, which may include funding a portion of its 2017 capital budget.  
  On September 30, 2016, the Company issued and completed a public offering (the  September 2016 Equity Offering ) of an aggregate of   40,000,000   shares of common stock at a price to the public of   $25.50   per share. On October 11, 2016, the Company sold an additional   6,000,000   shares of common stock pursuant to the exercise of the underwriters  option to purchase additional shares of common stock in connection with the September 2016 Equity Offering. After deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of approximately   $17.9 million   and transaction costs, the Company received net proceeds of approximately   $1.2 billion  , which includes proceeds from the exercised underwriters  option. The Company used the net proceeds from the offering primarily to fund a portion of the Vantage Acquisition. The Company will use the remaining proceeds for general corporate purposes. See Note 16 for additional information. 
  The Company s authorized common stock includes   650,000,000   shares of common stock,   $0.01   par value per share. The following table presents a summary of changes to the Company s common shares from December 31, 2015 through   September 30, 2016  : 
  
   22 

In connection with the Company s initial public offering ( IPO ) and the related corporate reorganization, the REO incentive unit holders contributed their REO incentive units to NGP Holdings and Rice Energy Holdings LLC ( Rice Holdings ) in return for (i) incentive units in such entities that, in the aggregate, were substantially similar to the REO incentive units they previously held and (ii) shares of common stock in the amount of   $3.4 million   related to the extinguishment of the incentive burden attributable to Mr. Daniel J. Rice III. No payments were made in respect of incentive units prior to the completion of the Company s IPO. As a result of the IPO, the payment likelihood related to the NGP Holdings and Rice Holdings incentive units was deemed probable, requiring the Company to recognize compensation expense. The compensation expense related to these interests is treated as additional paid in capital from NGP Holdings and Rice Holdings in the Company s financial statements and is not deductible for federal or state income tax purposes. The compensation expense recognized is a non-cash charge, with the settlement obligation resting on NGP Holdings and Rice Holdings, and as such, the incentive units are not dilutive to Rice Energy Inc. 
  NGP Holdings 
  The NGP Holdings incentive units are considered a liability-based award and are adjusted to fair market value on a quarterly basis until all payments have been made. As a result of NGP s sale of its remaining shares of the Company s common stock in connection with the Company s April 2016 Equity Offering, NGP Holdings paid approximately   $47.5 million   to holders of certain classes of NGP Holdings incentive units which resulted in the settlement of the remaining NGP Holdings incentive unit obligation. As such, the cumulative expense attributable to the NGP Holdings incentive units as of June 30, 2016 was adjusted to equal the cumulative cash payments made by NGP Holdings to NGP Holdings incentive unit holders. As a result, the Company recognized   $27.3 million   of compensation expense for the six months ended June 30, 2016. No future expense will be recognized related to the NGP Holdings incentive units as a result of the April 2016 settlement of the remaining NGP Holdings incentive unit obligation. The Company recognized   $(7.7) million   and   $(8.6) million   of non-cash compensation income for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , respectively.  
  Rice Holdings 
  The Rice Holdings incentive units are considered an equity-based award with the fair value of the award determined at the grant date and amortized over the service period of the award using the straight-line method. Compensation expense relative to the Rice Holdings incentive units was   $5.9 million   and   $17.6 million   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, and   $7.1 million   (including   $1.7 million   related to changes in certain service condition assumptions) and   $27.7 million   (including   $12.8 million   related to changes in certain service condition assumptions) for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , respectively. The Company will recognize approximately   $21.6 million   of additional compensation expense over the next year related to the Rice Holdings incentive units.  
  In August 2014, the triggering event for the Rice Holdings incentive units was achieved. As a result, in September 2014, 2015 and 2016, Rice Holdings distributed one quarter, one third and one half, respectively, of its then-remaining assets (consisting solely of shares of the Company s common stock) to its members pursuant to the terms of its limited liability company agreement. In addition, in September 2017, Rice Holdings will distribute all of its then-remaining assets (consisting solely of shares of the Company s common stock) to its members pursuant to the terms of its limited liability company agreement. As a result, over time, the shares of the Company s common stock held by Rice Holdings will be transferred in their entirety to the members of Rice Holdings.  
  Combined 
  Total combined compensation expense (income) attributable to the incentive units was   $5.9 million   and   $44.9 million   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, and   $(0.7) million   and   $45.9 million   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , respectively. 
  
   23 

Three   tranches of the incentive units have a time vesting feature. A roll forward of those units from December 31, 2015 to   September 30, 2016   is included below.    

  Two   tranches of the incentive units do not have a time vesting feature, and their payouts are triggered upon a future payment condition. As such,   none   of these awards have vested as of   September 30, 2016  .

    Variable Interest Entities 
     Pursuant to an evaluation performed upon adoption of Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2015-02,  Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis,  the Company concluded that the Partnership, GP Holdings and Strike Force Midstream LLC ( Strike Force Midstream ), a subsidiary of Midstream Holdings and Gulfport Midstream Holdings, LLC, each meet the criteria for variable interest entity ( VIE ) classification, as described in further detail below. 
  Rice Midstream Partners LP 
  The Company evaluated the Partnership for consolidation and determined the Partnership to be a VIE. The Company determined that the primary beneficiary of the Partnership is GP Holdings. As of   September 30, 2016  , Midstream Holdings held a significant indirect interest in the Partnership through its ownership of a   91.75%   limited liability partnership interest in GP Holdings, which owned an approximate   35%   limited partner interest in the Partnership, and through ownership of its wholly-owned subsidiary Rice Midstream Management LLC (the  GP ), which holds all of the substantive voting and participating rights in the Partnership. As a result, the related party group of GP Holdings and the GP collectively hold the power to direct the activities of the Partnership that most significantly impact the Partnership s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the Partnership that could potentially be significant to the Partnership.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company consolidated the Partnership, recording noncontrolling interest related to the net income of the Partnership attributable to its public unitholders. The following table presents summary information of assets and liabilities of the Partnership that is included in the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheets that are for the use or obligation of the Partnership.

Rice Midstream GP Holdings LP 
  The Company evaluated GP Holdings for consolidation and determined GP Holdings to be a VIE. The Company determined that the primary beneficiary of GP Holdings is Midstream Holdings. Midstream Holdings holds a   91.75%   limited partnership interest in GP Holdings and Rice Midstream GP Management LLC ( GP Management ), the general partner of GP Holdings and wholly-owned subsidiary of Midstream Holdings, holds all of the substantive voting and participating rights to direct the activities of GP Holdings. As a result, the related party group of Midstream Holdings and GP Management collectively hold the power to direct the activities of GP Holdings that most significantly impact GP Holdings  economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from GP Holdings that could potentially be significant to GP Holdings.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company consolidates GP Holdings, recording noncontrolling interest related to the ownership interests of GP Holdings attributable to the Investors. GP Holdings has no significant assets, liabilities or operations other than consolidation of the Partnership.  
  Strike Force Midstream Holdings LLC 
  On   February 1, 2016  , Strike Force Midstream Holdings LLC ( Strike Force Holdings ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Midstream Holdings, and Gulfport Midstream Holdings, LLC ( Gulfport Midstream ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Gulfport, entered into an Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement (the  Strike Force LLC Agreement ) of Strike Force Midstream to engage in the natural gas midstream business in approximately   319,000   acres in Belmont and Monroe Counties, Ohio. Under the terms of the Strike Force LLC Agreement, Strike Force Holdings made an initial contribution to Strike Force Midstream of certain pipelines, facilities and rights of way and cash in the amount of   $41.0 million   in exchange for a   75%   membership interest in Strike Force Midstream. Gulfport Midstream made an initial contribution of a gathering system and related assets in exchange for a   25%   membership interest in Strike Force Midstream. The assets contributed by Gulfport Midstream have a preliminary fair value of   $22.5 million   which was determined using Level 3 valuation inputs included in the discounted cash flow method within the income approach. The income approach includes estimates and  
  
   25 

assumptions related to future throughput volumes, operating costs, capital spending and changes in working capital. Estimating the fair value of these assets required judgment and determining the fair value is sensitive to changes in assumptions. Additionally, on   February 1, 2016  , Strike Force Midstream and Strike Force Holdings entered into a services agreement whereby Strike Force Holdings will provide all of the services necessary to operate, manage and maintain Strike Force Midstream.  
  The Company evaluated Strike Force Midstream for consolidation and determined Strike Force Midstream to be a VIE. Strike Force Holdings was determined to be the primary beneficiary as a result of its power to direct the activities of Strike Force Midstream that most significantly impact Strike Force Midstream s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits through its   75%   membership interest in Strike Force Midstream.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company consolidates Strike Force Midstream, recording noncontrolling interest related to the ownership interests of Strike Force Midstream attributable to Gulfport Midstream. The following table presents summary information of assets and liabilities of Strike Force Midstream that is included in the Company s condensed consolidated balance sheet that are for the use or obligation of Strike Force Midstream.

    Stock-Based Compensation 
     From time to time, the Company grants stock-based compensation awards to certain non-employee directors and employees under the Company s long-term incentive plan (the  LTIP ). Pursuant to the LTIP, the aggregate maximum number of shares of the Company s common stock issued under the LTIP may not exceed   17,500,000   shares. The Company has granted both restricted stock units, which vest upon the passage of time, and performance stock units, which vest based upon the passage of time and attainment of specified Company performance criteria. During the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company granted approximately   1.3 million   restricted stock units, which are expected to vest ratably over approximately   one   to   three   years. During the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company granted approximately   1.0 million   of performance stock units, which are expected to cliff vest over approximately   three   years. Stock-based compensation cost related to awards under the LTIP was   $5.4 million   and   $14.5 million   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, and   $3.3 million   and   $8.7 million   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , respectively.   As of September 30, 2016  , the Company has unrecognized compensation cost related to LTIP awards of   $29.0 million   which will be recognized over a period of   one   to   three   years.  
  Additionally, from time to time, phantom unit awards are granted under the Rice Midstream Partners LP 2014 Long Term Incentive Plan to certain non-employee directors of the Partnership and executive officers and employees of the Company that provide services to the Partnership under an omnibus agreement. The Partnership recorded   $0.6 million   and   $2.6 million   of equity-based compensation cost related to previously issued awards in the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, and   $1.0 million   and   $3.0 million   for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  , respectively.   As of September 30, 2016  , the Partnership has unrecognized compensation cost related to these awards of   $0.8 million   which will be recognized over a period of approximately   one   year.  
  Further information on stock-based compensation recorded in the condensed consolidated financial statements is detailed below. 

27 

Basic earnings per share ( EPS ) is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share takes into account the dilutive effect of potential common stock that could be issued by the Company in conjunction with stock awards that have been granted to directors and employees. The following is a calculation of the basic and diluted weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding and EPS for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  

For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, shares in the amount of   6,184   and   237,181  , respectively, attributable to equity awards were not included in the diluted earnings per share calculation because to do so would have been anti-dilutive. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,   1,235,115   and   160,248   shares, respectively, attributable to equity awards were not included in the diluted earnings per share calculation as the Company incurred a net loss for the periods presented herein.  
   
   The Company is a corporation under the Internal Revenue Code subject to federal income tax at a statutory rate of   35%   of pretax earnings and, as such, its future income taxes will be dependent upon its future taxable income. The Company estimates an annual effective income tax rate based on projected results for the year and applies this rate to income before taxes to calculate income tax expense, subject to certain loss limitation provisions. All of the Partnership s earnings are included in the Company s net income; however, the Company is not required to record income tax expense with respect to the portion of the Partnership s earnings allocated to the Partnership s noncontrolling public limited partners, which reduces the Company s effective tax rate. Any refinements made due to subsequent information that affects the estimated annual effective income tax rate are reflected as adjustments in the current period. 
    
  Tax (expense) benefit for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   $(81.1) million   and   $45.7 million  , respectively, resulting in an effective tax rate of approximately   47%   and   51%  , respectively. The tax expense for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015   was   $19.8 million   and   $18.3 million  , respectively, resulting in an effective tax rate of approximately   23%   and   75%  , respectively. The effective tax rate for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   differs from the statutory rate due principally to nondeductible incentive unit expense and the portion of the Partnership s earnings allocated to its noncontrolling public limited partners, and the application of loss limitation provisions.  
  Based on management s analysis, the Company did not have any uncertain tax positions   as of September 30, 2016  .  
  The assignment of the common and subordinated units in the Midstream Holdings Investment resulted in the sale or exchange of more than 50 percent of its capital and profits interests of the Partnership within 12 months. Accordingly, the Partnership is considered to have  technically terminated  as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The technical  
  
   28 

termination will not affect the Partnership s consolidated financial statements, nor will it affect the Partnership s classification as a partnership or the nature or extent of its  qualifying income  for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The taxable year for all unitholders ended on February 22, 2016 and will result in a deferral of depreciation deductions that were otherwise allowable in computing the taxable income of the Partnership s unitholders for the period from January 1, 2016 through February 22, 2016. 
    
  The Vantage Acquisition completed on October 19, 2016 resulted in a second technical termination of the Partnership. The taxable year for all unitholders ended on October 19, 2016 and will result in a deferral of depreciation deductions that were otherwise allowable in computing the taxable income of the Partnership s unitholders for the period February 23, 2016 through October 19, 2016.

    New Accounting Pronouncements 
     In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),  or ASU No. 2014-09. The FASB created Topic 606 which supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Topic 605,  Revenue Recognition,  and most industry-specific guidance throughout the Industry Topics of the Codification. ASU 2014-09 will enhance comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities, industries and capital markets compared to existing guidance. Additionally, ASU 2014-09 will reduce the number of requirements which an entity must consider in recognizing revenue, as this update will replace multiple locations for guidance. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) - Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing.  In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-11,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815)   Rescission of SEC Guidance Because of Accounting Standards Updates 2014-09 and 2014-16 Pursuant to Staff Announcements at the March 3, 2016 EITF Meeting  and ASU 2016-12,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)   Narrow Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients.  These updates do not change the core principle of the guidance in Topic 606 (as amended by ASU 2014-09), but rather provide further guidance with respect to the implementation of ASU 2014-09. The effective date for ASU 2016-10, 2016-11, 2016-12 and ASU 2014-09, as amended by ASU 2015-14, is for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those years. The Company has not yet selected a transition method and is currently evaluating the standard and the impact on its consolidated financial statements and footnote disclosures. 
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU, 2015-03,  Interest Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplification of Debt Issuance Costs.  ASU 2015-03 was issued to simplify the presentation of debt issuance costs by requiring debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. ASU 2015-03 is effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2015. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-15,  Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements.  ASU 2015-15 clarifies the guidance in ASU 2015-03 regarding presentation and subsequent measurement of debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements. The SEC staff announced they would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement. The Company adopted ASU 2015-03 in the first quarter of 2016 and presents debt issuance costs associated with its Notes as a deduction from the carrying amount of the Notes. The Company also adopted ASU 2015-15 in the first quarter and presents debt issuance costs associated with the Company s revolving credit facilities as deferred financing costs, net in its unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets. The Company has retrospectively applied the guidance in ASU 2015-03 and ASU 2015-15, which resulted in the reclassification of   $21.4 million   of deferred financing costs related to the Notes from deferred financing costs, net, to long-term debt on the condensed consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2015. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU, 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842)  ASU 2016-02 which requires, among other things, that lessees recognize the following for all leases (with the exception of short-term leases) at the commencement date: (i) a lease liability, which is a lessee s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis; and (ii) a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee s right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. The new guidance is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. The amendments should be applied at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach with earlier application permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new guidance on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,  Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.  ASU 2016-09 affects entities that issue share-based payment awards to their employees. ASU 2016-09 is designed to simplify several aspects of accounting for share-based payment award transactions, including: (a) income tax consequences, (b) classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, (c) classification on the statement of cash flows and (d) forfeiture rate calculations. The updated guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption of the update is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements, but does not intend to early adopt this standard. 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.  ASU 2016-15 clarifies and provides specific guidance on eight cash flow classification issues that are not currently addressed by current GAAP and thereby reduce the current diversity in practice. ASU 2016-15 is effective for public business entities for annual periods, including interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15,  
  
   29 

2017, with early application permitted. The Company does not anticipate that this guidance will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.  
   
   On October 19, 2016, the Company completed the acquisition of Vantage Energy, LLC and Vantage Energy II, LLC (collectively,  Vantage ) and their subsidiaries (the  Vantage Acquisition ) pursuant to the terms of a Purchase and Sale Agreement (the  Vantage Purchase Agreement ) dated September 26, 2016 by the Company, Vantage Energy Investment LLC, Vantage Energy Investment II LLC and Vantage. Pursuant to the terms of the Vantage Purchase Agreement, Rice Energy Operating acquired Vantage from certain affiliates of Quantum Energy Partners, Riverstone Holdings LLC and Lime Rock Partners (such affiliates, the  Vantage Sellers ) for an aggregate consideration of approximately   $2.7 billion  , which consisted of approximately   $1.0   billion in cash, the assumption of net debt of approximately   $707.0   million and the issuance of   40.0 million   units in Rice Energy Operating that were immediately exchangeable into   40.0   million shares of common stock of the Company, preliminarily valued at   $1.0 billion  . In connection with executing the Vantage Purchase Agreement, the Company transferred   $270.0 million   to escrow, which was reported on the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2016 as an acquisition deposit and was released in connection with the completion of the Vantage Acquisition to the Vantage Sellers. Concurrent with the completion of the Vantage Acquisition, the Company extinguished the debt assumed from the Vantage Sellers for   $707.0 million   in cash, which approximated the fair value of the debt at the time of extinguishment. In addition, the Vantage Sellers were issued 1/1000th of a share of Rice Energy preferred stock for each unit held in REO. These shares of preferred stock are intended to provide holders with non-economic voting rights in the Company and are extinguished upon conversion of the associated units in REO into Rice Energy common stock. The Company used the net proceeds from its September 2016 Equity Offering to pay for a portion of the Vantage Acquisition. Pursuant to the Vantage Purchase Agreement, the Company acquired approximately   85,000   net core Marcellus acres in Greene County, Pennsylvania, with rights to the deeper Utica Shale on approximately   52,000   net acres and approximately   37,000   net acres in the Barnett Shale. 
  On September 26, 2016, the Company entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement (the  Midstream Purchase Agreement ) by and between the Company and the Partnership. Pursuant to the terms of the Midstream Purchase Agreement, as amended, immediately following the close of the Vantage Acquisition on October 19, 2016, the Partnership acquired from the Company all of the outstanding membership interests of Vantage Energy II Access, LLC and Vista Gathering, LLC (collectively, the  Vantage Midstream Entities ). The Partnership s acquisition of the Vantage Midstream Entities from the Company is accounted for as a combination of entities under common control at historical cost. The Vantage Midstream Entities, which became wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Partnership following the completion of the acquisition of the Vantage Midstream Entities, own midstream assets including approximately   30   miles of dry gas gathering and compression assets. In consideration for the acquisition of the Vantage Midstream Entities, the Partnership paid the Company   $600.0   million in aggregate cash consideration, which the Partnership funded through the net proceeds of its private placement of Partnership common units and borrowings under its revolving credit facility. 
  The following table summarizes the preliminary purchase price and the preliminary estimated values of assets and liabilities assumed. 
  
   30 

Pro Forma Information (Unaudited) 
  The following unaudited pro forma combined financial information presents the Company s results as though the Vantage Acquisition had been completed at January 1, 2016 and January 1, 2015, respectively. 

Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of Rice Energy Operating 
  Following completion of the Vantage Acquisition, the Company operates Vantage through Rice Energy Operating. As more fully described above, as part of the consideration for the Vantage Acquisition, the Vantage Sellers received membership interests in Rice Energy Operating. In connection with the issuance of such membership interests to the Vantage Sellers, the Company and the Vantage Sellers entered into Rice Energy Operating s third amended and restated limited liability company agreement (the  Third A R LLC Agreement ). Provisions regarding the operations of Rice Energy Operating, and the rights and obligations of the holders of Rice Energy Operating common units (the  REO Common Units ), are set forth in the Third A R LLC Agreement. 
  Designation as Manager  . Under the Third A R LLC Agreement, the Company is a member and the sole manager of Rice Energy Operating. As the sole manager, the Company controls all of the day-to-day business affairs and decision-making of Rice Energy Operating without the approval of any other member, unless otherwise stated in the Third A R LLC Agreement. As such, the Company, through its officers and directors, is responsible for all operational and administrative decisions of Rice Energy Operating and the day-to-day management of Rice Energy Operating s business. Pursuant to the Third A R LLC Agreement, the Company cannot, under any circumstances, be removed or replaced as the sole manager except by its own election, so long as it remains a member of Rice Energy Operating. 
  Compensation  . The Company is not entitled to compensation for its services as sole manager. The Company is entitled to reimbursement by Rice Energy Operating for any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred on behalf of Rice Energy Operating, including all fees, expenses and costs of being a public company (including public reporting obligations, proxy statements, stockholder meetings, stock exchange fees, transfer agent fees, SEC and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority filing fees and offering expenses) and maintaining its corporate existence. 
  
   31 

Recapitalization  . The Third A R LLC Agreement provides for (a) the exchange of all outstanding Rice Energy Operating membership interests into newly issued REO Common Units, (b) the issuance of REO Common Units to each of the Vantage Sellers as partial consideration for the Vantage Acquisition and (c) the admission of the Vantage Sellers as members of Rice Energy Operating. Each common unit entitles the holder to a pro rata share of the net profits and losses and distributions of Rice Energy Operating. 
  Distributions  . The Third A R LLC Agreement allows for distributions to be made by Rice Energy Operating to its members on a pro rata basis out of  distributable cash  (as defined in the Third A R LLC Agreement). The Company expects to cause Rice Energy Operating to make distributions out of cash periodically to the extent permitted by the debt agreements of Rice Energy Operating as necessary to make dividend payments, if any, to holders of common stock of the Company. In addition, the Third A R LLC Agreement generally requires Rice Energy Operating to make pro rata distributions to its members, including the Company, in an amount at least sufficient to allow each member to pay any tax it incurs as a result of income allocated to such member by Rice Energy Operating. 
  Redemption Right.   The Third A R LLC Agreement provides each member of Rice Energy Operating, other than the Company, a redemption right which entitles them to cause Rice Energy Operating to redeem, from time to time, all or a portion of its REO Common Units. Each REO Common Unit will be redeemed for, at Rice Energy Operating s option, a newly-issued share of the Company s common stock or a cash payment equal to the volume-weighted average closing price of one share of common stock for the   five   trading days prior to and including the last full trading day immediately prior to the date that the member delivers a notice of redemption (subject to customary adjustments, including for stock splits, stock dividends and reclassifications). In the event of a  reclassification event  (as defined in the Third A R LLC Agreement), the manager is required to ensure that each REO Common Unit is redeemable for the same amount and type of property, securities or cash that one share of common stock becomes exchangeable for or converted into as a result of such  reclassification event.  Upon the exercise of the redemption right, the redeeming member will surrender its common units to Rice Energy Operating and 1/1000th of a share of Class A Preferred Stock, par value   $0.01   per share (the  Preferred Stock ) in respect of each redeemed unit, in each case free and clear of all liens and encumbrances, to Rice Energy Operating for cancellation. The Third A R LLC Agreement requires that the Company contribute cash or share of its common stock to Rice Energy Operation in exchange for a number of common units in Rice Energy Operating equal to the number of REO Common Units to be redeemed from the member. Rice Energy Operating will then distribute such cash or shares of the Company s common stock to such member to complete the redemption. Upon the exercise of the redemption right, the Company may, at its option, effect a direct exchange of the REO Common Units (and the corresponding shares of Preferred Stock (or fractions thereof) from the redemption member.  
  Change of Control  . In connection with the occurrence of a  manager change of control  (as defined below), the Company has the right to require each member of Rice Energy Operating (other than the Company) to cause Rice Energy Operating to redeem some or all of such member s common units and 1/1000   th    of a share of Preferred Stock in respect of each such common unit, in each case, effective immediately prior to the consummation of the manager change of control. From and after the date of such redemption, the REO common units and shares of Preferred Stock (or fractions thereof) subject to such redemption shall be deemed to be transferred to the Company and each such member shall cease to have any rights with respect to the REO Common Units and shares of Preferred Stock (or fractions thereof) subject to such redemption (other than the right to receive shares of common stock of the Company pursuant to such redemption).

  Overview  
  Rice Energy is an independent natural gas and oil company engaged in the acquisition, exploration and development of natural gas, oil and NGL properties in the Appalachian Basin. We manage our business in three operating segments, which are managed separately due to their distinct operational differences - the Exploration and Production segment, the Rice Midstream Holdings segment and the Rice Midstream Partners segment. The Exploration and Production segment is responsible for the acquisition, exploration and development of natural gas, oil and NGL properties in the Appalachian Basin. The Rice Midstream Holdings segment is engaged in the gathering and compression of natural gas, oil and NGL production in Belmont and Monroe counties, Ohio. The Rice Midstream Partners segment is engaged in the gathering and compression of natural gas, oil and NGL production in Washington and Greene counties, Pennsylvania, and in the provision of water services to support the well completion services of us and third parties in Washington and Greene counties, Pennsylvania and Belmont County, Ohio.  
  Recent Developments 
  Vantage Acquisition 
  On October 19, 2016, we completed the Vantage Acquisition pursuant to the terms of a Purchase and Sale Agreement (the  Vantage Purchase Agreement ) dated September 26, 2016 by the Company, Vantage Energy Investment LLC, Vantage Energy Investment II LLC and Vantage. Pursuant to the terms of the Vantage Purchase Agreement, Rice Energy Operating acquired Vantage from certain affiliates of Quantum Energy Partners, Riverstone Holdings LLC and Lime Rock Partners for an aggregate consideration at closing of approximately   $2.7 billion  , which consisted of approximately   $1.0   billion in cash, the assumption of net debt of approximately   $707.0   million and the issuance of 40.0 million units in Rice Energy Operating that were immediately exchangeable into   40.0   million shares of common stock of the Company, preliminarily valued at   $1.0 billion  . We used the net proceeds from the September 2016 Equity Offering to pay for a portion of the Vantage Acquisition. As a result of its acquisition of Vantage, Rice Energy Operating acquired approximately   85,000   net core Marcellus acres in Greene County, Pennsylvania, with rights to the deeper Utica Shale on approximately   52,000   net acres and approximately   37,000   net acres in the Barnett Shale. 
  Vantage Midstream Asset Acquisition 
  On September 26, 2016, we entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement (the  Midstream Purchase Agreement ) by and between us and the Partnership. Pursuant to the terms of the Midstream Purchase Agreement, as amended, immediately following the close of the Vantage Acquisition on October 19, 2016, the Partnership acquired from us all of the outstanding membership interests of Vantage Energy II Access, LLC and Vista Gathering, LLC ( collectively, the  Vantage Midstream Entities ). The Partnership s acquisition of the Vantage Midstream Entities from us is accounted for as a combination of entities under common control at historical cost. The Vantage Midstream Entities, which became wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Partnership following the completion of the acquisition of the Vantage Midstream Entities, own midstream assets including approximately   30   miles of dry gas gathering and compression assets. In consideration for the acquisition of the Vantage Midstream Entities, the Partnership paid us   $600.0   million in aggregate cash consideration, which the Partnership funded through the net proceeds of its private placement of Partnership common units and borrowings under its revolving credit facility. 
   
  Sources of Revenues  
  The substantial majority of our revenues are derived from the sale of natural gas and do not include the effects of derivatives. Our revenues may vary significantly from period to period as a result of changes in volumes of production sold or changes in realized prices. Our gathering, compression and water services revenues are primarily derived from our gathering and compression contracts in addition to fees charged to outside working interest owners.

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016   Compared to   Three Months Ended September 30, 2015     
  Total operating revenues  . The   $55.3 million   increase in total operating revenues was mainly a result of an increase in natural gas production in the   third quarter of 2016   compared to the   third quarter of 2015  , which was the result of increased drilling and completion activity, mainly in Washington County, Pennsylvania and Belmont County, Ohio. In addition to the impact of increased production volumes on operating revenues, our realized price increased from   $2.32   per Mcf in the   third quarter of 2015   to   $2.36   per Mcf in the   third quarter of 2016  , in each case before the effect of hedges. Operating revenues were positively impacted by an   $11.8 million   increase in gathering, compression and water service revenues period-over-period. This increase primarily relates to increased third-party volumes and related revenues on existing gathering contracts. Additionally, the increase in other revenue of approximately   $11.3 million   was primarily driven by our natural gas marketing activities.  
  Lease operating  . The   $0.3 million   decrease in lease operating expenses was primarily attributable to improved efficiencies relating to produced water recycling and reduced rental costs as a result of a reduced flowback period in the   third quarter of 2016   as compared to the prior period. In addition, lease operating expense per unit of production decreased period-over-period due to improved operating efficiencies, primarily related to more producing wells per pad, lower rental and service costs and increased overall production. 
  Gathering, compression and transportation  . Gathering, compression and transportation expense for the   third quarter of 2016   of   $29.6 million   is mainly comprised of   $27.2 million   of transportation contracts with third parties and $2.4 million of gathering charges from third parties. The   $5.3 million   increase in such expense was primarily attributable to increased firm transportation contracts in the   third quarter of 2016   compared to the   third quarter of 2015  . 
  Midstream operation and maintenance.   The   $0.7 million   decrease in midstream operation and maintenance expense period-over-period was primarily due to a decrease in operating expenses related to our water services as fewer wells were supported for completion activities in the third quarter of 2016.  
  Incentive unit expense (income).   Incentive unit expense increased   $6.6 million   period-over-period. In the   third quarter of 2015  , the   $0.7 million   income consisted of $7.0 million of non-cash compensation expense related to the Rice Holdings incentive units, offset by $7.7 million of non-cash income related to the quarterly fair market value adjustment for the NGP Holdings incentive units, which was largely driven by the decline in the Company s stock price at September 30, 2015. In the   third quarter of 2016  , the   $5.9 million   expense consisted of   $5.9 million   of non-cash compensation expense related to the Rice Holdings incentive units. No future expense will be recognized related to the NGP Holdings incentive units as a result of the April 2016 settlement of the remaining NGP Holdings incentive unit obligation. See  Item 1. Financial Statements Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 10. Incentive Units  for additional information. 
  General and administrative  . The   $1.6 million   increase in general and administrative expense period-over-period was primarily attributable to the addition of personnel to support our growth activities and related salary and employee benefits. At   September 30, 2016  , we had   406   employees as compared to   376   employees at   September 30, 2015  . Additionally, included in general and administrative expense is equity compensation expense of   $5.6 million   and   $4.2 million   for the third quarter of 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
  DD A  . The   $6.1 million   decrease in depreciation, depletion and amortization period-over-period was primarily a result of a change in expense allocation related to our working interest in certain assets. Partially offsetting the decrease in depreciation, depletion and amortization was an increase in midstream assets being in service in the   third quarter of 2016   as compared to the   third quarter of 2015   and the related depreciation on those assets. 
  Other expense.   The   $10.4 million   increase in other expense period-over-period was primarily attributable to expenses associated with our natural gas marketing activities. 
  Interest expense  . The   $0.5 million   increase in interest expense period-over-period was a result of higher levels of average borrowings outstanding during the   third quarter of 2016   as compared to the   third quarter of 2015   in order to fund our capital programs. 
  
   47 

Gain on derivative instruments  . The   $183.9 million   gain on derivative contracts in the   third quarter of 2016   is comprised of cash receipts of   $40.9 million   on the settlement of maturing contracts and a   $143.0 million   unrealized gain in the   third quarter of 2016   due to the decrease in commodity prices as compared to our hedged prices. The   $127.1 million   gain on derivative contracts in the   third quarter of 2015   was comprised of   $47.8 million   of cash receipts on the settlement of maturing contracts and a   $79.3 million   unrealized gain. 
  Income tax (expense) benefit.   The   $61.3 million   increase in income tax expense period-over-period was attributable to an increase in taxable income, including an increase to income attributable to noncontrolling interests. 
  Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   Compared to   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015     
  Total operating revenues  . The   $128.8 million   increase in total operating revenues period-over-period was mainly a result of an increase in natural gas production for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , which was the result of increased drilling and completion activity, mainly in Washington County, Pennsylvania and Belmont County, Ohio. The impact of increased production volumes on operating revenues was partially offset by a decrease in realized prices. Our realized price for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   $1.99   per Mcf compared to   $2.27   per Mcf for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , in each case before the effect of hedges. Operating revenues were positively impacted by a   $38.7 million   increase in gathering, compression and water service revenues period-over-period. This increase primarily relates to increased third-party volumes and related revenues on existing gathering contracts. Additionally, the increase in other revenue of approximately   $20.9 million   was primarily driven by our natural gas marketing activities.  
  Lease operating  . The   $2.9 million   decrease in lease operating expenses period-over-period was primarily attributable to improved efficiencies relating to produced water recycling and reduced rental costs as a result of a reduced flowback period in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to the prior period. In addition, lease operating expense per unit of production decreased period-over-period due to improved operating efficiencies, primarily related to more producing wells per pad, lower rental and service costs and increased overall production. 
  Gathering, compression and transportation  . Gathering, compression and transportation expense for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   of   $84.9 million   is mainly comprised of   $73.0 million   of transportation contracts with third parties and $11.9 million of gathering charges from third parties. The   $29.4 million   increase in such expense was primarily attributable to increased firm transportation contracts in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . 
  Midstream operation and maintenance.   The   $7.3 million   increase in midstream operation and maintenance expense period-over-period was primarily due to an increase in on and off pad water transfer costs and water procurement, in addition to increased contract labor expenses. 
  Incentive unit expense (income).   Incentive unit expense decreased   $1.0 million   period-over-period. In the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , the   $45.9 million   expense consisted of $27.7 million of non-cash compensation expense related to the Rice Holdings incentive units and $26.7 million related to payments made to certain holders of NGP Holdings incentive units, offset by $8.6 million of non-cash income related to the quarterly fair market value adjustment for the NGP Holdings incentive units, which was largely driven by the decline in the Company s stock price at September 30, 2015. In the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the   $44.9 million   expense consisted of   $17.6 million   of non-cash compensation expense related to the Rice Holdings incentive units and   $27.3 million   of compensation expense related to a cumulative adjustment to equal the cumulative cash payment made by NGP Holdings to NGP Holdings incentive unitholders. No future expense will be recognized related to the NGP Holdings incentive units as a result of the April 2016 settlement of the remaining NGP Holdings incentive unit obligation. See  Item 1. Financial Statements Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 10. Incentive Units  for additional information. 
  General and administrative  . The   $10.4 million   increase in general and administrative expense period-over-period was primarily attributable to the addition of personnel to support our growth activities and related salary and employee benefits. At   September 30, 2016  , we had   406   employees as compared to   376   employees at   September 30, 2015  . Additionally, included in general and administrative expense is equity compensation expense of   $16.4 million   and   $11.7 million   in 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
  DD A  . The   $19.1 million   increase in depreciation, depletion and amortization period-over-period was primarily a result of an increase in production driven by a greater number of producing wells in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , which is consistent with our expanded drilling program. In addition, the increase was also the result of an increase in midstream assets being in service in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   and the related depreciation on those assets. 
  
   48 

Other expense.   The   $22.2 million   increase in other expense period-over-period was attributable to expenses associated with our natural gas marketing activities. 
  Interest expense  . The   $10.3 million   increase in interest expense period-over-period was a result of higher levels of average borrowings outstanding during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   as compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   in order to fund our capital programs. 
  Gain on derivative instruments  . The   $52.5 million   gain on derivative contracts in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   is comprised of cash receipts of   $172.4 million   on the settlement of maturing contracts, partially offset by a   $119.8 million   unrealized loss due to the increase in commodity prices as compared to our hedged prices. The   $184.7 million   gain on derivative contracts in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   was comprised of   $117.7 million   of cash receipts on the settlement of maturing contracts and a   $67.0 million   unrealized gain. 
  Income tax (expense) benefit.   The   $64.1 million   increase in the income tax benefit period-over-period was attributable to a   $90.1 million   pre-tax loss for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 
  Business Segment Results of Operations  
  As a result of changes to our operations and organizational structure in the first quarter of 2016, we now manage our business in three operating segments: Exploration and Production, Rice Midstream Holdings and Rice Midstream Partners. We evaluate our business segments based on their contribution to our consolidated results based on operating income. Please see  Item 1. Financial Statements Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 6. Financial Information by Business Segment  for a reconciliation of each segment s operating income to our consolidated operating income. All prior period results have been revised to reflect the new reporting segment structure. 
  The following tables set forth selected operating and financial data for each business segment during the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015  :  
  Exploration and Production     Segment  
  
   49 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016   Compared to   Three Months Ended September 30, 2015     
  Natural gas, oil and NGL sales.   The   $32.6 million   increase in natural gas sales was mainly a result of an increase in production in the   third quarter of 2016   compared to the   third quarter of 2015  , as discussed above. In addition to the impact of increased production volumes on operating revenues, our realized price increased from   $2.32   per Mcf in the   third quarter of 2015   to   $2.36   per Mcf in the   third quarter of 2016  , in each case before the effect of hedges.  
  Other revenue.   The increase in other revenue of approximately   $11.3 million   was primarily due to an increase in natural gas marketing activities.  
  Lease operating  . The   $0.3 million   decrease in lease operating expenses was primarily attributable to improved efficiencies relating to produced water recycling and reduced rental costs as a result of a reduced flowback period in the   third quarter of 2016  , as compared to the prior period.  
  Gathering, compression and transportation  . Gathering, compression and transportation expense of   $57.0 million   for the   third quarter of 2016   includes   $30.0 million   of affiliate and third party gathering fees and   $27.0 million   of transportation contracts with third parties. The   $15.3 million   increase in gathering, compression and transportation expenses was mainly due to increased volumes under the gathering agreements with the Rice Midstream Partners segment and the Rice Midstream Holdings segment, as well as increased firm transportation expense in the   third quarter of 2016   compared to the   third quarter of 2015  . 
  General and administrative  . The   $1.6 million   decrease in segment general and administrative expense period-over-period is attributable to a decrease in allocated costs associated with personnel and administrative expenses as the Rice Midstream Holdings segment and Rice Midstream Partners segment continue to grow. Included in general and administrative expense is  
  
   50 

stock compensation expense of   $3.7 million   and   $2.7 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  DD A  . The   $4.7 million   decrease in depreciation, depletion and amortization period-over-period was a result of a change in expense allocation related to our working interest in certain assets. 
  Other expense.   The   $10.1 million   increase in other expense period-over-period was primarily attributable to expenses associated with our natural gas marketing activities. 
  Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016   Compared to   Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015    
  Natural gas, oil and NGL sales  . The   $69.5 million   increase in natural gas, oil and NGL sales was mainly a result of an increase in production in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , as discussed above. The impact of increased production volumes on operating revenues was partially offset by a decrease in realized prices. Our realized price for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   $1.99   per Mcf compared to   $2.27   per Mcf in the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , in each case before the effect of hedges. 
  Other revenue.   The increase in other revenue of approximately   $20.9 million   was primarily due to an increase in our natural gas marketing activities. 
  Lease operating  . The   $2.9 million   decrease in lease operating expenses period-over-period was primarily attributable to improved efficiencies relating to produced water recycling and reduced rental costs as a result of a reduced flowback period in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , as compared to the prior period. 
  Gathering, compression and transportation  . Gathering, compression and transportation expense of   $156.5 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   includes   $83.5 million   of affiliate and third party gathering fees and   $73.0 million   of transportation contracts with third parties. The   $54.4 million   increase in gathering, compression and transportation expenses was mainly due to increased volumes under the gathering agreements with the Rice Midstream Partners segment and the Rice Midstream Holdings segment, as well as increased firm transportation expense in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . 
  General and administrative  . The   $1.4 million   decrease in segment general and administrative expense period-over-period was primarily attributable to a decrease in allocated costs associated with personnel and administrative expenses as the Rice Midstream Holdings segment and Rice Midstream Partners segment continue to grow. Included in general and administrative expense is stock compensation expense of   $9.5 million   and   $7.9 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  DD A  . The   $17.5 million   increase in depreciation, depletion and amortization period-over-period was a result of an increase in production due to a greater number of producing wells in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , which is consistent with our expanded drilling program. 
  Other expense.   The   $22.6 million   increase in other expense period-over-period was primarily attributable to expenses associated with our natural gas marketing activities.

  Capital Resources and Liquidity 
  Our primary sources of liquidity have been the proceeds from equity and debt financings and borrowings under our credit facilities. Our primary use of capital has been the acquisition and development of natural gas properties and associated midstream infrastructure. As we pursue reserve and production growth, we monitor which capital resources, including equity and debt financings, are available to us to meet our future financial obligations, planned capital expenditure activities and liquidity requirements. We also expect to fund a portion of these requirements with cash flow from operations as we continue to bring additional upstream and midstream production online.  
  Our and RMP s credit ratings are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time. We and RMP cannot ensure that a rating will remain in effect for or will not be lowered for any given period of time. If our credit ratings are downgraded, we and RMP may be required to provide additional credit assurances in support of certain commercial agreements, such as pipeline capacity and construction contracts, the amount of which may be significant, and the potential pool of investors and funding sources may decrease. 
  Cash Flow Provided by Operating Activities 
  Net cash provided by operating activities was   $380.4 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   $270.4 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The increase in operating cash flow was primarily due to an increase in cash receipts on settled derivatives and production, partially offset by an increase in cash operating expenses. 
  Cash Flow Used in Investing Activities 
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , cash flows used in investing activities of   $960.2 million   primarily consisted of   $681.7 million   for capital expenditures for property and equipment and $270.0 million of cash in escrow related to the Vantage Acquisition, as compared to the   $909.7 million   of cash flows used in investing activities for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   with   $919.9 million   related to capital expenditures for property and equipment, offset by approximately $10.0 million in proceeds from the sale of gas properties. 
  Capital expenditures for the Exploration and Production segment were   $535.2 million   and   $638.5 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The decrease of   $103.4 million   was primarily attributable to a decrease in the acquisition and development of our natural gas properties. 
  
   54 

Capital expenditures for the Rice Midstream Holdings segment totaled   $86.0 million   and   $125.0 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The decrease of   $39.0 million   was attributable to a decrease in capital expenditures for Rice Olympus Midstream LLC s midstream infrastructure, offset by an increase in capital expenditures for Strike Force Midstream LLC s midstream infrastructure. 
  Capital expenditures for the Rice Midstream Partners segment totaled   $97.7 million   and   $178.1 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The decrease of   $80.4 million   was attributable to a decrease in the capital expenditures related to the Rice Midstream Partners segment s water services assets, offset by increases in capital expenditures for compression assets. 
  Cash Flow Provided by Financing Activities 
  Net cash provided by financing activities of   $1,701.0 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was primarily the result of the proceeds from the September 2016 and the April 2016 equity offerings, proceeds from the Partnership s June 2016 equity offering and proceeds from the Partnership s ATM program, offset by net repayments on our revolving credit facilities, and distributions to the Partnership s public unitholders. Net cash provided by financing activities of   $599.3 million   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2015   was primarily the result of proceeds from our 2023 Notes offering (discussed below) and borrowings on the Midstream Holdings Revolving Credit Facility (defined below) and the RMP Revolving Credit Facility (defined below), offset by distributions to the Partnership s public unitholders. 
  Debt Agreements 
  Senior Notes

Midstream Holdings used approximately $75.0 million of the proceeds to repay borrowings under its revolving credit facility and to pay transaction fees and expenses, and the remaining $300.0 million was distributed to us to fund a portion of our 2016 development program in the cores of the Marcellus and Utica Shales. In addition, Midstream Holdings may require EIG to make an additional $125.0 million commitment (subject to designated drawing conditions precedent) for a period of 18 months. 
  April 2016 Equity Offering 
  On April 15, 2016, we completed a public offering of   29,858,891   shares of common stock at   $16.35   per share, which included   20,000,000   shares sold by the Company and   9,858,891   shares sold by NGP Rice Holdings LLC ( NGP Holdings ). On April 21, 2016, NGP Holdings sold an additional 4,478,834 shares of common stock pursuant to the exercise of the underwriter s option to purchase additional shares. After deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of   $15.0 million   and transaction costs, we received net proceeds of   $311.8 million  . We received no proceeds from the sale of shares by NGP Holdings. We intend to use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes, which may include funding a portion of our 2017 capital budget.  
  September 2016 Equity Offering 
  On September 30, 2016, we issued and completed a public offering (the  September 2016 Equity Offering ) of an aggregate of   40,000,000   shares of common stock at a price to the public of   $25.50   per share. On October 11, 2016, we sold an additional   6,000,000   shares of common stock pursuant to the exercise of the underwriters  option to purchase additional shares of common stock in connection with the September 2016 Equity Offering. After deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of approximately   $17.9 million   and transaction costs, we received net proceeds of approximately   $1.2 billion  . We used the net proceeds from the offering to fund a portion of the Vantage Acquisition. We will use any remaining proceeds for general corporate purposes. See Note 16 for additional information. 
  Private Placement 
  On October 7, 2016, the Partnership issued   20,930,233   common units representing limited partner interests in the Partnership in a private placement for gross proceeds of approximately   $450.0   million, or $  21.50   per unit (the  Private Placement ). The Partnership primarily used the proceeds of the Private Placement to fund a portion of the Vantage Midstream Asset Acquisition associated with the Vantage Acquisition. The Private Placement closed on October 7, 2016. As a result of the Private Placement, GP Holdings owns approximately 28% of the Partnership, consisting of 3,623 common units, 28,753,623 subordinated units and all of the incentive distribution rights.  
   
  Commodity Hedging Activities  
  Our primary market risk exposure is in the prices we receive for our natural gas production. Realized pricing is primarily driven by the spot regional market prices applicable to our U.S. natural gas production. Pricing for natural gas production has been volatile and unpredictable for several years, and we expect this volatility to continue in the future. The prices we receive for production depend on many factors outside of our control, including volatility in the differences between product prices at sales points and the applicable index price. 
  To mitigate the potential negative impact on our cash flow caused by changes in oil and natural gas prices, we have entered into financial commodity derivative contracts in the form of swaps, zero cost collars, calls, puts and basis swaps to ensure that we receive minimum prices for a portion of our future oil and natural gas production when management believes that favorable future prices can be secured. We typically hedge the NYMEX Henry Hub price for natural gas. Pursuant to our Amended Credit Agreement, we are now permitted to hedge the greater of (i) the percentage of proved reserve volumes (Column A) or (ii) the percentage of internally forecasted production (Column B). 

Our hedging activities are intended to support natural gas prices at targeted levels and to manage our exposure to natural gas price fluctuations. The counterparty is required to make a payment to us for the difference between the floor price specified in the contract and the settlement price, which is based on market prices on the settlement date, if the settlement price is below the floor price. We are required to make a payment to the counterparty for the difference between the ceiling price and the settlement price if the ceiling price is below the settlement price. These contracts may include price swaps whereby we will receive a fixed price for our production and pay a variable market price to the contract counterparty and zero cost collars that set a floor and ceiling price for the hedged production. For a description of our commodity derivative contracts, please see  Item 1. Financial Statements Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 4. Derivative Instruments and 5. Fair Value of Financial Instruments  included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report. 
   
  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  
  The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The application of our critical accounting policies may require management to make judgments and estimates about the amounts reflected in the condensed consolidated financial statements. Management uses historical experience and all available information to make these estimates and judgments. Different amounts could be reported using different assumptions and estimates. Our critical accounting policies are described in  Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  in our   2015   Annual Report in addition to the discussion included herein. Any new accounting policies or updates to existing accounting policies as a result of new accounting pronouncements have been included in the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements contained in this Quarterly Report.  
  On a quarterly basis in accordance with ASC 360, we perform a qualitative assessment of whether events or changes in circumstances exist that could be indicators that the carrying amount of proved properties may not be recoverable. Based on our quarterly qualitative assessment, we have not become aware of indicators of impairment which would require us to estimate undiscounted future cash flows compared to the carrying value of our proved properties on an interim basis. As a result, we have not recognized any impairment losses during the three month period ended   September 30, 2016  . Current future commodity prices  
  continue to support the recoverability of our proved properties; however, we are unable to predict commodity prices with any greater precision than the futures market. Reductions in commodity prices within the futures market could trigger an impairment of proved natural gas properties in the future.  
   
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined by the SEC. In the ordinary course of business, we enter into various commitment agreements and other contractual obligations, some of which are not recognized in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. See  Item 1. Financial Statements 7. Commitments and Contingencies  for a description of our commitments and contingencies. 

58 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk  
  The primary objective of the following information is to provide forward-looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risk. The term  market risk  refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in oil and natural gas prices and interest rates. The disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses, but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses. This forward-looking information provides indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market risk exposures. All of our market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for hedging purposes, rather than for speculative trading. 
  Commodity price risk and hedges 
  Our primary market risk exposure is in the price we receive for our natural gas production. Realized pricing is primarily driven by market prices applicable to our U.S. natural gas production. Pricing for natural gas production has been volatile and unpredictable for several years, and we expect this volatility to continue in the future. The prices we receive for production depend on many factors outside of our control, including volatility in the differences between product prices at sales points and the applicable index price. 
  To mitigate some of the potential negative impact on our cash flow caused by changes in commodity prices, we enter into financial commodity swap contracts to receive fixed prices for a portion of our natural gas production to mitigate the potential negative impact on our cash flow.  
  Our financial hedging activities are intended to support natural gas prices at targeted levels and to manage our exposure to natural gas price fluctuations. The counterparty is required to make a payment to us for the difference between the fixed price and the settlement price if the settlement price is below the fixed price. We are required to make a payment to the counterparty for the difference between the fixed price and the settlement price if the fixed price is below the settlement price. These contracts may include financial price swaps whereby we will receive a fixed price for our production and pay a variable market price to the contract counterparty, cashless price collars that set a floor and ceiling price for the hedged production, or basis differential swaps. If the applicable monthly price indices are outside of the ranges set by the floor and ceiling prices in the various collars, we and the counterparty to the collars would be required to settle the difference.  
  As of September 30, 2016  , we have entered into derivative instruments with various financial institutions, fixing the price we receive for a portion of our natural gas through   December 31, 2020  . Our commodity hedge position as of   September 30, 2016   is summarized in Note 5 to our condensed consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in the Quarterly Report. Our financial hedging activities are intended to support natural gas prices at targeted levels and to manage our exposure to price fluctuations.  
  By removing price volatility from a portion of our expected natural gas production through   December 31, 2020  , we have mitigated, but not eliminated, the potential effects of changing prices on our operating cash flow for those periods. While mitigating negative effects of falling commodity prices, these derivative contracts also limit the benefits we would receive from increases in commodity prices above the hedge prices. 
  Interest rate risks  
  Our primary interest rate risk exposure results from our credit facilities. 
  As of September 30, 2016  , we had   zero   borrowings and approximately   $220.4 million   in letters of credit outstanding under our Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility.   As of September 30, 2016  , we had availability under the borrowing base of our Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility of approximately   $529.6 million   and the borrowing base was   $875.0 million   (with a   $750.0 million   lender commitment amount). Following the effectiveness of the Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, Eurodollar loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus an applicable margin ranging from   225   to   325   basis points, depending on the percentage of our borrowing base utilized. Base rate loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the greatest of (i) the agent bank s reference rate, (ii) the federal funds effective rate plus   50   basis points and (iii) the rate for one month Eurodollar loans plus   100   basis points, plus an applicable margin ranging from   125   to   225   basis points, depending on the percentage of our borrowing base utilized.  
  As of September 30, 2016  ,     Midstream Holdings     had     $34.0 million     of borrowings and     no     letters of credit outstanding under the     Midstream Holdings Revolving Credit Facility.   Under the revolving credit facility,     Midstream Holdings may elect to borrow in Eurodollars or at the base rate. Eurodollar loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the applicable LIBOR Rate plus an applicable margin ranging from   225   to   300   basis points, depending on the leverage ratio then in effect. Base rate loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the greatest of (i) the agent bank s reference rate, (ii) the federal funds effective rate plus   50    
  
   59 

basis points and (iii) the rate for one month Eurodollar loans plus   100   basis points, plus an applicable margin ranging from   125   to   200   basis points, depending on the leverage ratio then in effect. 
  The average annual weighted average interest rate incurred on the Midstream Holdings Revolving Credit Facility during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was approximately   4.2%  . A 1.0% increase in the applicable average interest rates for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   would have resulted in an estimated   $0.2 million   increase in interest expense. 
  As of September 30, 2016  ,     Rice Midstream OpCo     had     no     borrowings and     no     letters of credit outstanding under the     RMP Revolving Credit Facility.   Under the RMP Revolving Credit Facility,     Rice Midstream OpCo may elect to borrow in Eurodollars or at the base rate. Following the effectiveness of the Second Amendment, Eurodollar loans will bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the applicable LIBOR Rate plus an applicable margin ranging from   200   to   300   basis points, depending on the leverage ratio then in effect, and base rate loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the greatest of (i) the agent bank s reference rate, (ii) the federal funds effective rate plus   50   basis points and (iii) the rate for one month Eurodollar loans plus   100   basis points, plus an applicable margin ranging from   100   to   200   basis points, depending on the leverage ratio then in effect. Following the effectiveness of the Second Amendment, Rice Midstream OpCo also pays a commitment fee based on the undrawn commitment amount ranging from   37.5   to   50   basis points.   
  The average annual weighted average interest rate incurred on the RMP Revolving Credit Facility during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was approximately   3.3%  . A 1.0% increase in the applicable average interest rates for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   would have resulted in a   $0.7 million   estimated increase in interest expense. 
  As of September 30, 2016  , we did not have any derivatives in place to mitigate the effects of interest rate risk. We may implement an interest rate hedging strategy in the future. 
  Counterparty and customer credit risk 
  Our principal exposures to credit risk are through joint interest receivables (  $61.8 million   in receivables   as of September 30, 2016  ) and the sale of our natural gas production (  $82.9 million   in receivables   as of September 30, 2016  ), which we market to multiple natural gas marketing companies. Joint interest receivables arise from billing entities who own partial interest in the wells we operate. These entities participate in our wells primarily based on their ownership in leases on which we wish to drill. We have minimal ability to choose who participates in our wells. We are also subject to credit risk with   three   natural gas marketing companies that hold a significant portion of our natural gas receivables. We do not require our customers to post collateral. The inability or failure of our significant customers to meet their obligations to us or their insolvency or liquidation may adversely affect our financial results. 
  By using derivative instruments to hedge exposures to changes in commodity prices, we expose ourselves to the credit risk of our counterparties. Credit risk is the potential failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the derivative contract. When the fair value of a derivative contract is positive, the counterparty is expected to owe us, which creates credit risk. To minimize the credit risk in derivative instruments, it is our policy to enter into derivative contracts only with counterparties that are creditworthy financial institutions deemed by management as competent and competitive market makers. The creditworthiness of our counterparties is subject to review annually, or on an as-needed basis. We have derivative instruments in place with six different counterparties.   As of September 30, 2016  , our contracts with Barclays Bank PLC and Bank of Montreal accounted for   21%   and   20%   of the net fair market value of our derivative assets, respectively. We believe these counterparties are acceptable credit risks. We are not required to post letters of credit as collateral to Bank of Montreal, Wells Fargo Bank N.A., Citibank N.A. and Barclays Bank PLC under current contracts, nor are they required to provide credit support or collateral to us.   As of September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we did not have any past due receivables from counterparties. 

60 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures  
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   
  As required by Rule 13a-15(b) under the Exchange Act, we have evaluated, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of   September 30, 2016  . Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and to ensure that the information we are required to disclose in the reports we file and submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based upon that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of   September 30, 2016  .  
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   
  As disclosed in Note 16, subsequent to September 30, 2016, the Company completed the acquisition of Vantage. We are in the process of integrating these businesses. We are analyzing, evaluating and, where necessary, implementing changes in controls and procedures relating to Vantage as the integration proceeds. As such, this process may result in additions or changes to our internal control over financial reporting. Otherwise, there were no changes in our  internal control over financial reporting  (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

61 

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 
   
  Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
  We are party to various legal and/or regulatory proceedings from time to time arising in the ordinary course of business. While the ultimate outcome and impact to us cannot be predicted with certainty, we believe that all such matters are without merit and involve amounts which, if resolved unfavorably, either individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. When we determine that a loss is probable of occurring and is reasonably estimable, we accrue an undiscounted liability for such contingencies based on our best estimate using information available at the time. We disclose contingencies where an adverse outcome may be material, or in the judgment of management, the matter should otherwise be disclosed. 
  We are currently negotiating a settlement with the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection ( DEP ) relating to civil penalties for certain Notices of Violations received from December 2011 through April 2016 under the Clean Streams Law, the 2012 Oil and Gas Act, the Solid Waste Management Act, and the Dam Safety and Encroachments Act. As of September 30, 2016, we have accrued   $3.6 million   for contingencies associated with these settlement negotiations with the DEP. 
   
  Item 1A. Risk Factors   
  Our business faces many risks. Any of the risks discussed elsewhere in this Quarterly Report and our other SEC filings could have a material impact on our business, financial position or results of operations. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business operations.  
  For a discussion of our potential risks and uncertainties, see the risk factors below and the information in  Item 1A. Risk Factors  in our 2015 Annual Report. 
  We may be unable to successfully integrate Vantage s operations or to realize anticipated cost savings, revenues or other benefits of the Vantage Acquisition. 
  Our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the Vantage Acquisition will depend in part upon whether we can integrate Vantage s assets and operations into our existing businesses in an efficient and effective manner. We may not be able to accomplish this integration process successfully. The successful acquisition of producing properties, including those acquired from Vantage, requires an assessment of several factors, including: 
             
    recoverable reserves; 
                
    future natural gas and oil prices and their appropriate differentials; 
                
    availability and cost of transportation of production to markets; 
                
    availability and cost of drilling equipment and of skilled personnel; 
                
    development and operating costs and potential environmental and other liabilities; and 
                
    regulatory, permitting and similar matters. 
     The accuracy of these assessments is inherently uncertain. In connection with these assessments, we have performed a review of the subject properties that we believe to be generally consistent with industry practices. Our review may not reveal all existing or potential problems or permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their deficiencies and potential recoverable reserves. Inspections will not always be performed on every well, and environmental problems are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken. Even when problems are identified, the seller may be unwilling or unable to provide effective contractual protection against all or a portion of the underlying deficiencies. As is the case with the Vantage Acquisition, we are often not entitled to contractual indemnification for environmental liabilities and acquire properties on an  as is  basis, and, as is the case with certain liabilities associated with the assets to be acquired, we are entitled to indemnification for only certain environmental liabilities. The integration process may be subject to delays or changed circumstances, and we can give no assurance that the acquired properties will perform in accordance with our expectations or that our expectations with respect to integration or cost savings as a result of the Vantage Acquisition will materialize. Significant acquisitions, including the Vantage Acquisition, and other strategic transactions may involve other risks that may cause our business to suffer, including: 
             
    diversion of our management s attention to evaluating, negotiating and integrating significant acquisitions and strategic transactions; 
     
   62 

the challenge and cost of integrating acquired operations, information management and other technology systems and business cultures with those of ours while carrying on our ongoing business; and 
                
    the failure to realize the full benefit that we expect in estimated proved reserves, production volume, cost savings from operating synergies or other benefits anticipated from an acquisition, or to realize these benefits within the expected time frame. 
     We will incur significant transaction and acquisition-related costs in connection with the Vantage Acquisition. 
  We expect to incur significant costs associated with the Vantage Acquisition and combining the operations of the two companies. The substantial majority of the expenses resulting from the Vantage Acquisition will be composed of transaction costs related to the Vantage Acquisition and business integration and employment-related costs. We may also incur transaction fees and costs related to formulating integration plans. Additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of the two companies  businesses. Although we expect that the elimination of duplicative costs, as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses, should allow us to offset incremental transaction and acquisition-related costs over time, this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term, or at all. 
  We are a holding company. Our sole material asset is our equity interest in Rice Energy Operating and we are accordingly dependent upon distributions from Rice Energy Operating to pay taxes and to cover our corporate and other overhead expenses. 
  Following the Vantage Acquisition, we are a holding company and have no material assets other than our equity interest in Rice Energy Operating. We have no independent means of generating revenue. To the extent Rice Energy Operating has distributable cash, we intend to cause Rice Energy Operating to make pro rata distributions to its members, including us, in an amount at least sufficient to allow each member to pay any taxes it incurs as a result of income allocated to such member by Rice Energy Operating, and we also intend to cause Rice Energy Operating to reimburse us for our corporate and other overhead expenses. We may be limited, however, in our ability to cause Rice Energy Operating and its subsidiaries to make these and other distributions and payments to us due to restrictions under our credit facilities. To the extent that we need funds and Rice Energy Operating or its subsidiaries are restricted from making such distributions under applicable law or regulation or under the terms of their financing arrangements, or are otherwise unable to provide such funds, it could materially adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition. 
  Recent decisions by the Ohio Supreme Court interpreting the Ohio Dormant Mineral Act relating to preservation of mineral rights by surface owners could require certain curative efforts to vest title in a portion of the Company s leasehold acreage, increase its leasehold expenses, subject it to payment of additional royalties and/or result in the loss of some of its leasehold acreage in Ohio. 
  On September 15, 2016, the Ohio Supreme Court issued a series of decisions relating to the Ohio Dormant Mineral Act (the  ODMA ). In the lead case, Corban v. Chesapeake Exploration L.L.C., the court concluded that the 1989 version of the ODMA did not transfer ownership of dormant mineral rights automatically, by operation of law. Instead, prior to 2006, surface owners were required to bring a quiet title action in order to establish abandonment of mineral rights. After June 30, 2006 (the effective date of the 2006 version of the ODMA), surface owners are required to follow the statutory notice and recording procedures enacted in 2006. The Company is assessing the impact of these recent decisions on its operations in Ohio where a portion of its acreage and its producing properties are located. However, the Ohio Supreme Court decisions could require certain curative efforts to vest title in a portion of the Company s leasehold acreage, increase its leasehold expenses, subject it to payment of additional royalties and/or result in the loss of some of its leasehold acreage in Ohio, any of which could have an adverse effect on the Company s results of operations and financial condition.
