Note 1   Basis of Presentation 

The accompanying condensed (a) consolidated
balance sheet as of December 31, 2015, which has been derived from audited consolidated financial statements, and (b) the unaudited
interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared and, in the opinion of management, contain all the adjustments
(consisting of those of a normal recurring nature) considered necessary to present fairly the consolidated financial position and
the consolidated statements of comprehensive income and consolidated cash flows for the periods presented in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles for interim consolidated financial information and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of
Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. Operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily
indicative of the results that may be expected for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2016. It is suggested that these condensed
consolidated financial statements be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included
in the Company s annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. 

Principles of consolidation and nature
of operations: 

The condensed consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of CTI Industries Corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, CTI Balloons Limited and CTI
Supply, Inc., its majority-owned subsidiaries, Flexo Universal, S. de R.L. de C.V. and CTI Europe gmbH, as well as the
accounts of Venture Leasing S. A. de R. L., Venture Leasing L.L.C and Clever Container Company, L.L.C. (the
 Company ). The last three entities have been consolidated as variable interest entities. All significant
intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company (i) designs, manufactures and
distributes balloon products throughout the world, (ii) operates systems for the production, lamination, coating and printing
of films used for food packaging and other commercial uses and for conversion of films to flexible packaging containers and
other products, and (iii) distributes vacuum sealing products and home organization products in the United States. 

Variable
Interest Entities ( VIE s ):  

The determination of whether or not to
consolidate a variable interest entity under U.S. GAAP requires a significant amount of judgment concerning the degree of control
over an entity by its holders of variable interest. To make these judgments, management has conducted an analysis of the relationship
of the holders of variable interest to each other, the design of the entity, the expected operations of the entity, which holder
of variable interests is most  closely associated  to the entity and which holder of variable interests is the primary
beneficiary required to consolidate the entity. Upon the occurrence of certain events, management reviews and reconsiders its previous
conclusion regarding the status of an entity as a variable interest entity. There are three entities that have been consolidated
as variable interest entities. 

Use of estimates: 

In preparing condensed consolidated financial
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, management makes estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at
the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amount of revenue and expenses during the reporting
period in the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results may differ from those estimates.
The Company s significant estimates include reserves for doubtful accounts, reserves for the lower of cost or market of inventory,
reserves for deferred tax assets and recovery value of goodwill. 

Earnings per share: 

Basic earnings per share is computed by
dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each period. 

Diluted earnings per share is computed
by dividing the net income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock and equivalents (stock options and warrants),
unless anti-dilutive, during each period. 

As of September 30, 2016 and 2015, shares
to be issued upon the exercise of options and warrants aggregated 288,048 and 343,548, respectively. The number of anti-dilutive
shares (not included in the determination of earnings on a diluted basis) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015 were 0 and 174,000, respectively, all of which were represented by options. 

Significant Accounting Policies: 

The Company s significant accounting
policies are summarized in Note 2 of the Company s consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015.
There were no significant changes to these accounting policies during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

Reclassification: 

Certain 2015 amounts have been reclassified
to conform to the 2016 presentation. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements: 

In 2014, the FASB issued guidance on revenue
recognition, which provides for a single five-step model to be applied to all revenue contracts with customers. The guidance also
requires additional financial statement disclosures that will enable users to understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty
of revenue and cash flows relating to customer contracts. The guidance provides an option to use either a retrospective approach
or a cumulative effect adjustment approach to implement the guidance. In 2015, the FASB issued a deferral of the effective date
of the guidance to 2018, with early adoption permitted in 2017. In 2016, the FASB issued final amendments clarifying the implementation
guidance for principal versus agent considerations, identifying performance obligations and the accounting of intellectual property
licenses. In addition, the FASB introduced practical expedients related to disclosures of remaining performance obligations, as
well as other amendments to guidance on collectibility, non-cash consideration and the presentation of sales and other similar
taxes. We are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on our financial statements and the timing of adoption, and have
not yet selected a transition approach. 

In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No.
2015-03,  Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Cost  . The ASU requires debt issuance costs associated with a recognized
debt liability to be presented on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the corresponding debt liability.
This new guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption
permitted. An entity should apply the new guidance on a retrospective basis. We adopted this ASU effective with the first quarter
of fiscal year 2016. The adoption of this accounting standard update did not have a material impact to our consolidated financial
statements. 

In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11,
 Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory  . Under this ASU, inventory will be measured at the  lower of cost and net
realizable value  and options that currently exist for  market value  will be eliminated. The ASU defines net
realizable value as the  estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of
completion, disposal, and transportation.  No other changes were made to the current guidance on inventory measurement. ASU
2015-11 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early application is permitted and should
be applied prospectively. We do not expect the adoption of this accounting standard update to have a material impact on our consolidated
financial statements. 

In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17,
 Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes  , to eliminate the current requirements to classify deferred income tax assets
and liabilities between current and noncurrent. To simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes, the amendments in this update
require that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. For
public business entities, the amendments in this update are effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning
after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Earlier application is permitted for all entities as
of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. We are continuing to evaluate the impact of ASU 2015-17 on our consolidated
financial statements. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,
 Leases   (  Topic 842), aimed at making leasing activities more transparent and comparable. The new standard requires
substantially all leases be recognized by lessees on their balance sheet as a right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability,
including today s operating leases. For public business entities, the standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years, although early adoption is allowed. For all other entities,
the standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2020. Early application is permitted for all entities. We are continuing to evaluate the impact of ASU 2016-02
on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 

On March 30, 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Updated
No. 2016-09,  Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting 
( ASU 2016-09 ). Among other things, ASU 2016-09 requires that entities recognize tax benefits and deficiencies related
to employee share-based payment transactions as income tax expense or benefit. ASU 2016-09 also eliminates the requirement to reclassify
excess tax benefits and deficiencies from operating activities to financing activities in the statement of cash flows. The guidance
is effective for the annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company
does not expect the adoption of this standard to have any impact on the Company s consolidated
financial statements. 

On August 26, 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update
No. 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230) , a consensus of the FASB s Emerging Issues Task Force ( ASU
2016-15 ). The new guidance amends Accounting Standards Codification No. 230 ( ASC 230 ) to add or clarify guidance
on the classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows. ASC 230 lacks consistent principles
for evaluating the classification of cash payments and receipts in the statement of cash flows. This has led to diversity in practice
and, in certain circumstances, financial statement restatements. Therefore, the FASB issued the ASU 2016-15 with the intent of
reducing diversity in practice with respect to eight types of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 is effective for annual and interim periods
in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and is effective for the Company for the year ending December 31, 2017. The
Company is currently evaluating the impact that the implementation of this standard will have on the Company s consolidated
financial
statements. 

Note 2   Stock-Based Compensation; Changes
in Equity  

The Company has adopted Financial Accounting
Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 718 which requires all share-based
payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the condensed consolidated financial statements
based on their grant-date fair values. 

The Company has applied the Black-Scholes
model to value stock-based awards and issued warrants related to notes payable. That model incorporates various assumptions in
the valuation of stock-based awards relating to the risk-free rate of interest to be applied, the estimated dividend yield and
expected volatility of our common stock. The risk-free rate of interest is the related U.S. Treasury yield curve for periods within
the expected term of the option at the time of grant. The dividend yield on our common stock is estimated to be 0%, as the Company
did not issue dividends during 2016 and 2015. The expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the Company s
common stock. 

The Company s net loss for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 and net income in 2015 includes approximately $5,000 and $7,000, respectively, of compensation
costs related to share based payments. The Company s net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and net income
in 2015 includes approximately $29,000 and $25,000, respectively, of compensation costs related to share based payments. As of
September 30, 2016 there is $31,000 of unrecognized compensation expense related to non-vested stock option grants and stock grants.
We expect approximately $5,000 of additional stock-based compensation expense to be recognized over the remainder of 2016, $15,000
to be recognized during 2017, $7,000 to be recognized during 2018, $3,000 to be recognized during 2019 and $1,000 to be recognized
during 2020. 

As of September 30, 2016, the Company had
three stock-based compensation plans pursuant to which stock options were, or may be, granted. The Plans provide for the award
of options, which may either be incentive stock options ( ISOs ) within the meaning of Section 422A of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the  Code ) or non-qualified options ( NQOs ) which are not subject to
special tax treatment under the Code, as well as for stock grants. 

On April 10, 2009, the Board of
Directors approved for adoption, and on June 5, 2009, the shareholders of the Corporation approved, a 2009 Stock Incentive
Plan ( 2009 Plan ). The 2009 Plan authorizes the issuance of up to 250,000 shares of stock or options to purchase
stock of the Company (including cancelled shares reissued under the plan.) As of September 30, 2016, options for 250,000
shares had been granted and options for 148,000 shares remain outstanding. 

A summary of the Company s stock
option activity and related information is as follows: 

On July 17, 2012, the Company
entered into a Note and Warrant Purchase Agreement with BMO Private Equity (U.S.), Inc. ( BMO Equity ) pursuant
to which (i) BMO Equity advanced to the Company the sum of $5 million and (ii) the Company issued to BMO Equity a warrant to
purchase up to Four Percent (4%) of the outstanding shares of common stock of the Company on a fully-diluted basis (140,048
shares of common stock of the Company) at the price of One Cent ($0.01) per share. The term of the loan provided for in this
Agreement is five and a half years. Interest is payable on the outstanding balance of the loan at the rate of 11.5% per
annum. As of September 30, 2016, the Company was in compliance with all of the financial covenants under the Note and Warrant Purchase Agreement. 

On July 29, 2016, the Company and certain
accredited investors entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement wherein the investors purchased 152,850 shares of common stock
of the Company at a price of $6.00 per share. As additional consideration for the purchases of the shares in the offering, each
investor received, with each share of common stock purchased, one-half of a warrant, with one warrant entitling the investor to
purchase one share of the Company s common stock at the price of $7.00. The warrants are exercisable between six months and
three years from the investment date. As a result of the completion of the sale under the Purchase Agreement, warrants to purchase
76,425 shares of common stock at $7.00 per share were issued. 

In addition to the Purchase Agreement,
the Company and each of the investors entered into a Registration Rights Agreement pursuant to which the Company agreed to file
a Registration Statement with the SEC to register the common stock sold to the investors. 

A summary of the Company s stock
warrant activity and related information is as follows: 

A summary of the Company s stock option activity by grant
date as of September 30, 2016 is as follows: 

The aggregate intrinsic value in the tables
above represents the total pre-tax intrinsic value (the difference between the closing price of the Company s common stock
on the last trading day of the quarter ended September 30, 2016 and the exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money
options) that would have been received by the option holders had all the holders exercised their options on September 30, 2016. 

Note 3   Legal Proceedings  

The Company is party to certain claims
or actions arising in the normal course of business. The ultimate outcome of these matters is unknown but, in the opinion of management,
the resolution of these matters is not expected to have a significant effect on the future financial position or results of operations
of the Company. 

Note  4   Other Comprehensive Loss  

In the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 the company
incurred other comprehensive losses of $236,000 and $840,000, respectively, all from foreign currency translation adjustments. 

The following table sets forth the accumulated
balance of other comprehensive loss and each component. 

Note
5   Inventories, Net  

Note 6   Geographic Segment Data  

The Company has determined that it operates
primarily in one business segment that designs, manufactures and distributes film and film related products for use in packaging,
storage and novelty balloon products. The Company operates in foreign and domestic regions. Information about the Company s operations
by geographic area is as follows: 

Note 7   Concentration of Credit Risk  

Concentration of credit risk with respect
to trade accounts receivable is generally limited due to the large number of entities comprising the Company s customer base. The
Company performs ongoing credit evaluations and provides an allowance for potential credit losses against the portion of accounts
receivable which is estimated to be uncollectible. Such losses have historically been within management s expectations. During
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, there were two customers whose purchases represented more than 10%
of the Company s consolidated net sales, respectively. Sales to these customers for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015 are as follows: 

As of September 30, 2016, the total amounts
owed to the Company by these customers were approximately $1,411,000 or 13.9%, and $2,653,000 or 26.1%, of the Company s
consolidated net accounts receivable, respectively. The amounts owed at September 30, 2015 by these customers were approximately
$1,957,000 or 19.3%, and $1,972,000 or 19.5% of the Company s consolidated net accounts receivable, respectively.

Results of Operations  

Net Sales . For the three months
ended September 30, 2016, net sales were $13,476,000 compared to net sales of $14,881,000 for the same period of 2015, a decrease
of 9.4%. For the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, net sales by product category were as follows: 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, net sales were
$42,832,000 compared to net sales of $43,477,000 for the same period of 2015, a decrease of 1.5%. For the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, net sales by product category were as follows: 

Foil Balloons . During
the three months ended September 30, 2016, revenues from the sale of foil balloons increased by 17.6% compared to the prior
year period from $5,253,000 to $6,178,000. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, revenues from the sale of
foil balloons increased by 10.4% compared to the prior year period from $18,607,000 to $20,540,000. During the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, foil balloon sales to our largest customer increased to $11,825,000 from $11,335,000 for the same
period last year. Sales of foil balloons to other customers increased by 19.8% to $8,715,000 from $7,272,000 for the same
period last year. These sales to various customers include sales in the United States, Mexico, the United Kingdom and
Europe. 

Latex Balloons.  During the
three months ended September 30, 2016, revenues from the sale of latex balloons decreased by 28.2% compared to the prior year
period from $2,613,000 to $1,875,000. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, revenues from the sale of latex
balloons decreased by 14.4% compared to the prior year period from $7,221,000 to $6,182,000. The decline in sales is
attributable principally to (i) the reduced Dollar value of sales denominated in the Mexican Peso during those periods due to
the decline of the Peso in relation to the Dollar, (ii) a reduction in sales to customers in Central and South
America, and (iii) production shortfalls during portions of the period. 

Vacuum Sealing Products .
During the three months ended September 30, 2016, revenues from the sale of pouches and vacuum sealing machines decreased by
34.8% compared to the prior year from $3,983,000 to $2,594,000. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, revenues
from the sale of pouches and vacuum sealing machines decreased by 22.1% compared to the prior year from $9,446,000 to
$7,362,000. The decline in revenues for the nine month period is attributable to the decline in sales of zippered pouches
from $2,060,000 in the first nine months of 2015 to $122,000 in the first nine months of 2016. Most of the sales of zippered
pouches were to a principal customer. Sales to that customer ceased after the first quarter of this year and the customer has
advised us that they will not be purchasing the product on an ongoing basis. However, we are introducing a new line of
zippered pouch products under the brand Clever Fresh  to be sold through Clever Container from which we anticipate new
revenues of zippered pouch product. With respect to our branded vacuum sealing systems, sales for the quarter decreased to
$2,594,000 from $3,137,000 for the same period last year and sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased to
$7,240,000 from $7,386,000 in the same period last year. We have received orders for vacuum sealing system products for the
fourth quarter exceeding $8 million and anticipate that our sales of branded vacuum sealing systems will reach at least $17
million for 2016 compared to 2015 sales in that line of $10,624,000. 

Films . During the three months ended
September 30, 2016, revenues from the sale of laminated film products decreased by 19.3% compared to the prior year period from
$1,409,000 to $1,137,000. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, revenues from the sale of laminated film products increased
by 6.7% compared to the prior year period from $3,289,000 to $3,508,000. Virtually all of the sales of this product line were to
a single long-term customer. 

Home Organizing Products .
During the three months ended September 30, 2016, revenues from the sale of home organizing products increased by 14.9%
compared to the prior year period from $1,121,000 to $1,288,000. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, revenues
from the sale of home organizing products increased by 57.7% compared to the prior year period from $2,690,000 to $4,243,000.
We engage in direct sales of home organizing products through Clever Container Company, LLC. We now have a 28.5% direct ownership interest in Clever Container
and the results of its operations are consolidated with those of the Company as a variable interest entity. Clever Container
engages in the direct sales of home organizing products and containers (including certain products produced by the Company)
through a network of independent consultants throughout the United States. 

Other Revenues . During the three
months ended September 30, 2016, revenues from the sale of various other products decreased by 19.5% to $404,000 compared to revenues
from other products in the same period in 2015 of $502,000. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, revenues from the
sale of various other products decreased by 55.2% to $997,000 compared to revenues from other products in the same period in
2015 of $2,224,000. The revenues from the sale of other products during 2016 include (i) sales of a line of  Candy Blossoms 
and  Candy Loons  consisting of candy and small inflated balloons sold in small containers and (ii) the sale of accessories
and supply items related to balloon products. 

Sales to a limited number of
customers continue to represent a large percentage of our net sales. The table below illustrates the impact on sales of our
top three and ten customers for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

During the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016, there were two customers whose purchases represented more than 10% of the Company s consolidated net
sales. Sales to these customers for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were $3,088,000 or 22.9%, and $3,070,000 or 22.8%,
of consolidated net sales, respectively. Sales to these customers for the three months ended September 30, 2015 were $3,256,000
or 21.9%, and $2,282,000 or 15.3%, of consolidated net sales, respectively. Sales to these customers for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 were $11,859,000 or 27.7%, and $7,870,000 or 18.4%, of consolidated net sales, respectively. Sales to these
customers for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 were $11,660,000 or 26.8%, and $6,091,000 or 14.0%, of consolidated net
sales, respectively. The amounts owed at September 30, 2016 by these customers were $1,411,000 or 15.7%, and $2,653,000 or 29.4%,
of the Company s consolidated net accounts receivable, respectively. As of September 30, 2015, the total amounts owed to
the Company by these customers were $1,957,000 or 19.3% and $1,972,000 or 19.5% of the Company s consolidated net accounts
receivable, respectively. 

Cost of Sales . During
the three months ended September 30, 2016, the cost of sales represented 74.7% of net sales compared to 72.4% for the
three months ended September 30, 2015. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the cost of sales represented 73.9%
of net sales compared to 73.3% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in the cost of sales is the
result principally of the decline in gross margins we have experienced in relation to the sale of latex balloons, resulting
from the decline in the value of the Mexican Peso in relation to the dollar. 

General and Administrative .
During the three months ended September 30, 2016, general and administrative expenses were $1,808,000 or 13.4% of net sales, compared

expenses were $5,471,000 or 12.8% of net sales, compared to $5,300,000 or 12.2% of net sales for the same period in 2015. 

Selling . During the three months

to $2,426,000 or 5.6% of net sales for the same period in 2015. The increase in selling expense is attributable principally to an increase in commissions to clever container
consultants. 

Advertising and Marketing . During
the three months ended September 30, 2016, advertising and marketing expenses were $581,000 or 4.3% of net sales for the period,

and marketing expenses were $1,644,000 or 3.8% of net sales for the period, compared to $2,006,000 or 4.6% of net sales for the

The amount of that change was ($48,000) in the third quarter compared to $18,000 in the third quarter of 2015.

the nine months ended September 30, 2015 of $3,390,000. 

Significant changes in working capital
items during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 included: 

The increase in inventory is attributable
principally to the purchase and production of inventory for a significant sale of vacuum sealing systems in the fourth quarter,

significant reductions in inventory and trade payables, and significant increases in receivables during the fourth quarter as we

Critical Accounting
Policies  

Please see pages 25-28 of our Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 for a description of policies that are critical to our business operations
and the understanding of our results of operations. The impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business
operations is discussed throughout Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results. No material changes to such information have occurred during
the three months ended September 30, 2016. 

Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures Regarding Market Risk  

Not applicable. 

Item 4.  Controls and Procedures   

In the course of review of our
preliminary financial statements for the period ending June 30, 2016, our audit firm identified a transaction involving the sale
and leaseback of certain equipment by our Mexico subsidiary, Flexo Universal, which was not properly recorded under U.S.
GAAP. This error was identified and corrected prior to completion of the financial statements. Upon review by management and
our Audit Committee, it was determined that information respecting the transaction, and the accounting for it, was not
provided to management on a timely basis to enable proper review of the transaction prior to its being recorded. 

During the third quarter, the Company developed and implemented
new internal control procedures and documentation covering financial commitments, contracts and other transactions involving financial
commitments to remediate the identified weaknesses in controls and procedures. Based upon this remediation, our management, acting
under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has reviewed and evaluated
the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2016. Based on such
review and evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the disclosure controls and
procedures were effective as of September 30, 2016, to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports
that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (a) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported
within the time period specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (b) is accumulated and communicated to our management,
including the officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Except for the foregoing, there have
been no material changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2016 that
have materially affected or are likely to materially affect our internal controls over financial reporting.

or otherwise, including, but not limited to, all indebtedness, obligations and liabilities of the Borrower to the Bank under the
Credit Agreement, the Notes, or any other agreement, document, or instrument referred to in Section 3 of the Credit Agreement. 

2.            Subordination . 

(a)           Subordination
of the Subordinated Debt . Each Subordinated Creditor postpones and subordinates to the extent and in the manner provided in
this Agreement all of such Subordinated Creditor s Subordinated Debt to the payment of all of the Superior Debt. Each Subordinated
Creditor shall insure that any instrument or document evidencing such Subordinated Creditor s Subordinated Debt shall bear
the following legend: 

Payment of the indebtedness evidenced by this instrument
or document and the rights of the holder hereof are subordinated and subject to the rights of BMO Harris Bank N.A. to
the extent provided in a Subordination Agreement dated as of September 30, 2016, from the payee to said lender.  

The Debtor s and each Subordinated Creditor s
books shall be marked to evidence subordination of all of the Subordinated Debt to the Superior Debt. The Bank is authorized to
examine such books from time to time and to make any notations required by this Agreement. All instruments and documents evidencing
the Subordinated Debt shall, upon request, be delivered to the Bank properly assigned or endorsed to the Bank. Nothing contained
in this Agreement shall affect the validity of the Subordinated Debt. 

(b)           Subordination
of the Liens Securing the Subordinated Debt . Each Subordinated Creditor (i) acknowledges that, as of the date hereof,
such Subordinated Creditor has no lien, security interest in, or other right to, any property of the Debtor, and (ii) covenants
that it will not obtain any lien, security interest in, or other right to, any property of the Debtor without the Bank s
prior written consent. To the extent that, notwithstanding the foregoing acknowledgment and covenant, any Subordinated Creditor
acquires any lien, security interest in, or other right to, any of the Subordinated Creditor Collateral (as hereinafter defined),
each Subordinated Creditor expressly subordinates all of its rights in any property of the Debtor, real or personal, now or later
securing the Subordinated Debt (the   Subordinated Creditor Collateral  ), to all present and future rights of
the Bank in any of the Subordinated Creditor Collateral to secure the Superior Debt, without regard to the time or order of attachment
or perfection of any security interest, the time or order of filing any financing statement, or the giving or failure to give any
notice of the acquisition or expected acquisition of any purchase money security interest. Each Subordinated Creditor consents
to the creation and continuance of all present and future security interests of the Bank in the Subordinated Creditor Collateral
to secure the Superior Debt and to the enforcement of those security interests, including the removal of the Subordinated Creditor
Collateral from the real property of the Debtor. This subordination as to the Subordinated Creditor Collateral is intended to define
the rights and duties of the Bank and the Subordinated Creditors; it is not intended that any third party shall benefit from it.
If the effect of any provision of this subordination would be to give any third party a priority status to which that party would
not otherwise be entitled, that provision shall, to the extent necessary to avoid that priority, be given no effect and the rights
and priorities of the Bank and the Subordinated Creditors shall be determined in accordance with applicable law. 

3.            Payments
on Subordinated Debt . 

(a)           Limitations .
Except as permitted by Section 3(c), until all the Superior Debt is paid in full in cash: (i) the Debtor shall not, directly
or indirectly, make any payments on account of or (other than the liens securing the Subordinated Creditor Collateral) grant a
security interest in, mortgage, assign, or transfer, any properties to secure or satisfy any part of the Subordinated Debt; (ii) no
Subordinated Creditor shall demand or accept from the Debtor or any other person any such payment or collateral or cancel, set
off or otherwise discharge any part of the Subordinated Debt; and (iii) neither the Debtor nor any Subordinated Creditor shall
otherwise take or permit any action prejudicial to or inconsistent with the Bank s priority position over the Subordinated
Creditors created by this Agreement. 

(b)           Payments
Received . If any payment (other than a payment permitted by this Agreement or the Credit Agreement) on account of or any collateral
for any part of the Subordinated Debt is received by any Subordinated Creditor, such payment or collateral shall be delivered forthwith
to the Bank by such Subordinated Creditor for application to the Superior Debt, in the form received except for the addition of
any endorsement or assignment necessary to effect transfer of all rights therein to the Bank. The Bank is irrevocably authorized
(but not required), and each Subordinated Creditor does hereby irrevocably appoint the Bank, or any of its officers or employees
on behalf of the Bank as the attorney-in-fact for such Subordinated Creditor in connection with the Subordinated Debt, to supply
any required endorsement or assignment which may have been omitted. Until so delivered any such payment or collateral shall be
held by the recipient in trust for the Bank and shall not be commingled with other funds or property of the recipient. 

(c)           Permitted
Payments .

to the other provisions of this Section 3(c), the Debtor shall be permitted to make, and the Subordinated Creditors shall
be permitted to accept from the Debtor, one or more prepayments of principal of the Subordinated Debt, so long as (A) the
Debtor has delivered to the Bank evidence satisfactory to the Bank, in its sole and absolute discretion, that that prepayment is
being funded solely with amounts received in collection of accounts receivable from the 2016 Walmart Promotional Program (which

accrue and continue to accrue on the Subordinated Debt in accordance with the Subordinated Debt Instruments. No such accrued interest
may be capitalized or otherwise added to the outstanding principal balance of the Subordinated Debt, and no such accrued interest
may itself bear interest under the Subordinated Debt Instruments.

the Merrick Bridge Repayment is paid in full in cash, the Debtor shall, in lieu of making any prepayment of the Subordinated Debt
evidenced by the 2016 CTI Merrick Note that is permitted to be made in accordance with Section 3(c)(i) or 3(c)(ii),
pay to the Bank the amount of that permitted prepayment as a payment or prepayment of the Merrick Bridge Repayment, and any such
payment or prepayment paid to the Bank will be deemed a prepayment, in like amount, of the Subordinated Debt evidenced by the 2016 CTI Merrick
Note. 

(v)         Until
the Schwan Bridge Repayment is paid in full in cash, the Debtor shall, in lieu of making any prepayment of the Subordinated Debt
evidenced by the 2016 CTI Schwan Note that is permitted to be made in accordance with Section 3(c)(i) or 3(c)(ii),
pay to the Bank the amount of that permitted prepayment as a payment or prepayment of the Schwan Bridge Repayment, and any such
payment or prepayment paid to the Bank will be deemed a prepayment, in like amount, of the Subordinated Debt evidenced by the 2016 CTI Schwan
Note. 

(vi)        Unless
otherwise agreed in writing by each Subordinated Creditor, the Debtor, and the Bank, all prepayments of the Subordinated Debt permitted
to be made in accordance Section 3(c)(i) or 3(c)(ii) (and all payments or prepayments of the Merrick Bridge Repayment or the
Schwan Bridge Repayment to be made in lieu of any such permitted prepayment in accordance with Section 3(c)(iv) or 3(c)(v),
respectively) must be made ratably to the Subordinated Creditors (or to the Bank, as applicable) based on the outstanding principal
balance of the Subordinated Debt owing from the Debtor to each Subordinated Creditor. 

4.            Collection
of the Subordinated Debt, Bankruptcy, Etc . Until all of the Superior Debt is paid in full in cash, no Subordinated Creditor
shall, without the prior written consent of the Bank, accelerate the maturity of the Subordinated Debt, initiate or join with any
other creditor of the Debtor in initiating any proceedings, voluntary or involuntary, for the collection of the Subordinated Debt
or for the distribution, division or application of all or part of the assets of the Debtor or the proceeds thereof, whether such

or bankruptcy proceedings, an assignment for the benefit of creditors or proceedings by or against the Debtor for relief under
any bankruptcy, reorganization or insolvency law or any law relating to the relief of debtors, readjustment of indebtedness, reorganization,
arrangement, composition, extension or otherwise. The Bank is irrevocably authorized (but not required), and each Subordinated
Creditor does hereby irrevocably appoint the Bank, or any of its officers or employees on behalf of the Bank as the attorney-in-fact

the extent provided in a Subordination Agreement dated as of September 30, 2016, from the payee to said lender.  

The Debtor s and each Subordinated Creditor s books
shall be marked to evidence subordination of all of the Subordinated Debt to the Superior Debt. The Purchaser is authorized to
examine such books from time to time and to make any notations required by this Agreement. All instruments and documents evidencing
the Subordinated Debt shall, upon request, be delivered to the Purchaser properly assigned or endorsed to the Purchaser. Nothing
contained in this Agreement shall affect the validity of the Subordinated Debt. 

(b)            Subordination
of the Liens Securing the Subordinated Debt . Each Subordinated Creditor (i) acknowledges that, as of the date hereof,
such Subordinated Creditor has no lien, security interest in, or other right to, any property of the Debtor, and (ii) covenants
that it will not obtain any lien, security interest in, or other right to, any property of the Debtor without the Purchaser s
prior written consent. To the extent that, notwithstanding the foregoing acknowledgment and covenant, any Subordinated Creditor
acquires any lien, security interest in, or other right to, any of the Subordinated Creditor Collateral (as hereinafter defined),
each Subordinated Creditor expressly subordinates all of its rights in any property of the Debtor, real or personal, now or later
securing the Subordinated Debt (the   Subordinated Creditor Collateral  ), to all present and future rights of
the Purchaser in any of the Subordinated Creditor Collateral to secure the Superior Debt, without regard to the time or order of
attachment or perfection of any security interest, the time or order of filing any financing statement, or the giving or failure
to give any notice of the acquisition or expected acquisition of any purchase money security interest. Each Subordinated Creditor
consents to the creation and continuance of all present and future security interests of the Purchaser in the Subordinated Creditor
Collateral to secure the Superior Debt and to the enforcement of those security interests, including the removal of the Subordinated
Creditor Collateral from the real property of the Debtor. This subordination as to the Subordinated Creditor Collateral is intended
to define the rights and duties of the Purchaser and the Subordinated Creditors; it is not intended that any third party shall
benefit from it. If the effect of any provision of this subordination would be to give any third party a priority status to which
that party would not otherwise be entitled, that provision shall, to the extent necessary to avoid that priority, be given no effect
and the rights and priorities of the Purchaser and the Subordinated Creditors shall be determined in accordance with applicable
law. 

3.             Payments
on Subordinated Debt . 

(a)            Limitations .
Except as permitted by Section 3(c), until all the Superior Debt is paid in full in cash: (i) the Debtor shall not, directly
or indirectly, make any payments on account of or (other than any liens securing the Subordinated Creditor Collateral) grant a
security interest in, mortgage, assign, or transfer, any properties to secure or satisfy any part of the Subordinated Debt; (ii) no
Subordinated Creditor shall demand or accept from the Debtor or any other person any such payment or collateral or cancel, set
off or otherwise discharge any part of the Subordinated Debt; and (iii) neither the Debtor nor any Subordinated Creditor shall
otherwise take or permit any action prejudicial to or inconsistent with the Purchaser s priority position over the Subordinated
Creditors created by this Agreement. 

(b)            Payments
Received . If any payment (other than a payment permitted by this Agreement or the Purchase Agreement) on account of or any
collateral for any part of the Subordinated Debt is received by any Subordinated Creditor, such payment or collateral shall be
delivered forthwith to the Senior Lender, in the event any Senior Debt is outstanding, and if not so outstanding, to the Purchaser
by such Subordinated Creditor for application to the Senior Debt, if still outstanding, and, if not outstanding, for application
to the Superior Debt, in the form received except for the addition of any endorsement or assignment necessary to effect transfer
of all rights therein to the Purchaser. The Purchaser is irrevocably authorized (but not required), and each Subordinated Creditor
does hereby irrevocably appoint the Purchaser, or any of its officers or employees on behalf of the Purchaser as the attorney-in-fact
for such Subordinated Creditor in connection with the Subordinated Debt, to supply any required endorsement or assignment which
may have been omitted. Until so delivered any such payment or collateral shall be held by the recipient in trust for the Purchaser
and shall not be commingled with other funds or property of the recipient. 

(c)            Permitted
Payments . 

(i)           Subject
to the other provisions of this Section 3(c), the Debtor shall be permitted to make, and the Subordinated Creditors shall
be permitted to accept from the Debtor, one or more voluntary prepayments of principal in respect of the Subordinated Debt, so
long as (A) the Debtor has delivered to the Purchaser evidence satisfactory to the Purchaser, in its sole and absolute discretion,
that that prepayment is being funded solely with amounts received in collection of accounts receivable from the 2016 Walmart Promotional
Program (which evidence might include, but will not necessarily be limited to, invoice documentation and proof of payment remittance
from Walmart), (B) that prepayment is funded solely with amounts received in collection of accounts receivable from the 2016
Walmart Promotional Program, and (C)  that any such voluntary prepayment is made on or before February 28, 2017. 

(ii)          Subject
to the other provisions of this Section 3(c), the Debtor shall be permitted to make, and the Subordinated Creditors shall
be permitted to accept from the Debtor, (x) one or more voluntary prepayments of accrued interest in respect of the Subordinated
Debt, so long as (A) the Debtor has delivered to the Purchaser evidence satisfactory to the Purchaser, in its sole and absolute
discretion, that that prepayment is being funded solely with amounts received in collection of accounts receivable from the 2016
Walmart Promotional Program (which evidence might include, but will not necessarily be limited to, invoice documentation and proof
of payment remittance from Walmart), (B) that prepayment is funded solely with amounts received in collection of accounts
receivable from the 2016 Walmart Promotional Program, (C) that any such voluntary prepayment is made on or before February 28,
2017 and (D) that the outstanding principal balance of the Subordinated Debt has been paid in full in cash. 

(iii)         The
Debtor shall not be permitted to make, and the Subordinated Creditors shall not be permitted to accept from the Debtor, payments
in cash of any accrued interest on the Subordinated Debt other than in accordance with Section 3(c)(ii), but interest may
accrue and continue to accrue on the Subordinated Debt in accordance with the Subordinated Debt Instruments. No such accrued interest
may be capitalized or otherwise added to the outstanding principal balance of the Subordinated Debt, and no such accrued interest
may itself bear interest under the Subordinated Debt Instruments. 

(iv)         Until
the Merrick Bridge Repayment is paid in full in cash, the Debtor shall, in lieu of making any prepayment of the Subordinated Debt
evidenced by the 2016 CTI Merrick Note that is permitted to be made in accordance with Section 3(c)(i) or (ii), pay
to the Senior Lender the amount of that permitted prepayment as a payment or prepayment of the Merrick Bridge Repayment, and any
such payment or prepayment paid to the Senior Lender will be deemed a prepayment, in like amount, of the Subordinated Debt evidenced
by the 2016 CTI Merrick Note. 

(v)          Until
the Schwan Bridge Repayment is paid in full in cash, the Debtor shall, in lieu of making any prepayment of the Subordinated Debt
evidenced by the 2016 CTI Schwan Note that is permitted to be made in accordance with Section 3(c)(i) or (ii), pay to
the Senior Lender the amount of that permitted prepayment as a payment or prepayment of the Schwan Bridge Repayment, and any such
payment or prepayment paid to the Senior Lender will be deemed a prepayment, in like amount, of the Subordinated Debt evidenced
by the 2016 CTI Schwan Note. 

(vi)         Unless
otherwise agreed in writing by each Subordinated Creditor, the Debtor, and the Purchaser, all prepayments of the Subordinated Debt
permitted to be made in accordance Section 3(c)(i) or 3(c)(ii) (and all payments or prepayments of the Merrick Bridge Repayment
or the Schwan Bridge Repayment to be made in lieu of any such permitted prepayment in accordance with Section 3(c)(iv) or
3(c)(v), respectively) must be made ratably to the Subordinated Creditors (or to the Senior Lender, as applicable) based on the
outstanding principal balance of the Subordinated Debt owing from the Debtor to each Subordinated Creditor. 

4.             Collection
of the Subordinated Debt, Bankruptcy, Etc . Until all of the Superior Debt is paid in full in cash, no Subordinated Creditor
shall, without the prior written consent of the Purchaser, accelerate the maturity of the Subordinated Debt, initiate or join with
any other creditor of the Debtor in initiating any proceedings, voluntary or involuntary, for the collection of the Subordinated
Debt or for the distribution, division or application of all or part of the assets of the Debtor or the proceeds thereof, whether
such proceedings be for the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Debtor or the Debtor s business, receivership,
insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings, an assignment for the benefit of creditors or proceedings by or against the Debtor for relief
under any bankruptcy, reorganization or insolvency law or any law relating to the relief of debtors, readjustment of indebtedness,
reorganization, arrangement, composition, extension or otherwise. The Purchaser is irrevocably authorized (but not required), and
each Subordinated Creditor does hereby irrevocably appoint the Purchaser, or any of its officers or employees on behalf of the
Purchaser as the attorney-in-fact for such Subordinated Creditor in connection with the Subordinated Debt, at its option, at any
meeting of the creditors of the Debtor or in any such proceeding or any proceeding initiated by the Debtor: 

(a)           to
enforce claims comprising the Subordinated Debt either in its own name or in the name of the Subordinated Creditors, by proof of
debt, proof of claim, suit or otherwise; 

(b)           to
collect any assets of the Debtor distributed, divided or applied by way of dividend or payment, or any securities issued, on account
of the Subordinated Debt and apply the same, or the proceeds of any realization upon the same the Purchaser in its discretion elects
to effect, to the Superior Debt until all of the Superior Debt has been paid in full in cash, rendering any surplus to the Subordinated
Creditors; 

(c)           to
vote claims comprising the Subordinated Debt to accept or reject any plan of partial or complete liquidation, reorganization, arrangement,
composition or extension; and
