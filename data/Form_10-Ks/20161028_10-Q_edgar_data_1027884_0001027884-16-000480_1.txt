  (Unaudited) 
   
  1  .   ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF OPERATIONS    
  Organization and Nature of Operations   Founded in   1889  , Chicago Bridge   Iron Company N.V. ( CB I  or the  Company ) provides a wide range of services, including conceptual design, technology, engineering, procurement, fabrication, modularization, construction, commissioning, maintenance, program management and environmental services to customers in the energy infrastructure market throughout the world, and is a provider of diversified government services. Our business is aligned into   four   operating groups, which represent our reportable segments: (1) Engineering   Construction; (2) Fabrication Services; (3) Technology; and (4) Capital Services. See   Note 15   for a discussion of our operating groups and related financial information.  
   
  2  .   SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES    
  Basis of Accounting and Consolidation   The accompanying unaudited interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements ( Financial Statements ) are prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the United States ( U.S. ) Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ). These Financial Statements include all wholly-owned subsidiaries and those entities which we are required to consolidate. See the  Partnering Arrangements  section of this footnote for further discussion of our consolidation policy for those entities that are not wholly-owned. Intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. 
  Basis of Presentation   We believe these Financial Statements include all adjustments, which are of a normal recurring nature, necessary for a fair presentation of our results of operations for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , our financial position as of   September 30, 2016   and our cash flows for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  . The   December 31, 2015   Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet was derived from our   December 31, 2015   audited Consolidated Balance Sheet, adjusted to conform to our current year presentation. 
  We believe the disclosures accompanying these Financial Statements are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC for interim reporting periods. The results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. The accompanying Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included in our   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K (   2015   Annual Report ). 
  Use of Estimates   The preparation of our Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We believe the most significant estimates and judgments are associated with revenue recognition for our contracts, including estimating costs and the recognition of incentive fees and unapproved change orders and claims; fair value and recoverability assessments that must be periodically performed with respect to long-lived tangible assets, goodwill and other intangible assets; valuation of deferred tax assets and financial instruments; the determination of liabilities related to self-insurance programs and income taxes; and consolidation determinations with respect to our partnering arrangements. If the underlying estimates and assumptions upon which our Financial Statements are based change in the future, actual amounts may differ from those included in the accompanying Financial Statements. 
  Revenue Recognition   Our revenue is primarily derived from long-term contracts and is generally recognized using the percentage of completion ( POC ) method, primarily based on the percentage that actual costs-to-date bear to total estimated costs to complete each contract. We follow the guidance of Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Revenue Recognition Topic 605-35 for accounting policies relating to our use of the POC method, estimating costs, and revenue recognition, including the recognition of incentive fees, unapproved change orders and claims, and combining and segmenting contracts. We primarily utilize the cost-to-cost approach to estimate POC as we believe this method is less subjective than relying on assessments of physical progress. Under the cost-to-cost approach, the use of estimated costs to complete each contract is a significant variable in the process of determining recognized revenue and is a significant factor in the accounting for contracts. Significant estimates that impact the cost to complete each contract are costs of engineering, materials, components, equipment, labor and subcontracts; labor productivity; schedule durations, including subcontractor or supplier progress; liquidated damages; contract disputes, including claims; achievement of contractual performance requirements; and contingency, among others. The cumulative impact of revisions in total cost estimates during the progress of work is reflected in the period in which these changes become known, including, to the extent required, the

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued) 

reversal of profit recognized in prior periods and the recognition of losses expected to be incurred on contracts in progress. Due to the various estimates inherent in our contract accounting, actual results could differ from those estimates. Backlog for each of our operating groups generally consists of several hundred contracts, and our results may be impacted by changes in estimated project margins. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, significant changes in estimated margins on two projects resulted in an increase to our income from operations of approximately   $112,000  , and significant changes in estimated margins on two other projects resulted in a decrease to our income from operations of approximately   $104,000  . For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, individual projects with significant changes in estimated margins did not have a material net impact on our income from operations. 
  Our long-term contracts are awarded on a competitively bid and negotiated basis and the timing of revenue recognition may be impacted by the terms of such contracts. We use a range of contracting options, including cost-reimbursable, fixed-price and hybrid, which has both cost-reimbursable and fixed-price characteristics. Fixed-price contracts, and hybrid contracts with a more significant fixed-price component, tend to provide us with greater control over project schedule and the timing of when work is performed and costs are incurred, and accordingly, when revenue is recognized. Cost-reimbursable contracts, and hybrid contracts with a more significant cost-reimbursable component, generally provide our customers with greater influence over the timing of when we perform our work, and accordingly, such contracts often result in less predictability with respect to the timing of revenue recognition. Contract revenue for our long-term contracts recognized under the POC method reflects the original contract price adjusted for approved change orders and estimated recoveries for incentive fees, unapproved change orders and claims. We recognize revenue associated with incentive fees when the value can be reliably estimated and recovery is probable. We recognize revenue associated with unapproved change orders and claims to the extent the related costs have been incurred, the value can be reliably estimated and recovery is probable. Our recorded incentive fees, unapproved change orders and claims reflect our best estimate of recovery amounts; however, the ultimate resolution and amounts received could differ from these estimates. See   Note 14   for additional discussion of our recorded unapproved change orders, claims and incentives. 
  With respect to our engineering, procurement, and construction ( EPC ) services, our contracts are not segmented between types of services, such as engineering and construction, if each of the EPC components is negotiated concurrently or if the pricing of any such services is subject to the ultimate negotiation and agreement of the entire EPC contract. However, an EPC contract including technology or fabrication services may be segmented if we satisfy the segmenting criteria in ASC 605-35. Revenue recorded in these situations is based on our prices and terms for similar services to third party customers. Segmenting a contract may result in different interim rates of profitability for each scope of service than if we had recognized revenue without segmenting. In some instances, we may combine contracts that are entered into in multiple phases, but are interdependent and include pricing considerations by us and the customer that are impacted by all phases of the project. Otherwise, if each phase is independent of the other and pricing considerations do not give effect to another phase, the contracts will not be combined. 
  Cost of revenue for our long-term contracts includes direct contract costs, such as materials and labor, and indirect costs that are attributable to contract activity. The timing of when we bill our customers is generally dependent upon advance billing terms, milestone billings based on the completion of certain phases of the work, or when services are provided. Projects with costs and estimated earnings recognized to date in excess of cumulative billings is reported on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet ( Balance Sheet ) as costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings. Projects with cumulative billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings recognized to date is reported on the Balance Sheet as billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings. The net balances on our Balance Sheet are collectively referred to as Contracts in Progress, net and the components of these balances at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   were as follows:

  Chicago Bridge   Iron Company N.V. 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued) 

Any uncollected billed amounts, including contract retentions, are reported as accounts receivable. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , accounts receivable included contract retentions of approximately   $73,500   and   $62,900  , respectively. Contract retentions due beyond one year were not material at   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  .  
  Revenue for our service contracts that do not satisfy the criteria for revenue recognition under the POC method is recorded at the time services are performed. Revenue associated with incentive fees for these contracts is recognized when earned. Unbilled receivables for our service contracts are recorded within accounts receivable and were approximately   $100,000   and   $71,600   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  
  Revenue for our pipe and steel fabrication and catalyst manufacturing contracts that are independent of an EPC contract, or for which we satisfy the segmentation criteria discussed above, is recognized upon shipment of the fabricated or manufactured units. During the fabrication or manufacturing process, all related direct and allocable indirect costs are capitalized as work in process inventory and such costs are recorded as cost of revenue at the time of shipment. 
  Our billed and unbilled revenue may be exposed to potential credit risk if our customers should encounter financial difficulties, and we maintain reserves for specifically-identified potential uncollectible receivables. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , our allowances for doubtful accounts were not material. 
  Other Operating Expense (Income), Net     Other operating expense (income), net   generally represents (gains) losses associated with the sale or disposition of property and equipment. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015,   other operating expense (income), net   also included a gain of approximately   $7,500   related to the contribution of a technology to our unconsolidated Chevron-Lummus Global ( CLG ) joint venture and a foreign exchange loss of approximately   $11,000   associated with the re-measurement of certain non-U.S. Dollar denominated net assets, both of which occurred during the three months ended March 31, 2015. 
  Recoverability of Goodwill   Goodwill is not amortized to earnings, but instead is reviewed for impairment at least annually at a reporting unit level, absent any indicators of impairment or when other actions require an impairment assessment (such as a change in reporting units). We perform our annual impairment assessment during the fourth quarter of each year based upon balances as of October 1. We identify a potential impairment by comparing the fair value of the applicable reporting unit to its net book value, including goodwill. If the net book value exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, an indication of potential impairment exists, and we measure the impairment by comparing the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill to its implied fair value. To determine the fair value of our reporting units and test for impairment, we utilize an income approach (discounted cash flow method) as we believe this is the most direct approach to incorporate the specific economic attributes and risk profiles of our reporting units into our valuation model. This is consistent with the methodology used to determine the fair value of our reporting units in previous years. We generally do not utilize a market approach given the lack of relevant information generated by market transactions involving comparable businesses. See   Note 6   for additional discussion of our goodwill. 
  Recoverability of Other Long-Lived Assets   We amortize our finite-lived intangible assets on a straight-line basis with lives ranging from   4   to   20   years, absent any indicators of impairment. We review tangible assets and finite-lived intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If a recoverability assessment is required, the estimated future cash flow associated with the asset or asset group will be compared to the asset s carrying amount to determine if an impairment exists. See   Note 6   for additional discussion of our intangible assets. 
  Earnings Per Share ( EPS )   Basic EPS is calculated by dividing net income attributable to CB I by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS reflects the assumed conversion of dilutive securities, consisting of restricted shares, performance based shares (where performance criteria have been met), stock options and directors  deferred-fee shares. See   Note 3   for calculations associated with basic and diluted EPS. 
  Cash Equivalents   Cash equivalents are considered to be highly liquid securities with original maturities of three months or less. 
  Inventory   Inventory is recorded at the lower of cost or market and cost is determined using the first-in-first-out or weighted-average cost method. The cost of inventory includes acquisition costs, production or conversion costs, and other costs incurred to bring the inventory to a current location and condition. An allowance for excess or inactive inventory is recorded based upon an analysis that considers current inventory levels, historical usage patterns, estimates of future sales expectations and salvage value. See   Note 5   for additional discussion of our inventory.

Foreign Currency   The nature of our business activities involves the management of various financial and market risks, including those related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The effects of translating financial statements of foreign operations into our reporting currency are recognized as a cumulative translation adjustment in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) ( AOCI ) which is net of tax, where applicable. With the exception of a foreign exchange loss of approximately   $11,000   included within   other operating expense (income), net   related to the re-measurement of certain non-U.S. Dollar denominated net assets during the three months ended March 31, 2015, foreign currency transactional and re-measurement exchange gains (losses) are included within cost of revenue and were not material for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  
  Financial Instruments   We utilize derivative instruments in certain circumstances to mitigate the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, as described below: 
             
    Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Derivatives   We do not engage in currency speculation; however, we utilize foreign currency exchange rate derivatives on an ongoing basis to hedge against certain foreign currency-related operating exposures. We generally seek hedge accounting treatment for contracts used to hedge operating exposures and designate them as cash flow hedges. Therefore, gains and losses, exclusive of credit risk and forward points (which represent the time-value component of the fair value of our derivative positions), are included in AOCI until the associated underlying operating exposure impacts our earnings. Changes in the fair value of (1) credit risk and forward points, (2) instruments deemed ineffective during the period, and (3) instruments that we do not designate as cash flow hedges are recognized within cost of revenue. 
                
    Interest Rate Derivatives   At   September 30, 2016  , we continued to utilize a swap arrangement to hedge against interest rate variability associated with   $309,313   of our outstanding   $337,500   unsecured term loan (the  Term Loan ). The swap arrangement has been designated as a cash flow hedge as its critical terms matched those of the Term Loan at inception and through   September 30, 2016  . Accordingly, changes in the fair value of the swap arrangement are included in AOCI until the associated underlying exposure impacts our earnings. 
     For those contracts designated as cash flow hedges, we document all relationships between the derivative instruments and associated hedged items, as well as our risk-management objectives and strategy for undertaking hedge transactions. This process includes linking all derivatives to specific firm commitments or highly-probable forecasted transactions. We continually assess, at inception and on an ongoing basis, the effectiveness of derivative instruments in offsetting changes in the cash flow of the designated hedged items. Hedge accounting designation is discontinued when (1) it is determined that the derivative is no longer highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flow of the hedged item, including firm commitments or forecasted transactions, (2) the derivative is sold, terminated, exercised, or expires, (3) it is no longer probable that the forecasted transaction will occur, or (4) we determine that designating the derivative as a hedging instrument is no longer appropriate. See   Note 9   for additional discussion of our financial instruments. 
  Income Taxes   Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis using currently enacted income tax rates for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is provided to offset any net deferred tax assets ( DTA(s) ) if, based upon the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the DTAs will not be realized. The realization of our net DTAs depends upon our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income of the appropriate character and in the appropriate jurisdictions.  
  Income tax and associated interest reserves, where applicable, are recorded in those instances where we consider it more likely than not that additional tax will be due in excess of amounts reflected in income tax returns filed worldwide, irrespective of whether or not we have received tax assessments. We continually review our exposure to additional income tax obligations and, as further information is known or events occur, changes in our tax and interest reserves may be recorded within income tax expense and interest expense, respectively. 
  Partnering Arrangements     In the ordinary course of business, we execute specific projects and conduct certain operations through joint venture, consortium and other collaborative arrangements (collectively referred to as  venture(s) ). We have various ownership interests in these ventures, with such ownership typically proportionate to our decision-making and distribution rights. The ventures generally contract directly with the third party customer; however, services may be performed directly by the ventures, or may be performed by us, our partners, or a combination thereof. 
  Venture net assets consist primarily of working capital and property and equipment, and assets may be restricted from being used to fund obligations outside of the venture. These ventures typically have limited third party debt or have debt that is non-recourse in nature; however, they may provide for capital calls to fund operations or require participants in the venture to provide additional financial support, including advance payment or retention letters of credit.

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued) 

Each venture is assessed at inception and on an ongoing basis as to whether it qualifies as a VIE under the consolidations guidance in ASC 810. A venture generally qualifies as a VIE when it (1) meets the definition of a legal entity, (2) absorbs the operational risk of the projects being executed, creating a variable interest, and (3) lacks sufficient capital investment from the partners, potentially resulting in the venture requiring additional subordinated financial support, if necessary, to finance its future activities. 
  If at any time a venture qualifies as a VIE, we perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary of the VIE and, therefore, need to consolidate the VIE. We are the primary beneficiary if we have (1) the power to direct the economically significant activities of the VIE and (2) the right to receive benefits from, and obligation to absorb losses of, the VIE. If the venture is a VIE and we are the primary beneficiary, or we otherwise have the ability to control the venture, we consolidate the venture. If we are not determined to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE, or only have the ability to significantly influence, rather than control the venture, we do not consolidate the venture. We account for unconsolidated ventures using proportionate consolidation for both the Balance Sheet and Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations ( Statement of Operations ) when we meet the applicable accounting criteria to do so and utilize the equity method otherwise. See   Note 7   for additional discussion of our material partnering arrangements. 
  New Accounting Standards   In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2014-09, which provides a single comprehensive accounting standard for revenue recognition for contracts with customers and supersedes current industry-specific guidance, including ASC 605-35. The new standard prescribes a five-step revenue recognition model that focuses on transfer of control and entitlement to consideration in determining the amount of revenue to be recognized. The guidance also significantly expands qualitative and quantitative disclosure requirements regarding the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. We will adopt the standard, including any updates to the standard, upon its effective date in the first quarter 2018. Our adoption will result in retrospective application, either in the form of recasting all prior periods presented or a cumulative adjustment to equity in the period of adoption. We are assessing the potential impact of the new standard on our Financial Statements. 
  In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02, which amends existing consolidation requirements in ASC 810 associated with: (1) determining the consolidation model and assessing control for limited partnerships and similar entities; (2) determining when fees paid to decision makers or service providers are variable interests; and (3) evaluating interests held by de facto agents or related parties of the reporting entity. We adopted the standard upon its effective date in the first quarter 2016. Our adoption did not have a material impact on our Financial Statements. 
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, which requires presentation of debt issuance costs as a direct deduction from the related debt liability rather than as an asset, as presented under previous guidance. We adopted the standard upon its effective date in the first quarter 2016. Our adoption resulted in the reclassification of deferred debt issuance costs from other current assets and other non-current assets of approximately   $2,129   and   $8,168  , respectively, to current maturities of long term debt and long term debt, respectively, in our December 31, 2015 Balance Sheet. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, which requires the recognition of a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for most lease arrangements with a term greater than one year, and increases qualitative and quantitative disclosures regarding leasing transactions. The standard is effective for us in the first quarter 2019, although early adoption is permitted. Transition requires application of the new guidance at the beginning of the earliest comparative balance sheet period presented utilizing a modified retrospective approach. We are assessing the timing of adoption of the new standard and its potential impact on our Financial Statements. 
    In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, which modifies the accounting for excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies associated with share-based payments, and amends the associated cash flow presentation. ASU 2016-09 eliminates the requirement to recognize excess tax benefits in additional paid-in capital ( APIC ), and the requirement to evaluate tax deficiencies for APIC or income tax expense classification, and provides for these benefits or deficiencies to be recorded as an income tax expense or benefit in the income statement. Additionally, tax benefits of dividends on share-based payment awards will also be reflected as an income tax expense or benefit in the income statement. With these changes, tax-related cash flows resulting from share-based payments will be classified as operating activities as opposed to financing, as currently presented. We will adopt the standard upon its effective date in the first quarter 2017 and do not expect that it will have a material impact on our Financial Statements.

The effect of restricted, performance based, stock options and directors  deferred-fee shares were not included in the calculation of diluted EPS for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2015   due to the net loss for the periods. 
      
  4  .   DISPOSITION OF NUCLEAR OPERATIONS    
  As more fully described in our 2015 Annual Report, on December 31, 2015 we completed the sale of our nuclear power construction business (the  Nuclear Operations ), previously included within our Engineering   Construction operating group, to Westinghouse Electric Company LLC ( WEC ) for transaction consideration of approximately   $161,000  , which will be received upon WEC s substantial completion of certain acquired contracts. The present value of the estimated consideration was approximately   $147,000   at   September 30, 2016  , and is recorded within other non-current assets on our Balance Sheet. The imputed interest on the estimated consideration is included within interest income on our Statement of Operations. As a result of the sale, during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, we recorded a non-cash pre-tax charge related to the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets and a loss on net assets held for sale. A summary of the charge is as follows:  

The net tax benefit of the charge was approximately   $256,300  , reflecting the non-deductibility of the goodwill impairment, and resulted in an after-tax charge of approximately   $904,200  . The impact of the loss on net assets held for sale and intangible assets impairment is included in  Loss on net assets held for sale and intangible assets impairment  in our Statement of Operations, and the impact of the goodwill impairment is included in  Goodwill impairment  in our Statement of Operations.  
  Supplemental unaudited revenue and pre-tax income of our former Nuclear Operations is as follows:

6  .   GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLES    
  Goodwill   At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , our goodwill balances were   $3,712,608   and   $3,711,506  , respectively, attributable to the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in connection with our acquisitions. The change in goodwill for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was as follows: 

As discussed further in   Note 2  , goodwill is not amortized to earnings, but instead is reviewed for impairment at least annually at a reporting unit level, absent any indicators of impairment or when other actions require an impairment assessment (such as a change in reporting units). We perform our annual impairment assessment during the fourth quarter of each year based upon balances as of October 1. At   December 31, 2015  , we had the following   seven   reporting units within our   four   operating groups: 
             
    Engineering   Construction   Our Engineering   Construction operating group represented a reporting unit. 
                
    Fabrication Services   Our Fabrication Services operating group included   three   reporting units: Steel Plate Structures, Fabrication   Manufacturing and Engineered Products.  
                
    Technology   Our Technology operating group represented a reporting unit. 
                
    Capital Services   Our Capital Services operating group included   two   reporting units: Facilities   Plant Services and Federal Services. 
     During the three months ended   December 31, 2015  , we performed a quantitative assessment of goodwill for each of the aforementioned reporting units. Based upon these quantitative assessments, the fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded their respective net book values, and accordingly   no   impairment charge was necessary as a result of our impairment assessments.  
  Reporting Unit Realignment   During the three months ended September 30, 2016, our Steel Plate Structures, Fabrication   Manufacturing and Engineered Products operations, all within our Fabrication Services operating group, were integrated and operationally combined. As a result, we reevaluated our reporting units within the Fabrication Services operating group and determined that the Fabrication Services operating group now represented a single reporting unit. In conjunction with the aforementioned reorganization of our Fabrication Services operating group and change in reporting units, we performed a quantitative assessment of goodwill for each of the reporting units immediately before the change in reporting units, and for the new Fabrication Services reporting unit. Based on these quantitative assessments, the fair value of each of the reporting units exceeded their respective net book values, and accordingly,   no   impairment charge was necessary as a result of the change in reporting units. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we had no other changes to our reporting units and no indicators of goodwill impairment were identified for any of our reporting units. If, based on future assessments our goodwill is deemed to be impaired, the impairment would result in a charge to earnings in the period of impairment. There can be no assurance that future goodwill impairment tests will not result in charges to earnings.

  7  .   PARTNERING ARRANGEMENTS    
  As discussed in   Note 2  , we account for our unconsolidated ventures using either proportionate consolidation, when we meet the applicable accounting criteria to do so, or the equity method. Further, we consolidate any venture that is determined to be a VIE for which we are the primary beneficiary, or which we otherwise effectively control. 
  Proportionately Consolidated Ventures   The following is a summary description of our significant joint ventures which     have been accounted for using proportionate consolidation: 
             
    CB I/Zachry   We have a venture with Zachry (CB I   50%   / Zachry   50%  ) to perform EPC work for   two   liquefied natural gas ( LNG ) liquefaction trains in Freeport, Texas. Our proportionate share of the venture project value is approximately   $2,700,000  . In addition, we have subcontract and risk sharing arrangements with Chiyoda to support our responsibilities to the venture. The costs of these arrangements are recorded in cost of revenue. 
                
    CB I/Zachry/Chiyoda   We have a venture with Zachry and Chiyoda (CB I   33.3%   / Zachry   33.3%   / Chiyoda   33.3%  ) to perform EPC work for an additional LNG liquefaction train at the aforementioned project site in Freeport, Texas. Our proportionate share of the venture project value is approximately   $675,000  . 
                
    CB I/Chiyoda   We have a venture with Chiyoda (CB I   50%   / Chiyoda   50%  ) to perform EPC work for   three   LNG liquefaction trains in Hackberry, Louisiana. Our proportionate share of the venture project value is approximately   $3,100,000  . 
     The following table presents summarized balance sheet information for our share of our proportionately consolidated VIEs:

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued) 

(1)   
    Our venture arrangements allow for excess working capital of the ventures to be advanced to the venture partners. Such advances are returned to the venture for working capital needs as necessary. Accordingly, at a reporting period end a venture may have advances to its partners which are reflected as an advance receivable within current assets of the venture. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , other current assets on the Balance Sheet included approximately   $379,200   and   $325,000  , respectively, related to our proportionate share of advances from the ventures to our venture partners, and other current liabilities included approximately   $392,500   and   $334,900  , respectively, related to advances to CB I from the ventures. 
       Equity Method Ventures   The following is a summary description of our significant joint ventures which have been accounted for using the equity method: 
             
    Chevron-Lummus Global ( CLG )   We have a venture with Chevron (CB I   50%   / Chevron   50%  ), which provides licenses, engineering services and catalyst, primarily for the refining industry. As sufficient capital investments in CLG have been made by the venture partners, it does not qualify as a VIE.  
                
    NetPower LLC ( NetPower )   We have a venture with Exelon and 8 Rivers Capital (CB I   33.3%   / Exelon   33.3%   / 8 Rivers Capital   33.3%  ), which was formed for the purpose of developing, commercializing and monetizing a new natural gas power generation system that recovers essentially all the carbon dioxide produced during combustion. NetPower is building a first-of-its-kind demonstration plant which is being funded by contributions and services from the venture partners and other parties. We have determined the venture to be a VIE; however, we do not effectively control NetPower and therefore do not consolidate it. Our cash commitment for NetPower totals   $47,300   and at   September 30, 2016  , we had made cumulative investments totaling approximately   $32,900   of the   $47,300  .  
                
    CB I/CTCI Corporation ( CTCI )   We have a venture with CTCI (CB I   50%   / CTIC   50%  ) to perform EPC work for a liquids ethylene cracker and associated units in Sohar, Oman. We have determined the venture to be a VIE; however, we do not effectively control CB I/CTCI and therefore do not consolidate it. Our proportionate share of the venture project value is approximately   $1,400,000  . Our venture arrangement allows for excess working capital of the venture to be advanced to the venture partners. Such advances are returned to the venture for working capital needs as necessary. At   September 30, 2016  , other current liabilities included approximately   $138,000   related to advances to CB I from the venture.  
     Consolidated Ventures   The following is a summary description of our significant joint ventures we consolidate due to their designation as VIEs for which we are the primary beneficiary: 
             
    CB I/Kentz   We have a venture with Kentz (CB I   65%   / Kentz   35%  ) to perform the structural, mechanical, piping, electrical and instrumentation work on, and to provide commissioning support for,   three   LNG trains, including associated utilities and a gas processing and compression plant, for the Gorgon LNG project, located on Barrow Island, Australia. Our venture project value is approximately   $5,800,000  . 
                
    CB I/AREVA   We have a venture with AREVA (CB I     52%   / AREVA   48%  ) to design, license and construct a mixed oxide fuel fabrication facility in Aiken, South Carolina. Our venture project value is approximately   $5,800,000  . 
     The following table presents summarized balance sheet information for our consolidated VIEs:

Other   The use of these ventures exposes us to a number of risks, including the risk that our partners may be unable or unwilling to provide their share of capital investment to fund the operations of the venture or complete their obligations to us, the venture, or ultimately, our customer. Differences in opinions or views among venture partners could also result in delayed decision-making or failure to agree on material issues, which could adversely affect the business and operations of the venture. In addition, agreement terms may subject us to joint and several liability for our venture partners, and the failure of our venture partners to perform their obligations could impose additional performance and financial obligations on us. The aforementioned factors could result in unanticipated costs to complete the projects, liquidated damages or contract disputes, including claims against our partners. 
   
  8  .   DEBT    
  Our outstanding debt at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   was as follows: 

Committed Facilities   We have a   five  -year,   $1,350,000  , committed and unsecured revolving facility (the  Revolving Facility ) with Bank of America N.A. ( BofA ), as administrative agent, and BNP Paribas Securities Corp., BBVA Compass, Credit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank ( Credit Agricole ) and TD Securities, each as syndication agents, which expires in October 2018. The Revolving Facility has a   $270,000   financial letter of credit sublimit and certain financial and restrictive covenants, including a maximum leverage ratio of   3.25  , a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of   1.75  , and a minimum net worth level calculated as   $1,736,651   at   September 30, 2016  . The Revolving Facility also includes customary restrictions regarding subsidiary indebtedness, sales of assets, liens, investments, type of business conducted, and mergers and acquisitions, and includes a trailing   twelve  -month limitation of   $250,000   for dividend payments and share repurchases if our leverage ratio exceeds   1.50   (unlimited if our leverage ratio is equal to or below   1.50  ), among other restrictions. In addition to interest on debt borrowings, we are assessed quarterly commitment fees on the unutilized portion of the facility as well as letter of credit fees on outstanding instruments. The interest, commitment fee, and letter of credit fee percentages are based upon our quarterly leverage ratio. In the event we borrow funds under the facility, interest is assessed at either prime plus an applicable floating margin (  3.50%   and   0.75%  , respectively at   September 30, 2016  ), or LIBOR plus an applicable floating margin (  0.52%   and   1.75%  , respectively at   September 30, 2016  ). At   September 30, 2016  , we had   $100,000   outstanding borrowings under the facility and   $82,000   of outstanding letters of credit under the facility (  none   of which were financial letters of credit), providing   $1,168,000   of available capacity. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , our weighted average interest rate on borrowings under the facility was approximately   2.2%  , inclusive of the applicable floating margin.

We have a   five  -year,   $800,000  , committed and unsecured revolving credit facility (the  Second Revolving Facility ) with BofA, as administrative agent, and BNP Paribas Securities Corp., BBVA Compass, Credit Agricole and Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ, each as syndication agents, which expires in July 2020. The Second Revolving Facility supplements our Revolving Facility, has a   $50,000   financial letter of credit sublimit and has financial and restrictive covenants similar to those noted above for the Revolving Facility. In addition to interest on debt borrowings, we are assessed quarterly commitment fees on the unutilized portion of the facility as well as letter of credit fees on outstanding instruments. The interest, commitment fee, and letter of credit fee percentages are based upon our quarterly leverage ratio. In the event we borrow funds under the facility, interest is assessed at either prime plus an applicable floating margin (  3.50%   and   0.75%  , respectively at   September 30, 2016  ), or LIBOR plus an applicable floating margin (  0.52%   and   1.75%  , respectively at   September 30, 2016  ). At   September 30, 2016  , we had   $6,000   of outstanding borrowings and   $14,800   of outstanding letters of credit under the facility (including   $2,927   of financial letters of credit), providing   $779,200   of available capacity. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , our weighted average interest rate on borrowings under the facility was approximately   4.2%  , inclusive of the applicable floating margin. 
  Uncommitted Facilities   We also have various short-term, uncommitted letter of credit and borrowing facilities (the  Uncommitted Facilities ) across several geographic regions of approximately   $4,448,065  , of which   $563,000   may be utilized for borrowings. At   September 30, 2016  , we had   $463,000   of outstanding borrowings and   $1,598,766   of outstanding letters of credit under these facilities, providing   $2,386,299   of available capacity, of which   $100,000   may be utilized for borrowings. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , our weighted average interest rate on borrowings under the facilities was approximately   1.6%  . 
  Term Loans   At   September 30, 2016  , we had   $337,500   outstanding on a   four  -year,   $1,000,000   unsecured term loan (the  Term Loan ) with BofA as administrative agent. Interest and principal under the Term Loan is payable quarterly in arrears and bears interest at LIBOR plus an applicable floating margin (  0.52%   and   1.75%  , respectively at   September 30, 2016  ). However, we continue to utilize an interest rate swap to hedge against   $309,313   of the outstanding Term Loan, which resulted in a weighted average interest rate of approximately   2.3%   during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , inclusive of the applicable floating margin. Future annual maturities for the Term Loan are   $37,500   and   $300,000   for the remainder of   2016   and   2017  , respectively. The Term Loan includes financial and restrictive covenants similar to those noted above for the Revolving Facility. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , we had   $500,000   outstanding on a   five  -year,   $500,000   unsecured term loan (the  Second Term Loan ) with BofA as administrative agent. Interest and principal under the Second Term Loan is payable quarterly in arrears beginning in June 2017 and bears interest at LIBOR plus an applicable floating margin (rates are equivalent to the Term Loan). During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , our weighted average interest rate on the Second Term Loan was approximately   2.2%  , inclusive of the applicable floating margin. Future annual maturities for the Second Term Loan are   $56,250  ,   $75,000  ,   $75,000   and   $293,750   for   2017  ,   2018  ,   2019  , and   2020  , respectively. The Second Term Loan has financial and restrictive covenants similar to those noted above for the Revolving Facility.  
  Senior Notes   We have a series of senior notes totaling   $800,000   in the aggregate (the  Senior Notes ) with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner   Smith Incorporated, and Credit Agricole, as administrative agents. The Senior Notes have financial and restrictive covenants similar to those noted above for the Revolving Facility. The Senior Notes include Series A through D, which contain the following terms: 
      We have senior notes totaling   $200,000   (the  Second Senior Notes ) with BofA as administrative agent. Interest is due semi-annually at a fixed rate of   4.53%  , with principal of   $200,000   due in   July 2025  . The Second Senior Notes have financial and restrictive covenants similar to those noted above for the Revolving Facility.  
  Compliance and Other   During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , maximum outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit and other facilities were approximately   $1,444,000  . In addition to providing letters of credit, we also issue surety bonds in the ordinary course of business to support our contract performance. At   September 30, 2016  , we had   $787,878   of outstanding surety bonds. At   September 30, 2016  , we were in compliance with all of our financial and restrictive covenants associated with our debt and revolving credit facilities. Capitalized interest was insignificant for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  .

9  .   FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS    
  Derivatives 
  Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Derivatives   At   September 30, 2016  , the notional value of our outstanding forward contracts to hedge certain foreign exchange-related operating exposures was approximately   $131,500  . These contracts vary in duration, maturing up to   five   years from period-end. We designate certain of these hedges as cash flow hedges and accordingly, changes in their fair value are recognized in AOCI until the associated underlying operating exposure impacts our earnings. Forward points, which are deemed to be an ineffective portion of the hedges, are recognized within cost of revenue and are not material. 
  Interest Rate Derivatives   We continue to utilize a swap arrangement to hedge against interest rate variability associated with   $309,313   of our outstanding   $337,500   Term Loan. The swap arrangement has been designated as a cash flow hedge as its critical terms matched those of the Term Loan at inception and through   September 30, 2016  . Accordingly, changes in the fair value of the swap arrangement are recognized in AOCI until the associated underlying exposure impacts our earnings. 
  Financial Instruments Disclosures 
  Fair Value   Financial instruments are required to be categorized within a valuation hierarchy based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The three levels of the valuation hierarchy are as follows: 
             
    Level 1   Fair value is based upon quoted prices in active markets.  
                
    Level 2   Fair value is based upon internally-developed models that use, as their basis, readily observable market parameters. Our derivative positions are classified within level 2 of the valuation hierarchy as they are valued using quoted market prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets. These level 2 derivatives are valued utilizing an income approach, which discounts future cash flow based upon current market expectations and adjusts for credit risk. 
                
    Level 3   Fair value is based upon internally-developed models that use, as their basis, significant unobservable market parameters. We did not have any level 3 classifications at   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  . 
     The following table presents the fair value of our foreign currency exchange rate derivatives and interest rate derivatives at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, by valuation hierarchy and balance sheet classification: 

(1)   
    We are exposed to credit risk on our hedging instruments associated with potential counterparty non-performance, and the fair value of our derivatives reflects this credit risk. The total level 2 assets at fair value above represent the maximum loss that we would incur on our outstanding hedges if the applicable counterparties failed to perform according to the hedge contracts. To help mitigate counterparty credit risk, we transact only with counterparties that are rated as investment grade or higher and monitor all counterparties on a continuous basis. 
     The carrying values of our cash and cash equivalents (primarily consisting of bank deposits), accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate their fair values because of the short-term nature of these instruments. At   September 30, 2016  , the fair values of our Term Loan and Second Term Loan, based upon the current market rates for debt with similar credit risk and maturities, approximated their carrying values as interest is based upon LIBOR plus an applicable floating margin. Our Senior Notes and Second Senior Notes are categorized within level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. Our Senior Notes had a total fair value of approximately   $808,600   and   $772,600   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, based on current market rates for debt with similar credit risk and maturities. Our Second Senior Notes had a total fair value of approximately   $213,100   and   $203,500   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, based on current market rates for debt with similar credit risk and maturities.

  Legal Proceedings 
  General   We have been and may from time to time be named as a defendant in legal actions claiming damages in connection with engineering and construction projects, technology licenses, other services we provide, and other matters. These are typically claims that arise in the normal course of business, including employment-related claims and contractual disputes or claims for personal injury or property damage which occur in connection with services performed relating to project or construction sites. Contractual disputes normally involve claims relating to the timely completion of projects, performance of equipment or technologies, design or other engineering services or project construction services provided by us. We do not believe that any of our pending contractual, employment-related personal injury or property damage claims and disputes will have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations, financial position or cash flow.

The customer has not provided evidence to substantiate its allegations and we believe all amounts incurred and billed on the project, including outstanding receivables of approximately   $232,000   as of   September 30, 2016  , are contractually due under the provisions of our contract and are recoverable. We do not believe a risk of material loss is probable related to this matter, and accordingly, no amounts have been accrued. Further, we have asserted counterclaims for our outstanding receivables.  
  Dispute Related to Sale of Nuclear Operations   As discussed further in   Note 4  ,   on December 31, 2015, we sold our Nuclear Operations to WEC. In connection with the transaction, a customary post-closing purchase price adjustment mechanism was negotiated to account for any difference between target working capital and actual working capital as finally determined. On April 28, 2016, WEC delivered to us a purported closing statement estimating closing working capital to be negative     $976,506  , which was   $2,150,506   less than target working capital. In contrast, we had calculated closing working capital to be   $1,601,805  , which is   $427,805   greater than target working capital.   On July 21, 2016, we filed a complaint against WEC in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware seeking a declaration that WEC has no remedy for the vast majority of its claims and requesting an injunction barring WEC from bringing such claims. WEC has filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings requesting that the court dismiss our complaint. The court plans to hear oral argument on the motion on November 7, 2016. We do not believe a risk of material loss is probable related to the matters in dispute, and accordingly, no amounts have been accrued. We intend to vigorously pursue this litigation and our rights under the purchase agreement.    
  Asbestos Litigation   We are a defendant in lawsuits wherein plaintiffs allege exposure to asbestos due to work we may have performed at various locations. We have never been a manufacturer, distributor or supplier of asbestos products. Over the past several decades and through   September 30, 2016  , we have been named a defendant in lawsuits alleging exposure to asbestos involving approximately   6,000   plaintiffs and, of those claims, approximately   1,300   claims were pending and   4,700   have been closed through dismissals or settlements. Over the past several decades and through   September 30, 2016  , the claims alleging exposure to asbestos that have been resolved have been dismissed or settled for an average settlement amount of approximately   two thousand   dollars per claim. We review each case on its own merits and make accruals based upon the probability of loss and our estimates of the amount of liability and related expenses, if any. While we have seen an increase in the number of recent filings, especially in one specific venue, we do not believe the increase or any unresolved asserted claims will have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations, financial position or cash flow, and at   September 30, 2016  , we had approximately   $6,900   accrued for liability and related expenses. With respect to unasserted asbestos claims, we cannot identify a population of potential claimants with sufficient certainty to determine the probability of a loss and to make a reasonable estimate of liability, if any. While we continue to pursue recovery for recognized and unrecognized contingent losses through insurance, indemnification arrangements or other sources, we are unable to quantify the amount, if any, that we may expect to recover because of the variability in coverage amounts, limitations and deductibles, or the viability of carriers, with respect to our insurance policies for the years in question. 
  Environmental Matters     Our operations are subject to extensive and changing U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulations, as well as the laws of other countries, that establish health and environmental quality standards. These standards, among others, relate to air and water pollutants and the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes. We are exposed to potential liability for personal injury or property damage caused by any release, spill, exposure or other accident involving such pollutants, substances or wastes.    
  In connection with the historical operation of our facilities, including those associated with acquired operations, substances which currently are or might be considered hazardous were used or disposed of at some sites that will or may require us to make expenditures for remediation. In addition, we have agreed to indemnify parties from whom we have purchased or to whom we have sold facilities for certain environmental liabilities arising from acts occurring before the dates those facilities were transferred.    
  We believe we are in compliance, in all material respects, with environmental laws and regulations and maintain insurance coverage to mitigate our exposure to environmental liabilities. We do not believe any environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations, financial position or cash flow. We do not anticipate we will incur material capital expenditures for environmental controls or for the investigation or remediation of environmental conditions during the remainder of   2016   or   2017  .

  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we repurchased   5,768   shares for   $206,443   (an average price of   $35.79  ), including   $198,166   to purchase   5,522   shares of our outstanding common stock and   $8,277   to purchase   246   shares for taxes withheld on taxable share distributions. 
   
  14  .   UNAPPROVED CHANGE ORDERS, CLAIMS, INCENTIVES AND OTHER CONTRACT RECOVERIES    
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had unapproved change orders and claims included in project price totaling approximately   $78,000   and   $98,500  , respectively, for projects primarily within our Engineering   Construction and Fabrication Services operating groups. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we also had incentives included in project price of approximately   $67,600   and   $99,300  , respectively, for projects in our Engineering   Construction, Fabrication Services and Capital Services operating groups. Of the aforementioned unapproved change orders, claims and incentives, approximately   $123,600   had been recognized as revenue on a cumulative POC basis through   September 30, 2016  . 
  The aforementioned amounts recorded in project price reflect our best estimate of recovery amounts; however, the ultimate resolution and amounts received could differ from these estimates and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flow. See   Note 11   for further discussion of outstanding receivables related to one of our large cost reimbursable projects.

15  .   SEGMENT INFORMATION    
  Our management structure and internal and public segment reporting are aligned based upon the services offered by our   four   operating groups, which represent our reportable segments: Engineering   Construction; Fabrication Services; Technology; and Capital Services. 
  Our Chief Executive Officer evaluates the performance of the aforementioned operating groups based upon revenue and income from operations. Each operating group s income from operations reflects corporate costs, allocated based primarily upon revenue. Intersegment revenue is netted against the revenue of the segment receiving the intersegment services. For the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , intersegment revenue totaled approximately   $78,200   and   $96,800  , respectively, and for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , intersegment revenue totaled approximately   $168,000   and   $320,000  , respectively. Intersegment revenue for the aforementioned periods primarily related to services provided by our Fabrication Services and Capital Services operating groups to our Engineering   Construction operating group. 
  The following table presents total revenue and income from operations by reportable segment for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  :

Item 2.   Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
  The following  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  is provided to assist readers in understanding our financial performance during the periods presented and significant trends that may impact our future performance. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our Financial Statements and the related notes thereto. 
   
  OVERVIEW 
  General   We provide a wide range of services through our four operating groups, including conceptual design, technology, engineering, procurement, fabrication, modularization, construction, commissioning, maintenance, program management and environmental services to customers in the energy infrastructure market throughout the world, and are a provider of diversified government services. Our operating groups, which represent our reportable segments, include: Engineering   Construction; Fabrication Services; Technology; and Capital Services. As discussed in   Note 4   to our Financial Statements, on   December 31, 2015   we completed the sale of our Nuclear Operations, which were previously included within our Engineering   Construction operating group. For comparative purposes only, the results of the disposed Nuclear Operations are presented separately within the discussion and tables below.  
  We continue to be broadly diversified across the global energy infrastructure market. Our geographic diversity is illustrated by approximately   30%   of our year to date   2016   revenue coming from projects outside the U.S. and approximately   20%   of our   September 30, 2016   backlog of   $19.8 billion   (including approximately   $1.8 billion   related to our equity method joint ventures) being comprised of projects outside the U.S. The geographic mix of our revenue will evolve consistent with changes in our backlog mix, as well as shifts in future global energy demand. Our diversity in energy infrastructure end markets ranges from downstream activities such as gas processing, LNG, refining, and petrochemicals, to fossil based power plants and upstream activities such as offshore oil and gas and onshore oil sands projects. Planned investments across the natural gas value chain, including LNG and petrochemicals, remain strong, and we anticipate additional benefits from continued investments in projects based on U.S. shale gas. Global investments in power and petrochemical facilities are expected to continue, as are investments in various types of facilities which require storage structures and pre-fabricated pipe. 
  Our long-term contracts are awarded on a competitively bid and negotiated basis using a range of contracting options, including cost-reimbursable, fixed-price and hybrid, which has both cost-reimbursable and fixed-price characteristics. Under cost-reimbursable contracts, we generally perform our services in exchange for a price that consists of reimbursement of all customer-approved costs and a profit component, which is typically a fixed rate per hour, an overall fixed fee or a percentage of total reimbursable costs. Under fixed-price contracts, we perform our services and execute our projects at an established price. The timing of our revenue recognition may be impacted by the contracting structure of our contracts. Cost-reimbursable contracts, and hybrid contracts with a more significant cost-reimbursable component, generally provide our customers with greater influence over the timing of when we perform our work, and accordingly, such contracts often result in less predictability with respect to the timing of our revenue. Fixed-price contracts, and hybrid contracts with a more significant fixed-price component, tend to provide us with greater control over project schedule and the timing of when work is performed and costs are incurred, and accordingly, when revenue is recognized. Our shorter-term contracts and services are generally provided on a cost-reimbursable, fixed-price or unit price basis. Our   September 30, 2016   backlog distribution by contracting type was approximately   70%   fixed-price, hybrid, or unit based and   30%   cost-reimbursable and is further described below within our operating group discussion. 
  New awards represent the expected revenue value of new contract commitments received during a given period, as well as scope growth on existing commitments. Backlog represents the unearned value of our new awards. New awards and backlog include the entire award values for joint ventures we consolidate and our proportionate share of award values for joint ventures we proportionately consolidate. New awards and backlog also include our pro-rata share of the award values for unconsolidated joint ventures we account for under the equity method. As the net results for our equity method joint ventures are recognized as equity earnings, their revenue is not presented in our Statement of Operations. 
  Backlog for each of our operating groups generally consists of several hundred contracts, which are being executed globally. These contracts vary in size from less than one hundred thousand dollars in contract value to several billion dollars, with varying durations that can exceed five years. The differing types, sizes, and durations of our contracts, combined with their geographic diversity and stages of completion, often results in fluctuations in our quarterly operating group results as a percentage of operating group revenue. In addition, the relative contribution of each of our operating groups, and selling and administrative expense fluctuations, will impact our quarterly consolidated results as a percentage of consolidated revenue. Selling and administrative expense fluctuations are impacted by our stock-based compensation costs, which are generally higher in the first quarter of each year due to the timing of stock awards and the accelerated expensing of awards for participants that are eligible to retire. Although quarterly variability is not unusual in our business, absent the impact of the sale of our Nuclear Operations, which represented approximately   $502.9 million   and   $1.6 billion   of our revenue for the   three and

nine months ended September 30, 2015  , respectively, we are currently not aware of any fundamental change in our backlog or business that would give rise to future operating results that would be significantly different from our recent historical norms. 
  Engineering   Construction   Our Engineering   Construction operating group provides EPC   services for major energy infrastructure facilities. 
  Backlog for our Engineering   Construction operating group comprised approximately   $11.1 billion   (  56%  ) of our consolidated   September 30, 2016   backlog (including approximately   $1.3 billion   related to our equity method joint ventures). The backlog composition by end market was approximately   40%   LNG,   30%   petrochemical,   20%   power,   5%   refining, and   5%   gas processing and other end markets. Our LNG backlog was primarily concentrated in the Asia Pacific and North American regions. We anticipate significant opportunities will be derived from North America and Africa. Our petrochemical backlog was primarily concentrated in the U.S. and the Middle East region and we anticipate significant opportunities will continue to be derived from these regions. Our power backlog was primarily concentrated in the U.S. and we anticipate that our significant future opportunities will be derived from North America. The majority of our refining-related backlog was derived from the Middle East and Russia and we anticipate that our future opportunities will continue to be derived from these regions. Our gas processing projects were primarily concentrated in the U.S. and the Asia Pacific region, where we anticipate continued strength, in addition to the Middle East. Our   September 30, 2016   backlog distribution for this operating group by contracting type was approximately   80%   fixed-price and hybrid and   20%   cost-reimbursable. 
  Fabrication Services   Our Fabrication Services operating group   provides fabrication and erection of steel plate structures; fabrication of piping systems and process modules; manufacturing and distribution of pipe and fittings; and engineered products for the oil and gas, petrochemical, power generation, water and wastewater, mining and mineral processing industries. 
  Backlog for our Fabrication Services operating group comprised approximately   $2.3 billion   (  12%  ) of our consolidated   September 30, 2016   backlog. The backlog composition by end market was approximately   45%   petrochemical,   25%   LNG (including low temp and cryogenic),   15%   power,   5%   refining,   5%   gas processing and   5%   other end markets. Our   September 30, 2016   backlog distribution for this operating group by contracting type was approximately   95%   fixed-price, hybrid, or unit based, with the remainder being cost-reimbursable. 
  Technology   Our Technology operating group   provides licensed process technologies and catalysts for use in petrochemical facilities and oil refineries, and offers process planning and project development services and a comprehensive program of aftermarket support.   Technology also has a 50% owned unconsolidated joint venture that provides licensed technologies, engineering services and catalyst, primarily for the refining industry. 
   Backlog for our Technology operating group comprised approximately   $941.0 million   (  5%  ) of our consolidated   September 30, 2016   backlog (including approximately   $454.9 million   related to our equity method joint ventures) and was primarily comprised of fixed-price contracts.  
  Capital Services   Our Capital Services operating group   provides comprehensive and integrated maintenance services, environmental engineering and remediation, construction services, program management, and disaster response and recovery for private-sector customers and governments. 
  Backlog for our Capital Services operating group comprised approximately   $5.5 billion   (  27%  ) of our consolidated   September 30, 2016   backlog. The backlog composition by end market was approximately   65%   operations and maintenance services,   15%   environmental services,   15%   construction services and   5%   program and project management, and was primarily concentrated in the U.S. Our   September 30, 2016   backlog distribution for this operating group by contracting type was approximately   75%   cost-reimbursable and   25%   fixed-price and unit based.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
  Our backlog, new awards, revenue and income from operations by reportable segment were as follows: 

Consolidated Results 
  New Awards/Backlog   As discussed above, new awards represent the expected revenue value of new contract commitments received during a given period, as well as scope growth on existing commitments. Backlog represents the unearned value of our new awards. New awards and backlog include the entire award values for joint ventures we consolidate and our proportionate share of award values for joint ventures we proportionately consolidate. New awards and backlog also include our pro-rata share of the award values for unconsolidated joint ventures we account for under the equity method. As the net results for our equity method joint ventures are recognized as equity earnings, their revenue is not presented in our Statement of Operations. Our new awards may vary significantly each reporting period based upon the timing of our major new contract commitments.

     Table of Contents  

New awards were   $2.7 billion   for the   third quarter 2016   (including approximately   $17.0 million   related to our equity method joint ventures), compared with   $4.0 billion   for the corresponding   2015   period. Significant new awards for the   third quarter 2016   included a gas turbine power project in the U.S. (approximately $600.0 million); a refinery project in Russia (approximately $460.0 million); and federal funding allocations for our mixed oxide fuel fabrication facility project in the U.S. and scope increases for our LNG mechanical erection project in the Asia Pacific region (approximately $365.0 million combined), all within our Engineering   Construction operating group; and refinery maintenance services in North America (approximately $320.0 million combined) within our Capital Services operating group. Significant new awards for the   third quarter 2015   included petrochemical facility projects in the U.S. (approximately $1.8 billion combined); and federal funding allocations for our mixed oxide fuel fabrication facility project in the U.S. and scope increases for our LNG mechanical erection project in the Asia Pacific region (approximately $520.0 million combined), all within our Engineering   Construction operating group.  
  New awards were   $5.7 billion   for the   first nine months of     2016   (including approximately   $84.0 million   related to our equity method joint ventures), compared with   $9.9 billion   for the corresponding 2015 period. The nine month 2016 period included the aforementioned third quarter 2016 awards, and awards in the first half of 2016, including scope increases for our LNG mechanical erection project in the Asia Pacific region (approximately $515.0 million); and two gas turbine power projects in the U.S. (approximately $500.0 million combined) for our Engineering   Construction operating group. The nine month 2015 period included the aforementioned third quarter 2015 awards, and awards in the first half of 2015, including our proportionate share of a $2.0 billion additional LNG train for an LNG export facility in the U.S. (approximately $675.0 million) that we are executing through a proportionately consolidated joint venture arrangement; a gas turbine power project in the U.S. (approximately $600.0 million); and federal funding allocations for our mixed oxide fuel fabrication facility project in the U.S. and scope increases for our LNG mechanical erection project in the Asia Pacific region (approximately $360.0 million combined), all within our Engineering   Construction operating group; and refinery maintenance services in North America (approximately $310.0 million combined) for our Capital Services operating group. See   Operating Group Results   below for further discussion. 
  Backlog at   September 30, 2016   was approximately   $19.8 billion   (including approximately   $1.8 billion   related to our equity method joint ventures), compared with   $22.6 billion   at   December 31, 2015   (including approximately $1.8 billion related to our equity method joint ventures), with the decrease reflecting the impact of revenue exceeding new awards by   $2.5 billion   and other adjustments, primarily related to reductions in maintenance backlog for our Capital Services operating group. 
  Certain contracts within our Capital Services and Engineering   Construction operating groups are dependent upon funding from the U.S. government, where funds are appropriated on a year-by-year basis, while contract performance may take more than one year. Approximately   $1.1 billion   of our backlog at   September 30, 2016   for these operating groups was for contractual commitments that are subject to future funding decisions. 
  Revenue   Revenue was   $2.8 billion   for the   third quarter 2016  , representing a   decrease   of   $545.5 million   (  16.4%  ) compared with the corresponding   2015   period. Revenue was   $8.1 billion   for the   first nine months of     2016  , representing a   decrease   of   $1.5 billion   (  15.7%  ) compared with the corresponding   2015   period. Our third quarter and year-to-date 2015 revenue included approximately   $502.9 million   and   $1.6 billion  , respectively, of revenue attributable to our former Nuclear Operations. The table below summarizes our third quarter and year-to-date   2015   revenue excluding the Nuclear Operations.  

Excluding the impact of our former Nuclear Operations, revenue for the   third quarter 2016   decreased by   $42.6 million   (  1.5%  ) compared with the corresponding 2015 period, and revenue for the first nine months of 2016 increased by   $40.5 million   (  0.5%  ) compared with the corresponding 2015 period. Our third quarter and year-to-date 2016 revenue benefited from increased activity on our LNG export facility projects in the U.S. within our Engineering   Construction operating group; offset by the wind down of various tank projects in North America, South America and the Asia Pacific region within our Fabrication Services operating group; a reduction in plant maintenance activity within our Capital Services operating group; and decreased activity on our large cost reimbursable LNG mechanical erection project in the Asia Pacific region and refinery project in Colombia within our Engineering   Construction operating group. Our revenue for the first half of 2016 also benefited from increased activity on other projects in the U.S. and Asia Pacific region within our Engineering   Construction operating group. See   Operating Group Results   below for further discussion.

Gross Profit   Gross profit was   $326.6 million   (  11.8%   of revenue) for the   third quarter 2016  , compared with   $377.7 million   (  11.4%   of revenue) for the corresponding   2015   period. Gross profit was   $908.7 million   (  11.2%   of revenue) for the first nine months of 2016, compared with   $1.1 billion   (  11.7%   of revenue) for the corresponding   2015   period. Our third quarter and year-to-date 2015 results included approximately   $52.2 million   and   $182.4 million  , respectively, of gross profit attributable to our former Nuclear Operations. The table below summarizes our third quarter and year-to-date   2015   gross profit excluding the Nuclear Operations. 

Excluding the impact of our former Nuclear Operations, gross profit was approximately   $325.5 million   (  11.5%   of revenue) for the   third quarter     2015   and   $948.6 million   (  11.7%   of revenue) for the first nine months of   2015  . Our third quarter 2016 gross profit percentage increased compared to the 2015 period due to the net impact of changes in estimated recoveries and changes in forecast costs on certain projects, partly offset by a lower margin mix. Our year-to-date 2016 gross profit percentage decreased compared to the 2015 period due to the first half of 2016 impacts of lower revenue volume for our higher margin Technology operating group, a lower margin mix, and reduced leverage of our operating costs, partly offset by the aforementioned third quarter 2016 impacts. See   Operating Group Results   below for further discussion.  
  Selling and Administrative Expense   Selling and administrative expense was   $87.8 million   (  3.2%   of revenue) for the   third quarter 2016  , compared with   $93.7 million   (  2.8%   of revenue) for the corresponding   2015   period. Selling and administrative expense was   $263.1 million   (  3.2%   of revenue) for the first nine months of   2016  , compared with   $287.9 million   (  3.0%   of revenue) for the corresponding   2015   period. The decrease for the third quarter and year-to-date 2016 was primarily due to lower incentive plan costs (approximately $1.5 million and $21.5 million, respectively) and lower expense attributable to our former Nuclear Operations, partly offset by inflationary increases. Our third quarter 2016 expense also benefited from of our cost reduction initiatives. Our stock-based compensation costs, which are predominantly in selling and administrative expense, are generally higher in the first quarter of each year due to the timing of stock awards and the accelerated expensing of awards for participants that are eligible to retire. Stock-based compensation expense totaled approximately   $31.0 million   and   $49.2 million   for the first nine months of   2016   and   2015  , respectively, or 76% and 88% of estimated annual expense for each of the respective periods. 
  Intangibles Amortization   Intangibles amortization was   $10.5 million   and   $32.3 million   for the   third quarter   and first nine months of   2016  , respectively, compared with   $14.9 million   and   $45.5 million   for the corresponding   2015   periods. The decrease relative to the   2015   periods was primarily due to lower intangible balances resulting from the impairment of certain intangible assets in the third quarter 2015 and intangible assets that became fully amortized during the first quarter 2016. 
  Equity Earnings   Equity earnings were   $5.4 million   and   $11.4 million   for the   third quarter   and first nine months of   2016  , respectively, compared with   $1.2 million   and   $5.8 million   for the corresponding   2015   periods and were primarily associated with our unconsolidated CLG and CTCI joint ventures within our Technology and Engineering   Construction operating groups, respectively. 
  Loss on Net Assets Held For Sale and Impairment of Intangible Assets and Goodwill   As a result of the Agreement to sell our Nuclear Operations discussed in   Note 4   to our Financial Statements, during the third quarter 2015, we recorded a non-cash charge of approximately $1.2 billion related to the impairment of goodwill (  $453.1 million  ) and intangible assets (  $79.1 million  ) and an estimated loss on net assets held for sale (  $628.3 million  ). 
  Other Operating Expense (Income), Net     Other operating expense (income), net   generally represents (gains) losses associated with the sale or disposition of property and equipment. For the first nine months of   2015  ,   other operating expense (income), net   also included a gain of approximately   $7.5 million   related to the contribution of a technology to our unconsolidated CLG joint venture and a foreign exchange loss of approximately   $11.0 million   associated with the re-measurement of certain non-U.S. Dollar denominated net assets, both of which occurred during the first quarter 2015.

Income (Loss) from Operations    Income from operations was   $233.5 million   (  8.4%   of revenue) for the   third quarter 2016  , compared with a loss from operations of   $(890.0) million   (  26.8%   of revenue) for the corresponding   2015   period. Income from operations was   $623.6 million   (  7.7%   of revenue) for the first nine months of 2016, compared with a loss from operations of   $(359.1) million   (  3.7%   of revenue) for the corresponding   2015   period. Our third quarter and year-to-date 2015 results included approximately   $45.7 million   and   $163.1 million  , respectively, of income from operations attributable to our former Nuclear Operations and the aforementioned charge of approximately $1.2 billion resulting from the Agreement to sell our Nuclear Operations. The table below summarizes our third quarter and year-to-date   2015   income from operations excluding the Nuclear Operations and charge. 

Excluding the impact of our former Nuclear Operations and charge, income from operations was approximately   $224.8 million   (  8.0%   of revenue) for the   third quarter     2015   and approximately   $638.3 million   (  7.9%   of revenue) for the first nine months of 2015. The changes in our third quarter and year-to-date 2016 income from operations compared to the 2015 periods were due to the reasons noted above. See   Operating Group Results   below for further discussion.  
  Interest Expense and Interest Income   Interest expense was   $26.4 million   for the   third quarter 2016  , compared with   $25.0 million   for the corresponding   2015   period. Interest expense was   $78.4 million   for the first nine months of 2016, compared with   $68.4 million   for the corresponding   2015   period. Our third quarter and year-to-date   2016   periods were impacted by higher revolving credit facility borrowings. Our year-to-date 2016 period was also impacted by higher long-term borrowings, which occurred in the third quarter 2015. Interest income was   $2.6 million   for the   third quarter 2016  , compared with   $2.1 million   for the corresponding   2015   period. Interest income was   $8.2 million   for the first nine months of 2016, compared with   $6.3 million   for the corresponding   2015   period.  
  Income Tax (Expense) Benefit   Income tax expense was   $41.3 million   (  19.7%   of pre-tax income) for the third quarter 2016, compared with an income tax benefit of   $187.4 million   (  20.5%   of pre-tax loss) for the corresponding   2015   period. Income tax expense was   $132.4 million   (  23.9%   of pre-tax income) for the first nine months of 2016, compared with an income tax benefit of   $38.3 million   (  9.1%   of pre-tax loss) for the corresponding   2015   period. The aforementioned $1.2 billion charge during the third quarter 2015 related to the Agreement to sell our Nuclear Operations resulted in a net tax benefit of $256.3 million during the third quarter and year-to-date 2015 periods. Excluding this net benefit, our income tax expense for the third quarter and first nine months of 2015 was $68.9 million and $218.0 million, respectively (27.8% and 29.5%, respectively, of pre-tax income excluding the charge).  
  Our third quarter 2016 tax rate benefited from anticipated lower full year pre-tax income in higher tax rate jurisdictions, primarily the U.S. (approximately 3.0%) and previously unrecognized tax benefits (approximately 3.5%). Our year-to-date 2016 tax rate was impacted by the aforementioned, as well as the first half of 2016 benefiting from previously unrecognized tax benefits, changes in tax laws relating to our U.S. state deferred tax assets and changes in tax rates relating to our non-U.S. deferred tax assets (approximately 2.5% combined). Our third quarter and year-to-date 2015 tax rates benefited from previously unrecognized tax benefits and other adjustments recorded during the periods (approximately 4.0% and 3.0%, respectively).  
  Our third quarter and year-to-date 2016 tax rates decreased relative to the   2015   periods, excluding the impact of the charge, due to anticipated lower pre-tax income in higher tax rate jurisdictions, primarily the U.S., and a greater benefit from pre-tax income represented by noncontrolling interests (approximately 5.5% combined, for both the third quarter and year-to-date periods). Our tax rate may continue to experience fluctuations due primarily to changes in the geographic distribution of our pre-tax income.  
  Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests   Noncontrolling interests are primarily associated with our consolidated joint venture projects within our Engineering   Construction operating group and certain operations in the U.S. and Middle East within our Capital Services and Fabrication Services operating groups. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was   $46.7 million   for the   third quarter 2016  , compared with   $14.9 million   for the corresponding   2015   period. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was   $68.4 million   for the first nine months of 2016, compared with   $55.8 million   for the corresponding   2015   period. The change compared to the   2015   periods was commensurate with the level

Revenue was   $4.7 billion   for the first nine months of 2016, representing a   decrease   of   $961.5 million   (  16.9%  ) compared with the corresponding   2015   period. Our   third quarter   and   year-to-date     2015   revenue included approximately   $502.9 million   and   $1.6 billion  , respectively, of revenue attributable to our former Nuclear Operations. The table below summarizes our third quarter and year-to-date 2015 revenue excluding the Nuclear Operations.  

Excluding the impact of our former Nuclear Operations, revenue for the   third quarter     2016   increased by   $216.6 million   (  15.0%  ) compared with the corresponding   2015   period, and revenue for the first nine months of   2016   increased by   $594.0 million   (  14.4%  ) compared with the corresponding   2015   period. Our third quarter and year-to-date   2016   revenue benefited from increased activity on our LNG export facility projects in the U.S. (approximately   $300.0 million   and   $980.0 million  , respectively) and various other projects in the U.S. and Asia Pacific region, partly offset by decreased activity on our large cost reimbursable LNG mechanical erection project in the Asia Pacific region and refinery project in Colombia (approximately   $90.0 million   and   $620.0 million   combined, respectively). 
  Approximately   $640.0 million   and   $1.7 billion   of the operating group s quarter and year-to-date   2016   revenue, respectively, was attributable to our LNG export facility projects in the U.S., compared with approximately   $340.0 million   and   $730.0 million  , respectively, for the corresponding   2015   periods. Approximately   $380.0 million   and   $1.0 billion   of the operating group s quarter and year-to-date   2016   revenue, respectively, was attributable to our large cost reimbursable projects, compared with approximately   $470.0 million   and   $1.6 billion  , respectively, for the corresponding   2015   periods.  
  Income (Loss) from Operations   Income from operations was   $133.9 million   (  8.1%   of revenue) for the   third quarter 2016  , compared with a loss from operations of   $(1.0) billion   (  51.8%   of revenue) for the corresponding   2015   period. Income from operations was   $341.5 million   (  7.2%   of revenue) for the first nine months of 2016, compared with a loss from operations of   $(694.5) million   (  12.2%   of revenue) for the corresponding   2015   period. Our   third quarter   and   year-to-date     2015   results included approximately   $45.7 million   and   $163.1 million  , respectively, of income from operations attributable to our former

Nuclear Operations and the aforementioned charge of approximately $1.2 billion resulting from the Agreement to sell our Nuclear Operations. The results for the year-to-date 2015 period for our former Nuclear Operations benefited by approximately $28.0 million from the net impact of cost increases and adjustments to project price on our former large U.S. nuclear projects during the first half of 2015. The table below summarizes our third quarter and year-to-date 2015 income from operations excluding the Nuclear Operations and charge.  

Excluding the impact of our former Nuclear Operations and the charge, income from operations was approximately   $107.4 million   (  7.4%   of revenue) for the   third quarter 2015   and approximately   $302.9 million   (  7.3%   of revenue) for the first nine months of 2015. Our third quarter 2016 results benefited from changes in estimated recoveries on a large consolidated joint venture project that is nearing completion and increased recoveries on another project. This benefit was substantially offset by the impact of cost increases on two projects (approximately $104.0 million combined), one of which is substantially complete. The other project is now in a loss position and our estimate to complete was impacted by lower than anticipated labor productivity. Our third quarter 2016 results also benefited from higher revenue volume and leverage of operating costs. Our year-to-date 2016 results were impacted by the aforementioned third quarter impacts, as well as impacts during the first half of 2016, including net cost increases on various projects, primarily in the U.S. (approximately $14.0 million combined), and a lower margin mix, partly offset by the benefit of higher revenue volume.  
  Fabrication Services

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
  General 
  Cash and Cash Equivalents   At   September 30, 2016  , our cash and cash equivalents were   $615.0 million  , and were maintained in local accounts throughout the world, substantially all of which were maintained outside The Netherlands, our country of domicile. With the exception of   $406.2 million   of cash and cash equivalents within our variable interest entities ( VIEs ) associated with our partnering arrangements, which is generally only available for use in our operating activities when distributed to the partners, we are not aware of any material restrictions on our cash and cash equivalents.  
  With respect to tax consequences associated with repatriating our foreign earnings, distributions from our European Union ( EU ) subsidiaries to their Netherlands parent companies are not subject to taxation. Further, for our non-EU companies and their subsidiaries and our U.S. companies, to the extent taxes apply, the amount of permanently reinvested earnings becomes taxable upon repatriation of assets from the subsidiary or liquidation of the subsidiary. We have accrued taxes on undistributed earnings that we intend to repatriate and we intend to permanently reinvest the remaining undistributed earnings in their respective businesses, and accordingly, have accrued no taxes on such amounts.  
  Summary of Cash Flow Activity 
  Operating Activities   During the   first nine months of     2016  , net cash   provided by   operating activities was   $495.0 million  , primarily resulting from cash generated from earnings, offset by a net change of   $145.1 million   in our accounts receivable, inventory, accounts payable and net contracts in progress account balances (collectively  Contract Capital ). During the   third quarter 2016  , net cash provided by operating activities was   $175.8 million  , primarily resulting from cash generated from earnings. The components of our net Contract Capital balances at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , and changes during the   first nine months of     2016  , were as follows: 

(1)   
    Represents our cash position relative to revenue recognized on projects, with (i) billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings representing a liability reflective of future cash expenditures and non-cash earnings, and (ii) costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings representing an asset reflective of future cash receipts. 
     Fluctuations in our Contract Capital balance, and its components, are not unusual in our business and are impacted by the size of our projects and changing mix of cost-reimbursable versus fixed-price backlog. Our cost-reimbursable projects tend to have a greater working capital requirement ( costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings ), while our fixed-price projects are generally structured to be cash flow positive ( billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings ). Our Contract Capital is particularly impacted by the timing of new awards and related payments in advance of performing work, and the achievement of billing milestones on backlog as we complete certain phases of work. Contract Capital is also impacted at period-end by the timing of accounts receivable collections and accounts payable payments for our large projects.  
  The   $145.1 million   increase in our Contract Capital during the   first nine months of     2016   was primarily due to a net increase in contracts in progress and accounts receivable, partly offset by a decrease in inventory and an increase in accounts payable. The net increase in contracts in progress and accounts receivable is primarily due to the net use of advance payments on our large projects in the U.S. The decrease in inventory is related to our fabrication projects and the timing of awards. Our net cash provided by operating activities, combined with payments in advance of performing work for our unconsolidated equity method joint ventures, which are reflected in financing activities because the joint ventures are not consolidated, totaled approximately   $633.0 million   during the   first nine months of     2016  .

Although we anticipate future quarterly variability in our operating cash flows due to ongoing fluctuations in our Contract Capital balance, we expect cash flows from operating activities to approximate earnings for   2016  , and we believe our anticipated future operating cash flows and capacity under our revolving and other credit facilities will be sufficient to finance our capital expenditures, settle our commitments and contingencies and address our working capital needs for the foreseeable future. 
  Investing Activities   During the   first nine months of     2016  , net cash used in investing activities was   $151.7 million  , primarily related to net advances of   $54.2 million   to our venture partners by our proportionately consolidated ventures (see   Note 7   to our Financial Statements for further discussion), capital expenditures of   $37.9 million   and other investments of   $62.6 million  . We will continue to evaluate and selectively pursue other opportunities for additional expansion of our business through the acquisition of complementary businesses and technologies. These acquisitions may involve the use of cash or may require further debt or equity financing. 
  Financing Activities   During the   first nine months of     2016  , net cash used in financing activities was   $268.4 million  , primarily related to net revolving facility and other short-term repayments of   $84.0 million  , repayments on our long-term debt of   $112.5 million  , share repurchases totaling   $206.4 million   (  5.8 million   shares at an average price of   $35.79   per share), including   $198.2 million   to purchase   5.5 million   shares of our outstanding common stock and   $8.3 million   to repurchase   0.2 million   shares associated with stock-based compensation-related withholding taxes on taxable share distributions, distributions to our noncontrolling interest partners of   $51.9 million   and dividends paid to our shareholders of   $21.7 million  . These cash outflows were partly offset by net advances from our equity method and proportionately consolidated ventures of   $195.6 million   (see   Note 7   to our Financial Statements for further discussion) and cash proceeds from the issuance of shares associated with our stock plans of   $12.4 million  .  
  Effect of Exchange Rate Changes on Cash and Cash Equivalents   During the   first nine months of     2016  , our cash and cash equivalents balance   decreased   by   $10.2 million   due to the impact of changes in functional currency exchange rates against the U.S. Dollar for non-U.S. Dollar cash balances, primarily for net changes in the   Australian Dollar  ,   British Pound  ,   Colombian Peso   and   Euro   exchange rates. The net unrealized   loss   on our cash and cash equivalents resulting from these exchange rate movements is reflected in the cumulative translation adjustment component of OCI. Our cash and cash equivalents held in non-U.S. Dollar currencies are used primarily for project-related and other operating expenditures in those currencies, and therefore, our exposure to realized exchange gains and losses is not anticipated to be material.  
  Credit Facilities and Debt 
  General   Our primary internal source of liquidity is cash flow generated from operations. Capacity under our revolving credit and other facilities discussed below is also available, if necessary, to fund operating or investing activities and provide necessary letters of credit. Letters of credit are generally issued to customers in the ordinary course of business to support advance payments and performance guarantees, in lieu of retention on our contracts, or in certain cases, are issued in support of our insurance programs.  
  Committed Facilities   We have a   five  -year,   $1.35 billion  , committed and unsecured revolving facility (the  Revolving Facility ) with Bank of America N.A. ( BofA ), as administrative agent, and BNP Paribas Securities Corp., BBVA Compass, Credit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank ( Credit Agricole ) and TD Securities, each as syndication agents, which expires in October 2018. The Revolving Facility has a   $270.0 million   financial letter of credit sublimit and certain financial and restrictive covenants, including a maximum leverage ratio of   3.25  , a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of   1.75  , and a minimum net worth level calculated as   $1.7 billion   at   September 30, 2016  . The Revolving Facility also includes customary restrictions regarding subsidiary indebtedness, sales of assets, liens, investments, type of business conducted, and mergers and acquisitions, and includes a trailing twelve-month limitation of   $250.0 million   for dividend payments and share repurchases if our leverage ratio exceeds   1.50   (unlimited if our leverage ratio is equal to or below   1.50  ), among other restrictions. In addition to interest on debt borrowings, we are assessed quarterly commitment fees on the unutilized portion of the facility as well as letter of credit fees on outstanding instruments. The interest, commitment fee, and letter of credit fee percentages are based upon our quarterly leverage ratio. In the event we borrow funds under the facility, interest is assessed at either prime plus an applicable floating margin (  3.50%   and   0.75%  , respectively at   September 30, 2016  ), or LIBOR plus an applicable floating margin (  0.52%   and   1.75%  , respectively at   September 30, 2016  ). At   September 30, 2016  , we had   $100.0 million   outstanding borrowings under the facility and   $82.0 million   of outstanding letters of credit under the facility (none of which were financial letters of credit), providing   $1.2 billion   of available capacity. During the first nine months of 2016, our weighted average interest rate on borrowings under the facility was approximately   2.2%  , inclusive of the applicable floating margin. 
  We have a   five  -year,   $800.0 million  , committed and unsecured revolving credit facility (the  Second Revolving Facility ) with BofA, as administrative agent, and BNP Paribas Securities Corp., BBVA Compass, Credit Agricole and Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ, each as syndication agents, which expires in July 2020. The Second Revolving Facility supplements our Revolving Facility, has a   $50.0 million   financial letter of credit sublimit and has financial and restrictive covenants similar to those noted above for the Revolving Facility. In addition to interest on debt borrowings, we are assessed quarterly commitment

fees on the unutilized portion of the facility as well as letter of credit fees on outstanding instruments. The interest, commitment fee, and letter of credit fee percentages are based upon our quarterly leverage ratio. In the event we borrow funds under the facility, interest is assessed at either prime plus an applicable floating margin (  3.50%   and   0.75%  , respectively at   September 30, 2016  ), or LIBOR plus an applicable floating margin (  0.52%   and   1.75%  , respectively at   September 30, 2016  ). At   September 30, 2016  , we had   $6.0 million   of outstanding borrowings and   $14.8 million   of outstanding letters of credit under the facility (including   $2.9 million   of financial letters of credit), providing   $779.2 million   of available capacity. During the first nine months of 2016, our weighted average interest rate on borrowings under the facility was approximately   4.2%  , inclusive of the applicable floating margin.  
    Uncommitted Facilities   We also have various short-term, uncommitted letter of credit and borrowing facilities (the  Uncommitted Facilities ) across several geographic regions of approximately   $4.4 billion  , of which   $563.0 million   may be utilized for borrowings. At   September 30, 2016  , we had   $463.0 million   of outstanding borrowings and   $1.6 billion   of outstanding letters of credit under these facilities, providing   $2.4 billion   of available capacity, of which   $100.0 million   may be utilized for borrowings. During the first nine months of 2016, our weighted average interest rate on borrowings under the facilities was approximately   1.6%  . 
  Term Loans   At   September 30, 2016  , we had   $337.5 million   outstanding on a   four  -year,   $1.0 billion   unsecured term loan (the  Term Loan ) with BofA as administrative agent. Interest and principal under the Term Loan is payable quarterly in arrears and bears interest at LIBOR plus an applicable floating margin (  0.52%   and   1.75%  , respectively at   September 30, 2016  ). However, we continue to utilize an interest rate swap to hedge against   $309.3 million   of the outstanding Term Loan, which resulted in a weighted average interest rate of approximately   2.3%   during the first nine months of 2016, inclusive of the applicable floating margin. Future annual maturities for the Term Loan are   $37.5 million   and   $300.0 million   for the remainder of   2016   and   2017  , respectively. The Term Loan includes financial and restrictive covenants similar to those noted above for the Revolving Facility.  
  At   September 30, 2016  , we had   $500.0 million   outstanding on a   five  -year,   $500.0 million   unsecured term loan (the  Second Term Loan ) with BofA as administrative agent. Interest and principal under the Second Term Loan is payable quarterly in arrears beginning in June 2017 and bears interest at LIBOR plus an applicable floating margin (rates are equivalent to the Term Loan). During the first nine months of 2016, our weighted average interest rate on the Second Term Loan was approximately   2.2%  , inclusive of the applicable floating margin. Future annual maturities for the Second Term Loan are   $56.3 million  ,   $75.0 million  ,   $75.0 million   and   $293.8 million   for   2017  ,   2018  ,   2019  , and   2020  , respectively. The Second Term Loan has financial and restrictive covenants similar to those noted above for the Revolving Facility. 
  Senior Notes   We have a series of senior notes totaling   $800.0 million   in the aggregate (the  Senior Notes ) with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner   Smith Incorporated, and Credit Agricole, as administrative agents. The Senior Notes have financial and restrictive covenants similar to those noted above for the Revolving Facility. The Senior Notes include Series A through D, which contain the following terms: 
      We have senior notes totaling   $200.0 million   (the  Second Senior Notes ) with BofA as administrative agent. Interest is due semi-annually at a fixed rate of   4.53%  , with principal of   $200.0 million   due in   July 2025  . The Second Senior Notes have financial and restrictive covenants similar to those noted above for the Revolving Facility.  
  Compliance and Other   During the first nine months of 2016, maximum outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit and other facilities were approximately   $1.4 billion  . In addition to providing letters of credit, we also issue surety bonds in the ordinary course of business to support our contract performance. At   September 30, 2016  , we had   $787.9 million   of outstanding surety bonds.  
  At   September 30, 2016  , we were in compliance with all of our financial and restrictive covenants associated with our debt and revolving credit and other facilities, with a leverage ratio of   2.55  , a fixed charge coverage ratio of   4.64  , and net worth of   $2.2 billion  . Our ability to remain in compliance with our lending facilities could be impacted by circumstances or conditions beyond our control, including, but not limited to, the delay or cancellation of projects, changes in foreign currency exchange or interest rates, performance of pension plan assets, or changes in actuarial assumptions. Further, we could be impacted if our customers experience a material change in their ability to pay us or if the banks associated with our lending facilities were to cease or reduce operations, or if there is a full or partial break-up of the EU or its currency, the Euro.

Other 
  We believe our cash on hand, cash generated from operations, amounts available under our Revolving Facility and Second Revolving Facility (collectively,  Committed Facilities ) and Uncommitted Facilities, and other external sources of liquidity, such as the issuance of debt and equity instruments, will be sufficient to finance our capital expenditures, settle our commitments and contingencies (as more fully described in   Note 11   to our Financial Statements) and address our working capital needs for the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that such funding will continue to be available, as our ability to generate cash flows from operations and our ability to access funding under our Committed Facilities and Uncommitted Facilities at reasonable terms, may be impacted by a variety of business, economic, legislative, financial and other factors, which may be outside of our control. 
  Additionally, while we currently have significant uncommitted bonding facilities, primarily to support various commercial provisions in our contracts, a termination or reduction of these bonding facilities could result in the utilization of letters of credit in lieu of performance bonds, thereby reducing the available capacity under the Committed Facilities. Although we do not anticipate a reduction or termination of the bonding facilities, there can be no assurance that such facilities will continue to be available at reasonable terms to service our ordinary course obligations. 
  A portion of our pension plans  assets are invested in EU government securities, which could be impacted by economic turmoil in Europe or a full or partial break-up of the EU or its currency, the Euro. However, given the long-term nature of pension funding requirements, in the event any of our pension plans (including those with investments in EU government securities) become materially underfunded from a decline in value of our plan assets, we believe our cash on hand and amounts available under our existing Committed Facilities and Uncommitted Facilities would be sufficient to fund any increases in future contribution requirements. 
  We are a defendant in a number of lawsuits arising in the normal course of business and we have in place appropriate insurance coverage for the type of work that we perform. As a matter of standard policy, we review our litigation accrual quarterly and as further information is known on pending cases, increases or decreases, as appropriate, may be recorded. See   Note 11   to our Financial Statements for a discussion of pending litigation. 
   
  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 
  We use operating leases for facilities and equipment when they make economic sense, including sale-leaseback arrangements. Our sale-leaseback arrangements are not material to our Financial Statements, and we have no other significant off-balance sheet arrangements. 
   
  NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS 
  See the applicable section of   Note 2   to our Financial Statements for a discussion of new accounting standards. 
   
  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES 
  The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these Financial Statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We continually evaluate our estimates based upon historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Supervisory Board. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our Financial Statements. 
  Revenue Recognition 
  Our revenue is primarily derived from long-term contracts and is generally recognized using the POC method, primarily based on the percentage that actual costs-to-date bear to total estimated costs to complete each contract. We follow the guidance of FASB ASC Revenue Recognition Topic 605-35 for accounting policies relating to our use of the POC method, estimating costs, and revenue recognition, including the recognition of incentive fees, unapproved change orders and claims, and combining and segmenting contracts. We primarily utilize the cost-to-cost approach to estimate POC as we believe this method is less subjective than relying on assessments of physical progress. Under the cost-to-cost approach, the use of estimated costs to complete each contract is a significant variable in the process of determining recognized revenue and is a significant factor in the accounting for contracts. Significant estimates that impact the cost to complete each contract are costs of engineering, materials, components, equipment, labor and subcontracts; labor productivity; schedule durations, including subcontractor or supplier progress; liquidated damages; contract disputes, including claims; achievement of contractual performance requirements; and contingency, among others. The cumulative impact of revisions in total cost estimates during the progress of work is reflected in the period in which these changes become known, including, to the extent required, the reversal of profit  
  
   38 

     Table of Contents  

recognized in prior periods and the recognition of losses expected to be incurred on contracts in progress. Due to the various estimates inherent in our contract accounting, actual results could differ from those estimates. 
  Our long-term contracts are awarded on a competitively bid and negotiated basis and the timing of revenue recognition may be impacted by the terms of such contracts. We use a range of contracting options, including cost-reimbursable, fixed-price and hybrid, which has both cost-reimbursable and fixed-price characteristics. Fixed-price contracts, and hybrid contracts with a more significant fixed-price component, tend to provide us with greater control over project schedule and the timing of when work is performed and costs are incurred, and accordingly, when revenue is recognized. Cost-reimbursable contracts, and hybrid contracts with a more significant cost-reimbursable component, generally provide our customers with greater influence over the timing of when we perform our work, and accordingly, such contracts often result in less predictability with respect to the timing of revenue recognition. Contract revenue for our long-term contracts recognized under the POC method reflects the original contract price adjusted for approved change orders and estimated recoveries for incentive fees, unapproved change orders and claims. We recognize revenue associated with incentive fees when the value can be reliably estimated and recovery is probable. We recognize revenue associated with unapproved change orders and claims to the extent the related costs have been incurred, the value can be reliably estimated and recovery is probable. Our recorded incentive fees, unapproved change orders and claims reflect our best estimate of recovery amounts; however, the ultimate resolution and amounts received could differ from these estimates. See   Note 14   to our Financial Statements for additional discussion of our recorded unapproved change orders, claims and incentives. 
  With respect to our EPC services, our contracts are not segmented between types of services, such as engineering and construction, if each of the EPC components is negotiated concurrently or if the pricing of any such services is subject to the ultimate negotiation and agreement of the entire EPC contract. However, an EPC contract including technology or fabrication services may be segmented if we satisfy the segmenting criteria in ASC 605-35. Revenue recorded in these situations is based on our prices and terms for similar services to third party customers. Segmenting a contract may result in different interim rates of profitability for each scope of service than if we had recognized revenue without segmenting. In some instances, we may combine contracts that are entered into in multiple phases, but are interdependent and include pricing considerations by us and the customer that are impacted by all phases of the project. Otherwise, if each phase is independent of the other and pricing considerations do not give effect to another phase, the contracts will not be combined. 
  Cost of revenue for our long-term contracts includes direct contract costs, such as materials and labor, and indirect costs that are attributable to contract activity. The timing of when we bill our customers is generally dependent upon advance billing terms, milestone billings based on the completion of certain phases of the work, or when services are provided. Projects with costs and estimated earnings recognized to date in excess of cumulative billings is reported on the Balance Sheet as costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings. Projects with cumulative billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings recognized to date is reported on the Balance Sheet as billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings. Any uncollected billed amounts, including contract retentions, are reported as accounts receivable. 
  Revenue for our service contracts that do not satisfy the criteria for revenue recognition under the POC method is recorded at the time services are performed. Revenue associated with incentive fees for these contracts is recognized when earned. Unbilled receivables for our service contracts are recorded within accounts receivable.  
  Revenue for our pipe and steel fabrication and catalyst manufacturing contracts that are independent of an EPC contract, or for which we satisfy the segmentation criteria discussed above, is recognized upon shipment of the fabricated or manufactured units. During the fabrication or manufacturing process, all related direct and allocable indirect costs are capitalized as work in process inventory and such costs are recorded as cost of revenue at the time of shipment. 
  Goodwill 
  Goodwill Summary and Reporting Units   At   September 30, 2016  , our goodwill balance was   $3.7 billion  . Goodwill is not amortized to earnings, but instead is reviewed for impairment at least annually at a reporting unit level, absent any indicators of impairment or when other actions require an impairment assessment (such as a change in reporting units). We perform our annual impairment assessment during the fourth quarter of each year based upon balances as of October 1. At December 31, 2015, we had the following seven reporting units within our four operating groups: 
             
    Engineering   Construction   Our Engineering   Construction operating group represented a reporting unit. 
                
    Fabrication Services   Our Fabrication Services operating group included three reporting units: Steel Plate Structures, Fabrication   Manufacturing and Engineered Products. 
                
    Technology   Our Technology operating group represented a reporting unit. 
                
    Capital Services   Our Capital Services operating group included two reporting units: Facilities   Plant Services and Federal Services. 
     
   39 

     Table of Contents  

Impairment Assessment   During the fourth quarter   2015  , we performed a quantitative assessment of goodwill for each of the aforementioned reporting units. Based upon these quantitative assessments, the fair value of each of our reporting units exceeded their respective net book values, and accordingly, no impairment charge was necessary as a result of our impairment assessments. The fair value of the Engineering   Construction, Steel Plate Structures, Engineered Products and Technology reporting units substantially exceeded their respective net book values. The fair value of the Fabrication   Manufacturing, Federal Services and Facilities   Plant Services reporting units exceeded their respective net book values by approximately 13%, 12% and 10%, respectively. 
  Reporting Unit Realignment -   During the third quarter 2016, our Steel Plate Structures, Fabrication   Manufacturing and Engineered Products operations, all within our Fabrication Services operating group were integrated and operationally combined. As a result, we reevaluated our reporting units within the Fabrication Services operating group and determined that the Fabrication Services operating group now represented a single reporting unit. In conjunction with the aforementioned reorganization of our Fabrication Services operating group and change in reporting units, we performed a quantitative assessment of goodwill for each of the reporting units immediately before the change in reporting units, and for the new Fabrication Services reporting unit. Based on these quantitative assessments, the fair value of each of the reporting units prior to the change in reporting units exceeded their respective net book values, and the fair value of the Fabrication Services reporting unit substantially exceeded its net book value, and accordingly, no impairment charge was necessary as a result of the change in reporting units. During the first nine months of 2016, we had no other changes to our reporting units and no indicators of goodwill impairment were identified for any of our reporting units. If, based on future assessments our goodwill is deemed to be impaired, the impairment would result in a charge to earnings in the period of impairment. 
  Determination of Reporting Unit Fair Values   To determine the fair value of our reporting units and test for impairment, we utilize an income approach (discounted cash flow method) as we believe this is the most direct approach to incorporate the specific economic attributes and risk profiles of our reporting units into our valuation model. This is consistent with the methodology used to determine the fair value of our reporting units in previous years. We generally do not utilize a market approach given the lack of relevant information generated by market transactions involving comparable businesses. The discounted cash flow methodology is based, to a large extent, on assumptions about future events, which may or may not occur as anticipated, and such deviations could have a significant impact on the calculated estimated fair values of our reporting units. These assumptions include, but are not limited to, estimates of discount rates, future growth rates, and terminal values for each reporting unit. The discounted cash flow analysis for our reporting units tested in the fourth quarter 2015 included forecasted cash flows over a seven-year forecast period (2016 through 2022), with our 2016 business plan used as the basis for our 2016 projections. The discounted cash flow analysis for the reporting units tested in the third quarter 2016 included forecasted cash flows over a seven-year forecasted period (2017 through 2023), with our 2017 business plan used as the basis for our 2017 projections. These forecasted cash flows took into consideration historical and recent results, the reporting unit s backlog and near term prospects, and management s outlook for the future. A terminal value was also calculated using a terminal value growth assumption to derive the annual cash flows after the discrete forecast period. A reporting unit specific discount rate was applied to the forecasted cash flows and terminal cash flows to determine the discounted future cash flows, or fair value, of each reporting unit. 
  Additional Reporting Unit Disclosures   Further discussion regarding the fair values of the Federal Services and Facilities   Plant Services reporting units is below. 
             
    Federal Services   Goodwill associated with the Federal Services reporting unit was approximately $190.0 million at October 1, 2015, and the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its net book value by approximately 12%. Key assumptions used in deriving the reporting unit s fair value included a discount rate of 11.5%; an EBITDA CAGR of approximately 12% from 2016 through 2022; and a terminal growth rate of 2.5%. 
     The Federal Services reporting unit provides mission critical base operations and maintenance, environmental engineering and remediation, infrastructure EPC services, and disaster response and recovery for various federal government entities. Ongoing uncertainty with respect to federal government funding and prioritization has impacted recent operating results for the reporting unit; however, cost reductions and other initiatives have enabled the reporting unit to partially mitigate these impacts. The reporting unit s forecast and growth assumptions include 1) increases in environmental services and critical base infrastructure work, 2) increases in government funding or a greater share of the existing budgetary funding, and 3) continued benefits from its cost reduction initiatives. Accordingly, the fair value of the Federal Services reporting unit could be negatively impacted by lower than anticipated growth in environmental services and critical base infrastructure work, reductions in government spending or changes in prioritization, and increased competition within the government services sector. The fair value of the reporting unit could be positively impacted by a significant event (such as a natural disaster) that increases the demand for the reporting unit s emergency response and disaster recovery/program management services. While the reporting unit has benefited from such events historically, due to uncertainty with respect to timing, the reporting unit s forecast and growth assumptions do not include such an event. 
  
   40 

     Table of Contents  

Facilities   Plant Services   Goodwill associated with the Facilities   Plant Services reporting unit was approximately $695.0 million at October 1, 2015, and the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its net book value by approximately 10%. Key assumptions used in deriving the reporting unit s fair value included a discount rate of 10%; an EBITDA CAGR of approximately 8% from 2016 through 2022; and a terminal growth rate of 2.5%. 
     The Facilities   Plant Services reporting unit provides maintenance and modification services to power and industrial facilities, environmental engineering and remediation work, infrastructure EPC services, program management, and disaster response and recovery for private sector customers and state and local governments. The reporting unit is partially reliant upon securing and maintaining long-term power and industrial maintenance contracts, which often include services for multiple facilities for a single customer. The contracts often cover three to five year periods and are subject to periodic renewal. The reporting unit s forecast and growth assumptions include 1) maintaining these significant contracts (or replacing them with similar contracts), 2) expanding the reporting unit s maintenance services outside the U.S. utilizing CB I s international footprint, 3) growth in construction, global coastal marine and environmental services, and 4) continued participation in the new awards of other reporting units ( Pull-Through Services ). Accordingly, the fair value of the Facilities   Plant Services reporting unit could be negatively impacted by the loss of a key customer relationship, lower than anticipated international expansion, lower than anticipated growth in global coastal marine, environmental, and construction services, and reduced demand for Pull-Through Services due to delays in the award of large contracts for other reporting units. The fair value of the reporting unit could be positively impacted by a faster than expected international expansion (including a further diversification of associated services), new key customer relationships, and a larger than anticipated market share of construction activities. The fair value of the reporting unit could also be positively impacted by a significant event (such as a natural disaster) that increases the demand for the reporting unit s emergency response and disaster recovery/program management services. While the reporting unit has benefited from such events historically, due to uncertainty with respect to timing, the reporting unit s forecast and growth assumptions do not include such an event. 
             
    Other Factors   The fair value of each of our reporting units is also sensitive to changes in estimated discount rates. A hypothetical change in a reporting unit s discount rate of 0.5% would have resulted in a change in the fair value of the reporting unit by approximately 6%. 
     See   Note 6   to our Financial Statements for further discussion regarding goodwill. 
  Other Long-Lived Assets 
  We amortize our finite-lived intangible assets on a straight-line basis with lives ranging from   4   to   20   years, absent any indicators of impairment. We review tangible assets and finite-lived intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If a recoverability assessment is required, the estimated future cash flow associated with the asset or asset group will be compared to the asset s carrying amount to determine if an impairment exists. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we noted no indicators of impairment. See   Note 6   to our Financial Statements for additional discussion of our intangible assets. 
  Income Taxes 
  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis using currently enacted income tax rates for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. A valuation allowance is provided to offset any net deferred tax assets ( DTA(s) ) if, based upon the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the DTAs will not be realized. The realization of our net DTAs depends upon our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income of the appropriate character and in the appropriate jurisdictions. 
  On a periodic and ongoing basis we evaluate our DTAs and assess the appropriateness of our valuation allowances ( VA ). In assessing the need for a VA, we consider both positive and negative evidence related to the likelihood of realization of the DTAs. If, based on the weight of available evidence, our assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that a DTA will not be realized, we record a VA. Our assessments include, among other things, the value and quality of our backlog, evaluations of existing and anticipated market conditions, analysis of recent and historical operating results and projections of future results, strategic plans and alternatives for associated operations, as well as asset expiration dates, where applicable. If the factors upon which we based our assessment of realizability of our DTAs differ materially from our expectations, including future operating results being lower than our current estimates, our future assessments could be impacted and result in an increase in VA and increase in tax expense.  
  Income tax and associated interest reserves, where applicable, are recorded in those instances where we consider it more likely than not that additional tax will be due in excess of amounts reflected in income tax returns filed worldwide, irrespective of whether or not we have received tax assessments. We continually review our exposure to additional income tax obligations  
  
   41 

     Table of Contents  

and, as further information is known or events occur, changes in our tax and interest reserves may be recorded within income tax expense and interest expense, respectively. 
  Insurance 
  We maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our business and operations. However, we retain a portion of anticipated losses through the use of deductibles and self-insured retentions for our exposures related to third party liability and workers  compensation. We regularly review estimates of reported and unreported claims through analysis of historical and projected trends, in conjunction with actuaries and other consultants, and provide for losses through insurance reserves. As claims develop and additional information becomes available, adjustments to loss reserves may be required. If actual results are not consistent with our assumptions, we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material.  
  Partnering Arrangements 
  In the ordinary course of business, we execute specific projects and conduct certain operations through joint venture, consortium and other collaborative arrangements (collectively referred to as  venture(s) ). We have various ownership interests in these ventures, with such ownership typically proportionate to our decision making and distribution rights. The ventures generally contract directly with the third party customer; however, services may be performed directly by the ventures, or may be performed by us, our partners, or a combination thereof. 
  Venture net assets consist primarily of working capital and property and equipment, and assets may be restricted from being used to fund obligations outside of the venture. These ventures typically have limited third party debt or have debt that is non-recourse in nature; however, they may provide for capital calls to fund operations or require participants in the venture to provide additional financial support, including advance payment or retention letters of credit. 
  Each venture is assessed at inception and on an ongoing basis as to whether it qualifies as a VIE under the consolidations guidance in ASC 810. A venture generally qualifies as a VIE when it (1) meets the definition of a legal entity, (2) absorbs the operational risk of the projects being executed, creating a variable interest, and (3) lacks sufficient capital investment from the partners, potentially resulting in the venture requiring additional subordinated financial support, if necessary, to finance its future activities. 
  If at any time a venture qualifies as a VIE, we perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary of the VIE and, therefore, need to consolidate the VIE. We are the primary beneficiary if we have (1) the power to direct the economically significant activities of the VIE and (2) the right to receive benefits from, and obligation to absorb losses of, the VIE. If the venture is a VIE and we are the primary beneficiary, or we otherwise have the ability to control the venture, we consolidate the venture. If we are not determined to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE, or only have the ability to significantly influence, rather than control the venture, we do not consolidate the venture. We account for unconsolidated ventures using proportionate consolidation for both our Balance Sheet and Statement of Operations when we meet the applicable accounting criteria to do so and utilize the equity method otherwise. See   Note 7   to our Financial Statements for additional discussion of our material partnering arrangements. 
  Financial Instruments 
  We utilize derivative instruments in certain circumstances to mitigate the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, as described below: 
             
    Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Derivatives   We do not engage in currency speculation; however, we utilize foreign currency exchange rate derivatives on an ongoing basis to hedge against certain foreign currency related operating exposures. We generally seek hedge accounting treatment for contracts used to hedge operating exposures and designate them as cash flow hedges. Therefore, gains and losses, exclusive of credit risk and forward points (which represent the time value component of the fair value of our derivative positions), are included in AOCI until the associated underlying operating exposure impacts our earnings. Changes in the fair value of (1) credit risk and forward points, (2) instruments deemed ineffective during the period, and (3) instruments that we do not designate as cash flow hedges, are recognized within cost of revenue. 
                
    Interest Rate Derivatives   At   September 30, 2016  , we continued to utilize a swap arrangement to hedge against interest rate variability associated with   $309.3 million   of our outstanding   $337.5 million   Term Loan. The swap arrangement has been designated as a cash flow hedge as its critical terms matched those of the Term Loan at inception and through   September 30, 2016  . Accordingly, changes in the fair value of the swap arrangement are included in AOCI until the associated underlying exposure impacts our earnings. 
     See   Note 9   to our Financial Statements for additional discussion of our financial instruments.

  Item 3.     Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
  Foreign Currency Risk   We are exposed to market risk associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.  
  One form of exposure to fluctuating exchange rates relates to the effects of translating financial statements of entities with functional currencies other than the U.S. Dollar into our reporting currency. With respect to the translation of our balance sheet, net movements in the   Australian Dollar  ,   British Pound  ,   Colombian Peso   and   Euro   exchange rates against the U.S. Dollar did not have a material impact on the cumulative translation adjustment component of AOCI; however our cash balance was   unfavorably   impacted by approximately   $10.2 million  . We generally do not hedge our exposure to potential foreign currency translation adjustments. 
  Another form of exposure to fluctuating exchange rates relates to the effects of transacting in currencies other than those of our entity s functional currencies. We do not engage in currency speculation; however, we utilize foreign currency exchange rate derivatives on an ongoing basis to hedge against certain foreign currency related operating exposures. We generally seek hedge accounting treatment for contracts used to hedge operating exposures and designate them as cash flow hedges. Therefore, gains and losses, exclusive of credit risk and forward points, are included in AOCI until the associated underlying operating exposure impacts our earnings. Changes in the fair value of (1) credit risk and forward points, (2) instruments deemed ineffective during the period, and (3) instruments that we do not designate as cash flow hedges, are recognized within cost of revenue and were not material during the first nine months of 2016. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , the notional value of our outstanding forward contracts to hedge certain foreign currency exchange-related operating exposures was   $131.5 million  , including net foreign currency exchange rate exposure associated with the purchase of   U.S. Dollars   (  $79.2 million  ),   Thai Baht   (  $29.6 million  ),   Japanese Yen   (  $9.8 million  ),   Kuwaiti Dinars   (  $6.8 million  ), and   Euros   (  $6.1 million  ). The total fair value of these contracts was a net   liability   of approximately   $1.8 million   at   September 30, 2016  . The potential change in fair value for our outstanding contracts resulting from a hypothetical ten percent change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would have been approximately   $8.3 million   and   $2.5 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. This potential change in fair value of our outstanding contracts would be offset by the change in fair value of the associated underlying operating exposures. 
  Interest Rate Risk   At   September 30, 2016  , we continued to utilize an interest rate swap to hedge against interest rate variability associated with   $309.3 million   of our outstanding   $337.5 million   Term Loan. The swap arrangement has been designated as a cash flow hedge as its critical terms matched those of the Term Loan at inception and through   September 30, 2016  . Accordingly, changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap are recognized in AOCI. The total fair value of the contract was a net   liability   of approximately   $0.1 million   at   September 30, 2016  . The potential change in fair value for our interest rate swap resulting from a hypothetical one percent change in the LIBOR rate would have been approximately   $0.5 million   and   $2.8 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  Other   The carrying values of our accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate their fair values because of the short-term nature of these instruments. At   September 30, 2016  , the fair values of our Term Loan and Second Term Loan, based on current market rates for debt with similar credit risk and maturities, approximated their carrying values as interest is based upon LIBOR plus an applicable floating margin. Our Senior Notes and Second Senior Notes are categorized within level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. Our Senior Notes had a total fair value of approximately   $808.6 million   and   $772.6 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, based on current market rates for debt with similar credit risk and maturities. Our Second Senior Notes had a total fair value of approximately   $213.1 million   and   $203.5 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, based on current market rates for debt with similar credit risk and maturities. See   Note 9   to our Financial Statements for additional discussion of our financial instruments.

Item 4  . Controls and Procedures 
  Disclosure Controls and Procedures   For the period covered by this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ) and Chief Financial Officer ( CFO ), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). Based upon such evaluation, the CEO and CFO have concluded that, as of the end of such period, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective. 
  Changes in Internal Control   There were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the   third quarter     2016  , that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting. 
   
  PART II. OTHER INFORMATION 
   
  Item 1.     Legal Proceedings 
  General   We have been and may from time to time be named as a defendant in legal actions claiming damages in connection with engineering and construction projects, technology licenses, other services we provide, and other matters. These are typically claims that arise in the normal course of business, including employment-related claims and contractual disputes or claims for personal injury or property damage which occur in connection with services performed relating to project or construction sites. Contractual disputes normally involve claims relating to the timely completion of projects, performance of equipment or technologies, design or other engineering services or project construction services provided by us. We do not believe that any of our pending contractual, employment-related personal injury or property damage claims and disputes will have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations, financial position or cash flow.  
  Arbitration Matter   The customer for one of our large cost reimbursable projects has filed a request for arbitration with the International Chamber of Commerce, alleging cost overruns on the project. The customer has not provided evidence to substantiate its allegations and we believe all amounts incurred and billed on the project, including outstanding receivables of approximately   $232.0 million   as of   September 30, 2016  , are contractually due under the provisions of our contract and are recoverable. We do not believe a risk of material loss is probable related to this matter, and accordingly, no amounts have been accrued. Further, we have asserted counterclaims for our outstanding receivables.  
    Dispute Related to Sale of Nuclear Operations   As discussed further in   Note 4   to our Financial Statements,   on December 31, 2015, we sold our Nuclear Operations to WEC. In connection with the transaction, a customary post-closing purchase price adjustment mechanism was negotiated to account for any difference between target working capital and actual working capital as finally determined. On April 28, 2016, WEC delivered to us a purported closing statement estimating closing working capital to be negative     $976.5 million  , which was   $2.2 billion   less than target working capital. In contrast, we had calculated closing working capital to be   $1.6 billion  , which is   $427.8 million   greater than target working capital.   On July 21, 2016, we filed a complaint against WEC in the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware seeking a declaration that WEC has no remedy for the vast majority of its claims and requesting an injunction barring WEC from bringing such claims. WEC has filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings requesting that the court dismiss our complaint. The court plans to hear oral argument on the motion on November 7, 2016. We do not believe a risk of material loss is probable related to the matters in dispute, and accordingly, no amounts have been accrued. We intend to vigorously pursue this litigation and our rights under the purchase agreement. 
  Asbestos Litigation   We are a defendant in lawsuits wherein plaintiffs allege exposure to asbestos due to work we may have performed at various locations. We have never been a manufacturer, distributor or supplier of asbestos products. Over the past several decades and through   September 30, 2016  , we have been named a defendant in lawsuits alleging exposure to asbestos involving approximately   6,000   plaintiffs and, of those claims, approximately   1,300   claims were pending and   4,700   have been closed through dismissals or settlements. Over the past several decades and through   September 30, 2016  , the claims alleging exposure to asbestos that have been resolved have been dismissed or settled for an average settlement amount of approximately   two thousand   dollars per claim. We review each case on its own merits and make accruals based upon the probability of loss and our estimates of the amount of liability and related expenses, if any. While we have seen an increase in the number of recent filings, especially in one specific venue, we do not believe the increase or any unresolved asserted claims will have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations, financial position or cash flow, and at   September 30, 2016  , we had approximately   $6.9 million   accrued for liability and related expenses. With respect to unasserted asbestos claims, we cannot identify a population of potential claimants with sufficient certainty to determine the probability of a loss and to make a reasonable estimate of liability, if any. While we continue to pursue recovery for recognized and unrecognized contingent losses through insurance, indemnification arrangements or other sources, we are unable to quantify the amount, if any, that we may expect to recover because of the variability in coverage amounts, limitations and deductibles, or the viability of carriers, with respect to our insurance policies for the years in question.

Environmental Matters     Our operations are subject to extensive and changing U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulations, as well as the laws of other countries, that establish health and environmental quality standards. These standards, among others, relate to air and water pollutants and the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes. We are exposed to potential liability for personal injury or property damage caused by any release, spill, exposure or other accident involving such pollutants, substances or wastes. 
  In connection with the historical operation of our facilities, including those associated with acquired operations, substances which currently are or might be considered hazardous were used or disposed of at some sites that will or may require us to make expenditures for remediation. In addition, we have agreed to indemnify parties from whom we have purchased or to whom we have sold facilities for certain environmental liabilities arising from acts occurring before the dates those facilities were transferred. 
  We believe we are in compliance, in all material respects, with environmental laws and regulations and maintain insurance coverage to mitigate our exposure to environmental liabilities. We do not believe any environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations, financial position or cash flow. We do not anticipate we will incur material capital expenditures for environmental controls or for the investigation or remediation of environmental conditions during the remainder of   2016   or   2017  . 
   
  Item 1A.   Risk Factors 
  There have been no material changes to risk factors as previously disclosed in our   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   filed with the SEC on February 26, 2016. 
   
  Item 2.   Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
  Stock Repurchases   The following table summarizes the number of shares repurchased during the third quarter 2016:

    Table does not include shares withheld for tax purposes or forfeitures under our equity plans. 
               (2)   
    On May 4, 2016, our shareholders authorized us to repurchase up to 10% of our issued share capital (or approximately   10.0 million   shares based on the number of shares currently outstanding) through November 4, 2017. However, the number of shares repurchased in the future, if any, and the timing and manner of any repurchases are determined by us in light of prevailing market conditions, our available resources and other factors, including those discussed elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

CHICAGO BRIDGE   IRON SAVINGS PLAN 
    
  ARTICLE I 
  Adoption 
    
  1.01      Adoption, Amendment and Restatement  .  The Chicago Bridge   Iron Savings Plan was originally established by the Company s corporate predecessor effective June 16, 1964.  Chicago Bridge   Iron Company, a Delaware corporation, became the sponsor of the Plan effective March 18, 1997.  The Company merged the CBI Hourly Employees  Saving Plan into this Plan and amended and restated the Plan effective January 1, 1997.  The Company further merged the Howe-Baker Engineers, Inc. Employees  Profit-Sharing 401(k) Plan, the Matrix Engineering, Inc. Savings Plan, the A B Builders, Inc. Savings Plan, and the Callidus Technologies 401(k) Savings Plan, into this Plan effective December 31, 2000.  The Company previously amended and restated the Plan effective January 1, 2008, effective January 1, 2013 and effective January 1, 2014.   
    
  The Company also sponsors The Shaw Group Inc. 401(k) Plan (the  Shaw Plan ).  The Shaw Plan was originally effective January 1, 1994.  Effective June 1, 2010, The Shaw Group Inc. 401(k) Plan for Hourly Employees was merged into the Shaw Plan and the Shaw Plan was amended and restated.  Most recently, the Shaw Plan was amended and restated effective January 1, 2014.   
    
  Effective as of midnight December 31, 2015, the Plan and the Shaw Plan will merge.  The Company now amends, restates and consolidates the Plan and the Shaw Plan effective January 1, 2016 (except as otherwise provided in this document) to read as set forth in this document.  The Plan is intended to be a qualified profit sharing plan described in Code Section 401(a) with a qualified cash or deferred arrangement described in Code Section 401(k).

ARTICLE IV 
  Contributions and Vesting 
    
  4.01      Elective Deferrals  . 
    
  (a)      General.    Each Active Participant may elect to make Elective Deferrals from his or her Compensation, and may designate the portion, if any, of the Elective Deferrals to be contributed as Roth Contributions, at least annually during any Plan Year and at such other times as the Plan Administrator may prescribe by executing and filing an appropriately completed Salary Reduction Agreement with the Plan Administrator on such form or forms provided or permitted by the Plan Administrator and in such manner as the Plan Administrator may prescribe.  The Salary Reduction Agreement shall specify the percentage of Compensation to be contributed to the Plan as Elective Deferrals and the portion, if any, of the Elective Deferrals to be contributed as Roth Contributions.  A Participant s percentage for Elective Deferrals shall not be more than the seventy-five percent (75%) of Compensation.  The maximum percentage for Elective Deferrals may be changed by the Plan Administrator from time to time and shall be uniformly applicable to all Participants and effective from and after the date prescribed.  Except for that portion, if any, of the Elective Deferrals that the Participant has designated as Roth Contributions in accordance with subsection (b) below, such contribution shall be on a pre-tax basis, and the Employer shall reduce each Participant s Compensation by, and contribute to the Trust as Elective Deferrals on behalf of such Participant, the amount (if any) by which the Compensation available to the Participant (after applicable deductions) has been reduced under such Participant s Salary Reduction Agreement.  A Participant s Salary Reduction Agreement shall continue in effect, subject to subsection (f) below, notwithstanding any change in his or her Compensation, until he or she changes or revokes his or her Salary Reduction Agreement. 
    
  Notwithstanding the above, a Participant who is a Clive Shop Employee and whose participation in this Plan is governed by a collective bargaining agreement may elect to make Elective Deferrals from his or her Compensation in accordance with the provisions of the currently effective collective bargaining agreement. 
    
  (b)      Roth Contributions  .  If the Participant affirmatively  designates a portion of his or her Elective Deferrals as Roth Contributions,  such amount will be deducted from his or her Compensation  on an after-tax  basis, subject to withholding of applicable  federal, state and local income taxes on such  Roth Contributions  from the Participant's Compensation  other  than such Roth  Contributions.     Except  as  provided  in  the  preceding  sentence   or  otherwise  expressly specified  in  this  Plan,  Roth  Contributions  shall  be treated  as  Elective  Deferrals (or  Catch-Up Deferrals,  as applicable), for all purposes of this Plan.  In the absence of an affirmative designation, none of the Participant's Elective  Deferrals  under this Plan shall be contributed  as Roth Contributions. 
    
  (c)      Changes of Salary Reduction Agreements  .  A Participant may change his or her rate of Elective Deferrals, or the designation of any portion of Elective Deferrals as Roth  
  
   20 

Contributions, by executing and filing a new Salary Reduction Agreement with the Plan Administrator on such form provided or permitted by the Plan Administrator and in such manner as the Plan Administrator may prescribe. 
    
  (d)      Effective Date of Salary Reduction Agreement  .  A Salary Reduction Agreement or a change thereof shall apply solely to Compensation not yet paid or payable as of the date such new or changed Salary Reduction Agreement is filed with the Plan Administrator.  Subject to the foregoing requirement, a Salary Reduction Agreement or change thereof shall take effect on the first day of the payroll period as of which the start or change of the Participant s Elective Deferrals, or the designation of any portion of Elective Deferrals as Roth Contributions, is administratively practicable (determined under procedures established by the Plan Administrator) after the Participant has executed and filed an initial or changed Salary Reduction Agreement with the Plan Administrator as provided in subsection (a) or (c) of this Section 4.01. 
    
  (e)      Revocations of Salary Reduction Agreements  .  A Participant may revoke a Salary Reduction Agreement with respect to Compensation not paid or payable as of the date of such revocation by executing and filing a revocation of such Salary Reduction Agreement on such form provided or permitted by the Plan Administrator and in such manner as the Plan Administrator may prescribe.  Revocation of a Salary Reduction Agreement shall take effect on the first day of the payroll period as of which implementing the revocation is administratively practicable (determined under procedures established by the Plan Administrator) after the Participant has executed and filed such revocation with the Plan Administrator.  A Participant s Salary Reduction Agreement shall become ineffective upon his or her ceasing to be an Active Participant. But the Participant may make a new Salary Reduction Agreement in accordance with subsection (a) upon again becoming an Active Participant. 
    
  (f)      Other Reductions and Limitations  .  Elective Deferrals shall not exceed the lowest maximum amount permitted by Article V.  Notwithstanding anything in a Salary Reduction Agreement, the Plan Administrator may reduce the Elective Deferrals and amend the Salary Reduction Agreement of any Participant to prevent a reasonably anticipated violation of the limitations of Section 5.06, and may reduce the Elective Deferrals and Salary Reduction Agreement of any Participant who is a Highly Compensated Employee to prevent a reasonably anticipated violation of the limitations of Sections 5.01 or 5.02.  Any reduction of Elective Deferrals under this subsection (f) shall be applied pro rata to Elective Deferrals that are not Roth Contributions and to Elective Deferrals that are Roth Contributions.  If a Participant receives a Hardship distribution pursuant to Section 7.01, his or her Salary Reduction Agreement shall be suspended in accordance with Section 7.01(c)(5).  The Plan Administrator may, in its discretion, impose such additional rules, regulations and limitations on the amount of Elective Deferrals that may be elected, including limitations on the amount of Elective Deferrals that an Active Participant may elect for each payroll period to a pro-rata portion of the Dollar Limit, and limitations on the amount of Elective Deferrals that a Highly Compensated Employee may elect, to ensure that the limitations of Article V are not exceeded. 
  
   21 

(g)      Time for Contributing Elective Deferrals  .  For each payroll period during a Plan Year, each Employer shall pay the Elective Deferrals of Participants who are its Employees over to the Trustee as of, or as soon as reasonably possible after, the date such amount would otherwise have been paid to the Participant in cash; but not earlier (except as required by bona fide administrative considerations) than the date that the Participant performs the services with respect to which the contribution is made (or the date such amount would otherwise have been paid to the Participant in cash, if earlier), and not later than the fifteenth (15   th   ) business day of the month following the month in which such amount would otherwise have been paid to the Participant in cash. 
    
  (h)      Allocation of Elective Deferrals  .  Elective Deferrals that are not Roth Contributions shall be allocated to the Employee 401(k) Account of each Participant on whose behalf such Elective Deferrals were made.  Elective Deferrals that are Roth Contributions shall be allocated to the Roth Contribution Account of each  Participant  on  whose behalf such  Roth Contributions were made. 
    
  (i)      Automatic Increase  .  A Participant may elect to automatically increase his pre-tax Elective Deferrals each year. Following such an election, each year such Participant's Elective Deferrals shall be increased by an amount equal to one percent (1%), two percent (2%) or three percent (3%) of such Participant s Compensation, subject to a maximum deemed Elective Deferral Contribution of twenty percent (20%) of Compensation, unless prior to such anniversary such Participant has made an affirmative election to the contrary.   
    
  4.02      Matching Contributions  . 
    
   (a)    For Plan Years beginning on and after January 1, 2014, and subject to the limitations described in Article 5, the Company shall contribute to the Plan on behalf of each Participant who made Elective Deferrals (whether or not designated as Roth Contributions or Catch-Up Deferrals) a Safe Harbor Matching Contribution equal to: (i) one hundred percent (100%) of the Elective Deferrals that are not in excess of three percent (3%) of the Participant's Compensation, plus (ii) fifty percent (50%) of the amount of the Elective Deferrals that exceed 3% of the Participant's Compensation but that do not exceed five percent (5%) of the Participant's Compensation.   
    
  The Board may provide for Matching Contributions to be made in addition to the foregoing.  In any Plan Year that the Plan is deemed to meet the tests under Article 5 because the Plan is meeting the requirements of Code Section 401(k)(12) by virtue of a Matching Contribution or if the Plan is intended to satisfy the ACP safe harbor of Code Section 401(m)(11), no Highly Compensated Employee can receive a greater rate of Matching Contributions than a Nonhighly Compensated Employee at the same rate of Elective Deferral Contributions. In any Plan Year the Plan is intended to satisfy the ACP safe harbor of Code Section 401(m)(11): (i) the rate of Elective Deferral Contributions cannot increase as a Participant's Elective Deferral Contributions increase, (ii) Matching Contributions cannot be made on Elective Deferrals in excess of six percent (6%) of Compensation, and (iii) the  
  
   22 

amount of Matching Contributions subject to the Company's discretion shall not exceed four percent (4%) of Compensation. 
    
  (b)      Time for Contributing Matching Contributions  .  Matching contributions shall be determined and made, on the basis of Elective Deferrals, for each payroll period, subject to the subsection (d), below.  However the Employer may pay its Matching Contributions over to the Trustee at any time not later than the due date for the filing of the federal income tax return (including any extensions) of the Employer for the tax year during which occurs the last day of the Plan Year containing the last day of such payroll period. 
    
  If Safe Harbor Matching Contributions are made separately with respect to each payroll period (or with respect to all payroll periods ending with or within each month or quarter of a Plan Year), such Safe Harbor Matching Contributions must be contributed to the Plan by the last day of the immediately following Plan Year quarter. 
    
  (c)      Allocation of Matching Contributions  .  Matching Contributions shall be allocated to the Company Matching Account of each Participant on whose behalf such Matching Contributions were made; provided, however, that effective January 1, 2001, a Participant s Company Matching Account as of December 31, 2000 shall become an Inactive Account for pre-2001 Matching Contributions (including accumulated and future earnings thereon), as indicated in Schedule 1, and a new Company Matching Account shall be established for each such Participant as of January 1, 2001.  Effective January 1, 2014, a Safe Harbor Matching Account shall be established for fixed Matching Contributions described in subsection 4.02(b). 
    
  (d)      True-Up Contributions  .  As of the last day of each Plan Year, the applicable Matching Contributions formula under subsection (a) shall be applied to the total of the Participant s Elective Deferrals for the Plan Year then ending, and each Employer shall contribute (within the time specified by subsection (b)), on behalf of each Participant on whose behalf Elective Deferrals are made, the amount, if any (the  True-Up Contribution ), by which the total Matching Contributions so required exceed the actual Matching Contributions previously determined on the basis of payroll periods for such Active Participant during the course of the Plan Year.  If an Employer has changed its determination of percentages for its Matching Contribution formula during the Plan Year, the amount of the True-Up Contribution shall be determined separately for each portion of a Plan Year during which a given Matching Contribution formula was in effect.   
    
  Notwithstanding the above, a Participant who is a Clive Shop Employee and whose participation in this Plan is governed by a collective bargaining agreement may receive Matching Contributions in accordance with the provisions of the currently effective collective bargaining agreement. 

23 

4.03      Company Contributions  . 
    
  (a)      General.    Subject to Sections 11.01, 11.02 and 11.04, for each Plan Year for which the Company elects in its sole discretion for Employers to make a Company Contribution, each Employer that has adopted or is deemed to have adopted this Plan pursuant to Section 13.01 for purposes of Company Contributions shall make a Company Contribution for each Active Participant.  The Amount of the Company Contribution shall be a percentage, determined by the Company in its discretion and uniformly applicable to all such Active Participants equal to a percentage of the Compensation of each Active Participant for the portion of the Plan Year during which the Participant is an Active Participant.  If an Employer changes its determination of the percentage of its Company Contribution during the Plan Year, the amount of the Company Contribution shall be determined separately for each portion of a Plan Year during which a given percentage was in effect.   
    
  Notwithstanding the above, a Participant who is a Clive Shop Employee and whose participation in this Plan is governed by a collective bargaining agreement may receive Company Contributions in accordance with the provisions of the currently effective collective bargaining agreement. 
    
  (b)      Time for Company Contributions  . For each Plan Year, each Employer shall pay its Company Contributions over to the Trustee not later than the due date for the filing of the federal income tax return (including any extensions) of the Employer for the tax year during which the last day of such Plan Year occurs. 
    
  (c)      Allocation of Company Contributions  .  Company Contributions shall be allocated to the Company Contribution Account of each Active Participant eligible for such allocation under subsection (a) in the same ratio that the eligible Compensation of such Active Participant bears to the total eligible Compensation of all Active Participants. 
    
  4.04      Rollover Contributions into the Plan  .  At the request of any Eligible Employee, the Plan Administrator shall direct the Trustee to accept a Rollover Contribution on behalf of the Eligible Employee.  Unless the Rollover Contribution is a direct transfer from another Roth elective deferral account under an applicable retirement plan described in Code Section 402A(c)(1), the Rollover Contribution shall be held in the Prior Plan and Rollover Account for the Eligible Employee. A Rollover Contribution that is a direct transfer from another Roth elective deferral account under an applicable retirement plan described in Code Section 402A(e)(1) shall be held  in the Participant's  Roth Rollover Account.  If the Rollover Contribution includes amounts that would not be includible in gross income (except as provided by Code Sections 402(c), 403(a)(4), 403(b)(8) and 457(e)(16) and except by reason of being a direct transfer from another Roth elective deferral account) if not transferred as an Rollover Contribution, the Plan Administrator shall separately account for the portion of the Rollover Contribution which is so includible in gross income and the portion of such Rollover Contribution which is not so includible.  Each Rollover Contribution shall be made in cash, in notes representing a loan to the Participant from a qualified trust under provisions of such qualified trust similar to Section 7.02, or in property (which may be stock or securities issued by the former employer) acceptable to the Trustee for purposes of this Plan.  Prior to accepting a  
  
   24 

Rollover Contribution, the Plan Administrator may require that the Eligible Employee who wants to make the Rollover Contribution shall provide evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Plan Administrator that such contribution qualifies as a Rollover Contribution.  Acceptance of a Rollover Contribution shall not in any manner guarantee the result of such contribution under any tax laws; and neither the Company, the Investment Committee, any Employer, the Plan Administrator, the Trustee nor any Investment Manager, shall be responsible for such tax results.  If the Plan Administrator determines after any Rollover Contribution that such contribution did not in fact qualify as a Rollover Contribution, the amount of the Rollover Contribution, increased by income and gains and reduced (but not below zero) by losses and expenses, shall be returned to the Eligible Employee. 
    
  4.05      Special Contributions; QNECs and QMACs  . 
    
  (a)      QNECs and QMACs  .  For each Plan Year, the Company may elect to have the Company and the other Employers make a special contribution in such amount (if any) as the Company may determine as QNECs and/or QMACs.  In any Plan Year in which the Company elects to have such a QNEC or QMAC made, each Employer shall contribute a fractional portion of the QNEC or QMAC in such amount as the Company shall determine to be appropriate in the circumstances. 
    
  (b)      Time for QNECs or QMACs  .  Each Employer shall pay its QNECs or QMACs for a Plan Year over to the Trustee not later than the last day of the following Plan Year; provided, however, that if the Employer intends to deduct such QNEC or QMAC in the tax year in which the last day of the Plan Year for which such QNEC or QMAC was made occurs, the Employer shall pay its QNEC or QMAC over to the Trustee on or before the due date for the filing of the federal income tax return (including any extensions) of the Employer for such tax year. 
    
  (c)      Allocation of QNECs or QMACs  .  As of the last day of each Plan Year, any QNECs or QMACs made to the Plan for the Plan Year shall be allocated to the Employee 401(k) Account of each Designated Participant (as defined below) who is an Active Participant, as determined by the Company in its discretion, in whichever one or more of the following methods as the Company shall determine: 
    
  (i)      Compensation-Based QNEC  . 
    
  (A)    Compensation-based QNECs may be allocated to the Employee 401(k) Account of each Designated Participant who has Compensation not in excess of an amount specified by the Company in the ratio that such Participant's Compensation for the Plan Year bears to the total Compensation of all such Participants for the Plan Year. 
    
  (B)    A Section 415-based QNEC may be allocated to the Employee 401(k) Account of each Designated Participant in an amount that maximizes each such Participant s annual additions under Code Section 415(c). 
  
   25 

(ii)      Per Capita-Based QNEC  .  A per capita-based QNEC may be allocated to the Employee 401(k) Account of each Designated Participant in an amount equal to the total per capita-based QNEC divided by the total number of such Participants for the Plan Year. 
    
  (iii)      Section 401(k)-Based QMAC  .  A Section 401(k)-based QMAC may be allocated to the Employee 401(k) Account of each Designated Participant in the ratio that the amount of Elective Deferrals made to the Plan for such Plan Year on behalf of such Participant bears to the total amount of Elective Deferrals made to the Plan for such Plan Year on behalf of all such Participants, based on Elective Deferrals up to a specified percentage or dollar amount of Compensation, as determined by the Plan Administration. 
    
  (d)      Limitation on Allocation of QNECs and QMACs  .  Notwithstanding subsection (c) above, QNECs and QMACs shall not be allocated to the Employee 401(k) Account of any Designated Participant in an amount in excess of (i) the Participant s Statutory Compensation, multiplied by (ii) the greater of (A) five percent (5%), or (B) the Plan s Representative Contribution Rate.  For this purpose the Plan s Representative Contribution Rate is the lowest Applicable Contribution Rate of any eligible Participant who is not a Highly Compensated Employee ( NHCE ) within a group of NHCEs that that consists of half of all eligible NHCEs for the Plan Year (or, if greater, the lowest Applicable Contribution Rate of any eligible employee who is employed on the last day of the Plan Year.  For this purpose the Applicable Contribution Rate for an eligible NHCE is the sum of the QMACs and QNECs for the eligible NHCE for the Plan Year, divided by the eligible NHCE s Statutory Compensation for the same period. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this subsection (d), QNECs and QMACs that are made in connection with an Employer s obligations under the Davis-Bacon Act, the Public Service Contract Act of 1965, or similar legislation may be allocated to the Employee 401(k) Account of a NHCE to the extent that such contributions do not exceed ten percent (10%) of such NHCE s Statutory Compensation. 
    
  The limitations of this subsection (d) shall be applied separately to QNECs and QMACs; but QNECs taken into account in applying the limitations of Section 5.03 (including the related determination of the Representative Contribution Rate) shall not be taken into account in applying the limitations of Section 5.02 (including the related determination of the Representative Contribution Rate); and similarly QMACs taken into account in applying the limitations of Section 5.02 (including the related determination of the Representative Contribution Rate) shall not be taken in to account in applying the limitations of Section 5.03 (including the related determination of the Representative Contribution Rate). 
    
  (e)      Definition of Designated Participant  .  With respect to any QNEC or QMAC, a Designated Participant is a Participant who is not a Highly Compensated Employee for the Plan Year and who is designated by the Plan Administrator on the basis of any one or more of the following: 
  
   26 

(i)    such Participant s level of Compensation; 
    
  (ii)    such Participant s employment on the last day of the Plan Year; 
    
  (iii)    such Participant s completion of a year of vesting Service; 
    
  (iv)    such Participant s making of a Salary Reduction Agreement Election; or 
    
  (v)    such Participant s job classification that satisfies the nondiscriminatory classification test. 
    
  4.06      Crediting of Contributions  .  Contributions to be allocated to a Participant s Account shall be credited to such Account (and available for Participant direction of investment pursuant to Section 6.08(a) and loans, withdrawals and benefits pursuant to Articles VII and VIII) on or as soon as reasonably practicable (under procedures established or approved by the Plan Administrator) after the contributions (and a reconciliation of the contributions to Participants  Accounts) are actually received by the Trustee from time to time during or after the Plan Year.  However, for purposes of determining the Account Balance to which a Participant is entitled, contributions made or to be made for a particular Plan Year but credited under this Section after the last day of such Plan Year shall nevertheless be deemed made and allocated on such last day of such Plan Year. 
    
  4.07      Determination and Amount of Employer Contributions  .  Subject to the Company s determination of the rate (if any) of Company Contributions pursuant to Section 4.03, the Plan Administrator shall determine the amount of any contribution to be made by the Company and each Employer hereunder.  In making such determination, the Plan Administrator shall be entitled to rely upon the estimates of Compensation made by the accounting officers of each respective Employer with respect to the Employees of that Employer.  Such determination shall be binding on all Participants, all Employers, and the Trustee.  Under no circumstances shall any Participant or Beneficiary have any right to examine the books and records of any Employer. 
    
  4.08      Condition on Company Contributions  .

  (e)      Forfeitures  .  If a Participant has a Termination of Employment, then that portion of the Participant s Account Balance which is not vested as of his or her Termination of Employment shall become a Forfeiture as soon as administratively practicable after the earliest of (i) the date on which the balance of the Participant s Accounts is distributed, (ii) the last day of the Plan Year in which the Participant incurs a one year Period of Severance, or (iii) the date of Termination of Employment; provided, however, if the Participant has no vested interest in any Accounts, such portion shall become a Forfeiture on the date of Termination of Employment. 
    
  (f)      Return to Employment  .  If a Participant or a former Participant resumes service with an Employer as an Employee before incurring a Period of Severance lasting five (5) or more years, the amount forfeited under subsection (e) (without adjustment for interest, gains or losses) shall be reinstated to the Participant s or former Participant s Account(s) from which the Forfeiture arose, as soon as administratively practicable after the Participant resumes service with an Employer as an Employee.  The restoration of Forfeitures pursuant to the foregoing shall be accomplished by an allocation of Forfeitures, or if such Forfeitures are insufficient, a charge to Trust earnings or by a special Company contribution. If a former Participant does not resume employment with an Employer before the end of a Period of Severance lasting at least five (5) years, the amounts forfeited under subsection (e) shall not be reinstated. 

29

Forfeitures arising pursuant to Sections 4.10(e), 5.01, 5.02(c), or 13.04 during a Plan Year shall be applied first to restore any Forfeitures that are reinstated during the Plan Year pursuant to Sections 4.10(f) or 13.04; second, to correct in such Plan Year any errors in the adjustment of Participants  Accounts pursuant to Section 6.11, third, to the payment of expenses of administering the Plan and the Trust pursuant to Section 6.03, and fourth, toward the payment of Company Contributions.  Forfeitures that are applied toward payment of Company Contributions shall be considered to be Company Contributions, shall reduce the amount of Company Contributions otherwise required to be made to the Trust, and shall be allocated in accordance with Section 4.03(c).   Forfeitures cannot be used as QNECs, QMACs, Elective Deferrals, or actual deferral percentage test safe harbor contributions (Code Section 401(k)(12)). 
    
  4.11      Catch-Up Deferrals  .  Each Participant who is an "Eligible Active Participant" (as defined in subsection (a)) may elect to make Catch-Up Deferrals from his or her Compensation, and may elect to designate all or any portion of such Catch-Up Deferrals as Roth Contributions, by written election on a Salary Reduction Form filed with the Plan Administrator in such manner as the Plan Administrator may prescribe.  The Employer shall reduce each Eligible Active Participant s Compensation by, and contribute to the Trust as Catch-Up Deferrals on behalf of such Participant, the amount (if any) of the Participant s Catch-Up Deferrals.  For purposes of this Section 4.11: 
    
  (a)    An "Eligible Active Participant" is a Participant who (i) will have attained age fifty (50) on or before the last day of the taxable year; and (ii) has made Elective Deferrals for the Plan Year that are in excess of the maximum Elective Deferrals allowed under the Plan, taking into account the provisions of Article V. 
    
  (b)    For each Plan Year, the amount of the Catch-Up Deferrals made on behalf of a Participant who is an Eligible Active Participant shall be equal to the dollar amount or percentage (in increments of one percent (1%)) of the Participant's Compensation specified by the Participant for Catch-Up Deferrals on his or her Salary Reduction Form, provided that such Catch-Up Deferrals may not exceed the lesser of the following for a Plan Year: 
    
  (i)    six thousand dollars ($6,000) for 2016, as adjusted for cost-of-living increases by the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate pursuant to the provisions of Code Section 414(v)(2)(C); or 
    
  (ii)    The excess of (i) the Participant's Statutory Compensation for the Plan Year as determined under Section 2.13(b) (as applied for purposes of Sections 5.02 and 5.03), over (ii) the Participant's Elective Deferrals for the Plan Year. 
    
  (c)    A Participant's initial Catch-Up Deferral election shall be effective for Compensation payable on or after the date on which such election is made and shall remain in effect until changed or revoked.  Thereafter, changes in the percentage (solely in increments or decrements of one percent (1%)) or dollar amount of Compensation to be deferred or revocation of any such election, or changes in the designation of any portion of Catch-Up Deferrals as Roth Contributions, may be made by written election on a Salary  
  
   30 

Reduction Form filed with the Plan Administrator in such manner as the Plan Administrator may prescribe. 
    
  (d)    The Catch-Up Deferrals for the Plan Year (other than Catch-Up Deferrals designated as Roth Contributions) shall be credited to Participants' Employee 401(k) Accounts, and Catch-Up Deferrals for the Plan Year designated as Roth Contributions shall be credited to Participants' Roth Contribution Accounts, in the amounts of their respective Catch-Up Deferral elections for such Plan Year and the designation, if any, of any portion of such Catch-Up Deferrals as Roth Contributions.  Catch-Up Deferrals shall be fully vested and nonforfeitable. 
    
  (e)    Catch-Up Deferrals shall not be subject to any of the limitations under Article V. 
    
  (f)    The Plan Administrator may specify rules from time to time governing Catch-Up Deferrals, including, but not limited to, rules regarding (i) the timing, method, and implementation dates of Catch-Up Deferral elections, (ii) the return or recharacterization of Catch-Up Deferrals as Elective Deferrals, and (iii) the recharacterization of Elective Deferrals of an Eligible Active Participant as Catch-Up Deferrals, to the extent the Elective Deferrals of the Eligible Active Participant would otherwise exceed the limitations of Article V and the total Catch-Up Deferrals of the Participant (after recharacterization) do not exceed the limits of subsection (b) above. Such rules shall be in compliance with any applicable guidance issued by the Secretary of the Treasury, and, to the extent deemed advisable by the Plan Administrator in order to comply with such guidance, such rules may override any of the preceding provisions of this Section 4.11. 
    
  (g)    Catch-Up Deferrals will be treated as Elective Deferrals for all purposes of this Plan other than Article V (relating to Limitations on Contributions); provided, however, that Catch-Up Deferrals recharacterized under subsection (f) as Elective Deferrals will be eligible for Matching Contributions to the extent provided for Elective Deferrals in Section 4.02.  In addition, for Plan Years beginning prior to January 1, 2014, Catch-up Deferrals will not be treated as Elective Deferrals for purposes of Section 4.02 (relating to Matching Contributions). 
    
  4.12      Military Service  .  Notwithstanding any provision of this Plan to the contrary, contributions, benefits and service credit with respect to qualified military service shall be provided in accordance with Code Section 414(u). 
    
  (a)      Death Benefits Under USERRA  .  Effective January 1, 2007, if a Participant dies while performing Qualified Military Service, the survivors of the Participant are entitled to any additional benefits provided under the Plan as if the Participant had resumed and then terminated employment on account of death pursuant to Code Section 401(a)(37), Notice 2010-5 and any superseding guidance. 

31 

(b)      Differential Military Pay  . Effective for Plan Years beginning after December 31, 2008, pursuant to Code Section 414(u)(12), Notice 2010-5 and any superseding guidance, a Participant receiving differential wage payments (as defined in Code Section 3401(h)(2)) shall be treated as an Employee of the Employer making the payment and the differential wage payments shall be treated as Compensation under the Plan. 
    
   (c)      Qualified Reservist Distributions  .  Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, a Participant who, by reason of being a member of a "reserve component" (as defined in Section 101 of Title 37 of the United States Code), is ordered or called to active duty after September 11, 2001 for a period in excess of one hundred seventy-nine (179) days or for an indefinite period may take a "qualified reservist distribution" (as defined in Code Section 72(t)(2)(G)(iii)), from amounts attributable to Employer contributions made pursuant to the Participant s Elective Deferrals described in Code Section 402(g)(3)(A), during the period beginning on the date the Participant is ordered or called to duty and ending at the close of the Participant's active duty period.   
    
  (d)      Withdrawal of Elective Deferrals for Participants in Uniformed Services  .  For purposes of Code Section 40l(k)(2)(B)(i)(I), any Participant shall be treated as having been severed from employment during the period he or she is performing service in the uniformed services described in Code Section 340l(h)(2)(A) while on active duty for a period of more than thirty (30) days. If such a Participant elects to receive a distribution of Elective Deferrals, the Participant may not contribute any Elective Deferrals to the Plan during the six (6)-month period beginning on the date of distribution.   
  
   32 

ARTICLE V 
  Limitations on Contributions 
    
  5.01      Excess Deferrals  .  Notwithstanding Section 4.01 or anything in a Participant s Salary Reduction Agreement, the sum for any calendar year of (i) Elective Deferrals of any Participant under this Plan, (ii) any elective deferrals excluded from the Participant s gross income made under a Related Plan, and (iii) the amount of elective deferrals under any other plan if the Participant notifies the Plan Administrator in writing by March 1 of the following calendar year that such other plan exists under which elective deferrals were excluded from the Participant s gross income and the amount of such elective deferrals (excluding in every case Catch-Up Deferrals made under Section 4.11 of this Plan or corresponding provisions authorized by Code Section 414(v) of any Related Plan or other plan), shall not exceed the applicable Dollar Limit.  The  Dollar Limit  is eighteen thousand dollars ($18,000) for 2016, as adjusted for Plan Years thereafter for cost-of-living increases by the Secretary of the Treasury or his or her delegate pursuant to Code Sections 402(g)(4) and 415(d).  If the sum of such amounts exceeds the Dollar Limit for a calendar year, the Plan Administrator shall, not later than the April 15 following the close of such calendar year, distribute to the Participant all or such portion of the Participant s Elective Deferrals in excess of the Dollar Limit (by first distributing unmatched Elective Deferrals that are not Roth Contributions, then by distributing unmatched Elective Deferrals that are Roth Contributions, then by distributing matched Elective Deferrals that are not Roth Contributions, and finally by distributing matched Elective Deferrals that are Roth Contributions) for such calendar year in an amount equal to the greater of (i) the amount the Plan Administrator determines is necessary to eliminate the excess of the sum of the amount described in clauses (i) and (ii) above over the, including net income and minus any loss allocable to such amount determined in accordance with Section 5.05, or (ii) the amount requested in writing by the Participant on or before the March 1 following the close of such calendar year.  Any Matching Contributions (including any net income and minus any loss allocable thereto determined in accordance with Section 5.05) made with respect to such distributed Elective Deferrals matched Plan Administrator shall be forfeited and allocated in accordance with Section 4.10(f). 
    
  5.02      Excess Contributions:  The ADP Test  .  Effective January 1, 2014 and because the Plan is intended to be a safe harbor plan, the Plan shall comply with the Safe Harbor Notice requirements as described in Section 2.53, and the Plan shall be deemed to meet the requirements of this Section 5.02 with respect to Elective Deferrals.  However, for any year the Plan is not deemed to meet the requirements of this Section 5.02, the Plan must meet one of the two tests (as described in subsection (a), below), with respect to Elective Deferrals for any Plan Year. 
    
  Notwithstanding Section 4.01 or anything in a Participant s Salary Reduction Agreement, a Participant s Elective Deferrals shall not exceed the amounts permitted under the non-discrimination rules of Code Section 401(k) as set forth in this Section. 
    
  (a)      Imposition of Limit  .  Elective Deferrals made with respect to a Highly Compensated Employee for a Plan Year shall not exceed such amount as the Plan Administrator determines is necessary to cause the Average ADP (as defined in subsection (d) below) of Active Participants who are Highly Compensated Employees to not exceed the greater of the following limits (the  Required ADP Test ): 
  
   33 

(1)      General Limit  .  The Average ADP of the Highly Compensated Employees for such Plan Year shall not be more than the Average ADP of all other Active Participants for such Plan Year multiplied by 1.25; or 
    
  (2)      Alternative Limit  .  The excess of the Average ADP of Highly Compensated Employees for such Plan Year over the Average ADP of all other Active Participants for such Plan Year shall not be more than two (2) percentage points, and the Average ADP of the Highly Compensated Employees for such Plan Year shall be not more than the Average ADP of all other Active Participants for such Plan Year multiplied by two (2). 
    
  (b)      Manner of Reduction to Satisfy Limit  .  To the extent the Plan Administrator determines is necessary to pass the Required ADP Test, Elective Deferrals (and Matching Contributions allocated with respect to Elective Deferrals that are reduced) shall be reduced for Highly Compensated Employees in the following steps: 
    
  Step 1:  The Plan Administrator shall first determine the dollar amount of the reductions which would have to be made to the Elective Deferrals of each Highly Compensated Employee who is an Active Participant for the Plan Year in order for the Average ADP of the Highly Compensated Employees for the Plan Year to satisfy the Required ADP Test.  Such amount shall be calculated by first determining the dollar amount by which the Elective Deferrals of Highly Compensated Employees who have the highest Actual Deferral Percentage (as defined in subsection (d)) would have to be reduced until the first to occur of:  (i) such Employees  Actual Deferral Percentage would equal the Actual Deferral Percentage of the Highly Compensated Employee or group of Highly Compensated Employees with the next highest Actual Deferral Percentage; or (ii) the Average ADP of all of the Highly Compensated Employees, as recalculated after the reductions made under this Step 1, satisfies the Required ADP Test.  Then, unless the recalculated Average ADP of the Highly Compensated Employees satisfies the Required ADP Test, the reduction process shall be repeated by determining the dollar amount of reductions which would have to be made to the Elective Deferrals of the Highly Compensated Employees who, after the prior reductions made in this step 1, would have the highest Actual Deferral Percentage until the first to occur of: (iii) such Employees  Actual Deferral Percentage, after the current and all prior reductions under this Step 1, would equal the Actual Deferral Percentage of the Highly Compensated Employee or group of Highly Compensated Employees with the next highest Actual Deferral Percentage; or (iv) the Average ADP of all of the Highly Compensated Employees, as recalculated after the current and all prior reductions made under this Step 1, satisfies the Required ADP Test.  This process is repeated until the Average ADP of all of the Highly Compensated Employees, after all reductions, satisfies the Required ADP Test. 
    
  Step 2.  Next, the Plan Administrator shall determine the total dollar amount of reductions to the Elective Deferrals calculated under Step 1 ( Total Excess Contributions ). 

34 

Step 3.  Finally, the Plan Administrator shall reduce the Elective Deferrals of the Highly Compensated Employees with the highest dollar amount of Elective Deferrals by the lesser of the dollar amount which: (i) causes each such Highly Compensated Employee s Elective Deferrals to equal the dollar amount of the Elective Deferrals of the Highly Compensated Employee or group of Highly Compensated Employees with the next highest dollar amount of Elective Deferrals; or (ii) reduces the Highly Compensated Employees  Elective Deferrals by the Total Excess Contributions.  Then, unless the total amount of reductions made to Highly Compensated Employees  Elective Deferrals under this Step 3 equals the amount of the Total Excess Contributions, the reduction process shall be repeated by reducing the Elective Deferrals of the group of Highly Compensated Employees with the highest dollar amount of Elective Deferrals, after the prior reductions made in this Step 3, by the lesser of the dollar amount which:  (iii) causes each such Highly Compensated Employees  Elective Deferrals, after the current and all prior reductions under this Step 3 to equal the dollar amount of the Elective Deferrals of the Highly Compensated Employees with the next highest dollar amount of Elective Deferrals; or (iv) causes total reductions to equal the Total Excess Contributions.  This process is repeated with each successive group of Highly Compensated Employees with the highest dollar amount, after all reductions, of the Elective Deferrals until the total reductions made under this Step 3 is equal to the Total Excess Contributions. 
    
  (c)      Distribution of Excess Contributions  .  The Plan Administrator shall, not later than the last day of the Plan Year next following the Plan Year in which such amounts are contributed, distribute the Total Excess Contributions (including any income earned and minus any loss allocable to such amounts determined in accordance with Section 5.6) to the Highly Compensated Employees on whose behalf such Elective Deferrals were made.  Any required distribution will be made first from Elective Deferrals that are not Roth Contributions and then if necessary form Elective Deferrals that are Roth Contributions.  Matching Contributions (including any income earned and minus any loss allocable thereto determined in accordance with Section 5.6) made with respect to such distributed Elective Deferrals shall be forfeited and allocated in accordance with Section 4.10(f). 
    
  (d)      Average ADP; Actual Deferral Percentage  .  The  Average ADP  for a specified group of Active Participants for a Plan Year shall be the average of the Actual Deferral Percentages (as defined below) of the members of such group.  The  Actual Deferral Percentage  of an Active Participant is the ratio of the amount of Elective Deferrals actually paid over to the Plan on behalf of such Active Participant for such Plan Year divided by the Active Participant s Statutory Compensation for the Plan Year, or, at the discretion of the Plan Administrator to the extent not prohibited by regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury or his or her delegate, the sum of (i) Elective Deferrals (to the extent not included in the Actual Contribution Percentage under Section 5.03(d)), and (ii) any portion on all of the QNECS and QMACS actually paid over to the Plan on behalf of such Active Participant for the Plan Year, divided by the Active Participant s Compensation for the Plan Year. 

35 

(e)      Aggregation Rules  .  The Actual Deferral Percentage for any Active Participant who is a Highly Compensated Employee for the Plan Year and who is eligible to have Elective Deferrals allocated under this Plan and is also eligible to have elective deferrals (within the meaning of Code Section 401(m)(4)(B)), qualified matching contributions (within the meaning of Treas. Reg. Section 1.401(k)-6) or qualified nonelective contributions (within the meaning of Treas. Reg. Section 1.401(k)-6), allocated pursuant to a cash or deferred arrangement under one or more Related Plans shall be determined as if such elective deferrals, qualified matching contributions and qualified nonelective contributions were made under a single arrangement.  If a Highly Compensated Employee participates in two or more cash or deferred arrangements that have different plan years, all cash or deferred arrangements ending with or within the same calendar year shall be treated as a single arrangement. 
    
  In the event that this Plan satisfies the requirements of Code Section 401(k), 401(a)(4) or 410(b) only if aggregated with one or more Related Plans, or if one or more Related Plans satisfy the requirements of such sections of the Code only if aggregated with this Plan, then this Section shall be applied by determining the Actual Deferral Percentages of Participants as if this Plan and all such Related Plans were a single plan; provided, however, that the Plan and one or more Related Plans may be aggregated in order to satisfy the non-discrimination requirements of Code Section 401(k) only if such plans have the same plan year and employ consistent testing methods. 
    
  5.03      Excess Aggregate Contributions:  The ACP Test  .  Effective January 1, 2014 and because the Plan is intended to be a safe harbor plan, the Plan shall comply with the Safe Harbor Notice requirements as described in Section 2.53, the Plan shall be deemed to meet the requirements of this Section 5.03 with respect to Matching Contributions.  However, for any year the Plan is not deemed to meet the requirements of this Section 5.03, the Plan must meet one of the two tests (as described in subsection (a), below) with respect to Matching Contributions for any Plan Year.   
    
  Notwithstanding Section 4.02, Matching Contributions shall not exceed the amounts permitted under the non-discrimination rules of Code Section 401(m) as set forth in this Section. 
    
  (a)      Imposition of Limit  .  Matching Contributions made on behalf of Highly Compensated Employees for a Plan Year shall not exceed such amount as the Plan Administrator determines is necessary to cause the Average ACP (as defined in subsection (d) below) of Active Participants who are Highly Compensated Employees not to exceed the greater of the following limits (the  Required ACP Test ): 
    
  (1)      General Limit  .  The Average ACP of the Highly Compensated Employees for such Plan Year shall not be more than the Average ACP of all other Active Participants for such Plan Year Multiplied by 1.25; or 
    
  (2)      Alternative Limit  .  The excess of the Average ACP for Highly Compensated Employees for such Plan Year over the Average ACP of all other Active Participants for such Plan Year shall not be more than two (2) percentage points, and  
  
   36 

the Average ACP of the Highly Compensated Employees for such Plan Year shall not be more than the Average ACP of all other Active Participants for such Plan Year multiplied by two (2). 
    
  (b)      Manner of Reduction to Satisfy Limit  .  To the extent that the Plan Administrator, after giving effect to any reduction in the amount of Matching Contributions pursuant to Section 5.02(c), determines is necessary to pass the Required ACP Test, Matching Employer Contributions shall be reduced for Highly Compensated Employees in the following steps: 
    
  Step 1:  The Plan Administrator shall first determine the dollar amount of the reductions which would have to be made to the Matching Contributions of each Highly Compensated Employee who is an Active Participant for the Plan Year in order for the Average ACP of the Highly Compensated Employees to satisfy the Required ACP Test.  Such amount shall be calculated by first determining the dollar amount by which the Matching Contributions of the Highly Compensated Employees who have the highest Actual Contribution Percentage (as defined in subsection (d)) would have to be reduced until the first to occur of:  (i) such Employees  Actual Contribution Percentage would equal the Actual Contribution Percentage of the Highly Compensated Employee or group of Highly Compensated Employees with the next highest Actual Contribution Percentage; or (ii) the Average ACP of all of the Highly Compensated Employees, as recalculated after the reductions made under this Step 1, satisfies the Required ACP Test.  Then, unless the recalculated Average ACP of the Highly Compensated Employees satisfies the Required ACP Test, the reduction process shall be repeated by determining the dollar amount of reductions which would have to be made to the Matching Contributions of the Highly Compensated Employees who, after the prior reductions made in this Step 1 would have the highest Actual Contribution Percentage until the first to occur of: (iii) such Employees Actual Contribution Percentage, after all the current and prior reductions under this Step 1 would equal the Actual Contribution Percentage of the Highly Compensated Employee or group of Highly Compensated Employees with the next highest Actual Contribution Percentage; or (iv) the Average ACP of all of the Highly Compensated Employees, as recalculated after the current and all prior reductions under this Step 1, satisfies the Required ACP Test.  This process is repeated until the Average ACP of all of the Highly Compensated Employees, as recalculated after all reductions made under this Step 1, satisfies the Required ACP Test. 
    
  Step 2.  Next, the Plan Administrator shall determine the total dollar amount of reductions to the Matching Employer Contributions calculated under Step 1 ( Total Excess Aggregate Contributions ). 
    
  Step 3.  Finally, the Plan Administrator shall reduce the Matching Employer Contributions of the Highly Compensated Employees with the highest dollar amount of Matching Employer Contributions by the lesser of the dollar amount which:  (i) causes each such Highly Compensated Employee s Matching Contributions to equal the dollar amount of the Matching Employer Contributions of the Highly Compensated Employee or group  
  
   37 

of Highly Compensated Employees with the next highest dollar amount of Matching Contributions; or (ii) reduces the Highly Compensated Employees  Matching Contributions by the Total Excess Aggregate Contributions.  Then, unless the total amount of reductions made to Highly Compensated Employees  Matching Employer Contributions under this Step 3 equals the amount of Total Excess Aggregate Contributions, the reduction process shall be repeated by reducing the Matching Contributions of the group of Highly Compensated Employees with the highest dollar amount of Matching Employer Contributions, after the prior reductions made in this Step 3, by the lesser of the dollar amount which: (iii) causes each such Highly Compensated Employee s Matching Contributions, after the current and cell prior reductions under this Step 3, to equal the dollar amount of the Matching Contributions of Highly Compensated Employees with the next highest dollar amount of Matching Contributions; or (iv) causes total reductions to equal the Total Excess Aggregate Contributions.  This process is repeated with each successive group of Highly Compensated Employees with the highest dollar amount, after all reductions, of the Matching Contributions until the total reductions made under this Step 3 is equal to the Total Excess Aggregate Contributions. 
    
  (c)      Distribution of Excess Contributions  .  The Plan Administrator shall, not later than the last day of the Plan Year next following the Plan Year in which such amounts are contributed, distribute the Total Excess Aggregate Contributions (including any income earned and minus any loss allocable to such amounts determined in accordance with Section 5.05), to the Highly Compensated Employees on whose behalf such Matching Contributions were made.

  (2)    fifty percent (50%) of the Participant s vested Account Balance valued as of the most recent Valuation Date for which a valuation has been completed preceding the date of disbursement of the loan. 
    
  The minimum loan amount shall be one thousand dollars ($1,000).  No loan shall be available to a Participant unless the maximum loan available under this subsection (a) exceeds one thousand dollars ($1,000).  A Participant may not have more than one (1) loan from the Plan outstanding at any time (except additional loans granted for hurricane relief).  Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, a Participant who, on January 1, 2016, had outstanding loan balances under both the Plan and the Shaw Plan shall be permitted more than one (1) outstanding loan until such time as any loan initiated under the Shaw Plan is paid off. 
    
  (b)      Loan Terms  .  Any loan made under this Section 7.02 shall, by its terms, be required to be repaid within five (5) years, unless the loan is used to acquire a dwelling unit which within a reasonable time is to be used (determined at the time the loan is made) as a principal residence of the Participant, in which case the loan shall, by its terms, be required to be repaid within ten (10) years.  A Participant who, prior to January 1, 2014, had an outstanding home loan with a term exceeding ten (10) years shall be permitted to continue repayment on that loan under its original terms. 
    
  (c)      Level Amortization  .  All loans, except as provided in the regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury, shall be amortized over the term of the loan in substantially level payments not less frequently than quarterly.  A Participant s loan shall be repaid by means of payroll deduction. 
    
  (1)      Authorized Leave of Absence  .  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section, a Participant s loan payments shall be suspended for a period of up to one year while the Participant is on an unpaid Authorized Leave of Absence (other than a military leave described in clause (2) below); provided that the loan must be repaid within the term specified in subsection (b) and the installments due after the earlier of the Participant s resumption of active service or the first anniversary of the commencement of the Authorized Leave of Absence may not be less than the installments payable immediately prior to the commencement of the Authorized Leave of Absence. 

50 

(2)      Military Leave  .  Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (b) and (a), a Participant s loan repayments shall be suspended as permitted under Code Section 414(u)(4) during periods of absence from employment due to Qualified Military Leave effective as of December 12, 1994. 
    
  (d)      Loans Granted on a Reasonably Equivalent Basis  .  The Plan Administrator may grant such loans and may direct the Trustee to lend Trust Fund assets to such Participant, provided the Plan Administrator determines that such loans are available to all Participants on a reasonably equivalent basis, are not made available to Highly Compensated Employees in amounts greater than the amounts made available to other Employees, bear a reasonable rate of interest, and are adequately secured. 
    
  (e)      Pledge of Accounts  .  Any loan made pursuant to this Section 7.02 shall be made pro rata from the Participant s Accounts other than his or her Roth Contribution Account or any portion of his Account which is invested in a brokerage account described in Sections 2.32 and 6.08.  If a Participant s Account is invested in more than one Investment Fund at the time of the loan, the loan shall be made pro rata from each Investment Fund in which the Accounts from which the loan is disbursed are invested, except to the extent an Inactive Account is not available for loans as set forth in Schedule 1.  Such loan and any accrued but unpaid interest with respect thereto, shall constitute a first lien upon the interest of such Participant in the Accounts from and to the extent to which the loan is made and, to the extent that the loan may be unpaid at the time the Participant s Accounts become payable, shall be deducted from the amount payable to such Participant or his Beneficiary at the time of distribution of any portion of his or her Accounts.  In the event that a Participant fails to repay a loan according to its terms and foreclosure occurs, the Plan may foreclose on the portion of the Participant s Accounts which secure the loan and which would be distributable to the Participant as of the earliest date on which the Participant could elect a distribution or withdrawal pursuant to this Article or Article VII.  Such foreclosed amount shall be deemed to be a distribution. 
    
  A Participant may continue to make loan payments after his Termination of Employment so long as payments are established via ACH within sixty (60) days of his termination date.  The Participant may continue to make such loan payments until the first of the following dates to occur (i) the date the loan is paid off; or (ii) the date the Participant receives a distribution of his vested Account Balance. 
    
  (f)      Loan Earmarked as a Separate Investment for Participant s Accounts  .  The note representing the loan shall be segregated as a separate Investment Fund held by the Trustee as a separate earmarked investment solely for the account of the Participant.  Interest and principal payments on a Participant s loan shall be credited to each of the Participant s Accounts in the ratio that the amount of the loan borrowed from the Account bears to the total amount of the loan borrowed from all of the Participant s Accounts.  Interest and principal payments shall be invested in accordance with the Participant s investment election under Section 6.08 in effect at the time such interest and principal payment is made. 

51 

(g)      Spousal Consent  .  If any part of the loan will be disbursed from a Restricted Account, the Participant must obtain the consent of his or her spouse, if any, to use of his or her Accounts as security for the loan.  Spousal consent shall be obtained no earlier than the beginning of the ninety (90)-day period that ends on the date on which the loan is to be so secured.  The consent must be in writing, must acknowledge the effect of the loan and must be witnessed by a Plan representative or a notary public.  Such consent shall thereafter be binding with respect to the consenting spouse or any subsequent spouse with respect to that loan.  A new consent shall be required if the Accounts are used as security for the renegotiation, extension, renewal or other revision of the loan. 
    
  (h)      Loans Subject to Terms and Conditions Imposed by Plan Administration  .  Any loan made pursuant to this Section, subject to the foregoing requirements, shall be subject to such origination fee and other terms and conditions as the Plan Administrator may in its discretion impose.  The Plan Administrator may adopt such non-discriminatory rules and regulations relating to loans to Participants as it may deem appropriate. 
    
  7.03      Request for Distribution  .  A withdrawal or loan shall be paid only if the Participant or Beneficiary files a written request for a withdrawal with the Plan Administrator on such form as the Plan Administrator shall provide or permit and in accordance with such rules and regulations as the Plan Administrator may prescribe.  A withdrawal or loan disbursed to a married participant from a Restricted Account shall require the consent of the participant s spouse in accordance with Appendix A.  A withdrawal or loan shall be paid as soon as administratively feasible after the first Valuation Date that after the Plan Administrator receives a valid written request for a withdrawal or loan. 

52 

ARTICLE VIII 
  Benefits 
    
  8.01      Payment of Benefits in General  .  Subject to the special rules applicable to Restricted Accounts set forth in Appendix A, a Participant s benefits under this Plan shall be payable in accordance with the provisions of this Article.  Except as otherwise specifically provided, the provisions of this Article shall apply to all distributions occurring on or after the Effective Date including distributions to Participants (or to the Beneficiaries of deceased Participants) who had a Termination of Employment prior to the Effective Date. 
    
  8.02      Payment on Termination of Employment  .  If a Participant has a Termination of Employment, the Participant (or if the Participant has died, his or her Beneficiary) shall be entitled to a distribution of the vested portion of the Participant s Account Balance in such one of the following methods as the Participant (or if the Participant has died and has not elected a form of distribution which precludes his or her Beneficiary from making a subsequent election, the Participant s Beneficiary), may elect by written notice to the Plan Administrator in a form acceptable to the Plan Administrator: 
    
  (a)    a single lump sum; 
    
  (b)    installments at monthly, quarterly or annual intervals over a period certain not exceeding the period determined under Section 8.06(b) and in compliance with the requirements of Section 8.06. 
    
  Notwithstanding the foregoing and subject to the provisions of Section 8.09(e) if for any reason no election of a form of benefit is on file with the Plan Administrator when payment of the Participant s Account Balance is required under Section 8.03, or if the Participant s vested Account Balance does not exceed five thousand dollars ($5,000) at the time of the Participant s Termination of Employment, the Trustee will pay the Participant s vested Account Balance in a single lump sum. 
    
  8.03      Time of Payment  . 
    
  (a)      General  .  Distribution of a Participant s benefits upon Termination of Employment will normally be available as soon as reasonably practicable after the Valuation Date coinciding or with or next following the Participant s Termination of Employment, but not more than sixty (60) days following the end of the Plan Year in which his or her Termination of Employment occurred.  However, except as otherwise provided in this Section, a distribution shall be paid only if and after the Participant or Beneficiary files a written request for a distribution with the Plan Administrator on such form as the Plan Administrator shall provide or permit and in accordance with such rules and regulations as the Plan Administrator may prescribe.  The time of any distribution is subject to subsection (b), (c) and (d). 
    
  (b)      Consent Requirement  .  If the Participant s distributable Account balance is more than five thousand dollars ($5,000), and if the Participant is living but has not attained  
  
   53 

age sixty-five (65), distribution will not be made without the Participant s prior written consent before the Participant attains age sixty-five (65) or dies.  The Plan Administrator will notify each such terminated Participant of his or her right to give or withhold such consent at least thirty (30) days, but no more than ninety (90) days, before the date distribution is made (if in a lump sum) or begins (if in installments).  Such distribution may be made less than thirty (30) days after such notice is given if the Plan Administrator clearly informs the Participant that the Participant has a right to a period of at least thirty (30) days after receiving the notice to consider the decision whether to elect a distribution, and the Participant, after receiving the notice, affirmatively elects a distribution. 
    
  (c)      Limitation on Mandatory Deferral  .  The making (if in a lump sum) or commencement (if in installments) of any distribution shall not be delayed without the consent of the Participant (or Beneficiary) beyond sixty (60) days after the close of the Plan Year in which occurs the latest of (i) the Participant s Termination of Employment, or (ii) the Participant s Normal Retirement Date.  The failure of a Participant or Beneficiary to otherwise elect payment in accordance with the provisions of the Plan shall be deemed to be an election to defer the making or commencement of payment of benefits until such Participant files a request in accordance with subsection (a) and (if applicable) a consent in accordance with subsection (b), or until the Required Distribution Date as provided in subsection (d) below. 
    
  (d)      Required Distribution Date  .  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan or any Participant election, payment of benefits shall be made (if in a lump sum) or shall commence (if in installments) not later than the Participant s Required Distribution Date, or such later date as the Secretary of the Treasury or his or her delegate shall by applicable regulation, ruling or notice permit.  If the payment is made in installments, the installment schedule shall comply with Section 8.06.  If the payment is made by reason of the death of the Participant, the schedule shall comply with Section 8.05(d). 
    
  8.04      Lump Sum Payment Without Election  .  Subject to the provisions of Section 8.09(d), if a Participant (or the Beneficiary of a deceased Participant) is entitled to a distribution (including distributions with respect to Participants who had a Termination of Employment prior to January 1, 1997) and the value of a Participant s vested Account Balance does not exceed five thousand dollars ($5,000), the Plan Administrator shall direct the immediate distribution of such benefit in a single lump sum regardless of any election or consent of the Participant, his or her spouse or other Beneficiary; provided, however, that no cash-out payment under this subsection shall be made after distribution of benefits has begun without the consent of the Participant or (if the Participant has died and his or her surviving spouse is his or her Beneficiary) his or her surviving spouse. 
    
  8.05      Payment Upon Death  .   
    
  (a)      Designated Beneficiary  .  Each Participant shall designate a Beneficiary to receive payment of that portion, which may be all, of his or her Account Balance that is payable after the Participant s death, on such form as the Plan Administrator shall provide or permit and in accordance with such rules and regulations as the Plan Administrator may  
  
   54 

prescribe.  The Participant may change his or her Beneficiary from time to time by filing a Beneficiary designation in writing with the Plan Administrator.  No designation of Beneficiary or change of Beneficiary shall be effective unless and until it is received by the Plan Administrator during the Participant s lifetime and, if applicable, unless and until the consent of the Participant s spouse (in accordance with subsection) is received by the Plan Administrator. 
    
  (b)      Default Beneficiary  .  If a Participant shall fail to file a valid Beneficiary designation, or if all persons designated as the Beneficiary shall have died, (or, in the case of a Beneficiary other than an individual, ceased to exist), or if, after a reasonable search, the Plan Administrator is unable to locate the Participant s Beneficiary within a period of two years following the Participant s death, the Participant s Beneficiary shall be the first of the following in order of precedence: 
    
  (1)    the Participant s surviving spouse; 
    
  (2)    the Participants then-living descendants, if any, per stirpes; 
    
  (3)    the Participant s then-living parent or parents, equally; 
    
  (4)    the estate of the last to die of the Participant and any designated Beneficiary.  If, due to its value, the Participant s and/or the Beneficiary s estate is relieved from administration, the Participant's Account Balance shall be distributed (in such proportions as the Plan Administrator decides) to one or more Beneficiaries selected by the Plan Administrator, who shall be one or more of the Participant's relatives by blood, adoption or marriage.  The Plan Administrator may require documentation (to the extent required in the state of Participant s estate) evidencing such relief from administration. 
    
  (c)      Spousal Consent  .  If the Participant is married, his or her designation of a Beneficiary other than his or her surviving spouse will not be valid unless the spouse has consented to such designation of Beneficiary.  Such consent shall be: 
    
  (1)    in a writing acknowledging the effect of the consent; 
    
  (2)    signed by the Participant s spouse and witnessed by a notary public or (if the Plan Administrator is an individual employed by the Company or an Employer) the Plan Administrator or an Employee of the Company or an Employer working under the organizational supervision of the Plan Administrator; 
    
  (3)    effective only for the spouse who gives the consent; 
    
  (4)    effective only with respect to the specific beneficiary named in the consent unless the spouse voluntarily in such consent expressly permits subsequent  
  
   55 

elections of Beneficiaries without further spousal consent and acknowledges the spouse s right to limit the consent to a specific Beneficiary; and 
    
  (5)    irrevocable unless and until the Participant revokes his or her designation of Beneficiary. 
    
  However, the consent of a Participant s spouse shall not be required if (i) it is established to the satisfaction of a Plan representative that such consent may not be obtained because there is no spouse, or because the spouse cannot be located, (ii) the Participant is legally separated or the Participant has been abandoned (within the meaning of local law) and the Participant has a court order to such effect, or (iii) because of such other circumstances as the Secretary of the Treasury may by regulations prescribe. If the spouse is legally incompetent to give consent, the spouse s legal guardian, even if the guardian is the Participant, may give consent.  To the extent provided in any Qualified Domestic Relations Order (as defined in Section 13.03), the former spouse of a Participant shall be treated as the surviving spouse of such Participant for purposes of providing consent in accordance with this Section 8.05. 
    
  (d)      Time and Period of Distribution  .  Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 8.05, if a Participant dies before distributions begin, the Participant's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed,  no later than as follows: 
    
  (i)    If the Participant's surviving spouse is the Participant's sole designated Beneficiary, then distributions to the surviving spouse will begin no later than December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the Participant's death, or by December 31 of the calendar year in which the Participant would have attained age seventy and one-half (70-1/2), if later, 
    
  (ii)    If the Participant's surviving spouse is not the Participant's sole designated Beneficiary, or if there is no designated Beneficiary, then the Participant's entire interest will be distributed to the Beneficiary no later than December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the Participant's death.  If the Participant's surviving spouse is the Participant's sole designated Beneficiary and the surviving spouse dies after the Participant but before distributions to either the Participant or the surviving spouse begin, then this clause (ii) shall apply as if the surviving spouse were the Participant. 
    
  (iii)       Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Article VIII or Section 8.06, if for any reason any portion of a Participant's vested Account Balance is to be paid after his or her death to a trust or to an estate, distribution shall be made in the form of an immediate lump sum payment. 
    
  For purposes of this Section 8.05(d) and Section 8.06, distributions are considered to begin on the Participant's Required Distribution Date. If distributions under an annuity  
  
   56 

purchased from an insurance company irrevocably commence to the Participant before the Participant's Required Distribution Date (or to the Participant's surviving spouse before the date distributions are required to begin to the surviving spouse under clause (i)), the date distributions are considered to begin is the date distributions actually commence.  The minimum amount of distributions beginning pursuant to this Section 8.05(d) shall be determined under Section 8.06(e) 
    
  (e)      Rights of Beneficiary  .  The Beneficiary of a Participant who has died shall have the same rights and obligations as the Participant with respect to the portion of the interest of the Participant as to which he or she is the Beneficiary, to direct the investment of Accounts pursuant to Section 6.08 and to direct the Trustee with respect to exercise of rights in Company Stock pursuant to Section 6.09. 
    
  8.06      Minimum Distribution Requirements  . 
    
  (a)    A Participant's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed, to the Participant no later than the Participant's Required Distribution Date.  Unless a Participant's interest is distributed in a single sum on or before his or her Required Distribution Date, the amount required to be distributed for each calendar year, beginning with distributions for the first distribution calendar year (as defined in subsection (f)), will be made in accordance with this Section 8.06.  If the Participant's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company, distributions thereunder will be made in accordance with the requirements of Code Section 401(a)(9) and Treasury regulations. 
    
  (b)    During the Participant's lifetime, the minimum amount that will be distributed for each distribution calendar year is the lesser of: (i) the quotient obtained by dividing the Participant's account balance by the distribution period in the Uniform Lifetime Table set forth in Treas. Reg. Section 1.401(a)(9)-9, using the Participant's age as of the Participant's birthday in the distribution calendar year; or (ii) if the Participant's sole designated Beneficiary for the distribution calendar year is the Participant's spouse, the quotient obtained by dividing the Participant's account balance by the number in the Joint and Last Survivor Table set forth in Treas. Reg. Section 1.401(a)(9)-9, using the Participant's and spouse's attained ages as of the Participant's and spouse's birthdays in the distribution calendar year.  Required minimum distributions will be determined under this Section 8.06 beginning with the first distribution calendar year and up to and including the distribution calendar year that includes the Participant's date of death. 
    
  (c)    If a Participant dies on or after the date distributions begin and there is a designated Beneficiary, the minimum amount that will be distributed for each distribution calendar year after the year of the Participant's death is the quotient obtained by dividing the Participant's account balance by the longer of the remaining life expectancy of the Participant or the remaining life expectancy of the Participant's designated Beneficiary, determined as follows: 

57 

(i)     The Participant's remaining life expectancy is calculated using the age of the Participant in the year of death, reduced by one for each subsequent year. 
    
  (ii)     If the Participant's surviving spouse is the Participant's sole designated Beneficiary, the remaining life expectancy of the surviving spouse is calculated for each distribution calendar year after the year of the Participant's death using the surviving spouse's age as of the spouse's birthday in that year. For distribution calendar years after the year of the surviving spouse's death, the remaining life expectancy of the surviving spouse is calculated using the age of the surviving spouse as of the spouse's birthday in the calendar year of the spouse's death, reduced by one for each subsequent calendar year. 
    
  (iii)     If the Participant's surviving spouse is not the Participant's sole designated Beneficiary, the designated Beneficiary's remaining life expectancy is calculated using the age of the Beneficiary in the year following the year of the Participant's death, reduced by one for each subsequent year. 
    
  (d)    If the Participant dies on or after the date distributions begin and there is no designated Beneficiary, the minimum amount that will be distributed for each distribution calendar year after the year of the Participant's death is the quotient obtained by dividing the Participant's account balance by the Participant's remaining life expectancy calculated using the age of the Participant in the year of death, reduced by one for each subsequent year. 
    
  (e)    If the Participant dies before the date distributions begin then, subject to Section 8.05(d): 
    
  (i)    If there is a designated Beneficiary, the minimum amount that will be distributed for each distribution calendar year after the year of the Participant's death is the quotient obtained by dividing the Participant's account balance by the remaining life expectancy of the Participant's designated Beneficiary, determined as provided in subsection (d). 
    
  (ii)     If there is no designated Beneficiary, distribution of the Participant's entire interest will be completed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the Participant's death. 
    
  (iii)    If the Participant's surviving spouse is the Participant's sole designated Beneficiary, and the surviving spouse dies before distributions are required to begin to the surviving spouse under Section 8.05(d), this Section 8.06(e) will apply as if the surviving spouse were the Participant. 
    
  (f)    For purposes of this Section 8.05(d) and this Section 8.06: 

58 

(i)      "Designated Beneficiary  " means the individual who is designated as the Beneficiary under Section 8.05(a) of the Plan and is the designated Beneficiary under Section 401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code and Treas. Reg. Section 1.401(a)(9)-4. 
    
  (ii)    "  Distribution calendar year  " means a calendar year for which a minimum distribution is required. For distributions beginning before the Participant's death, the first distribution calendar year is the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year which contains the Participant's Required Distribution Date.  For distributions beginning after the Participant's death, the first distribution calendar year is the calendar year in which distributions are required to begin under Section 8.05(d).  The required minimum distribution for the Participant's first distribution calendar year will be made on or before the Participant's Required Distribution Date.  The required minimum distribution for other distribution calendar years, including the required minimum distribution for the distribution calendar year in which the Participant's Required Distribution Date occurs, will be made on or before December 31 of that distribution calendar year. 
    
  (iii)       "Life expectancy  " means life expectancy as computed by use of the Single Life Table in Treas. Reg. Section 1.401(a)(9)-9. 
    
  (iv)       "Participant's account balance  " means the account balance as of the last valuation date in the calendar year immediately preceding the distribution calendar year (valuation calendar year) increased by the amount of any contributions made and allocated or forfeitures allocated to the account balance as of dates in the valuation calendar year after the valuation date and decreased by distributions made in the valuation calendar year after the valuation date. The account balance for the valuation calendar year includes any amounts rolled over or transferred to the plan either in the valuation calendar year or in the distribution calendar year if distributed or transferred in the valuation calendar year. 
    
  (g)    The requirements of Section 8.05(d) and this Section 8.06 will take precedence over any inconsistent provisions of the Plan.  Distributions required under Section 8.05(d) and this Section 8.06 will be determined and made in accordance with the Treasury Regulations under Section 401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code. 
    
  (h)    2009 Waiver of Requirements. Notwithstanding other provisions of the Plan to the contrary; to the extent provided by Code Section 401(a)(9), IRS Notice 2009,-82 and any superseding guidance: 
    
  (i)    a Participant or Beneficiary who would have been required to receive a 2009 RMD will not receive that distribution for 2009 unless the Participant or Beneficiary chooses to receive such distribution. Participants and Beneficiaries described in the preceding sentence will be given the opportunity to elect to receive the distribution described in the preceding sentence.  
  
   59 

(ii)    a Participant or Beneficiary who would have been required to receive an Extended 2009 RMD will receive that distribution for 2009 unless the Participant or Beneficiary chooses not to receive such distribution. Participants and Beneficiaries described in the preceding sentence will be given the opportunity to elect to receive the distribution described in the preceding sentence.  
    
  In addition, notwithstanding other provisions of the Plan to the contrary, and solely for purposes of applying the direct rollover provisions of the Plan, 2009 RMDs and Extended 2009 RMDs will be treated as Eligible Rollover Distributions. 
    
  (iii)      Definitions: 
    
  1.      "2009 RMDs  " are Required Minimum Distributions for 2009 but for the enactment of Code Section 401(a)(9)(H); 
    
  2.      "Extended 2009 RMDs  " are one or more payments in a series of substantially equal distributions (that include the 2009 RMDs) made at least annually and expected to last for the life (or life expectancy) of the Participant, the joint lives (or joint life expectancy) of the Participant and the Participant s designated Beneficiary, or for a period of at least 10 years. 
    
  8.07      Facility of Payment  .  If a Participant or Beneficiary is (i) declared an incompetent or is a minor, (ii) a conservator, guardian, or other person legally charged with his or her care has been appointed, and (iii) written notice of such incompetency and appointment is filed with the Plan Administrator before distribution of benefits, then any benefits to which such Participant or Beneficiary is entitled shall be payable to such conservator, guardian, or other person legally charged with his or her care.  Neither the Company, any Employer, the Trustee, the Investment Committee, any Investment Manager, nor the Plan Administrator, shall be under any duty to see to the proper application of such payments made to a Participant, conservator, guardian, or relatives of a Participant. 
    
  8.08      Form of Payment  .  Each distribution shall be paid in cash (including negotiable check or other cash equivalent), except that a Participant or Beneficiary may elect in accordance with such procedures as the Plan Administrator may establish or adopt to receive that portion of his or her distributable Accounts invested in the Company Stock Fund in the form of whole shares (with cash in lieu of fractional shares) of such Company Stock.  In addition, the Participant may elect to receive an in-kind distribution of any portion of his distributable Accounts invested in a discount brokerage account. 
    
  8.09      Direct Rollover to Another Plan  .  Notwithstanding any provision of this Plan to the contrary, a Participant or other Distributee (as defined below), may elect, at such time and in such manner as prescribed by the Plan Administrator, to have all or any portion of the benefits payable to such Distributee which constitutes an Eligible Rollover Distribution (as defined below) as paid by the Trustee directly to the Eligible Retirement Plan specified by such Distributee.  Such election  
  
   60 

shall be subject to such reasonable administrative requirements as the Plan Administrator may from time to time establish which may include, but shall not be limited to, requirements consistent with Treasury Regulations and other guidance issued by the Internal Revenue Service permitting de minimis requirements for amounts eligible to be rolled over or paid partly to the Participant and partly rolled over.  An election may be made pursuant to this Section only after the Distributee has met otherwise applicable requirements for receipt of a distribution under the Plan, including any applicable requirements of Appendix A.  As used in this Section, the following terms shall have the following meanings: 
    
  (a)       Eligible Rollover Distribution    means any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the credit of the Distributee, except that an Eligible Rollover Distribution does not include any distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of the Distributee or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the Distributee and the Distributee s designated Beneficiary, or for a specified period of ten years or more; any distribution to the extent such distribution is required under Section 8.06(b); any distribution by reason of Hardship pursuant to Section 7.01(b); and except as provided in the following sentence the portion of any distribution that is not includable in gross income (determined without regard to the exclusion for net unrealized appreciation with respect to employer securities). A portion of a distribution shall not fail to be an Eligible Rollover Distribution merely because the portion consists of after-tax employee contributions which are not includable in gross income.  However, such portion may be transferred only to an individual retirement account or annuity described in Code Section 408(a) or (b), or to a qualified defined contribution plan described in Code Section 401(a) or 403(a) that agrees to separately account for amounts so transferred, including separately accounting for the portion of such distribution which is includable in gross income and the portion of such distribution which is not so includable. 
    
  A  portion  of  a  distribution  will  not  fail  to  be  an Eligible Rollover Distribution merely because the portion consists of all or a portion of the Participant's Roth Contribution Account or Roth Rollover Account.  However, such portion may be transferred only to another Roth elective deferral account under an applicable retirement plan described in Code Section 402A(e)(l)  or to a Roth IRA described in Code Section 408A, and only to the extent the direct rollover is permitted under the rules of Code Section 402(c). 
    
  (b)       Eligible Retirement Plan    means an individual retirement account described in Code Section 408(a), an individual retirement annuity described in Code Section 408(b), an annuity plan described in Code Section 403(a), or a qualified trust described in Code Section 401(a), that accepts the Distributee s Eligible Rollover Distributions.  However, in the case of an Eligible Rollover Distribution to a Participant s surviving spouse or surviving former spouse who is a Distributee pursuant to a Qualified Domestic Relations Order (as defined in Section 13.03), an Eligible Retirement Plan is an individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity.  For purposes of this Section an Eligible Retirement Plan shall also mean an annuity contract described in Code Section 403(b) and an eligible plan under Code Section 457(b) which is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state,  
  
   61 

or any agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state and which agrees to separately account for amounts transferred into such plan from this plan.  The definition of Eligible Retirement Plan shall also apply in the case of a distribution to a surviving spouse, or to a spouse or former spouse who is the alternate payee under a qualified domestic relation order, as defined in Code Section 414(p).   
    
  Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Participant may roll over a distribution from the Plan to a Roth IRA provided that the amount rolled over is an Eligible Rollover Distribution (as defined in Code Section 402(c)(4)) and, pursuant to Code Section 408A(d)(3)(A), there is included in gross income any amount that would be includible if the distribution were not rolled over. 
    
  Notwithstanding any provisions of this Plan to the contrary, a nonspouse Beneficiary may elect to have all or any portion of the benefits payable to such Distributee which constitutes an Eligible Rollover Distribution as defined in Code Section 402(c)(4) transferred directly to (A) an individual retirement account described in Code Section 408(a) or (B) an individual retirement annuity described in Code Section 408(b) (other than an endowment contract) that was established for the purpose of receiving the benefits on behalf of the nonspouse Beneficiary. 
    
  (c)       Distributee    means a Participant.  In addition, a Participant s surviving spouse, former spouse who is an alternative payee under a Qualified Domestic Relations Order, and a nonspouse Beneficiary are Distributees with regard to the interest of the spouse, former spouse, or nonspouse Beneficiary. 
    
  (d)       Direct Rollover    means a payment by the Plan to the Eligible Retirement Plan specified by the Distributee. 
    
  (e)      Automatic Rollovers  . In the event of a mandatory distribution greater than one thousand dollars ($1,000), if the Participant does not elect to have such distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the Participant in a direct rollover or to receive the distribution directly in accordance with Section 8.03(b), then the Plan Administrator will pay the distribution in a direct rollover to an individual retirement plan designated by the Plan Administrator. For purposes of determining whether a mandatory distribution is greater than one thousand dollars ($1,000), the portion of the Participant's distribution attributable to any Rollover Contribution is not included.  
    
  8.10      Deduction of Taxes from Amounts Payable  .  The Trustee may deduct from any amounts to be distributed under this Plan such amounts as authorized by the Plan Administrator to protect the Trustee and the Trust against liability for the payment of death, succession, inheritance, income, or other federal, state or local taxes, and out of the money so deducted, the Trustee, as directed by the Plan Administrator, may discharge any such liability and pay the amount remaining to the Participant or his or her Beneficiary, as the case may be.

  9.03      Plan Administrator Bonding and Expenses  .  The Plan Administrator shall serve without bond (except as otherwise required by federal law) and without compensation for his, her or its service as such; but all expenses incurred in the administration of the Plan and the Trust shall be paid by the Trust pursuant to Section 6.03 except to the extent paid by the Company. 
    
  9.04      Information To Be Supplied by Participants  .  Participants and Beneficiaries shall provide the Plan Administrator and the Trustee or their delegates with such information, as they shall from time to time determine to be necessary in the discharge of their duties for the administration of the Plan and the Trust.

  9.05      Information To Be Supplied by Employers  .  Employers shall provide the Plan Administrator and the Trustee or their delegates with such information, as they shall from time to time determine to be necessary in the discharge of their duties for the administration of the Plan and the Trust.

The regularly kept records of the Plan Administrator, the Company and the other Employers shall be conclusive evidence of the Service of a Participant, his or her Compensation, his or her age, marital status, status as an Eligible Employee, and all other matters contained in such records applicable to this Plan. 
    
  9.07      Electronic Media  .  Under procedures authorized or approved by the Plan Administrator, any form for any notice, election, designation, or similar communication required or permitted to be given to or received from a Participant or Beneficiary under this Plan may be made available to such Participant or Beneficiary in an electronic medium (including computer network, e-mail or voice response system) and any such communication to or from a Participant or Beneficiary through such electronic media shall be fully effective under this Plan for such purposes as such procedures shall prescribe; provided, however, that the consent of a spouse under Section 7.02(g), 8.05(c), or Appendix A, shall be effective only if made in a written document.  Any record of such communication retrieved from such electronic medium under its normal storage and retrieval parameters shall be effective as a fully authentic executed writing for all purposes of this Plan absent manifest error in the storage or retrieval process. 
  
   64 

9.08      Plan Administrator Decisions Final  .  The Plan Administrator shall have discretion to determine all matters within his, her or its jurisdictions.

ARTICLE X 
  Claims Procedure 
    
  10.01      Initial Claim for Benefits  .  Except as provided in Section 8.03 for requests for and consents to distribution in certain circumstances, and in Appendix A, no claim shall be required for benefits routinely due to be made or begin under this Plan.  Any Participant or Beneficiary (a  Claimant ) may submit to the Plan Administrator (or to such other person or persons as may be designated by the Plan Administrator) a claim for benefits not received or received in an improper amount.  A claim shall be in writing in such form as is provided or approved by the Plan Administrator.  A Claimant shall have no right to seek review of a denial of benefits, or to bring any action in any court to enforce a claim for benefits, prior to his or her filing a claim for benefits under this Section 10.01 and exhausting his or her rights to review under Section 10.02. 
    
  When a claim for benefits has been filed properly, the Plan Administrator shall evaluate such claim for benefits and notify the Claimant of its approval or the denial within ninety (90) days after the receipt of such claim unless special circumstances require an extension of time for processing the claim.  If such an extension of time for processing is required, the Plan administrator shall furnish written notice of the extension to the Claimant prior to the termination of the initial ninety (90) day period.  The notice shall specify the special circumstances requiring an extension and the date by which a final decision will be reached (which date shall not be later than one hundred and eighty (180) days after the date on which the claim was filed).  The Plan Administrator shall give the Claimant written notice whether the claim is granted or denied, in whole or in part.  If a claim is denied, in whole or in part, the Plan Administrator shall give the Claimant written notice which shall contain (1) the specific reasons for the denial, (2) references to pertinent plan provisions upon which the denial is based, (3) a description of any additional material or information necessary to perfect the claim and an explanation of why such material or information is necessary, and (4) the Claimant s rights to seek review of the denial. 
    
  10.02      Review of Claim Denial  .  If a claim is denied, in whole or in part (or if within the time periods presented in Section 10.01 the Claimant has not received an approval or a denial and the claim is therefore deemed denied), the Claimant shall have the right to request that the Plan Administrator (or such other person or persons as may be designated by the Plan Administrator) review the denial.  The Plan Administrator may in the sole and absolute discretion of the Plan Administrator appoint a third person other than the Plan Administrator, with such person s consent but without the consent of any Claimant, to make any decision on review of a claim under this Section 10.02, provided such person acknowledges in writing that he, she or it is a fiduciary with respect to this Plan for such purpose.  A request for review shall be in writing and must be filed with the Plan Administrator within sixty (60) days after the date on which the Claimant received written notification of the denial.  A Claimant (or his or her duly authorized representative) may request and receive copies of pertinent documents and submit issues and comments in writing to the Plan Administrator (or other designated person).  Within sixty (60) days after such request for review is received, the Plan Administrator (or other designated person) shall reconsider the decision and advise the Claimant in writing of the decision on review, unless special circumstances require an extension of time for processing the review, in which case the Plan Administrator (or other designated person) shall give the Claimant a written notification within such initial sixty (60) day  
  
   66 

period specifying the reasons for the extension and advising the Claimant when such review shall be completed.  Such review shall be completed within one hundred and twenty (120) days after the date on which the request for review was filed.  The Plan Administrator (or other designated person) shall forward the decision on review to the Claimant in writing and shall include specific reasons for the decision and references to plan provisions upon which the decision is based.  A decision on review shall be final and binding on all persons for all purposes.  No action may be brought in any court respecting benefits, which were the subject of a denial of a claim for benefits (other than an action by the Plan Administrator to enforce such denial) more than one (1) year after the denial of such claim.  If a Claimant shall fail to file a request for review in accordance with the procedures described in Sections 10.01 and 10.02, such Claimant shall have no right to review and shall have no right to bring action in any court and the denial of the claim shall become final and binding on all persons for all purposes.

ARTICLE XI 
  Amendment, Merger and Termination of the Plan 
    
  11.01      Amendments  .  The Company may amend, modify, change, revise, discontinue or terminate the Plan at any time prospectively or retroactively.  Such amendment, modification, change, revision, discontinuance or termination shall be done by written resolution of the Board, except that (i) an amendment or modification required (in the reasonable judgment of the Plan Administrator or the Company) to comply with changes in applicable law or to permit the issuance of or conform to the conditions of a favorable determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service on the qualification of the Plan under Code Section 401(a) may be done by written instrument signed on behalf of the Company by the Plan Administrator or officer of the Company; and (ii) the Plan Administrator may revise Schedule 1 from time to time to reflect the Accounts maintained from time to time under the Plan as long as such revision does not have an effect prohibited by this Section or Section 11.02.  However, except as authorized or permitted by provisions of the Code, or any other statute relating to employees  trusts, or regulations or ruling issued pursuant thereto, no amendment shall:  (i) increase the duties or liabilities of the Trustee or the Plan Administrator without the consent of the person affected;  (ii) have the effect of vesting in any Employer any interest in any funds, securities or other property subject to the terms of this Plan and the Trust Agreement; or authorizing or permitting at any time any part of the corpus or income of the Trust Fund to be used or diverted to purposes other than for the exclusive benefit of Participants and their Beneficiaries, except as provided in Sections 5.06 and 6.11 or applicable law as in effect from time to time, or (iii) divest any Participant of his or her vested Account Balance, decrease the Account Balance of any Participant, or eliminate or reduce any early retirement benefit or retirement-type subsidy or eliminate an optional form of benefit except as permitted by Code Section 411(d)(6) and Treasury Regulations and rulings thereunder or other applicable law as in effect from time to time. 
    
  11.02      Plan Merger  .  The Company may direct the merger or consolidation of this Plan with, or transfer of assets from this Plan to, another employee benefit plan qualified under Code Section 401(a) ( Other Plan ), or may direct the Trustee to accept the merger or consolidation of a Transferor Plan into, or a transfer of assets and liabilities, or portion thereof, from a Transferor Plan to this Plan, on such terms and conditions as the Company in its sole discretion deems desirable, in the same manner (and subject to the same conditions) as an amendment to this Plan under Section 11.01.  However, the Plan shall not merge or consolidate with, or transfer to or receive from any Transferor Plan or Other Plan any assets or liabilities, (i) unless each Participant would receive a benefit immediately after the merger, consolidation or transfer (if the Plan were then terminated) which is equal to or greater than the benefit to which he would have been entitled immediately before the merger, consolidation, or transfer (if the Plan were then terminated), and (ii) the merger, consolidation or transfer of assets does not have an effect prohibited by clause (iii) of the last sentence of Section 11.01 above.  The portion of any assets and liabilities received from a Transferor Plan that was attributable to elective contributions, qualified nonelective contributions or qualified matching contributions (as defined in Treas. Reg. Section 1.401(k)-6 ( 401(k) Assets and Liabilities ) shall remain subject to the distribution limitations of Treas. Reg. Section 1.401(k)-1(d).  401(k) Assets and Liabilities of this Plan shall not be transferred to an Other Plan unless the Other Plan provides (as determined by the Plan Administrator) that such 401(k) Assets and Liabilities may not be distributed before the times specified in Treas. Reg. Section 1.401(k)-1(d).  The portion  
  
   68 

of any assets and liabilities received from a Transferor Plan that was subject to Code Section 412 shall not be distributable before the earlier of the Participant s Normal Retirement Date or Termination of Employment except as otherwise required by Code Section 401(a)(9).  No merger, consolidation, or transfer of assets shall impose on the Company or any Related Company any liabilities or obligations of the sponsor of a Transferor Plan respecting the Transferor Plan or accounts transferred from the Transferor Plan (including but not limited to the obligation to make contributions to such accounts) unless the Company or Related Company expressly assumes such liabilities or obligations. 
    
  Subject to the conditions and limitations of Revenue Ruling 2008-40, a transfer of assets from the Plan s Trust to a nonqualified foreign trust shall be treated as a distribution. 
    
  Sponsorship of the Plan may not be transferred to an unrelated taxpayer if such transfer would violate Revenue Ruling 2008-45. 
    
  11.03      Plan Termination  .  The Company, by resolution of the Board, may reduce, suspend or discontinue Employer contributions hereunder, and terminate the Plan at any time in whole or in part, provided, however, that the termination of the Plan or the reduction, suspension or discontinuance of contributions hereunder shall not have any retroactive effect as to deprive any Participant or Beneficiary of any benefit already accrued. 
    
  11.04      Payment Upon Termination  .  Upon termination of the Plan or complete discontinuance of Employer contributions, the unvested portion of each Participant s Account Balance that has not been forfeited pursuant to Section 4.10 prior to the termination of the Plan or complete discontinuance of Employer contributions shall become fully vested and nonforfeitable.  Upon a partial termination of the Plan, the Account Balance of each former Active Participant who lost status as an Active Participant because of such partial termination shall become fully vested and nonforfeitable.  In determining whether a partial plan termination has occurred, the Plan Administrator shall employ the analysis set forth in IRS Revenue Ruling 2007-43.  In the event of termination of the Plan and after payment of all expenses, the Plan Administrator may direct that either (1) each Participant and each Beneficiary of a deceased Participant receive his or her entire Account Balance as soon as reasonably possible and permitted by regulations under Code Section 401(k) where the applicable Employer does not continue to maintain an alternative defined contribution plan, or (2) the Trust be continued and Participants  Account Balances be distributed at such times and in such manner as provided in Article VIII, in which case continued allocations of net income, gains, losses and expenses of the Trust Fund as provided in Article VI shall be made.  Any distribution upon Plan termination shall be deemed to include a distribution of Excess Deferrals, Total Excess Contributions, and Total Excess Aggregate Contributions, to the extent such distribution is required by Article V of the Plan. 
    
  11.05      Withdrawal from the Plan by an Employer  .  Any Employer other than the Company may withdraw from the Plan and Trust Agreement, under such terms and conditions as the Board may prescribe, by delivery to the Trustee and the Company of a resolution of its board of directors electing to so withdraw.  An Employer that ceases to be an Employer shall automatically withdraw from the Plan effective as of the date such Employer ceases to be an Employer unless then or  
  
   69 

thereafter such Employer affirmatively elects, and the Board affirmatively consents, to such Employer continuing to be an Employer under this Plan.

ARTICLE XII 
  Top Heavy Provisions 
    
  12.01      Application  .  The definitions in Section 12.02 shall apply under this Article XII and the special rules in Section 12.03 shall apply, notwithstanding any other provisions of the Plan, for any Plan Year in which the Plan is a Top Heavy Plan and for such other Plan Years as may be specified herein.  In any year in which the Plan is a multiple employer plan as described in Code Section 413(c), the provisions of this Article XII shall be applied separately to each Employer and Related Company taking account of benefits under the Plan provided to employees of the Employer or Related Company because of service with that Employer or Related Company.

With respect to Non-Key Employees, Elective Deferrals under the Plan and employer contributions attributable to salary reduction or similar arrangement under any Related Defined Contribution Plans shall not be included in Aggregate Employer Contributions.  Matching Contributions under the Plan and employer matching contributions (within the meaning of Code Section 401(m)(4)(A)) under any Related Defined Contribution Plans shall be included in Aggregate Employer Contributions.  Matching Contributions that are used to satisfy the minimum contribution requirements of Section 12.03(a) shall be treated as Matching Contributions for purposes of the actual contribution percentage test of Section 5.03 of the Plan and other applicable requirements of Code Section 401(m). 
    
  (b)       Aggregation Group    means the group of plans in a Mandatory Aggregation Group, if any, that includes the Plan, unless the inclusion of Related Plans in the Permissive Aggregation Group would prevent the Plan from being a Top Heavy Plan, in which case  Aggregation Group  means the group of plans consisting of the Plan and each other Related Plan in a Permissive Aggregation Group with the Plan. 
    
  (1)       Mandatory Aggregation Group    means each plan (considering the Plan and Related Plans) that, during the Plan Year that contains the Determination Date or any of the four preceding Plan Years, 
    
  (A)    had a participant who was a Key Employee, or 
    
  (B)    was necessary to be considered with a plan in which a Key Employee participated in order to enable the plan in which the Key Employee participated to meet the requirements of Code Section 401(a)(4) or 410. 

71 

If the Plan is not described in (A) or (B) above, it shall not be part of a Mandatory Aggregation Group. 
    
  (2)       Permissive Aggregation Group    means the group of plans consisting of (A) the plans, if any, in a Mandatory Aggregation Group with the Plan, and (B) any other Related Plan, that, when considered as a part of the Aggregation Group, does not cause the Aggregation Group to fail to satisfy the requirements of Code Sections 401(a)(4) and 410.  A Related Plan in (B) of the preceding sentence may include a simplified employee pension plan, as defined in Code Section 408(k), and a collectively bargained plan, if when considered as a part of the Aggregation Group such plan does not cause the Aggregation Group to fail to satisfy the requirements of Code Sections 401(a)(4) and 410 considering, if the plan is a multiemployer plan as described in Code Section 414(f) or a multiple employer plan as described in Code Section 413(c), benefits under the plan only to the extent provided to employees of the employer because service with the employer and, if the plan is a simplified employee pension plan, only the employer s contribution to the plan. 
    
  (c)       Determination Date    means, with respect to a Plan Year, the last day of the preceding Plan Year or, in the case of the first Plan Year, the last day of such Plan Year.  If the Plan is aggregated with other plans in the Aggregation Group, the Determination Date for each other plan shall be, with respect to any plan year, the Determination Date for each such other plan which falls in the same calendar year as the Determination Date for the Plan. 
    
  (d)       Key Employee    means, for the Plan Year containing the Determination Date, any Employee or former Employee (including any deceased employee) who at any time during such Plan Year was: 
    
  (1)    an officer (including administrative executives as described in Treas. Reg. Section 1.416-1(T-13)) of the Employer or a Related Company having annual Compensation for the Plan Year greater than one hundred seventy thousand dollars ($170,000) (as adjusted under Code Section 416(i)); 
    
  (2)    a more than five percent (5%) owner (or is considered as owning more than five percent (5%) within the meaning of Code Section 318) of the Employer or a Related Company; or 
    
  (3)    a more than one percent (1%) owner (or is considered as owning more than one percent (1%) within the meaning of Code Section 318) of the Employer or a Related Company and has an annual Compensation for such Plan Year from the Employer and Related Companies of more than one hundred fifty thousand dollars ($150,000). 
    
  No more than a total of fifty (50) persons (or, if lesser, the greater of three (3) persons or ten percent (10%) of all persons or beneficiaries of persons who are employees or former employees) shall be treated as Key Employees under paragraph (1) above for any Plan Year.   
  
   72 

If the number of persons who meet the requirements to be treated as Key Employees under paragraph (1) exceeds such limitation those persons with the highest annual Compensation in a Plan Year for which the requirements are met and who are within the limitation on the number of Key Employees will be treated as Key Employees.  For purposes of determining the number of officers taken into account hereunder, employees described in Section 2.26(b)(i) through (vi) shall be excluded.  The determination of who is a Key Employee will be made in accordance with Code Section 416(i) and the applicable regulations 
    
  (e)       Non-Key Employee    means a person with an accrued benefit or account balance in the Plan or any Related Plan in the Aggregation Group at any time during the Measurement Period who is not a Key Employee, and any beneficiary of such a person. 
    
  (f)       Present Value of Accrued Benefits    means, for any Plan Year, an amount equal to the sum of (1), (2) and (3), subject to (4), for each person who, in the Plan Year containing the Determination Date, was a Key Employee or a Non-Key Employee. 
    
  (1)    The value of a person s accrued benefit under the Plan and each Related Defined Contribution Plan in the Aggregation Group, determined as of the valuation date coincident with or immediately preceding the Determination Date, adjusted for contributions due as of the Determination Date, as follows: 
    
  (A)    in the case of a plan not subject to the minimum funding requirements of Code Section 412, by including the amount of any contributions actually made after the valuation date but on or before the Determination Date, and, in the first plan year of a plan, by including contributions made after the Determination Date that are allocated as of a date in that first plan year; and 
    
  (B)    in the case of a plan that is subject to the minimum funding requirements, by including the amount of any contributions that would be allocated as of a date not later than the Determination Date, plus adjustments to those amounts as required under applicable rulings, even though those amounts are not yet required to be contributed or allocated (e.g., because they have been waived) and by including the amount of any contributions actually made (or due to be made) after the valuation date but before the expiration of the extended payment period in Code Section 412(c)(10). 
    
  (2)    The sum of the actuarial present values of a person s accrued benefits under each Related Defined Benefit Plan in the Aggregation Group, expressed as a benefit commencing at Normal Retirement Date (or the person s attained age, if later) determined based on the following actuarial assumptions: 
    
  (A)    Interest rate: five percent (5%); and 
    
  (B)    Post Retirement Mortality: 1984 Unisex Pension Table; 
  
   73 

and determined in accordance with Code Section 416(g), provided, however, that the accrued benefit of any Non-Key Employee shall be determined under the method which is used for accrual purposes for all Related Defined Benefit Plans or, if no single accrual method is used in all such plans, such accrued benefit shall be determined as if such benefit accrued not more rapidly than the slowest accrual rate permitted under Code Section 411(b)(1)(C).  The present value of an accrued benefit for any person who is employed by an employer maintaining a plan on the Determination Date is determined as of the most recent valuation date which is within a twelve (12)-month period ending on the Determination Date, provided however that: 
    
  (C)    for the first plan year of the plan, the present value for an employee is determined as if the employee had a Termination of Employment (i) on the Determination Date or (ii) on such valuation date but taking into account the estimated accrued benefit as of the Determination Date; and 
    
  (D)    for the second and subsequent plan years of the plan, the accrued benefit taken into account for an employee is not less than the accrued benefit taken into account for the first plan year unless the difference is attributable to using an estimate of the accrued benefit as of the Determination Date for the first plan year and using the actual accrued benefit as of the Determination Date for the second plan year. 
    
  For purposes of this paragraph (2), the valuation date is the valuation date used by the plan for computing plan costs for minimum funding, regardless of whether a valuation is performed that year. 
    
  If the Plan provides for a nonproportional subsidy as described in Treasury Reg. Section 1.416-1(T-27), the present value of accrued benefits shall be determined taking into account the value of nonproportional subsidized early retirement benefits and nonproportional subsidized benefit options. 
    
  (3)    Distributions made with respect to the Employee under the Plan and any Related Plan within the Aggregation Group during the one (1)-year period ending on the determination date.  The preceding sentence shall also apply to distributions under a terminated plan which, had it not been terminated, would have been a Related Plan within the Aggregation Group.  In the case of a distribution for a reason other than severance from employment, death or disability, this provision shall be applied by substituting  five (5)-year period  for  one (1)-year period.  
    
  (4)    The following rules shall apply in determining the Present Value of Accrued Benefits: 

74 

(A)    Amounts attributable to qualified voluntary employee contributions, as defined in Code Section 219(e), shall be excluded. 
    
  (B)    In computing the Present Value of Accrued Benefits with respect to rollovers or plan-to-plan transfers, the following rules shall be applied to determine whether amounts which have been distributed during the five (5) year period ending on the Determination Date from or accepted into this Plan or any plan in the Aggregation Group shall be included in determining the Present Value of Accrued Benefits: 
    
  (i)    Unrelated Transfers accepted into the Plan or any plan in the Aggregation Group after December 31, 1983 shall not be included. 
    
  (ii)    Unrelated Transfers accepted on or before December 31, 1983 and all Related Transfers accepted at any time into the Plan or any plan in the Aggregation Group shall be included. 
    
  (iii)    Unrelated Transfers made from the Plan or any plan in the Aggregation Group shall be included. 
    
  (iv)    Related Transfers made from the Plan or any plan in the Aggregation Group shall not be included by the transferor plan (but shall be counted by the accepting plan). 
    
  (C)    The Accrued Benefit of any individual who has not performed services for the Employer maintaining the Plan at any time during the one (1) year period ending on the Determination Date shall be excluded. 
    
  (g)       Related Transfer    means a rollover or a plan-to-plan transfer which is either not initiated by the Employee or is made between plans each of which is maintained by a Related Company. 
    
  (h)    A    Top Heavy Aggregation Group    exists in any Plan Year for which, as of the Determination Date, the sum of the Present Value of Accrued Benefits for Key Employees under all plans in the Aggregation Group exceeds sixty percent (60%) of the sum of the Present Value of Accrued Benefits for all employees under all plans in the Aggregation Group; provided that, for purposes of determining the sum of the Present Value of Accrued Benefits for all employees, there shall be excluded the Present Value of Accrued Benefits of any Non-Key Employee who was a Key Employee for any Plan Year preceding the Plan Year that contains the Determination Date.  For purposes of applying the special rules herein with respect to a Super Top Heavy Plan, a Top Heavy Aggregation Group will also constitute a  Super Top Heavy Aggregation Group  if in any Plan Year as of the Determination Date, the sum of the Present Value of Accrued Benefits for Key Employees under all plans in the  
  
   75 

Aggregation Group exceeds ninety percent (90%) of the sum of the Present Value of Accrued Benefits for all employees under all plans in the Aggregation Group. 
    
  (i)       Top Heavy Plan    means the Plan in any Plan Year in which the Plan is a member of a Top Heavy Aggregation Group, including a Top Heavy Aggregation Group consisting solely of the Plan.  For purposes of applying the rules herein with respect to a Super Top Heavy Plan, a Top Heavy Plan will also constitute a  Super Top Heavy Plan  if the Plan in any Plan Year is a member of a Super Top Heavy Aggregation Group, including a Super Top Heavy Aggregation Group consisting solely of the Plan. 
    
  (j)       Unrelated Transfer    means a rollover or a plan-to-plan transfer which is both initiated by the Employee and (a) made from a plan maintained by a Related Company to a plan maintained by an employer which is not a Related Company or (b) made to a plan maintained by a Related Company from a plan maintained by an employer which is not a Related Company. 
    
  12.03      Special Top Heavy Provisions  .  For each Plan Year in which the Plan is a Top Heavy Plan, the following rules shall apply, except that the special provisions of this Section 12.03  shall not apply with respect to any employee included in a unit of employees covered by an agreement which the Secretary of Labor finds to be a collective-bargaining agreement between employee representatives and one or more Employers if there is evidence that retirement benefits were the subject of good faith bargaining between such employee representative and the Employer or Employers. 
    
  (a)      Minimum Employer Contributions  .  In any Plan Year in which the Plan is a Top Heavy Plan, the Employers shall make additional Employer Contributions to the Plan as necessary for each Participant who is employed on the last day of the Plan Year and who is a Non-Key Employee to bring the amount of his or her Aggregate Employer Contributions for the Plan Year up to at least three percent (3%) of his or her Compensation, or if the Plan is not required to be included in an Aggregation Group in order to permit a Related Defined Benefit Plan in the Aggregation Group to satisfy the requirements of Code Section 401(a)(4) or 410, such lesser amount as is equal to the largest percentage of a Key Employee s Compensation allocated to the Key Employee as Aggregate Employer Contributions, unless such Participant is a Participant in a Related Defined Benefit Plan and receives a minimum benefit thereunder in accordance with Code Section 416(c) in which case such Participant shall not receive a minimum contribution under this Section 12.03(a). 
    
  For purposes of determining whether a Non-Key Employee is a Participant entitled to have minimum Employer Contributions made on his or her behalf, a Non-Key Employee will be treated as a Participant even if he is not otherwise a Participant (or accrues no benefit) under the Plan because: 
    
  (i)    he has failed to complete the requisite number of hours of service (if any) after becoming a Participant in the Plan, 

76 

(ii)    he is excluded from participation in the Plan (or accrues no benefit) merely because his or her compensation is less than a stated amount, or 
    
  (iii)    he is excluded from participation in the Plan (or accrues no benefit) merely because of a failure to make mandatory employee contributions or, if the Plan is a 401(k) plan, because of a failure to make elective 401(k) contributions. 
    
  Contributions required by this subsection shall be allocated to the Company Contribution Account of the affected Non-Key Employee. 
    
  (b)      Vesting  .  For each Plan Year in which the Plan is a Top Heavy Plan and any Plan Year thereafter, the Employer Contribution Account of a Participant who has at least one (1) Hour of Service after the Plan becomes a Top Heavy Plan and who has completed three (3) or more years of Vesting Service shall become fully vested and nonforfeitable. 
    
  (c)      Terminated Plan  .  If the Plan becomes a Top Heavy Plan after it has formally been terminated, has ceased contributions and has been or is distributing all Plan assets to Participants and their Beneficiaries as soon as administratively feasible or if a terminated Plan has distributed all benefits of Participants and their Beneficiaries, the provisions of Section 12.03 shall not apply to the Plan. 
    
  (d)      Frozen Plans  .  If the Plan becomes a Top Heavy Plan after contributions have ceased under the Plan but all assets have not been distributed to Participants or their Beneficiaries, the provisions of Section 12.03 shall apply to the Plan.

ARTICLE XIII 
  Miscellaneous Provisions 
    
  13.01      Employer Joinder  .       
    
  (a)     Any Employer immediately before the Effective Date that continues to be a Related Company immediately after the Effective Date shall continue as an Employer under this Plan.  Any entity that is a Related Company as of the Effective Date or which is created by a transfer of assets from an Employer after the Effective Date, and that employs Employees within the United States who would be Eligible Employees if such Related Company were an Employer, shall be an Employer and shall be deemed to have adopted this Plan and the Trust unless such Related Company by resolution of its board of directors, or the Company by resolution of the Board, affirmatively provides that such Related Company shall not be an Employer or shall be an Employer only as to selected features pursuant to subsection (b) below.  Any other Related Company shall become an Employer as of the date (if any) as of which such Related Company adopts the Plan by resolution of its board of directors, or as of which the Company designates such Related Company as an Employer under the Plan by resolution of the Board.   
    
  (b)    An Employer may adopt this Plan (or the Company may designate a Related Company as an Employer) separately for each of (i) Elective Deferrals (including Catch-Up Deferrals) (ii) Matching Contributions (if it has also adopted the Plan for Elective Deferrals); (iii) Company Contributions; or (iv) combination thereof; in each case as specified by resolution of the Employer s board of directors or of the Company s Board.  Adoption of any of those Plan features will include for such Employer and its Eligible Employees all Plan provisions relating thereto and all generally applicable Plan provisions, but will not include for such Employer or its Eligible Employees Plan provisions to the extent relating to the features not adopted.  If the resolution of the Employer s board of directors or of the Company s Board does not specifically limit Plan adoption to fewer than all of the above features the Employer will be deemed to have adopted the Plan in its entirety for itself and its Eligible Employees. An Employer may withdraw separately from one or more of the above features by resolution of the Employer s board of directors in accordance with Section 11.05.  
    
  (c)    Each Employer other than the Company so adopting or deemed to have adopted the Plan thereby irrevocably appoints the Company as its agent to do on its behalf all acts and things required of an Employer under this Plan and authorizes the Plan Administrator to determine the Employer contributions required of such Employer under this Plan, to the end that Participants, Beneficiaries, the Trustee, the Plan Administrator, and all other persons may deal with the Company as if it were the only Employer under this Plan. 
    
  13.02      Non-Alienation of Benefits  .  Except as provided in Section 13.03, no benefit payable at any time under this Plan shall be subject in any manner to alienation, sale, transfer, assignment, pledge, attachment, or other legal processes, or encumbrance of any kind, other than federal tax  
  
   78 

levies and judgments which are enforceable under federal law.  Any attempt to alienate, sell, transfer, assign, pledge or otherwise encumber any such benefits, whether currently or thereafter payable, shall be void.  No benefit, nor any fund which may be established for the payment of such benefits, shall, in any manner, be liable for or subject to the debts or liabilities of any person entitled to such benefits. 
    
  13.03      Qualified Domestic Relations Order  .  Notwithstanding Section 13.02, the Plan will pay all or the designated portion of a Participant s Accounts to an Alternate Payee (as defined below) pursuant to a Qualified Domestic Relations Order (defined below).  Payments to an Alternate Payee pursuant to a Qualified Domestic Relations Order may not be made before the earlier of (i) the date on which the Participant corresponding to the Qualified Domestic Relations Order is entitled to a distribution under the Plan; or (ii) the later of (A) the date on which such Participant attains age 50 or (B) the earliest date on which such Participant could begin receiving benefits under the Plan if the Participant had separated from service; provided, however, that clause (ii)(A) shall not apply (and therefore the Plan will make distributions to an Alternate Payee under a Qualified Domestic Relations Order regardless of whether the Participant has attained age 50) if the Order specifies distributions at an earlier date than otherwise permitted by clause (ii)(A) or permits the Alternate Payee to request or consent to a distribution prior to the date specified by clause (ii)(A). 
    
  The term  Qualified Domestic Relations Order  means any judgment, decree or order (including approval of a property settlement agreement) which: 
    
  (a)     relates to the provision of child support, alimony payments, or marital property rights to a spouse, child or other dependent of a Participant, 
    
  (b)    is made pursuant to a State domestic relations law (including a community property law), 
    
  (c)    creates or recognizes the existence of an Alternate Payee s right to, or assigns to an Alternate Payee the right to, receive all or a portion of the benefits payable with respect to the Participant, 
    
  (d)    clearly specifies the name and last known mailing address, if any, of the Participant and the name and mailing address of each Alternate Payee covered by the order, the amount and percentage of the Participant s benefits to be paid by the Plan to each Alternate Payee, or the manner in which such amount or percentage is to be determined, the number of payments or period to which such order applies and each plan to which such order applies, and 
    
  (e)    does not require the Plan to provide (i) any form or type of benefit, or any option, not otherwise provided under the Plan, (ii) increased benefits (determined on the basis of actuarial value), (iii) benefits to a beneficiary inconsistent with the form of distribution available under Article VIII (or, if applicable, Appendix A), (iv) benefits to an Alternate Payee which are required to be paid to another payee under another order  
  
   79 

previously determined by the Plan Administrator to be a Qualified Domestic Relations Order; or (v) payments or other benefits to a person other than an Alternate Payee. 
    
  The Plan Administrator shall establish reasonable procedures to determine the qualified status of domestic relations order and to administer distributions under such qualified orders, including the establishment of segregated accounts for Alternate Payees. All expenses incurred by the Plan Administrator in determining the qualified status of a domestic relations order shall be paid as an administrative expense of the Plan as a whole. 
    
  The term  Alternate Payee  means any spouse, former spouse, child or other dependent of a Participant who is recognized by a Qualified Domestic Relations Order as having a right to receive all, or a portion of, the benefits payable under the Plan with respect to the Participant. To the extent provided in any Qualified Domestic Relations Order, the former spouse of a Participant shall be treated as the surviving spouse of such Participant for purposes of consenting to the naming of another Beneficiary to the extent provided in Sections 8.05 and Appendix A.  An Alternate Payee shall be considered a Beneficiary under the terms of this Plan until the Alternate payee s benefits are distributed. 
    
  In the case of any domestic relations order received by the Plan, the Plan Administrator shall separately account for the amounts payable under the domestic relations order.  If it is determined that the order is not a Qualified Domestic Relations Order, the amounts separately accounted for during such determination shall no longer be accounted for separately. 
    
  Pursuant to Department of Labor Regulations Section 2530.206, a domestic relations order will not fail to be a Qualified Domestic Relations Order solely because the domestic relations order: (i) revises or is issued after another domestic relations order or Qualified Domestic Relations Order, or (ii) the domestic relations order is issued after the Participant's death, divorce or annuity starting date. 
    
  13.04      Unclaimed Amounts  .  Unclaimed amounts shall consist of the amounts of the Accounts of a retired, deceased or terminated Participant which cannot be distributed because of the Plan Administrator s inability, after a reasonable search, to locate a Participant or his or her Beneficiary within a period of two (2) years after the payment of benefits becomes due in accordance with Section 8.03.  Unclaimed amounts for a Plan Year shall become a Forfeiture and shall be applied in accordance with Section 4.10(f) as of the close of the Plan Year in which such two (2)-year period shall end.  If an unclaimed amount is subsequently properly claimed by the Participant or the Participant s Beneficiary, said amount shall be paid to such Participant or Beneficiary out of Forfeitures for the Plan Year in which such benefits are properly claimed and to the extent that Forfeitures for such Plan Year are not sufficient, such payments shall be charged ratably against income or gain of the Trust Fund unless paid by an Employer. 
    
  13.05      No Contract of Employment  .  Nothing contained in this Plan shall be construed as a contract of employment between any Employer and any Employee or as creating a right of any Employee to be continued in the employment of any Employer. 

80 

13.06      Recoupment of or Reduction for Overpayment  .  If the Plan Administrator determines that any payment previously made to a putative Participant or Beneficiary was not properly payable, the person to whom such payment was made shall promptly upon notice and demand from the Plan Administrator repay such amount to the Trust, subject to the right of such payee to request review of such determination in accordance with Section 10.02.  If the person to whom such payment was made does not, within a reasonable time, make the requested repayment to the Plan, and if such person is entitled to other benefits from the Plan, the Plan Administrator may in his, her or its discretion treat the overpayment as an advance payment of benefits, and the Plan Administrator shall direct the Trustee to reduce all future benefits payable to that person, if any, by the amount of the overpayment. 
    
  13.07      Employees  Trust  .  The Plan and Trust are created for the exclusive purpose of providing benefits to the Participants in the Plan and their Beneficiaries and defraying reasonable expenses of administering the Plan and Trust. The Plan and Trust shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with their being a Plan described in Code Section 401(a) and a Trust exempt under Code Section 501(a). 
    
  13.08      Source of Benefits  .  All benefits payable under the Plan shall be paid or provided solely from the Trust and the Employers assume no liability or responsibility therefore. 
    
  13.09      Interest of Participants  .  No Participant or Beneficiary shall have any interest in any specific assets of the Trust Fund (other than notes representing a loan to the Participant pursuant to Section 7.02) but shall have only an undivided interest in the Trust Funds as a whole. 
    
  13.10      Indemnification  .  The Company shall indemnify and hold harmless the Plan Administrator, the members of the Investment Committee, and, if the Trustees are one or more individuals, the Trustees, and each officer and employee of an Employer to whom are delegated duties, responsibilities, and authority with respect to the Plan, from and against all claims, liabilities, fines and penalties, and all expenses reasonably incurred by or imposed upon him or her (including, but not limited to, reasonable attorney fees) which arise as a result of his or her actions or failure to act in connection with the operation and administration of the Plan to the extent lawfully allowable and to the extent that such claim, liability, fine, penalty, or expense is not paid for by liability insurance purchased or paid for by the Company.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not indemnify any person for any such amount incurred through any settlement or compromise of any action unless the Company consents in writing to such settlement or compromise. 
    
  13.11      Company Action  .  Any action this Plan requires or permits the Company to do (including any action taken by the Company as agent for any other Employer pursuant to Section 13.01) shall be properly done if done by resolution of its Board, or, unless this Plan expressly requires action by such Board, by any officer or employee of the Company authorized to take actions of such type on behalf of the Company (i) under the by-laws of the Company, (ii) by resolution of the Board, or (iii) by delegation from a person authorized under clause (i) or (ii). 
    
  13.12      Company Merger  .  In the event that any successor corporation to the Company, by merger, consolidation, purchase or otherwise, shall elect to adopt the Plan, such successor  
  
   81 

corporation shall be substituted hereunder for the Company upon filing in writing with the Trustee its election so to do. 
    
  13.13      Multiple Capacity  .  Any person or group of persons may serve in more than one capacity (including more than one fiduciary or nonfiduciary capacity or both a fiduciary and non-fiduciary capacity) with respect to the Plan. 
    
  13.14      Gender and Number  .  Except when the context indicates to the contrary, when used herein, masculine terms shall be deemed to include the feminine or neuter, and singular the plural. 
    
  13.15      Headings  . The headings of articles and sections are included solely for convenience of reference, and if there is any conflict between such headings and the text of this Plan, the text shall control. 
    
  13.16      Uniform and Non-Discriminatory Application of Provisions  .  The provisions of this Plan shall be interpreted and applied in a uniform and non-discriminatory manner with respect to all similarly situated Participants, former Participants, and Beneficiaries. 
    
  13.17      Invalidity of Certain Provisions  .  If any provision of this Plan shall be held invalid or unenforceable, such invalidity or unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions hereof and the Plan shall be construed and enforced as if such provisions, to the extent invalid or unenforceable, had not been included. 
    
  13.18      Law Governing  .  The Plan shall be construed and enforced according to the laws of Texas other than its laws with respect to choice of law, to the extent not preempted by ERISA.

APPENDIX A 
    
  A-1.      Distribution of Restricted Accounts  .  Notwithstanding any provisions in the Plan to the contrary, the balance of a Participant s Restricted Accounts may be distributed, in addition to the options specified in Section 8.02(a) and (b), by purchase with the vested balance of his or her Restricted Accounts and distribution to the Participant of a nontransferable annuity contract, providing for payment in the form of a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity (as defined below), and in any other form of distribution to which the participant would have been entitled under Section 6.02(b) of the Hourly Plan as in effect on December 31, 1996.  The Participant shall select the method by which his or her benefits shall be distributed in accordance with Section 8.03, except as modified by this Appendix A.  If no other election has been made under Section 8.03 and this Appendix A, the Participant s benefits attributable to his or her Restricted Accounts will be distributed in the form of a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity.   
    
  For purposes of this Appendix A, a  Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity , for a Participant who is legally married on his or her Annuity Starting Date, is an immediate installment refund annuity for the life of the Participant with a survivor annuity for the life of such spouse (if such spouse survives the Participant) that is fifty percent (50%) or seventy-five percent (75%), as selected by the Participant prior to the Annuity Starting Date, of the amount of the annuity which is payable during the joint lives of the Participant and the spouse, and which is the amount of such benefit that can be purchased with the vested balance of the Participant s Restricted Accounts.  If the Participant does not select a Qualifying Joint and Survivor Annuity of fifty percent (50%) or seventy-five percent (75%), then the default distribution shall be a fifty percent (50%) survivor annuity.  If the Participant is not married on his or her Annuity Starting Date, a  Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity  is an immediate installment refund annuity for the life of such Participant, which is the amount of such benefit that can be purchased with the vested balance of the Participant s Restricted Accounts.  The  Annuity Starting Date  is the first day of the first period for which an amount is paid as an annuity or any other form. 
    
  A-2.      Election and Revocation of Joint and Survivor Annuity Form  .  If a Participant is married on his or her Annuity Starting Date, his or her Restricted Account balances shall be paid in the form of a Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity, subject to the following provisions of this subsection.  Within one hundred eighty (180) days, but not less than thirty (30) days, preceding the Participant s Annuity Starting Date, the Plan Administrator will provide, by a means reasonably calculated to reach the Participant and his or her spouse, election information consisting of: 
    
  (a)    a written description of the Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity and the relative financial effect of payment of his or her Restricted Account balances in that form; 
    
  (b)    a notification of the right to waive payment in that form, the rights of his or her spouse with respect to such waiver and the right to revoke such waiver, and the effect of such revocation; and 
    
  (c)    the relative values of the various optional forms of benefit under the plan as provided in Treas. Reg. Section 1.417(a)-3. 
  
   84 

During an election period commencing on the date the Participant receives such election information and ending on the later of the one hundred eightieth (180   th   ) day thereafter or the Annuity Starting Date, a Participant may waive payment in the Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity form and elect payment in such another form permitted by Section A-1; provided that, the Participant s surviving spouse, if any, has consented in writing to such waiver and the spouse s consent acknowledges the effect of such revocation and is witnessed by a Plan representative or a notary public.  A Participant may, at any time during his or her election period, revoke any prior waiver of the Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity form.  However, the consent of his or her spouse once given shall be irrevocable unless and until the Participant revokes his or her prior waiver of the Joint and Survivor Annuity form.  A Participant may request, by writing filed with the Plan Administrator during his or her election period, an explanation, written in nontechnical language, of the terms, conditions and financial effect (in terms of dollars per monthly benefit payment) of payment in the Qualified Joint and Survivor Annuity form.  If not previously provided to the Participant, the Plan Administrator shall provide him or her with such explanation within thirty (30) days of his or her request by a method reasonably calculated to reach the Participant and his or her spouse, and the Participant s election period will be extended, if necessary, to include the one hundred eightieth (180   th   ) day next following the date on which he or she receives such explanation.  No distribution shall be made from a Participant s Restricted Accounts until his or her election period has terminated.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Participant s total distributable Account balances (not just Restricted Account balances) are less than one thousand dollars ($1,000) as of his or her date of Termination, the Trustee shall immediately distribute such benefits in a lump sum without such Participant s consent pursuant to Section 8.03 of the Plan. 
    
  A-3.       Pre-Retirement Survivor Annuity  .  The term  Pre-Retirement Survivor Annuity  means an installment refund annuity for the life of the Participant s surviving spouse, the payments under which are equal to the amount of benefit which can be purchased with the Participant s Restricted Accounts as of the date of his or her death.  Payment of such benefits will commence as soon as practicable after the date of the Participant s death, unless the surviving spouse elects a later date. Any election to waive the Pre-Retirement Survivor Annuity must be made by the Participant in writing during the election period described herein and shall require the spouse s consent in the same manner provided for in Section A-2.  The election period to waive the Pre-Retirement Survivor Annuity shall begin on the first day of the Plan Year in which the Participant attains age thirty-five (35) and end on the date of the Participant s death.  In the event a Participant separates from service prior to the beginning of the election period, the election period shall begin on the data of such separation from service.  In connection with the election, the Plan Administrator shall provide each Participant within the period beginning with the first day of the Plan Year in which the Participant attains age thirty-two (32) and ending with the close of the Plan Year preceding the Plan Year in which the Participant attains age thirty-five (35), a written explanation of the Pre-Retirement Survivor Annuity containing comparable information to that required pursuant to the provisions of subsections A-2(a), (b), and (c).  If the Participant enters the Plan after the first day of the Plan Year in which the Participant attained age thirty-two (32), the Plan Administrator shall provide notice no later than the close of the second Plan Year following the entry of the Participant into the Plan.  In the case of a Participant who has a Termination of Employment before the Plan Year in which age thirty-five (35) is attained, the written explanation shall be provided within the two (2) year  
  
   85 

period beginning one (1) year prior to Termination of Employment and ending one year after Termination of Employment.  If such a Participant thereafter returns to employment with the Employer, the applicable period for providing the written explanation shall be redetermined.  If the total distributable balance of the Participant s Accounts (not just Restricted Accounts) is less than one thousand dollars ($1,000) as of his or her date of Termination, the Trustees shall provide for the immediate distribution of such Accounts to the Participant s spouse.  If the value exceeds one thousand dollars ($1,000), an immediate distribution of the entire amount may be made to the surviving spouse, provided such surviving spouse consents in writing to such distribution.

  I, Philip K. Asherman, certify that: 
           1. 
    I have reviewed this quarterly report on Form 10-Q of Chicago Bridge   Iron Company N.V.; 
              2. 
    Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report; 
              3. 
    Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report; 
              4. 
    The registrant s other certifying officers and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have: 
              a) 
    Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared; 
              b) 
    Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; 
              c) 
    Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and 
              d) 
    Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant s most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant s fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect the registrant s internal control over financial reporting; and 
              5. 
    The registrant s other certifying officers and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant s auditors and the audit committee of the registrant s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions): 
              a) 
    All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and 
              b) 
    Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting.
