EXPLANATORY NOTE 
  This report combines the quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the period ended   September 30, 2016   of Kilroy Realty Corporation and Kilroy Realty, L.P.  Unless stated otherwise or the context otherwise requires, references to  Kilroy Realty Corporation  or the  Company,   we,   our,  and  us  mean Kilroy Realty Corporation, a Maryland corporation, and its controlled and consolidated subsidiaries, and references to  Kilroy Realty, L.P.  or the  Operating Partnership  mean Kilroy Realty, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership and its controlled and consolidated subsidiaries.  
  The Company is a real estate investment trust, or REIT, and the general partner of the Operating Partnership.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company owned an approximate   97.2%   common general partnership interest in the Operating Partnership.  The remaining approximate   2.8%   common limited partnership interests are owned by non-affiliated investors and certain directors and officers of the Company.  As the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, the Company exercises exclusive and complete discretion over the Operating Partnership s day-to-day management and control and can cause it to enter into certain major transactions, including acquisitions, dispositions and refinancings, and cause changes in its line of business, capital structure and distribution policies. 
  There are a few differences between the Company and the Operating Partnership that are reflected in the disclosures in this Form 10-Q.  We believe it is important to understand the differences between the Company and the Operating Partnership in the context of how the Company and the Operating Partnership operate as an interrelated, consolidated company.  The Company is a REIT, the only material asset of which is the partnership interests it holds in the Operating Partnership.  As a result, the Company generally does not conduct business itself, other than acting as the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, issuing equity from time to time and guaranteeing certain debt of the Operating Partnership.  The Company itself is not directly obligated under any indebtedness, but guarantees some of the debt of the Operating Partnership.  The Operating Partnership owns substantially all of the assets of the Company either directly or through its subsidiaries, conducts the operations of the Company s business and is structured as a limited partnership with no publicly traded equity.  Except for net proceeds from equity issuances by the Company, which the Company generally contributes to the Operating Partnership in exchange for units of partnership interest, the Operating Partnership generates the capital required by the Company s business through the Operating Partnership s operations, by the Operating Partnership s incurrence of indebtedness or through the issuance of units of partnership interest. 
  Noncontrolling interests and stockholders  equity and partners  capital are the main areas of difference between the consolidated financial statements of the Company and those of the Operating Partnership.  The common limited partnership interests in the Operating Partnership are accounted for as partners  capital in the Operating Partnership s financial statements and, to the extent not held by the Company, as noncontrolling interests in the Company s financial statements.  The Operating Partnership s financial statements reflect the noncontrolling interest in Kilroy Realty Finance Partnership, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the  Finance Partnership ).  This noncontrolling interest represents the Company s 1% indirect general partnership interest in the Finance Partnership, which is directly held by Kilroy Realty Finance, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.  The differences between stockholders  equity, partners  capital and noncontrolling interests result from the differences in the equity issued by the Company and the Operating Partnership, and in the Operating Partnership s noncontrolling interest in the Finance Partnership. 
  We believe combining the quarterly reports on Form 10-Q of the Company and the Operating Partnership into this single report results in the following benefits: 
             
    Combined reports better reflect how management and the analyst community view the business as a single operating unit; 
                
    Combined reports enhance investors  understanding of the Company and the Operating Partnership by enabling them to view the business as a whole and in the same manner as management; 
                
    Combined reports are more efficient for the Company and the Operating Partnership and result in savings in time, effort and expense; and 
                
    Combined reports are more efficient for investors by reducing duplicative disclosure and providing a single document for their review. 
     To help investors understand the significant differences between the Company and the Operating Partnership, this report presents the following separate sections for each of the Company and the Operating Partnership: 
             
    consolidated financial statements;

1.    Organization and Basis of Presentation  
    
  Organization 
    
  Kilroy Realty Corporation (the  Company ) is a self-administered real estate investment trust ( REIT ) active in premier office submarkets along the West Coast.  We own, develop, acquire and manage real estate assets, consisting primarily of Class A properties in the coastal regions of Los Angeles, Orange County, San Diego County, the San Francisco Bay Area and Greater Seattle, which we believe have strategic advantages and strong barriers to entry.  Class A real estate encompasses attractive and efficient buildings of high quality that are attractive to tenants, are well-designed and constructed with above-average material, workmanship and finishes and are well-maintained and managed.  We qualify as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the  Code ).  The Company s common stock is publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange ( NYSE ) under the ticker symbol  KRC.   
    
  We own our interests in all of our real estate assets through Kilroy Realty, L.P. (the  Operating Partnership ) and Kilroy Realty Finance Partnership, L.P. (the  Finance Partnership ).  We generally conduct substantially all of our operations through the Operating Partnership.  Unless stated otherwise or the context indicates otherwise, the terms  Kilroy Realty Corporation  or the  Company,   we,   our,  and  us  refer to Kilroy Realty Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries and the term  Operating Partnership  refers to Kilroy Realty, L.P. and its consolidated subsidiaries.  The descriptions of our business, employees and properties apply to both the Company and the Operating Partnership.  
    
  Our stabilized portfolio of operating properties was comprised of the following office properties at   September 30, 2016  :  

Our stabilized office portfolio includes all of our properties with the exception of development and redevelopment properties currently under construction or committed for construction,  lease-up  properties, real estate assets held for sale, undeveloped land and our recently completed residential property.  We define redevelopment properties as those properties for which we expect to spend significant development and construction costs on the existing or acquired buildings pursuant to a formal plan, the intended result of which is a higher economic return on the property.  We define  lease-up  properties as office properties we recently developed or redeveloped that have not yet reached   95%   occupancy and are within one year following cessation of major construction activities.   
    
  During the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , we stabilized   two   development projects consisting of   455,340   rentable square feet and   185,602   rentable square feet in San Francisco, California, which were included in our stabilized office portfolio as of   September 30, 2016  .  As of   September 30, 2016  , the following properties, in addition to our recently completed residential property, were excluded from our stabilized office portfolio.  We did not have any redevelopment properties at   September 30, 2016  .

    Estimated rentable square feet upon completion. 
              (2) 
    See Note 3  Dispositions and Real Estate Assets Held for Sale  for additional information. 
       
  Our stabilized office portfolio also excludes our near-term and future development pipeline, which as of   September 30, 2016   was comprised of     eight     development sites, representing approximately   70     gross acres of undeveloped land.   
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we owned   100%   of our properties and development projects, excluding   three   office properties owned by   two   consolidated property partnerships.  One property partnership, 100 First Street Member, LLC ( 100 First LLC ), owned   one   office property through a subsidiary REIT (see Notes 7 and 8 for additional information).  The other property partnership,

  NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued) 

Redwood City Partners, LLC ( Redwood LLC ) owned   two   office properties.  Both property partnerships are consolidated entities.  As of   September 30, 2016  , all of our properties and development projects were owned and all of our business was conducted in the state of California with the exception of   twelve   office properties and   one   future development project located in the state of Washington.   
    
  Ownership and Basis of Presentation  
    
  The consolidated financial statements of the Company include the consolidated financial position and results of operations of the Company, the Operating Partnership, the Finance Partnership, KSLLC, 100 First LLC, Redwood LLC and all of our wholly-owned and controlled subsidiaries.  The consolidated financial statements of the Operating Partnership include the consolidated financial position and results of operations of the Operating Partnership, the Finance Partnership, KSLLC, Redwood LLC, 100 First LLC and all wholly-owned and controlled subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership.  All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.  
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company owned an approximate   97.2%   common general partnership interest in the Operating Partnership.  The remaining approximate   2.8%   common limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership as of   September 30, 2016  , was owned by non-affiliated investors and certain of our executive officers and directors (see Note 7).  Both the general and limited common partnership interests in the Operating Partnership are denominated in common units.  Generally, the number of common units held by the Company is equivalent to the number of outstanding shares of the Company s common stock, and the rights of all the common units to quarterly distributions and payments in liquidation mirror those of the Company s common stockholders.  The common limited partners have certain redemption rights as provided in the Operating Partnership s Seventh Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership, as amended, the  Partnership Agreement  (see Note 7).   
    
  Kilroy Realty Finance, Inc., which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, is the sole general partner of the Finance Partnership and owns a   1.0%   common general partnership interest in the Finance Partnership.  The Operating Partnership owns the remaining   99.0%   common limited partnership interest.  Kilroy Services, LLC ( KSLLC ), which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Operating Partnership, is the entity through which we generally conduct substantially all of our development activities.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company owned an approximate   56%   equity interest in 100 First LLC.   The remaining interest was owned by an unrelated third party.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company owned an approximate   93%   equity interest in Redwood LLC.  The remaining interest was owned by an unrelated third party.  With the exception of the Operating Partnership, Redwood LLC and 100 First LLC, all of our subsidiaries are wholly-owned. 
    
  The accompanying interim financial statements have been prepared by management in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) and in conjunction with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ).  Certain information and footnote disclosures required for annual financial statements have been condensed or excluded pursuant to SEC rules and regulations.  Accordingly, the interim financial statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements.  In the opinion of management, the accompanying interim financial statements reflect all adjustments of a normal and recurring nature that are considered necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented.  However, the results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31,   2016  .  The interim financial statements for the Company and the Operating Partnership should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Adoption of New Accounting Pronouncements       
  Variable Interest Entities  
  Effective January 1, 2016, the Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No. 2015-02 ( ASU 2015-02 ), which amended certain guidance with respect to the evaluation of Variable Interest Entities ( VIEs ) and when a reporting entity is required to consolidate certain legal entities.  Specifically, the amendments: (i) modify the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are VIEs or voting interest entities, (ii) eliminate the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership, (iii) affect the consolidation analysis of reporting entities that are involved with VIEs, and (iv) provide a scope exception for certain entities.   
  Under the new guidance, effective January 1, 2016, the Operating Partnership was determined to be a VIE of the Company as the Operating Partnership is a limited partnership in which the common limited partners do not have substantive kick-out rights or participating rights.  However, given that the Company was deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the Operating Partnership because the Company has the ability to control the activities that most significantly impact the Operating Partnership's economic  
  
    10    

KILROY REALTY CORPORATION AND KILROY REALTY, L.P. 
  NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued) 

performance, the adoption of this new guidance and the conclusion that the Operating Partnership was a VIE did not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements since the conclusion to consolidate the Operating Partnership still applied.  The Operating Partnership was the only new VIE identified as part of the adoption of the guidance as of January 1, 2016.  
  At   September 30, 2016  , the consolidated financial statements of the Company included   one   VIE in addition to the Operating Partnership, 100 First LLC (see Note 7 for further discussion of the formation transaction for this VIE), and the consolidated financial statements of the Operating Partnership included only   one   VIE, 100 First LLC.  The Operating Partnership was determined to be the primary beneficiary of 100 First LLC because it has the ability to control the activities that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the VIE s total assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interest included on our consolidated balance sheet were approximately   $191.3 million   (of which   $173.2 million   related to real estate held for investment), approximately   $11.8 million   and approximately   $79.0 million  , respectively.  Revenues, income and net assets generated by 100 First LLC may only be used to settle its contractual obligations, which primarily consist of operating expenses, capital expenditures and required distributions. 
    
  At   December 31, 2015  , the consolidated financial statements of the Company and the Operating Partnership included   two   VIEs in which we were deemed to be the primary beneficiary: Redwood LLC and   one   other VIE to facilitate a potential future Section 1031 Exchange to defer taxable gains on property dispositions for federal income tax purposes.  At   December 31, 2015  , the impact of consolidating the VIEs increased the Company s total assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interests by approximately   $203.3 million   (of which   $187.3 million   related to real estate held for investment on our consolidated balance sheet), approximately   $28.8 million   and approximately   $6.5 million  , respectively.  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , Redwood LLC had a VIE reconsideration event and was determined to no longer be a VIE and the VIE to facilitate a potential future Section 1031 Exchange was terminated.  
  Reclassification of Debt Issuance Costs  
  Effective January 1, 2016, the Company adopted FASB ASU No. 2015-03 and No. 2015-15, which requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts.  However, for line-of-credit arrangements, entities may defer and present debt issuance costs as an asset and amortize the costs ratably over the term of the line of credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line of credit arrangement.  As a result of our adoption of the guidance,   $1.1 million   of deferred financing costs as of   December 31, 2015   were reclassified to reduce secured debt, net and   $12.0 million   of deferred financing costs as of   December 31, 2015   were reclassified to reduce unsecured debt, net in the   December 31, 2015   balances on our consolidated balance sheets.  In addition,   $4.6 million   of deferred financing costs relating to our unsecured line of credit as of   December 31, 2015   were reclassified to prepaid expenses and other assets, net in the   December 31, 2015   balances on our consolidated balance sheets.  The guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements  
    
  On August 26, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15 ( ASU 2016-15 ) to provide guidance for areas where there is diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows.  ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  The Company does not currently anticipate that the guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or notes to our consolidated financial statements. 
  On June 16, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13 ( ASU 2016-13 ) to amend the accounting for credit losses for certain financial instruments.  Under the new guidance, an entity recognizes its estimate of expected credit losses as an allowance, which the FASB believes will result in more timely recognition of such losses.  ASU 2016-13 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption is permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  The Company does not currently anticipate that the guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or notes to our consolidated financial statements. 
  On May 9, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12, which clarifies and provides practical expedients for certain aspects of ASU No. 2014-09, which outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenues arising from contracts with customers and notes that lease contracts with customers are a scope exception.  Public business entities may elect to adopt the amendments as of the original effective date; however, adoption is required for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017.  The Company is currently assessing the impact of the guidance on our consolidated financial statements and notes to our consolidated financial statements.

  NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued) 

On March 30, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09 ( ASU 2016-09 ) to amend the accounting guidance for share-based payment accounting.  The areas for simplification in ASU 2016-09 involve several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows.  ASU 2016-09 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those annual periods and early adoption is permitted.  The Company does not currently anticipate that the guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or notes to our consolidated financial statements. 
  On February 25, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02 ( ASU 2016-02 ) to amend the accounting guidance for leases.  The accounting applied by a lessor is largely unchanged under ASU 2016-02.  However, the standard requires lessees to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities for leases classified as operating leases on the balance sheet.  Lessees will recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term.  For leases with a term of 12 months or less, a lessee is permitted to make an accounting policy election by class of underlying asset not to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities.  If a lessee makes this election, it will recognize lease expense for such leases generally on a straight-line basis over the lease term.  ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and early adoption is permitted.  The Company is currently assessing the impact of the guidance on our consolidated financial statements and notes to our consolidated financial statements. 
  On January 5, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01 ( ASU 2016-01 ) to amend the accounting guidance on the classification and measurement of financial instruments.  The standard requires that all investments in equity securities, including other ownership interests, are carried at fair value through net income.  This requirement does not apply to investments that qualify for equity method accounting or to those that result in consolidation of the investee or for which the entity has elected the predictability exception to fair value measurement.  Additionally, the standard requires that the portion of the total fair value change caused by a change in instrument-specific credit risk for financial liabilities for which the fair value option has been elected would be recognized in other comprehensive income.  Any accumulated amount remaining in other comprehensive income is reclassified to earnings when the liability is extinguished.  ASU 2016-01 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017.  The Company does not currently anticipate that the guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or notes to our consolidated financial statements.

The remaining approximate   2.8%  ,   1.9%   and   1.9%   common limited partnership interest as of   September 30, 2016  ,   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively, was owned by non-affiliated investors and certain of our executive officers and directors in the form of noncontrolling common units.  There were   2,631,276  ,   1,764,775   and   1,788,170     common units outstanding held by these investors, executive officers and directors as of   September 30, 2016  ,   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively.  The increase in the common units from   December 31, 2015   to   September 30, 2016   was attributable to   867,701   common units issued in connection with an acquisition (see Note 2) partially offset by a unit redemption. 
    
  The noncontrolling common units may be redeemed by unitholders for cash.  Except under certain circumstances, we, at our option, may satisfy the cash redemption obligation with shares of the Company s common stock on a one-for-one basis.  If satisfied in cash, the value for each noncontrolling common unit upon redemption is the amount equal to the average of the closing quoted price per share of the Company s common stock, par value   $.01   per share, as reported on the NYSE for the ten trading days immediately preceding the applicable redemption date.  The aggregate value upon redemption of the then-outstanding noncontrolling common units was   $181.7 million   and   $112.0 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  This redemption value does not necessarily represent the amount that would be distributed with respect to each noncontrolling common unit in the event of our termination or liquidation.  In the event of our termination or liquidation, it is expected in most cases that each common unit would be entitled to a liquidating distribution equal to the liquidating distribution payable in respect of each share of the Company s common stock.   
    
  Consolidated Property Partnerships 
    
  On August 30, 2016, the Operating Partnership entered into agreements with a third party whereby the third party will invest, through REIT subsidiaries, in   two   existing companies that owned the Company s 100 First Street and 303 Second Street office properties located in San Francisco, California.  Based on a gross valuation of the   two   properties of approximately     $1.2 billion  , the third party will contribute a total of   $452.9 million   for a   44%   common equity interest in the companies.   
  The transaction was structured with a staggered closing.  On August 30, 2016, the first tranche of the transaction (the  100 First Street Transaction ) closed and the third party contributed   $191.4 million   plus a working capital contribution of   $2.1 million   for a   44%   common ownership interest in 100 First LLC.  The second tranche of the transaction (the  303 Second Street Transaction ) is expected to close on November 30, 2016, at which time the third party will contribute   $261.5 million  , which is net of its proportionate share of the existing mortgage debt secured by the 303 Second Street property, for a   44%   common ownership interest in 303 Second Street Member, LLC.  
  The 100 First Street Transaction did not meet the criteria to qualify as a sale of real estate because the Company continues to effectively control the property and therefore will continue to account for the property on a consolidated basis in its financial statements.  The Company has accounted for the 100 First Street Transaction as an equity transaction and has recognized the noncontrolling interest in its consolidated balance sheets totaling approximately   $78.7 million  , which is equal to   44%   of the aggregate carrying value of the total equity of 100 First LLC immediately prior to the transaction plus the third party s   $2.1 million   working capital contribution.      The amount of the third party s total contribution not recognized as noncontrolling interest was approximately   $113.0 million  , which is net of transaction costs.  This amount has not been reflected as a gain on sale of operating properties in the Company s consolidated statements of operations and has instead been reflected as an increase in additional paid-in capital and partners  capital in the Company s and the Operating Partnership s consolidated balance sheets, respectively.  Transfers of less than 50% of an entity ownership interest are normally not subject to certain tax assessments in California and therefore the Company believes that the 100 First Street Transaction does not meet the statutory requirements for such tax assessments.  If the taxing authority attempted to assess such tax assessments on the 100 First Street Transaction, the Company estimates it could incur

additional taxes of up to   $10.9 million   plus potential penalties and interest.   The Company anticipates that the 303 Second Street Transaction will be accounted for in the same manner as the 100 First Street Transaction upon closing in November 2016. 
  In connection with the transaction, the Company will provide customary property management, leasing and construction management services for both properties. 100 First Street is a   467,095   square foot office tower, and 303 Second Street is a   740,047   square foot office property, both located in the South of Market submarket in San Francisco, California.   
    
  The noncontrolling interest in 100 First LLC as of   September 30, 2016   was   $79.0 million   which is recognized in noncontrolling interests in consolidated property partnerships on the Company's consolidated balance sheets.  The remaining amount of noncontrolling interests in consolidated property partnerships represents the third party equity interest in Redwood LLC.  This noncontrolling interest was   $6.5 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .

  Consolidated Property Partnerships 
    
  On August 30, 2016, the Operating Partnership entered into agreements with a third party whereby the third party will invest, through REIT subsidiaries, in   two   existing companies that owned the Company s 100 First Street and 303 Second Street office properties located in San Francisco, California.  Based on a gross valuation of the   two   properties of approximately     $1.2 billion  , the third party will contribute a total of   $452.9 million   for a   44%   common equity interest in the companies.   
  The transaction was structured with a staggered closing.  On August 30, 2016, the 100 First Street Transaction closed and the third party contributed   $191.4 million   plus a working capital contribution of   $2.1 million   for a   44%   common ownership interest in 100 First LLC.  The 303 Second Street Transaction is expected to close on November 30, 2016, at which time the third party will contribute   $261.5 million  , which is net of its proportionate share of the existing mortgage debt secured by the 303 Second Street property, for a   44%   common ownership interest in 303 Second Street Member, LLC.  Refer to Note 7 for additional information regarding the transaction. 
  The noncontrolling interest in 100 First LLC as of   September 30, 2016   was   $79.0 million   which is recognized in noncontrolling interests in consolidated property partnerships on the Operating Partnership's consolidated balance sheets.  The remaining amount of noncontrolling interests in consolidated property partnerships represents the third party equity interest in Redwood LLC.  This noncontrolling interest was   $6.5 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .

11.    Share-Based Compensation   
    
  Stockholder Approved Equity Compensation Plans  
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we maintained   one   share-based incentive compensation plan, the Kilroy Realty 2006 Incentive Award Plan, as amended (the  2006 Plan ).  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   1,354,143   shares were available for grant under the 2006 Plan.  The calculation of shares available for grant is presented after taking into account a reserve for a sufficient number of shares to cover the vesting and payment of 2006 Plan awards that were outstanding on that date, including performance-based vesting awards at (i) levels actually achieved for the performance conditions (as defined below) and (ii) at target levels for the market conditions (as defined below) applicable to these awards.  
    
  2016 Share-Based Compensation Grants 
    
  On   January 28, 2016  , the Executive Compensation Committee of the Company s Board of Directors awarded   294,821   restricted stock units ( RSUs ) to certain officers of the Company under the 2006 Plan, which included   168,077   RSUs (at the target level of performance), or   57%  , that are subject to market and performance-based vesting requirements (the  2016 Performance-Based RSUs ) and   126,744   RSUs, or   43%  , that are subject to time-based vesting requirements (the  2016 Time-Based RSUs ).  
    
  During   2016  , the Executive Compensation Committee of the Company s Board of Directors also awarded   55,713   RSUs to various officers of the Company under the 2006 Plan (the  2016 Special RSUs ).  
    
  2016 Performance-Based RSU Grant 
    
  The 2016 Performance-Based RSUs are scheduled to vest at the end of a   three  -year period based upon the achievement of pre-set FFO per share goals (the  performance condition ) for the year ending December 31, 2016 and also based upon the average annual relative total stockholder return ranking for the Company compared to an established comparison group of companies (the  market condition ) for the   three  -year period ending December 31, 2018.  The 2016 Performance-Based RSUs are also subject to a   three  -year service vesting provision and are scheduled to cliff vest at the end of the   three  -year period.  The number of 2016 Performance-Based RSUs ultimately earned could fluctuate from the target number of 2016 Performance-Based RSUs granted based upon the levels of achievement for both the performance condition and the market condition.  The estimate of the number of 2016 Performance-Based RSUs earned are evaluated quarterly during the 2016 performance period based on our estimate as to the 2016 FFO per share performance measured against the applicable goals.  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   206,907   2016 Performance-Based RSUs are estimated to be earned based on the Company s estimate of 2016 FFO per share performance measured against the applicable goals, and the compensation cost recorded to date for this program was based on that estimate.  Compensation expense for the 2016 Performance-Based RSU grant will be recorded on a straight-line basis over the   three  -year period. 
    
  Each 2016 Performance-Based RSU represents the right, subject to the applicable vesting conditions, to receive   one   share of our common stock in the future.  The total fair value of the 2016 Performance-Based RSU grant was   $9.6 million   at   January 28, 2016   and was calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation pricing model based on the assumptions in the table below.  The determination of the fair value of the 2016 Performance-Based RSU grant takes into consideration the likelihood of achievement of both the performance condition and the market condition discussed above.  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we recorded compensation expense based upon the   $57.08   fair value at   January 28, 2016  .  The following table summarizes the assumptions utilized in the Monte Carlo simulation pricing model:  

The computation of expected volatility is based on a blend of the historical volatility of our shares of common stock over approximately six years, as that is expected to be most consistent with future volatility and equates to a time period twice as long as the approximate three-year remaining performance period of the RSUs and implied volatility data based on the observed pricing of six month publicly-traded options on our shares of common stock.  The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield curve on

  NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued) 

zero-coupon U.S. Treasury STRIP securities in effect at   January 28, 2016  .  The expected life of the RSUs is equal to the remaining   2.9   year vesting period at   January 28, 2016  . 
    
  2016 Time-Based RSU Grant 
    
  The 2016 Time-Based RSUs are scheduled to vest in   three   equal installments beginning on January 5, 2017 through January 5, 2019.  Compensation expense for the 2016 Time-Based RSUs will be recognized on a straight-line basis over the   three  -year service vesting period.  Each 2016 Time-Based RSU represents the right to receive one share of our common stock in the future. The total fair value of the 2016 Time-Based RSU grant was   $7.1 million  , which was based on the   $56.23   closing share price of the Company s common stock on the NYSE on   January 28, 2016  .   
    
  2016 Special RSU Grants 
    
  The 2016 Special RSUs are scheduled to vest in equal installments based on service vesting provisions and the achievement of certain metrics.  Compensation expense for the 2016 Special RSUs will be recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting periods.  Each 2016 Special RSU represents the right, subject to the applicable vesting conditions, to receive one share of our common stock in the future. The total fair value of the 2016 Special RSUs at grant was   $3.5 million  , which was based on the closing share price of the Company s common stock on the NYSE at date of grant for the time-based portion, and the estimated fair value at date of grant for the performance-based portion. 
    
  Share-Based Compensation Cost Recorded During the Period 
    
  The total compensation cost for all share-based compensation programs was   $6.8 million     and   $4.3 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $19.3 million   and   $13.6 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  Of the total share-based compensation costs,   $1.5 million     and   $0.7 million   was capitalized as part of real estate assets for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $4.0 million   and   $2.3 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  As of   September 30, 2016  , there was approximately     $34.9 million     of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested incentive awards granted under share-based compensation arrangements that is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of   1.9     years.  The remaining compensation cost related to these nonvested incentive awards had been recognized in periods prior to   September 30, 2016  . 

12.    Commitments and Contingencies 
    
  General 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had commitments of approximately   $379.4 million  , excluding our ground lease commitments, for contracts and executed leases directly related to our operating properties and development projects.   
    
  Environmental Matters 
    
  We follow the policy of monitoring all of our properties, both acquisition and existing stabilized portfolio properties, for the presence of hazardous or toxic substances.  While there can be no assurance that a material environmental liability does not exist, we are not currently aware of any environmental liability with respect to our stabilized portfolio properties that would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flow, or that we believe would require additional disclosure or the recording of a loss contingency.    
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had accrued environmental remediation liabilities of approximately   $25.1 million   recorded on our consolidated balance sheets in connection with certain development projects and recent development acquisitions.  It is possible that we could incur additional environmental remediation costs in connection with these recent development acquisitions.  However, given we are in the early stages of development on certain of these projects, potential additional environmental costs are not reasonably estimable at this time.

  NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued) 

to entry.  We own our interests in all of our properties through the Operating Partnership and the Finance Partnership and generally conduct substantially all of our operations through the Operating Partnership.  We owned an approximate   97.2%  ,   98.1%   and   98.1%   general partnership interest in the Operating Partnership as of   September 30, 2016  ,   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively.  All of our properties are held in fee except for the eleven office buildings that are held subject to long-term ground leases for the land.  

Factors That May Influence Future Results of Operations  
    
  Development Program   
    
  We believe that a portion of our long-term future growth will continue to come from the completion of our in-process development projects, stabilization of recently completed development projects, and, subject to market conditions, executing on our near-term and future development pipeline, including expanding entitlements.  Over the past several years, we increased our focus on development opportunities and expanded our near-term and future development pipeline through targeted acquisitions of development opportunities on the West Coast. 
    
  We have a proactive planning process by which we continually evaluate the size, timing, costs and scope of our development program and, as necessary, scale activity to reflect the economic conditions and the real estate fundamentals that exist in our submarkets. We expect to execute on our development program with prudence and will be pursuing opportunities with attractive economic returns in strategic locations with proximity to public transportation or transportation access and retail amenities and in markets with strong fundamentals and visible demand. We plan to develop in phases as appropriate and we generally favor starting projects that are pre-leased. 
    
  Completed Development Projects 
    
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we completed construction of the following residential development project and   two   office development projects. 

350 Mission Street, SOMA, San Francisco, California, which we acquired in October 2012 and was stabilized in March 2016.  This development project has a total estimated investment of approximately   $277.8 million   and encompasses approximately   455,340   rentable square feet.  The office component of this project is   100%   leased to salesforce.com, inc.  

333 Brannan Street, SOMA, San Francisco, California, which we acquired in July 2012 and was stabilized in March 2016.  This development project has a total estimated investment of approximately   $101.5 million   and encompasses approximately   185,602   rentable square feet.  The office component of the project is   100%   leased to Dropbox, Inc.  

Columbia Square - Residential, Hollywood, California, the 21-story residential component of the Columbia Square project, which is comprised of   200   units, is a mix of high-end long-term rentals and extended stay apartment homes and has a total estimated investment of approximately   $160 million  .  As of   September 30, 2016  , the project was   22%   leased.  Construction on the project was completed in the second quarter of 2016. 
       
  Projects in      Lease-Up    
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   two   development projects in the  lease-up  phase. 

Columbia Square Office Phase 2, Hollywood, California, located in the heart of Hollywood, California, two blocks from the corner of Sunset Boulevard and Vine Street.  This project is comprised of three buildings totaling approximately   377,000   rentable square feet with a total estimated investment of   $230 million  .  The building core and shell of the project were completed in the first quarter of 2016.  The project is currently   84%   committed and     9%     occupied and is expected to be stabilized in the first quarter of 2017.  

The Heights at Del Mar, Del Mar, California, a   73,000   square foot office project that has a total estimated investment of approximately   $45 million  .  The building core and shell of the project were completed in the fourth quarter of 2015.  The project is currently     65%   committed and is expected to be added to the stabilized portfolio in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
       
  Projects Under Construction 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   one   project that was under construction.  
  
    30    

The Exchange on 16th, Mission Bay, San Francisco, California, was acquired in May 2014 and we commenced construction in June 2015.  This project encompasses approximately   700,000   gross rentable square feet in four buildings and represents a total estimated investment of   $485.0 million  .  Construction is currently in progress and the building and core shell are currently estimated to be completed in the second half of 2017.  The timing, estimated gross rentable square feet and total estimated investment are for a multi-tenant office project.    
       
  Near-Term and Future Development Pipeline 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our near-term development pipeline included   four   additional undeveloped land holdings located in various submarkets in San Diego County, the San Francisco Bay Area, Greater Seattle and Los Angeles with an aggregate cost basis of approximately   $436.8 million   at   September 30, 2016  , on which we believe we could develop approximately 2.7 million developable square feet at a total estimated investment of approximately $1.7 billion, depending on successfully obtaining entitlements and market conditions.  
    
  The following table sets forth information about our near-term development pipeline as of the date of this filing. 

________________________ 
           (1) 
    Project timing, costs, developable square feet and scope could change materially from estimated data provided due to one of more of the following:  any significant changes in the economy, market conditions, our markets, tenant requirements and demands, construction costs, new office supply, regulatory and entitlement processes, and project design.  
              (2) 
    Potential start dates assume successfully obtaining all entitlements and approvals necessary to commence construction.  Actual commencement is subject to extensive consideration of market conditions and economic factors.  
               (4) 
    In July 2016, the Company received final entitlement approval for this project.  Development for this project will occur in phases with the first phase estimated to commence in the fourth quarter of 2016 with an estimated Phase I investment amount of approximately $150 million to $200 million. 
              (5) 
    Consists of four adjacent parcels in the South Lake Union submarket of Seattle.   
       
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our longer term future development pipeline included additional undeveloped land holdings located in various submarkets in San Diego County and the San Francisco Bay Area with an aggregate cost basis of approximately   $298.5 million     at   September 30, 2016  , at which we believe we could develop more than 3.0 million developable square feet, depending on successfully obtaining entitlements and market conditions.  
    
  Increases in our development activities could cause an increase in the average development asset balances qualifying for interest and other carry cost and internal cost capitalization in future periods. During the   three   and   nine      months   ended   September 30, 2016  , we capitalized interest on in-process development projects and development pipeline projects with an average aggregate cost basis of approximately $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively, as     it was determined these projects qualified for interest and other carry cost capitalization under GAAP.  For the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we capitalized   $11.2 million   and   $37.8 million  , respectively, of interest to our qualifying development projects.  For the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , we capitalized   $14.6 million   and   $37.8 million  , respectively, of interest to our qualifying development projects. For the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we capitalized   $5.1 million   and   $13.8 million  , respectively, of internal costs to our qualifying development projects.  For the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , we capitalized   $3.2 million   and   $10.4 million  , respectively, of internal costs to our qualifying development projects.  
    
  Capital Recycling Program  .  We continuously evaluate opportunities for the potential disposition of properties and undeveloped land in our portfolio or the formation of strategic ventures with the intent of recycling the proceeds generated into capital used to fund new operating and development acquisitions, to finance development and redevelopment expenditures, to repay long-term debt and for other general corporate purposes.  As part of this strategy, we attempt to enter into Section 1031 Exchanges and other tax deferred transaction structures, when possible, to defer some or all of the taxable gains on the sales, if any, for federal and state income tax purposes.  See the  Liquidity and Capital Resources of the Operating Partnership   Liquidity Sources  section for further information regarding our capital recycling strategy. 

31    

In connection with our capital recycling strategy, during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we completed the sale of   six   office properties and five undeveloped land parcels located in San Diego, California, to unaffiliated third parties for total gross sales proceeds of   $330.7 million  .      During   2015  , we completed the sale of   ten   office properties and one undeveloped land parcel to unaffiliated third parties for total gross sales proceeds of   $335.2 million  .  
    
  In addition, in August 2016, the Company entered into agreements with a third party whereby the third party will invest in   two   existing previously wholly-owned companies that owned two office properties located in San Francisco, California.  Based on a gross valuation of the two properties of approximately   $1.2 billion  , the third party will contribute a total of   $452.9 million   for a   44%   common equity interest in the two companies.  On August 30, 2016, the first tranche of the transaction closed and the third party contributed   $191.4 million   plus a working capital contribution of   $2.1 million   for a   44%   common ownership in the first entity.  The second tranche of the transaction is expected to close on November 30, 2016, at which time the third party will contribute   $261.5 million  , which is net of its proportionate share of the existing mortgage debt secured by the property, for a   44%   common ownership in the second entity.  
    
  The timing of any potential future disposition or strategic venture transactions will depend on market conditions and other factors, including but not limited to our capital needs and our ability to defer some or all of the taxable gains on the sales.  We cannot assure that we will dispose of any additional properties, enter into any additional strategic ventures, or that we will be able to identify and complete the acquisition of a suitable replacement property to effect a Section 1031 Exchange or be able to use other tax deferred structures in connection with our strategy.  See the  Liquidity and Capital Resources of the Operating Partnership   Liquidity Sources  section for further information. 
    
  Acquisitions  .  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we acquired a   114,175   square foot office building in Mountain View, California for a purchase price of   $55.4 million   and a 1.75 acre land parcel in San Francisco, California for a purchase price of   $31.0 million   in cash, the issuance of   867,701   common units in the Operating Partnership valued at approximately   $48.0 million   and   $2.4 million   in seller transaction costs.  During   2015  , we acquired two development opportunities for an aggregate cash purchase price of approximately   $127.5 million  .  We generally finance our acquisitions through proceeds from the issuance of debt and equity securities, borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility, proceeds from our capital recycling program, the assumption of existing debt and cash flows from operations. 
    
  As part of our growth strategy, which is highly dependent on market conditions and business cycles, among other factors, we continue to evaluate strategic opportunities and remain a disciplined buyer of development and redevelopment opportunities as well as value-add operating properties.  We continue to focus on growth opportunities in West Coast markets populated by knowledge and creative based tenants in a variety of industries, including technology, media, healthcare, life sciences, entertainment and professional services.  Against the backdrop of market volatility, we expect to manage a strong balance sheet, execute on our development program and selectively evaluate opportunities that either add immediate Net Operating Income to our portfolio or play a strategic role in our future growth. 
    
  We cannot provide assurance that we will enter into any agreements to acquire properties, or undeveloped land, or that the potential acquisitions contemplated by any agreements we may enter into in the future will be completed.  In addition, acquisitions are subject to various risks and uncertainties and we may be unable to complete an acquisition after making a nonrefundable deposit or incurring acquisition-related costs.  
    
  Incentive Compensation  .  Our Executive Compensation Committee determines compensation, including cash bonuses and equity incentives, for our executive officers.  For 2016, the annual cash bonus program was structured to allow the Executive Compensation Committee to evaluate a variety of key quantitative and qualitative metrics at the end of the year and make a determination based on the Company s and management s overall performance.  Our Executive Compensation Committee also grants equity incentive awards from time to time that include performance-based or market-measure based vesting requirements and/or time-based vesting requirements.  As a result, accrued incentive compensation and compensation expense for future awards may be affected by our operating and development performance, financial results, stock price, performance against applicable performance-based vesting goals, market conditions and other factors.  Consequently, we cannot predict the amounts that will be recorded in future periods related to such incentive compensation. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , there was approximately     $34.9 million     of total unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding nonvested shares of restricted common stock, RSUs and stock options issued under share-based compensation arrangements.  Those costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of     1.9     years.  The   $34.9 million     of unrecognized compensation cost does not reflect the future compensation cost for any potential share-based awards that may be issued.  Share-based compensation expense for potential future awards could be affected by our operating and development performance, financial results, stock price, performance against applicable performance-based vesting goals, market conditions and other factors.

Information on Leases Commenced and Executed 
    
  Leasing Activity and Changes in Rental Rates  .  The amount of net rental income generated by our properties depends principally on our ability to maintain the occupancy rates of currently leased space and to lease currently available space, newly developed or redeveloped properties, newly acquired properties with vacant space, and space available from unscheduled lease terminations.  The amount of rental income we generate also depends on our ability to maintain or increase rental rates in our submarkets.  Negative trends in one or more of these factors could adversely affect our rental income in future periods.  The following tables set forth certain information regarding leasing activity for our stabilized portfolio during the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  For Leases Commenced    (1)   

For Leases Executed    (1)(9)    

________________________ 
           (1) 
    Includes 100% of consolidated property partnerships. 
              (2) 
    First generation leasing includes space where we have made capital expenditures that result in additional revenue generated when the space is re-leased.  Second generation leasing includes space where we have made capital expenditures to maintain the current market revenue stream.  
              (3) 
    Represents leasing activity for leases that commenced or signed during the period, including first and second generation space, net of month-to-month leases.  Excludes leasing on new construction. 
              (4) 
    Tenant improvements and leasing commissions per square foot exclude tenant-funded tenant improvements. 
              (5) 
    Calculated as the change between GAAP rents for new/renewed leases and the expiring GAAP rents for the same space.  Excludes leases for which the space was vacant longer than one year or vacant when the property was acquired. 
              (6) 
    Excludes commenced and executed leases of approximately 12,022 and 51,333 square feet, respectively, for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , and 108,499 and 123,105 rentable square feet, respectively, for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , for which the space was vacant longer than one year or being leased for the first time.  Space vacant for more than one year is excluded from our change in rents calculations to provide a meaningful market comparison. 
              (7) 
    Calculated as the change between stated rents for new/renewed leases and the expiring stated rents for the same space.  Excludes leases for which the space was vacant longer than one year or vacant when the property was acquired. 
              (8) 
    Calculated as the percentage of space either renewed or expanded into by existing tenants or subtenants at lease expiration. 
        
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we believe that the weighted average cash rental rates for our stabilized portfolio are approximately     17% below the current average market rental rates, although individual properties within any particular submarket presently may be leased either above, below, or at the current market rates within that submarket, and the average rental rates for individual submarkets may be above, below or at the average cash rental rate of our portfolio.  We believe that cash rental rates for our San Diego stabilized properties are approximately 9% above current market rental rates in that region.  
    
  In general, market rental rates have continued to increase over the last several quarters in the majority of our submarkets but in certain markets the pace of rental rate growth is starting to moderate.  Our rental rates and occupancy are impacted by general economic conditions and regional market fundamentals, including the pace of regional economic growth and access to capital.  Therefore, we cannot give any assurance that leases will be renewed or that available space will be re-leased at rental rates equal to or above the current market rates.  Additionally, decreased demand, increase in sublease space available in the submarkets in which we operate, and other negative trends or unforeseeable events that impair our ability to timely renew or re-lease space could have further negative effects on our future financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 

33    

Scheduled Lease Expirations  .  The following table sets forth certain information regarding our lease expirations for our stabilized portfolio for the remainder of   2016   and the next five years.   
    
  Lease Expirations    (1)   

________________________  
           (1) 
    The information presented for all lease expiration activity reflects leasing activity through   September 30, 2016   for our stabilized portfolio.  For leases that have been renewed early or space that has been re-leased to a new tenant, the expiration date and annualized base rent information presented takes into consideration the renewed or re-leased lease terms.  Excludes space leased under month-to-month leases, intercompany leases, vacant space and lease renewal options not executed as of   September 30, 2016  . 
              (2) 
    Annualized base rent includes the impact of straight-lining rent escalations and the amortization of free rent periods and excludes the impact of the following: amortization of deferred revenue related tenant-funded tenant improvements, amortization of above/below market rents, amortization for lease incentives due under existing leases and expense reimbursement revenue.  Additionally, the underlying leases contain various expense structures including full service gross, modified gross and triple net.  Percentages represent percentage of total portfolio annualized contractual base rental revenue.  For additional information on tenant improvement and leasing commission costs incurred by the Company for the current reporting period, please see further discussion under the caption  Information on Leases Commenced and Executed.  
              (3) 
    Includes 100% of annualized base rent from consolidated property partnerships. 
       
  In addition to the   0.5 million   rentable square feet, or   3.4%  , of currently available space in our stabilized portfolio, leases representing approximately   1.3%   and   8.6%   of the occupied square footage of our stabilized portfolio are scheduled to expire during   2016   and   2017  , respectively.  The leases scheduled to expire during the remainder of   2016   and in   2017   represent approximately   1.3 million   rentable square feet or   9.1%   of our total annualized base rental revenue.  We believe that the weighted average cash rental rates are approximately 23% below     the current average market rental rates for leases scheduled to expire during the remainder of   2016   and in   2017  , although individual properties within any particular submarket presently may be leased either above, below, or at the current quoted market rates within that submarket, and the average rental rates for individual submarkets may be above, below, or at the average cash rental rate of our overall portfolio.   Our ability to re-lease available space depends upon both general market conditions and the market conditions in the specific regions in which individual properties are located. 

Stabilized Portfolio Information  
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our stabilized office portfolio was comprised of   101   office properties encompassing an aggregate of approximately   13.6 million   rentable square feet.  Our stabilized office portfolio includes all of our properties with the exception of development and redevelopment properties currently under construction or committed for construction,  lease-up  properties, real estate assets held for sale and undeveloped land, and our recently completed residential property.  We define redevelopment properties as those properties for which we expect to spend significant development and construction costs on the existing or acquired buildings pursuant to a formal plan, the intended result of which is a higher economic return on the property.  We define  lease-up  properties as office properties we recently developed or redeveloped that have not yet reached   95%   occupancy and are within one year following cessation of major construction activities.  Our stabilized office portfolio also excludes our near-term and future development pipeline, which as of   September 30, 2016   was comprised of   eight   potential development sites, representing approximately   70   gross acres of undeveloped land on which we believe we have the potential to develop over   5.7 million     square feet of office space, depending upon economic conditions. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the following properties, in addition to our recently completed residential property, were excluded from our stabilized office portfolio:

  Current Regional Information  
    
  West Coast real estate markets continued their solid outperformance in the third quarter of 2016, with growth in demand, net absorption and average rental rates outperforming the rest of the country. 
    
  San Francisco Bay Area.   In the third quarter of 2016, market fundamentals continued to trend positively with rent growth, net absorption and vacancy rates.  As of   September 30, 2016  , our San Francisco Bay Area stabilized portfolio of   5.0 million   rentable square feet was   98.3%   occupied with approximately   82,000   available rentable square feet, compared to   98.1%   occupied with approximately 81,000 available rentable square feet as of   December 31, 2015  .

Results of Operations  
    
  Net Operating Income 
    
  Management internally evaluates the operating performance and financial results of our stabilized portfolio based on Net Operating Income.  We define  Net Operating Income  as consolidated operating revenues (rental income, tenant reimbursements and other property income) less consolidated operating expenses (property expenses, real estate taxes, provision for bad debts and ground leases).  
    
  Net Operating Income is considered by management to be an important and appropriate supplemental performance measure to net income (loss) because we believe it helps both investors and management to understand the core operations of our properties excluding corporate and financing-related costs and non-cash depreciation and amortization.  Net Operating Income is an unlevered operating performance metric of our properties and allows for a useful comparison of the operating performance of individual assets or groups of assets.  This measure thereby provides an operating perspective not immediately apparent from GAAP income (loss) from operations or net income (loss).  In addition, Net Operating Income is considered by many in the real estate industry to be a useful starting point for determining the value of a real estate asset or group of assets.  Other real estate companies may use different methodologies for calculating Net Operating Income, and accordingly, our presentation of Net Operating Income may not be comparable to other real estate companies.  Because of the exclusion of the items shown in the reconciliation below, Net Operating Income should only be used as a supplemental measure of our financial performance and not as an alternative to GAAP income (loss) from operations or net income (loss). 
    
  Management further evaluates Net Operating Income by evaluating the performance from the following property groups:   

Same Store Properties   which includes the consolidated results of all of the office properties that were owned and included in our stabilized portfolio for two comparable reporting periods, i.e., owned and included in our stabilized portfolio as of January 1,   2015   and still owned and included in the stabilized portfolio as of   September 30, 2016  ; 

Stabilized Development Properties   which includes the results generated by the following: 
                
    Two office development projects that were completed and stabilized in March 2016; 
                
    Two office development projects comprising four office buildings that were completed and stabilized in the fourth quarter of 2015; 

Acquisition Property   which includes the results, from the dates of acquisition through the periods presented, for the one office building we acquired in June 2016; and 

37    

2016 Held for Sale, Dispositions and Other   which includes the results of the   six     properties disposed of in 2016, the   ten   properties disposed of in 2015,   one   property held for sale at   September 30, 2016  , two office projects in  lease-up  at   September 30, 2016  , the recently completed residential property, and expenses for certain of our in-process, near-term and future development projects.

  Net Operating Income increased   $21.0 million  , or   20.6%  , for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015   driven by the following activity: 

An increase in Net Operating Income of   $6.4 million   attributable to the Same Store Properties primarily resulting from: 

An increase in rental income of   $4.2 million   primarily due to new leases and renewals at higher rates primarily in the San Francisco Bay Area and Los Angeles regions;  

39    

An increase in tenant reimbursements of   $2.8 million   primarily due to an increase in occupancy and expenses at certain properties in the San Francisco Bay Area, Greater Seattle and Los Angeles regions as well as lower revenues in 2015 due to base year resets and adjustments, abatements, and property tax refunds; 

A partially offsetting increase in property and related expenses of   $0.6 million   primarily due to property tax refunds received for two properties in 2015 offset by lower electricity and repairs and maintenance expenses in 2016; 

An increase in Net Operating Income of   $15.8 million   attributable to the Stabilized Development Properties; 

An increase in Net Operating Income of    $1.3 million   attributable to the Acquisition Property; and 

A decrease in Net Operating Income of   $2.6 million   attributable to the 2016 Held for Sale, Disposition and Other Properties mainly due to the following: 

$2.0 million decrease attributable to the residential property that was completed during June 2016 and is in the very early stages of operations; partially offset by

Capitalized interest and deferred financing costs decreased   $3.4 million   or   23.1%   for the  
  
    40    

three   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015   primarily due to lower development activity during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated property partnerships 
    
  Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated property partnerships increased   $1.0 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  .

Liquidity and Capital Resources of the Company  
    
  In this  Liquidity and Capital Resources of the Company  section, the term the  Company  refers only to Kilroy Realty Corporation on an unconsolidated basis and excludes the Operating Partnership and all other subsidiaries.  
    
  The Company s business is operated primarily through the Operating Partnership.  Distributions from the Operating Partnership are the Company s primary source of capital.  The Company believes the Operating Partnership s sources of working capital, specifically its cash flow from operations and borrowings available under its unsecured revolving credit facility, are adequate for it to make its distribution payments to the Company and, in turn, for the Company to make its dividend payments to its preferred and common stockholders for the next twelve months.  Cash flows from operating activities generated by the Operating Partnership for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were sufficient to cover the Company s payment of cash dividends to its stockholders.      However, there can be no assurance that the Operating Partnership s sources of capital will continue to be available at all or in amounts sufficient to meet its needs, including its ability to make distributions to the Company.  The unavailability of capital could adversely affect the Operating Partnership s ability to make distributions to the Company, which would in turn, adversely affect the Company s ability to pay cash dividends to its stockholders. 
    
  The Company is a well-known seasoned issuer and the Company and the Operating Partnership have an effective shelf registration statement that provides for the public offering and sale from time to time by the Company of its preferred stock, common stock, depositary shares, warrants and guarantees of debt securities and by the Operating Partnership of its debt securities, in each case in unlimited amounts.  The Company evaluates the capital markets on an ongoing basis for opportunities to raise capital, and, as circumstances warrant, the Company and the Operating Partnership may issue securities of all of these types in one or more offerings at any time and from time to time on an opportunistic basis, depending upon, among other things, market conditions, available pricing and capital needs.  When the Company receives proceeds from the sales of its preferred or common stock, it generally contributes the net proceeds from those sales to the Operating Partnership in exchange for corresponding preferred or common partnership units of the Operating Partnership.  The Operating Partnership may use these proceeds and proceeds from the sale of its debt securities to repay debt, including borrowings under its unsecured revolving credit facility, to develop new or existing properties, to make acquisitions of properties or portfolios of properties, or for general corporate purposes. 
    
  As the sole general partner with control of the Operating Partnership, the Company consolidates the Operating Partnership for financial reporting purposes, and the Company does not have significant assets other than its investment in the Operating Partnership.  Therefore, the assets and liabilities and the revenues and expenses of the Company and the Operating Partnership are substantially the same on their respective financial statements.  The section entitled  Liquidity and Capital Resources of the Operating Partnership  should be read in conjunction with this section to understand the liquidity and capital resources of the Company on a consolidated basis and how the Company is operated as a whole. 
    
  Distribution Requirements 
    
  The Company is required to distribute 90% of its taxable income (subject to certain adjustments and excluding net capital gains) on an annual basis to maintain qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes and is required to pay income tax at regular corporate rates to the extent it distributes less than 100% of its taxable income (including capital gains).  As a result of these distribution requirements, the Operating Partnership cannot rely on retained earnings to fund its on-going operations to the same extent as other companies whose parent companies are not REITs.  In addition, the Company may be required to use borrowings under the Operating Partnership s revolving credit facility, if necessary, to meet REIT distribution requirements and maintain its REIT status.  The Company may also need to continue to raise capital in the equity markets to fund the Operating Partnership s working capital needs, as well as potential developments of new or existing properties or acquisitions. 
    
  The Company intends to continue to make, but has not committed to make, regular quarterly cash distributions to common stockholders, and through the Operating Partnership, common unitholders from the Operating Partnership s cash flow from operating activities.  All such distributions are at the discretion of the Board of Directors.  The Company has historically distributed amounts in excess of its taxable income resulting in a return of capital to its common stockholders.  However, while the 2015 regular quarterly distributions were sufficient to distribute 100% of the Company s 2015 taxable income, they did not result in a return of capital to its stockholders.  As the Company intends to maintain distributions at a level sufficient to meet the REIT distribution requirements and minimize its obligation to pay income and excise taxes, it will continue to evaluate whether the current levels of distribution are sufficient to do so.  For 2016, the Company expects to realize approximately $160 to $200 million of taxable gain from the sales of real property that may not be deferred in Internal Revenue Code Section 1031 Exchanges or other tax-deferred structures. To the extent that such gains are not distributed to the Company's stockholders in 2016 (or treated as distributed by the Company with respect to 2016 for purposes of the REIT distribution requirements), the Company and Operating Partnership expect to make a special distribution to their common stockholders and common unitholders, respectively, in an amount  
  
    45    

sufficient to enable the Company to meet the REIT distribution requirements and minimize its obligation to pay income and excise taxes.  The Company considers market factors and its performance in addition to REIT requirements in determining its distribution levels.  Amounts accumulated for distribution to stockholders are invested primarily in interest-bearing accounts and short-term interest-bearing securities, which are consistent with the Company s intention to maintain its qualification as a REIT.  Such investments may include, for example, obligations of the Government National Mortgage Association, other governmental agency securities, certificates of deposit, and interest-bearing bank deposits. 
    
  On   September 15, 2016  , the Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of   $0.375   per share of common stock payable on   October 12, 2016   to stockholders of record on   September 30, 2016   and caused a   $0.375   per Operating Partnership unit cash distribution to be paid in respect of the Operating Partnership s common limited partnership interests, including those owned by the Company.  The total cash quarterly dividends and distributions paid on   October 12, 2016   was   $35.6 million  . 
    
  On   September 15, 2016  , the Board of Directors declared a dividend of   $0.42969   per share on the Series G Preferred Stock and   $0.39844   per share on the Series H Preferred Stock for the period commencing on and including August 15, 2016 and ending on and including November 14, 2016.  The dividend will be payable on   November 15, 2016   to Series G Preferred and Series H Preferred stockholders of record on   October 31, 2016  . The quarterly dividends payable on   November 15, 2016   to Series G and Series H Preferred stockholders is expected to total   $3.3 million  . 
    
  Debt Covenants 
    
  The covenants contained within the unsecured revolving credit facility, unsecured term loan facility, unsecured term loan and the Series A and B Notes generally prohibit the Company from paying dividends in excess of 95% of FFO. 
    
  Capitalization  
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our total debt as a percentage of total market capitalization was   24.8%   and our total debt and liquidation value of our preferred equity as a percentage of total market capitalization was   27.0%  , which was calculated based on the closing price per share of the Company s common stock of   $69.35   on   September 30, 2016   as shown in the following table:

    Outstanding debt repurchases and repayments.  
       
  General Strategy  
    
  Our general strategy is to maintain a conservative balance sheet with a strong credit profile and to maintain a capital structure that allows for financial flexibility and diversification of capital resources.  We manage our capital structure to reflect a long-term investment approach and utilize multiple sources of capital to meet our long-term capital requirements.  We believe that our current projected liquidity requirements for the next twelve-month period, as set forth above under the caption   Liquidity Uses,  will be satisfied using a combination of the liquidity sources listed above, although there can be no assurance in this regard.  We believe our conservative leverage and staggered debt maturities provide us with financial flexibility and enhances our ability to obtain additional sources of liquidity if necessary, and, therefore, we are well-positioned to refinance or repay maturing debt and to pursue our strategy of seeking attractive acquisition opportunities, which we may finance, as necessary, with future public and private issuances of debt and equity securities.

Liquidity Sources 
    
  Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility  
    
  The following table summarizes the balance and terms of our unsecured revolving credit facility as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  :   

________________________ 
           (1) 
    We may elect to borrow, subject to bank approval and obtaining commitments for any additional borrowing capacity, up to an additional   $311.0 million   under an accordion feature under the terms of the unsecured revolving credit facility and unsecured term loan facility. 
              (2) 
    The interest rate on our unsecured revolving credit facility is based on an annual rate of LIBOR plus   1.050%  . 
              (3) 
    Our facility fee is paid on a quarterly basis and is calculated based on the total borrowing capacity.  In addition to the facility fee, we incurred debt origination and legal costs.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  ,   $3.6 million   and   $4.6 million   of unamortized deferred financing costs, respectively, remained to be amortized through the maturity date of our unsecured revolving credit facility, which are included in prepaid expenses and other assets, net on our consolidated balance sheets. 
       
  We intend to borrow under the unsecured revolving credit facility from time to time for general corporate purposes, to fund potential acquisitions, to finance development and redevelopment expenditures and to potentially repay long-term debt.  
    
  Capital Recycling Program 
    
  In connection with our capital recycling program, we continuously evaluate opportunities for the potential disposition of properties and undeveloped land in our portfolio or the formation of strategic ventures with the intent of recycling the proceeds generated into capital used to finance development expenditures, to fund new acquisitions, to repay long-term debt and for other general corporate purposes.  As part of this strategy, we attempt to enter into Section 1031 Exchanges and other tax deferred structures, when possible, to defer some or all of the taxable gains on the sales, if any, for federal and state income tax purposes.  
    
  In connection with our capital recycling strategy, during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we completed the sale of   six   operating properties and five undeveloped land parcels located in San Diego, California to unaffiliated third parties for gross sales proceeds of   $330.7 million  .  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , we completed the sale of   ten   operating properties and   one   undeveloped land parcel to unaffiliated third parties for gross sale proceeds of   $335.2 million  .  
    
  In addition, in August 2016, the Company entered into agreements with a third party whereby the third party will invest in   two   existing previously wholly-owned companies that owned two office properties located in San Francisco, California.  Based on a gross valuation of the two properties of approximately   $1.2 billion  , the third party will contribute a total of   $452.9 million   for a   44%   common equity interest in the two companies.  On August 30, 2016, the first tranche of the transaction closed and the third party contributed   $191.4 million   plus a working capital contribution of   $2.1 million   for a   44%   common ownership interest in the first entity.  The second tranche of the transaction is expected to close on November 30, 2016, at which time the third party will contribute   $261.5 million  , which is net of its proportionate share of the existing mortgage debt secured by the property, for a   44%   common ownership interest in the second entity.  
    
  Any potential future capital recycling transactions depend on market conditions and other factors including but not limited to our capital needs and our ability to defer some or all of the taxable gains on the sales.  In addition, we cannot assure that we will dispose of any additional properties or that we will be able to identify and complete the acquisition of suitable replacement properties to effect Section 1031 Exchanges or other tax deferred structures to defer some or all of the taxable capital gains related to our capital recycling program. 

48    

At-The-Market Stock Offering Program   
    
  Since commencement of our at-the-market stock offering program in December 2014, through   September 30, 2016  , we have sold   2,007,767   shares of common stock having an aggregate gross sales price of   $150.1 million  , and approximately   $149.9 million   remained available to be sold under this program.  No shares of common stock were sold under this program during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  .  Actual future sales will depend upon a variety of factors, including but not limited to, market conditions, the trading price of the Company s common stock and our capital needs.  We have no obligation to sell the remaining shares available for sale under this program. 
    
  Shelf Registration Statement  
    
  As discussed above under   Liquidity and Capital Resources of the Company,  the Company is a well-known seasoned issuer and the Company and the Operating Partnership have an effective shelf registration statement that provides for the public offering and sale from time to time by the Company of its preferred stock, common stock, depository shares and guarantees of debt securities and by the Operating Partnership of its debt securities, in each case in unlimited amounts.  The Company evaluates the capital markets on an ongoing basis for opportunities to raise capital, and, as circumstances warrant, the Company and the Operating Partnership may issue securities of all of these types in one or more offerings at any time and from time to time on an opportunistic basis, depending upon, among other things, market conditions, available pricing and capital needs.  When the Company receives proceeds from the sales of its preferred or common stock, it generally contributes the net proceeds from those sales to the Operating Partnership in exchange for corresponding preferred or common partnership units of the Operating Partnership.  The Operating Partnership may use these proceeds and proceeds from the sale of its debt securities to repay debt, including borrowings under its unsecured revolving credit facility, to develop new or existing properties, to make acquisitions of properties or portfolios of properties, or for general corporate purposes.  On September 29, 2016, the Company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission a shelf registration statement on Form S-3, which became immediately effective upon filing. 
    
  Unsecured Senior Notes - Private Placement 
    
  On September 14, 2016, the Operating Partnership entered into a Note Purchase Agreement in a private placement (the  Note Purchase Agreement ), in connection with the issuance and sale of   $175.0 million   principal amount of the Operating Partnership s   3.35%   Senior Notes, Series A, due February 17, 2027 (the  Series A Notes ), and   $75.0 million    principal amount of the Operating Partnership s   3.45%   Senior Notes, Series B, due February 17, 2029 (the  Series B Notes  and, together with the Series A Notes, the  Series A and B Notes ).  Under the delayed draw option of the Series A and B Notes, the Operating Partnership is required to issue   $175.0 million   principal amount of its Series A Notes and   $75.0 million   principal amount of its Series B Notes by February 17, 2017.  As of   September 30, 2016  , there were   no   amounts issued or outstanding under the Series A and B Notes.  The Series A Notes mature on February 17, 2027, and the Series B notes mature on February 17, 2029, unless earlier redeemed or prepaid pursuant to the terms of the Note Purchase Agreement.  Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on February 17 and August 17 of each year beginning February 17, 2017.  
  
    49    

Unsecured and Secured Debt 
    
  The aggregate principal amount of the unsecured debt and secured debt of the Operating Partnership outstanding as of   September 30, 2016   was as follows: 

________________________ 
           (1) 
    In September, the Company completed a private placement of   $175.0 million   of ten-year,   3.35%   unsecured senior notes and   $75.0 million   of twelve-year,   3.45%   unsecured senior notes with a delayed draw option required to be exercised by February 17, 2017.  The table above does not reflect any amounts pertaining to these notes since there were no amounts drawn or outstanding as of   September 30, 2016  . 
              (2) 
    There was no outstanding balance on the unsecured line of credit as of   September 30, 2016  . 
       
  Debt Composition  
    
  The composition of the Operating Partnership s aggregate debt balances between secured and unsecured and fixed-rate and variable-rate debt as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   was as follows:  

________________________ 
           (1) 
    In September, the Company completed a private placement of   $175.0 million   of ten-year,   3.35%   unsecured senior notes and   $75.0 million   of twelve-year,   3.45%   unsecured senior notes with a delayed draw option required to be exercised by February 17, 2017. The table above does not reflect any amounts pertaining to these notes since there were no amounts drawn or outstanding as of   September 30, 2016  . The table above also does not reflect any amounts pertaining to the unsecured line of credit as there were no amounts outstanding as of   September 30, 2016  . 
              (2)

  Contractual Obligations 
    
  The following table provides information with respect to our contractual obligations as of   September 30, 2016  .  The table: (i) indicates the maturities and scheduled principal repayments of our secured and unsecured debt outstanding as of   September 30, 2016   as well as commitments for the Series A and B Notes issuable pursuance to the Note Purchase Agreement; (ii) indicates the scheduled interest payments of our fixed-rate and variable-rate debt as of   September 30, 2016  ; (iii) provides information about the minimum commitments due in connection with our ground lease obligations and other lease and contractual commitments; and (iv) provides estimated development commitments as of   September 30, 2016  .  Note that the table does not reflect our available debt maturity extension options and reflects gross aggregate principal amounts before the effect of unamortized discounts/premiums. 

________________________ 
           (1) 
    Represents gross aggregate principal amount before the effect of the unamortized premium and deferred financing costs of approximately   $4.9 million   and   $0.8 million  , respectively, as of   September 30, 2016  . 
              (2) 
    Represents gross aggregate principal amount before the effect of the unamortized discount and deferred financing costs of approximately   $6.8 million   and   $10.5 million  , respectively, as of   September 30, 2016  .  Includes   $175.0 million   of Series A Notes and   $75.0 million   of Series B Notes issuable pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement for which no Series A or B Notes were issued and outstanding as of   September 30, 2016   but the Company is committed to issuing by February 17, 2017.  
              (3) 
    As of   September 30, 2016  ,   91.5%   of our debt was contractually fixed.  The information in the table above reflects our projected interest rate obligations for these fixed-rate payments based on the contractual interest rates on an accrual basis and scheduled maturity dates.  Amounts include interest rate obligations for the Series A and B Notes issuable pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement for which no Series A or B Notes were issued and outstanding as of   September 30, 2016   but the Company is committed to issuing by February 17, 2017. 
              (4) 
    As of   September 30, 2016  ,   8.5%   of our debt bore interest at variable rates that was incurred under the unsecured term loan facility and unsecured term loan.  The variable interest rate payments are based on LIBOR plus a spread of     1.150%     as of   September 30, 2016  .  The information in the table above reflects our projected interest rate obligations for these variable-rate payments based on outstanding principal balances as of   September 30, 2016  , the scheduled interest payment dates and the contractual maturity dates. 
              (5) 
    Reflects minimum lease payments through the contractual lease expiration date before the impact of extension options.  
              (6) 
    Amounts represent commitments under signed leases and contracts for operating properties, excluding tenant-funded tenant improvements and for other contractual commitments.  The timing of these expenditures may fluctuate.  
              (7) 
    Amounts represent commitments under signed leases for pre-leased development projects, contractual commitments for projects under construction, in  lease-up  as of   September 30, 2016  , and also includes $58.0 million for two recently completed office projects and the recently completed residential project.     The timing of these expenditures may fluctuate based on the ultimate progress of construction.  We may start additional construction during the remainder of   2016    and   2017   (see   Development Activities  for additional information). 
       
  Other Liquidity Uses 
    
  Development Activities  
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   one   development project under construction.  This project has a total estimated investment of approximately   $485 million  , of which we have incurred approximately   $200.8 million   and committed an additional $203 million as of   September 30, 2016  , which is included in the table above.  In addition, as of   September 30, 2016  , we had   two    lease up  office projects.  These two projects have a total estimated investment of approximately   $275 million  , of which we have paid approximately   $218 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and are contractually committed to spend approximately $34 million under executed leases and contracts, which is included in the table above.  Depending on market conditions, we expect to incur the remaining $23 million for these two projects through stabilization.  In addition, we currently believe we may spend an additional $100 - $350 million on potential near-term and future development pipeline projects that we expect we may commence construction on during the fourth quarter of 2016 and throughout 2017.  Ultimate timing of these expenditures may fluctuate given construction progress and leasing status of the projects.  We expect that any material additional development activities will be funded with borrowings under the unsecured revolving credit facility, the public or private issuance of debt or equity securities or the disposition of assets under our capital recycling program. 

51    

Potential Future Acquisitions 
    
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  ,     we acquired one office building for   $55.4 million   in cash and one development opportunity for   $31.0 million   in cash and the issuance of   867,701   common units in the Operating Partnership valued at approximately   $48.0 million   and   $2.4 million   in seller transaction costs.  In 2015, we acquired two development opportunities for approximately   $127.5 million   in cash. These transactions were funded through various capital raising activities and, in selected instances, the assumption of existing indebtedness and issuance of common stock of the Company or common units in the Operating Partnership.  
    
  As part of our growth strategy, which is highly dependent on market conditions and business cycles, among other factors, we continue to evaluate strategic opportunities and remain a disciplined buyer of development and redevelopment opportunities as well as value-add operating properties.  We continue to focus on growth opportunities in West Coast markets populated by knowledge and creative based tenants in a variety of industries, including technology, media, healthcare, life sciences, entertainment and professional services.  Against the backdrop of market volatility, we expect to manage a strong balance sheet, execute on our development program and selectively evaluate opportunities that either add immediate Net Operating Income to our portfolio or play a strategic role in our future growth. We expect that any material acquisitions will be funded with borrowings under the unsecured revolving credit facility, the public or private issuance of debt or equity securities, the disposition of assets under our capital recycling program or through the assumption of existing debt. 
    
  Debt Maturities 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our next debt maturity of $64.3 million of secured debt is scheduled to occur in February 2017, which we have the option to prepay without penalty in the fourth quarter of 2016.  We currently expect to refinance this debt with a secured debt financing of approximately $170.0 million in the fourth quarter of  2016.  We believe our conservative leverage and staggered debt maturities provide us with financial flexibility and enhance our ability to obtain additional sources of liquidity if necessary, and, therefore, we believe we are well-positioned to refinance or repay maturing debt and to pursue our strategy of seeking attractive acquisition opportunities, which we may finance, as necessary, with future public and private issuances of debt and equity securities. 
    
  6.875% Series G and 6.375% Series H Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock 
    
  The Company has the option to redeem the 4,000,000 shares of its 6.875% Series G Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock ("Series G Preferred Stock") and the 4,000,000 shares of its 6.375% Series H Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock ("Series H Preferred Stock"), on or after March 27, 2017 and August 15, 2017, respectively, in whole or in part at any time or from time to time, by payment of $25.00 per share in cash, totaling $200.0 million plus any accumulated, accrued and unpaid distributions through the date of redemption.  Depending on various factors, including but not limited to market conditions, based on our capital needs we currently anticipate that we will redeem all or part of the outstanding Series G and Series H Preferred Stock on or after the stated redemption dates in 2017. 
    
  Share Repurchases 
    
  On February 23, 2016, the Company s Board of Directors approved a   4,000,000   share increase to the Company s existing share repurchase program bringing the total current repurchase authorization to   4,988,025   shares.  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company repurchased   52,199   shares of common stock at a weighted average price of   $55.45   per common share totaling   $2.9 million  .  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   4,935,826   shares remain eligible for repurchase under the Company s share-repurchase program. Under this program, repurchases may be made in open market transactions at prevailing prices or through privately negotiated transactions.  We may elect to repurchase shares of our common stock under this program in the future depending upon various factors, including market conditions, the trading price of our common stock and our other uses of capital.  This program does not have a termination date, and repurchases may be discontinued at any time.  We intend to fund repurchases, if any, primarily with the proceeds from property dispositions. 
    
  Other Potential Future Liquidity Uses 
    
  The amounts we are required to spend on tenant improvements and leasing costs we ultimately incur will depend on actual leasing activity.  Tenant improvements and leasing costs generally fluctuate in any given period depending on factors such as the type of property, the term of the lease, the type of the lease, the involvement of external leasing agents, and overall market conditions.  Capital expenditures may fluctuate in any given period subject to the nature, extent, and timing of improvements required to maintain or improve our properties. 
  
    52    

Factors That May Influence Future Sources of Capital and Liquidity of the Company and the Operating Partnership 
    
  We continue to evaluate sources of financing for our business activities, including borrowings under the unsecured revolving credit facility, issuance of public and private equity securities, unsecured debt and fixed-rate secured mortgage financing, proceeds from the disposition of selective assets through our capital recycling program, and the formation of strategic ventures.  However, our ability to obtain new financing or refinance existing borrowings on favorable terms could be impacted by various factors, including the state of the macro economy, the state of the credit and equity markets, significant tenant defaults, a decline in the demand for office properties, a decrease in market rental rates or market values of real estate assets in our submarkets, and the amount of our future borrowings.  These events could result in the following:  

Decreases in our cash flows from operations, which could create further dependence on the unsecured revolving credit facility;  

An increase in the proportion of variable-rate debt, which could increase our sensitivity to interest rate fluctuations in the future; and 

A decrease in the value of our properties, which could have an adverse effect on the Operating Partnership s ability to incur additional debt, refinance existing debt at competitive rates, or comply with its existing debt obligations. 
       
  In addition to the factors noted above, the Operating Partnership s credit ratings are subject to ongoing evaluation by credit rating agencies and may be changed or withdrawn by a rating agency in the future if, in its judgment, circumstances warrant.  In the event that the Operating Partnership s credit ratings are downgraded, we may incur higher borrowing costs and may experience difficulty in obtaining additional financing or refinancing existing indebtedness.  
    
  Debt Covenants  
    
  The unsecured revolving credit facility, unsecured term loan facility, unsecured term loan, unsecured senior notes and certain other secured debt arrangements contain covenants and restrictions requiring us to meet certain financial ratios and reporting requirements.  Key existing financial covenants and their covenant levels include:  

The Operating Partnership was in compliance with all of its debt covenants as of   September 30, 2016  .  Our current expectation is that the Operating Partnership will continue to meet the requirements of its debt covenants in both the short and long term.  However, in the event of an economic slowdown or continued volatility in the credit markets, there is no certainty that the Operating Partnership will be able to continue to satisfy all of the covenant requirements.  
    
  Consolidated Historical Cash Flow Summary 
    
  The following summary discussion of our consolidated historical cash flow is based on the consolidated statements of cash flows in Item 1.  Financial Statements  and is not meant to be an all-inclusive discussion of the changes in our cash flow for the periods presented below.  Our historical cash flow activity for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   is as follows:  

53    

Operating Activities  
    
  Our cash flows from operating activities depends on numerous factors including the occupancy level of our portfolio, the rental rates achieved on our leases, the collectability of rent and recoveries from our tenants, the level of operating expenses, the impact of property acquisitions, completed development projects and related financing activities, and other general and administrative costs.  Our net cash provided by operating activities increased by   $50.0 million  , or   24.7%  , for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   as a result of an increase in cash rents in the same store portfolio and the expiration of the free rent period for certain leases, resulting in higher cash rental revenue, as well as the stabilization of completed development projects, offset by operating property dispositions.  See additional information under the caption   Results of Operations.  
    
  Investing Activities  
    
  Our cash flows from investing activities is generally used to fund development and operating property acquisitions, expenditures for development projects, and recurring and nonrecurring capital expenditures for our operating properties, net of proceeds received from dispositions of real estate assets.  Our net cash used in investing activities decreased by   $12.5 million   or   9.1%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   primarily due to     a decrease in acquisition and development expenditures for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the nine months ended   September 30, 2015  .  
    
  Financing Activities  
    
  Our cash flows from financing activities is principally impacted by our capital raising activities, net of dividends and distributions paid to common and preferred security holders.  Our net cash provided by financing activities decreased   $412.6 million   or   86.3%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   primarily due to a decrease in unsecured debt and stock offerings, partially offset by capital raised in connection with a consolidated property partnership (see Note 7 "Noncontrolling Interests on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements" in the consolidated financial statements).  

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and as of the date this report was filed, we did not have any off-balance sheet transactions, arrangements or obligations, including contingent obligations.  
  
    54    

Non-GAAP Supplemental Financial Measure: Funds From Operations  
    
  We calculate FFO in accordance with the White Paper on FFO approved by the Board of Governors of NAREIT.  The White Paper defines FFO as net income or loss calculated in accordance with GAAP, excluding extraordinary items, as defined by GAAP, gains and losses from sales of depreciable real estate and impairment write-downs associated with depreciable real estate, plus real estate-related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs and depreciation of non-real estate assets) and after adjustment for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.  Our calculation of FFO includes the amortization of deferred revenue related to tenant-funded tenant improvements and excludes the depreciation of the related tenant improvement assets.  We also add back net income attributable to noncontrolling common units of the Operating Partnership because we report FFO attributable to common stockholders and common unitholders.   
    
  We believe that FFO is a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance.  The exclusion from FFO of gains and losses from the sale of operating real estate assets allows investors and analysts to readily identify the operating results of the assets that form the core of our activity and assists in comparing those operating results between periods.  Also, because FFO is generally recognized as the industry standard for reporting the operations of REITs, it facilitates comparisons of operating performance to other REITs.  However, other REITs may use different methodologies to calculate FFO, and accordingly, our FFO may not be comparable to all other REITs. 
    
  Implicit in historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP is the assumption that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time.  Since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies using historical cost accounting alone to be insufficient.  Because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, we believe that FFO along with the required GAAP presentations provides a more complete measurement of our performance relative to our competitors and a more appropriate basis on which to make decisions involving operating, financing and investing activities than the required GAAP presentations alone would provide. 
    
  However, FFO should not be viewed as an alternative measure of our operating performance because it does not reflect either depreciation and amortization costs or the level of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, which are significant economic costs and could materially impact our results from operations. 
    
  The following table presents our FFO for the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  :

ITEM 3.  
    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
       
  The primary market risk we face is interest rate risk.  We seek to mitigate this risk by following established risk management policies and procedures.  These policies include maintaining prudent amounts of debt, including a greater amount of fixed-rate debt as compared to variable-rate debt in our portfolio, and may include the periodic use of derivative instruments.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we did not have any interest-rate sensitive derivative assets or liabilities.  Information about our changes in interest rate risk exposures from   December 31, 2015   to   September 30, 2016   is incorporated herein by reference from  Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Liquidity and Capital Resources of the Operating Partnership.

  As of   September 30, 2016  , approximately   8.5%   of our total outstanding debt of   $2.2 billion   (before the effects of debt discounts, premiums and deferred financing costs) was subject to variable interest rates.  The remaining   91.5%   bore interest at fixed rates.  All of our interest rate sensitive financial instruments are held for purposes other than trading purposes.  In general, interest rate fluctuations applied to our variable-rate debt will impact our future earnings and cash flows.  Conversely, interest rate fluctuations applied to our fixed-rate debt will generally not impact our future earnings and cash flows, unless such instruments mature or are otherwise terminated and need to be refinanced.  However, interest rate fluctuations will impact the fair value of the fixed-rate debt instruments. 
    
  We generally determine the fair value of our secured debt, unsecured revolving credit facility, unsecured term loan facility and unsecured term loan by performing discounted cash flow analyses using an appropriate market discount rate.  We calculate the market rate by obtaining period-end treasury rates for maturities that correspond to the maturities of our fixed-rate debt and then adding an appropriate credit spread based on information obtained from third-party financial institutions.  We calculate the market rate of our unsecured revolving credit facility, unsecured term loan facility and unsecured term loan by obtaining the period-end LIBOR rate and then adding an appropriate credit spread based on information obtained from third-party financial institutions.  These credit spreads take into account factors, including but not limited to, our credit profile, the tenure of the debt, amortization period, whether the debt is secured or unsecured, and the loan-to-value ratio of the debt to the collateral.  These calculations are significantly affected by the assumptions used, including the discount rate, credit spreads, and estimates of future cash flow. We determine the fair value of each of our publicly traded unsecured senior notes based on their quoted trading price at the end of the reporting period.  See Note 13  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures  in the consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information on the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the total outstanding balance of our variable-rate debt was comprised of borrowings on our unsecured term loan facility and unsecured term loan of   $189.0 million  , which was indexed to LIBOR plus a spread of   1.150%   (weighted average interest rate of   1.67%  ).  As of   December 31, 2015  , the total outstanding balance of our variable-rate debt was comprised of borrowings on our unsecured term loan facility and unsecured term loan of   $189.0 million  , which were indexed to LIBOR plus a spread of   1.15%   (weighted average interest rate of   1.40%  )  .      Assuming no changes in the outstanding balance of our existing variable-rate debt as of   September 30, 2016  , a 100 basis point increase in the LIBOR rate would increase our projected annual interest expense, before the effect of capitalization, by approximately $1.9 million.  Comparatively, if interest rates were 100 basis points higher as of December 31, 2015, our projected annual interest expense, before the effect of capitalization, would have also been $1.9 million higher. 
    
  The total carrying value of our fixed-rate debt was approximately   $2.0 billion   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  The total estimated fair value of our fixed-rate debt was approximately   $2.2 billion   as of   September 30, 2016   and   $2.1 billion   as of   December 31, 2015  .  For sensitivity purposes, a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate equates to a decrease in the total fair value of our fixed-rate debt of approximately $113.4 million, or 5.2%, as of   September 30, 2016  .  Comparatively, a 100 basis point increase in the discount rate equates to a decrease in the total fair value of our fixed-rate debt of approximately $117.1 million, or 5.6%, as of   December 31, 2015  .

TIME SHARING AGREEMENT 
  This Time Sharing Agreement (   Agreement   ) is entered into this ___ day of _____________, 2016 (   Effective Date   )     by and between Kilroy Realty, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (   Lessor   ),     and __________________, an individual (   Lessee   ).  Lessor and Lessee are hereinafter sometimes referred to individually as    Party    and also collectively as    Parties   . 
  RECITALS 
  WHEREAS, Lessor is the operator of the Aircraft described and referenced in   Exhibit A   attached hereto; 
  WHEREAS, Lessor employs a fully qualified flight crew to operate the Aircraft; and 
  WHEREAS, Lessor and Lessee desire to lease the Aircraft and flight crew from time to time on a time sharing basis, as defined in Section 91.501(c)(l) of the Federal Aviation Regulations (   FAR   ). 
  NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and based on the mutual covenants and conditions set forth herein, the Parties agree as follows: 
  ARTICLE 1 
  LEASE OF AIRCRAFT 
  1.1  Lease of Aircraft  .  Pursuant to and in accordance with the provisions of FAR Section 91.501(c)(l), Lessor hereby agrees to lease the Aircraft from time to time to Lessee on a time sharing, non-continuous and non-exclusive basis, and Lessee hereby agrees to lease the Aircraft from time to time from Lessor on a time sharing, non-continuous and non-exclusive basis, during the Term (as defined in Article 2) and subject to the terms and conditions herein contained. 
    
  1.2  Delivery and Redelivery of Aircraft  .  Upon the request of Lessee, subject to the availability of the Aircraft as determined by Lessor in accordance with   Section 1.3  , Lessor shall make the Aircraft available to Lessee at such location as Lessee may reasonably request.  Lessee acknowledges that Lessor currently bases the Aircraft at Oakland International Airport (KOAK), Oakland, CA (   Home Base   ).  The repositioning, ferry or dead head flights of the Aircraft required in connection with Lessee s flights of the Aircraft under this Agreement, including delivery and/or redelivery of the Aircraft to the Home Base or to such other location as determined by Lessor s specific schedule of the Aircraft usage for its intended business or as the Parties may otherwise agree, shall be deemed to be use of the Aircraft by Lessee and at Lessee s expense subject to the FAA Maximum (as defined and set forth in   Section 1.4  ). 
    
  1.3  Availability, Scheduling, and Use of Aircraft Flights  .  Lessee shall advise Lessor of his request for flight time and use of the Aircraft under this Agreement by giving Lessor   advance notice by telephone, email and/or facsimile.  Lessee s notice shall provide the customary information required by Lessor and its flight crew for each proposed flight.  Lessor, in its sole discretion, shall have final authority over the scheduling of the Aircraft and in the event of a scheduling conflict, Lessor s plans and decisions shall control. 
    
  1.4  Rent  .  For each flight (including the repositioning, ferry or dead head flights set forth under   Section 1.2  ) conducted under this Agreement, Lessee shall pay to Lessor rent (   Rent   ) equal to the Variable Costs (as defined below) of the flight; provided, however, that in no case shall the Rent for a flight exceed the FAA Maximum.  The amount of Rent for a particular flight shall be estimated by Lessor (or its delegate) in advance of a particular flight and shall be finally determined after the particular flight.  With respect to a particular flight, the    FAA Maximum    shall equal the aggregate amount of the expenses incurred for such flight as authorized and listed by FAR Section 91.501(d), consisting of the following enumerated expenses: 

1 

(1) 
    Fuel, oil, lubricants, and other additives; 
       
           (2) 
    Travel expenses of the crew, including food, lodging, and ground transportation; 
       
           (3) 
    Hangar and tie-down costs away from the Aircraft s base of operations; 
       
           (4) 
    Insurance obtained for the specific flight; 
       
           (5) 
    Landing fees, airport taxes, and similar assessments (including, without limitation and to the extent permitted by law, reimbursement of the taxes referred to in   Section 1.6  ); 
       
           (6) 
    Customs, foreign permit, and similar fees directly related to the flight; 
       
           (7) 
    In flight food and beverages: 
       
           (8) 
    Passenger ground transportation; 
       
           (9) 
    Flight planning and weather contract services; and 
       
           (10) 
    An additional charge equal to one hundred percent (100  %  ) of the expenses listed in paragraph (1) of this   Section 1.4  . 
     The    Variable Costs    of a particular flight shall equal the FAA Maximum with respect to that flight, modified by (a) subtracting the amount set forth in paragraph (10) of this   Section 1.4  , and (b) adding any variable maintenance and other variable costs of the flight not otherwise included in paragraphs (1) through (9) of this   Section 1.4   (  e.g.  , the Maintenance Programs described and referred to in   Exhibit A  ).   
  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event a particular trip is comprised of both business purpose flight legs and personal use flight legs, Rent for such trip shall be determined as follows: 
             
    The basic principle shall be that Variable Costs shall be calculated for all flight legs of such trip and shall be compared to the hypothetical Variable Costs that would have been incurred had the trip itinerary been conducted solely as a business purpose flight.  The excess, if any, of such Variable Costs shall be the amount of Rent imposed upon Lessee for such trip consisting of mixed purpose flight segments  ;   provided  ,   however  , that in no case shall the Rent for a flight exceed the FAA Maximum.  Any personal use attributable to a specific flight leg of a trip comprising multi-leg flights shall render that specific flight leg, in its entirety, a personal use flight leg of the trip. 

For purposes of clarity, assume that Lessee is traveling on the Aircraft from San Francisco to New York for business reasons and is scheduled to return from New York to San Francisco as part of the same business trip.  If, instead of returning to San Francisco from New York, Lessee adds a new leg to the flight from New York to Miami for personal reasons and then travels back to San Francisco from Miami, Lessee shall pay Rent on the New York-to-Miami and the Miami  to-San Francisco legs of the trip, but the amount of such Rent shall not exceed the positive difference (if any) between the Variable Costs of such flight legs less hypothetical Variable Costs that would have been incurred had the return trip been completed via a nonstop flight from New York-to-San Francisco as a business purpose flight.  Accordingly, in such example, if the Variable Costs of the New York-to-San Francisco return flight segment for business purposes would have been $10,000 and the Variable Costs with respect to the New York-to Miami and the Miami-to-San Francisco flight legs totaled $15,000, the Rent for the two personal legs of the flight would be $5,000 (but subject to the FAA Maximum limitation).   

2 

As another example, assume that a flight is necessary from San Francisco to New York for business reasons and would otherwise be scheduled to return from New York to San Francisco as part of the same business trip.  If, for personal reasons, Lessee makes a stop in Chicago on the way to New York from San Francisco and, on the return flight, stops in Denver for personal reasons, Lessee shall pay Rent on the entire trip (all four flight legs), but the amount of such Rent shall be equal to the positive difference (if any) between the Variable Costs of all four flight legs of such trip less the hypothetical Variable Costs that would have been incurred had the two business-intended flight legs of the trip (San Francisco-to-New York and New York-to-San Francisco) been completed for business purposes (subject in all events to the FAA Maximum limitation). 
       
  1.5  Taxation  . In the event that the SIFL Value (as defined below) with respect to a specific flight should exceed Rent for a particular flight, then such excess difference shall be imputed as taxable compensation to Lessee includable in Lessee s gross income in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (   IRC   ), and Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, and correctly treated and documented for income tax and employment tax and reporting purposes.  To the extent any such income results in tax withholding obligations for Lessor, or any of their respective affiliates, Lessee agrees that such entity may withhold the amount of such taxes from any other compensation otherwise payable to Lessee or may require Lessee to provide for such payment.  The    SIFL Value    of a particular flight shall equal the valuation of such flight using the special non-commercial flight valuation rule for employees determined under the base aircraft valuation formula (also known as the Standard Industry Fare Level formula), in accordance with the applicable provisions of federal income tax regulations Section l.61-21(g). 
    
  1.6  Federal Excise Tax on Transportation by Air  .  Lessee agrees and accepts that Lessee shall be responsible for paying to Lessor the federal excise tax under IRC Section 4261 on the Rent paid to Lessor in accordance with   Section 1.4  . 
    
  1.7  Method of Payment  .  Lessee shall provide Lessor from time to time a deposit in an amount reasonably estimated by the Parties to cover the anticipated level of Rent for personal use by Lessee of the Aircraft based upon the projected number of trips and their duration and profiles.  Lessor may request an increase in the deposit amount at any time should an increased use of the Aircraft occur and/or should there be an increase of the Variable Costs.  Lessor is permitted to deduct from the deposit at any time the amount of Rent that is incurred under this Agreement from time to time and in such event Lessee agrees promptly to replenish the deposit account in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Lessor shall provide Lessee a periodic statement of Rent incurred. 
  ARTICLE 2 
  TERM 
  The term of this Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date and shall continue for one year after said date.  This Agreement shall automatically be renewed for additional one (1) year periods upon the same terms and conditions in the event neither Party gives the other Party a written notice of termination thirty (30) days prior to the end of the initial term or any extensions (the initial term and any extensions thereof are hereinafter referred to as    Term   ).  Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party may terminate this Agreement at any time upon thirty (30) days  written notice or this Agreement shall terminate automatically upon (i) Lessor entering into an agreement for the sale of the Aircraft, or (ii) Lessee ceasing to be an executive officer of Lessor.   
  ARTICLE 3 
  OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE RESPONSIBILITIES 
  3.1  Operational Control and Crew  .  With respect to each flight undertaken under this Agreement, Lessor shall have and retain operational control of the Aircraft as provided in the applicable FAR (as defined in FAR Section 1.1    operational control,  with respect to a flight, means the exercise of authority over initiating, conducting, or terminating a flight.  );     and, for federal tax purposes, shall have and retain  possession, command and control  of the Aircraft, as determined under IRC and the Regulations and rulings promulgated thereunder.  Lessor shall employ, pay for and provide to Lessee a qualified flight crew for each flight undertaken under this Agreement.   

3 

3.2  Duties and Responsibilities of Crew  .  In accordance with applicable FAR, the qualified flight crew provided or contracted for by Lessor will exercise all of its duties and responsibilities in regard to the safety of each flight conducted hereunder.  Lessee specifically agrees that the flight crew, in its sole discretion, may terminate any flight, refuse to commence any flight, or take other action which in the considered judgment of the pilot in command is necessitated by considerations of safety.  The pilot in command shall have final and complete authority to cancel any flight for any reason or condition, which in the judgment of such pilot in command would compromise the safety of the flight.  No such action of the pilot in command shall create or support any liability for loss, injury, damage or delay to Lessee or any other person.  Lessee acknowledges and agrees that Lessor shall not be liable under any circumstances for delay or failure to furnish the Aircraft and the flight crew pursuant to this Agreement, except in the event of willful misconduct by Lessor. 
    
  3.3  Maintenance  .  Lessor shall be solely responsible for securing maintenance, preventive maintenance and required or otherwise necessary inspections on the Aircraft, and s  hall take such requirements into account in scheduling the Aircraft.  No period of maintenance, preventive maintenance or inspection shall be delayed or postponed for the purpose of scheduling the Aircraft, unless said maintenance or inspection can be safely conducted at a later time in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, and within the sound discretion of the pilot in command. 
  ARTICLE 4 
  INSURANCE 
  4.1  Insurance by Lessor  .  Lessor, at its sole cost, shall maintain in effect during the Term of this Agreement its present liability insurance covering public liability, property damage, including passenger legal liability and its all-risk hull and engine insurance.  Lessor s insurance shall be primary and without right of contribution from any other insurance.  Lessor shall cause Lessee to be an additional named insured with respect to the liability coverage. 
    
  4.2  Further Insurance  .  Lessor will provide such additional insurance coverage as Lessee shall request or require, provided, however, that the cost of such additional insurance shall be borne by Lessee as set forth in paragraph (4) of the definition of FAA Maximum (and the corresponding inclusion of such amount in the definition of Variable Expenses) in   Section 1.4   of this Agreement. 
  ARTICLE 5 
  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES 
  5.1  Representations, Warranties and Covenants of Lessor  .  Lessor hereby represents, warrants and covenants to Lessee the following:
