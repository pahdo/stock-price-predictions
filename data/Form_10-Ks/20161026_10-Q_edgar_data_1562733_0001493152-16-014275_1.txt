Note
1   Nature of the Business   

Synergy
CHC Corp. ( Synergy ,  we ,  us ,  our  or the  Company ) (formerly
Synergy Strips Corp.) was incorporated on December 29, 2010 in Nevada under the name  Oro Capital Corporation.  On
April 21, 2014, the Company changed its fiscal year end from July 31 to December 31. On April 28, 2014, the Company changed its
name to  Synergy Strips Corp. . On August 5, 2015, the Company changed its name to  Synergy CHC Corp.   

The
Company is a consumer health care company that is in the process of building a portfolio of best-in-class consumer product brands.
Synergy s strategy is to grow its portfolio both organically and by further acquisition.  

Synergy
is the sole owner of four subsidiaries: Neuragen Corp., Breakthrough Products, Inc., NomadChoice Pty Ltd. and Synergy CHC Inc.
and the results have been consolidated in these statements.  

Synergy
CHC Inc., a Canadian corporation, was created during February 2016 in order to perform marketing and customer service operations
for the companies owned by Synergy CHC Corp.  

Note
2   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   

General   

The
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 and for the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are unaudited. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have
been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ) for interim
financial information and are presented in accordance with the requirements of Rule S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission
(the  SEC ) and with the instructions to Form 10-Q. Accordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes
required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments
(consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the
fiscal year ending December 31, 2016. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction
with the audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015 and footnotes thereto included
in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC.  

Basis
of Presentation   

The
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All
significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  

Use
of Estimates   

The
preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Significant estimates are assumptions about collection of accounts receivable, useful life of fixed and intangible assets, goodwill
and assumptions used in Black-Scholes-Merton, or BSM, valuation methods, such as expected volatility, risk-free interest rate,
and expected dividend rate.  

Cash
and Cash Equivalents   

The
Company considers all cash on hand and in banks, including accounts in book overdraft positions, certificates of deposit and other
highly-liquid investments with maturities of three months or less, when purchased, to be cash and cash equivalents. As of September
30, 2016 the Company had no cash equivalents. The Company maintains its cash and cash equivalents in banks insured by the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) in accounts that at times may be in excess of the federally insured limit of $250,000 per
bank. The Company minimizes this risk by placing its cash deposits with major financial institutions. At September 30, 2016, the
uninsured balance amounted to $3,802,571.  

Capitalization
of Fixed Assets   

The
Company capitalizes expenditures related to property and equipment, subject to a minimum rule, that have a useful life greater
than one year for: (1) assets purchased; (2) existing assets that are replaced, improved or the useful lives have been extended;
or (3) all land, regardless of cost. Acquisitions of new assets, additions, replacements and improvements (other than land) costing
less than the minimum rule in addition to maintenance and repair costs, including any planned major maintenance activities, are
expensed as incurred.  

Intangible
Assets   

We
evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets periodically and take into account events or circumstances that warrant revised
estimates of useful lives or that indicate that impairment exists. All of our intangible assets are subject to amortization except
intellectual property of $1,450,000 acquired as part of Asset Purchase Agreement entered into with Factor Nutrition LLC on January
22, 2015. Intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over the useful lives.  

Long-lived
Assets   

Long-lived
assets include equipment and intangible assets other than those with indefinite lives. We assess the carrying value of our long-lived
asset groups when indicators of impairment exist and recognize an impairment loss when the carrying amount of a long-lived asset
is not recoverable when compared to undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset.  

Indicators
of impairment include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, significant changes
in our use of the assets or in our business strategy, loss of or changes in customer relationships and significant negative industry
or economic trends. When indications of impairment arise for a particular asset or group of assets, we assess the future recoverability
of the carrying value of the asset (or asset group) based on an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If carrying value exceeds projected,
net, undiscounted cash flows, an additional analysis is performed to determine the fair value of the asset (or asset group), typically
a discounted cash flow analysis, and an impairment charge is recorded for the excess of carrying value over fair value. As of
September 30, 2016, our qualitative analysis of long-lived assets did not indicate any impairment.  

Goodwill   

An
asset purchase is accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. Under that method, assets and liabilities of the business
acquired are recorded at their estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisition, with any excess of the cost of the acquisition
over the estimated fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired recorded as goodwill. As of September 30, 2016,
our qualitative analysis of goodwill did not indicate any impairment.  

Revenue
Recognition   

The
Company recognizes revenue in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board s ( FASB ), Accounting
Standards Codification ( ASC ) 605, Revenue Recognition ( ASC 605 ). ASC 605 requires that four basic
criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred
and/or service has been performed; (3) the selling price is fixed and determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured.
The Company believes that these criteria are satisfied upon shipment from its fulfillment centers. Certain of our distributors
may also perform a separate function as a co-packer on our behalf. In such cases, ownership of and title to our products that
are co-packed on our behalf by those co-packers who are also distributors, passes to such distributors when we are notified by
them that they have taken transfer or possession of the relevant portion of our finished goods. Freight billed to customers is
presented as revenues, and the related freight costs are presented as cost of goods sold. Cancelled orders are refunded if not
already dispatched, refunds are only paid if stock is damaged in transit, discounts are only offered with specific promotions
and orders will be refilled if lost in transit.  

Accounts
receivable   

Accounts
receivable are generally unsecured. The Company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable based on the age of
outstanding invoices and management s evaluation of collectability. Accounts are written off after all reasonable collection
efforts have been exhausted and management concludes that likelihood of collection is remote. Any future recoveries are applied
against the allowance for doubtful accounts.  

Advertising
Expense   

The
Company expenses marketing, promotions and advertising costs as incurred. Such costs are included in selling expense in the accompanying
unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations.  

Research
and Development   

Costs
incurred in connection with the development of new products and processing methods are charged to general and administrative expenses
as incurred.  

Income
Taxes   

The
Company utilizes FASB ASC 740,  Income Taxes,  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities
for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this
method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the tax basis of assets and liabilities
and their financial reporting amounts based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the
differences are expected to affect taxable income. A valuation allowance is recorded when it is  more likely-than-not 
that a deferred tax asset will not be realized.  

The
Company generated a deferred tax asset through net operating loss carry-forward. However, a valuation allowance of 100% has been
established due to the uncertainty of the Company s realization of the net operating loss carry forward prior to its expiration.  

NomadChoice
Pty Ltd, the Company s wholly-owned foreign subsidiary, is subject to income taxes in the jurisdictions in which it operates.
Significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income tax. There are many transactions and calculations undertaken
during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. The company recognizes liabilities
for anticipated tax audit issues based on the Company s current understanding of the tax law. Where the final tax outcome
of these matters is different from the carrying amounts, such differences will impact the current and deferred tax provisions
in the period in which such determination is made.  

Net
Earnings (Loss) Per Common Share   

The
Company computes earnings per share under ASC subtopic 260-10, Earnings Per Share. Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed
by dividing the net income (loss) attributable to the common stockholders (the numerator) by the weighted average number of shares
of common stock outstanding (the denominator) during the reporting periods. Diluted earnings per share is computed by increasing
the denominator by the weighted average number of additional shares that could have been outstanding from securities convertible
into common stock (using the  treasury stock  method), unless their effect on net loss per share is anti-dilutive.
As of September 30, 2016, options to purchase 5,000,000 shares of common stock and warrants to purchase 9,132,002 shares of common
stock were outstanding. These potential shares were included in the shares used to calculate diluted earnings per share.  

Going
Concern   

The
Company s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared using U.S. GAAP applicable to a going concern,
which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company had
an accumulated deficit at September 30, 2016 of $2,721,289. The Company had a working capital deficit of $2,487,840 as of September
30, 2016. Due to acquisitions during 2015 of revenue-producing products, the Company believes it has established an ongoing source
of revenue that is sufficient to cover its operating costs.  

Management s
plans to continue as a going concern include growing sales revenue on our existing brands, raising additional capital through
borrowing and sales of common stock. However, management cannot provide any assurances that the Company will be successful in
accomplishing any of its plans.  

The
ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plans described
in the preceding paragraph and eventually secure other sources of financing and attain profitable operations. The accompanying
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is
unable to continue as a going concern.  

Fair
Value Measurements   

The
Company measures and discloses the fair value of assets and liabilities required to be carried at fair value in accordance with
ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures. ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value,
and enhances fair value measurement disclosure.  

ASC
825 defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities
required or permitted to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it
would transact and considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, such as inherent
risk, transfer restrictions, and risk of nonperformance. ASC 825 establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to
maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 825 establishes
three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value:  

Level
1 - Quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets to which we have access at the measurement date.  

Level
2 - Inputs other than quoted prices within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.  

Level
3 - Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.  

The
determination of where assets and liabilities fall within this hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant
to the fair value measurement.  

As
of September 30, 2016, the Company has determined that there were no assets or liabilities measured at fair value, except for
the warrant derivative liability.  

Inventory   

Inventory
consists of raw materials, components and finished goods. The Company s inventory is stated at the lower of cost (FIFO cost
basis) or market. Finished goods include the cost of labor to assemble the items.  

Stock-Based
Compensation   

The
Company adopted the provisions of ASC 718. We estimate the fair value of stock options using a binomial model, consistent with
the provisions of ASC 718 and SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107, Share-Based Payment. Option-pricing models require the input
of highly subjective assumptions, including the price volatility of the underlying stock. We determined that the use of implied
volatility is expected to be more reflective of market conditions and, therefore, could reasonably be expected to be a better
indicator of our expected volatility than historical volatility. The expected term assumption used in calculating the estimated
fair value of our stock-based compensation awards using the Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) model is based on detailed historical data
about employees  exercise behavior, vesting schedules, and death and disability probabilities. In addition, we are required
to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest. We estimate the forfeiture
rate based on historical experience of our stock-based awards that are granted, exercised and cancelled. We believe the resulting
BSM calculation provides a more refined estimate of the fair value of our employee stock options.  

Foreign
Currency Translation   

The
functional currency of one of the Company s foreign subsidiaries (Nomadchoice Pty Ltd.) is the U.S. Dollar. The Company s
foreign subsidiary maintains its records using local currency (Australian Dollar). All monetary assets and liabilities of the
foreign subsidiary were translated into U.S. Dollars at quarter end exchange rates, non-monetary assets and liabilities of the
foreign subsidiary were translated into U.S. Dollars at transaction day exchange rates. Income and expense items related to non-monetary
items were translated at exchange rates prevailing during the transaction date and other incomes and expenses were translated
using average exchange rate for the period. The resulting translation adjustments, net of income taxes, were recorded in statements
of operations as Remeasurement gain or loss on translation of foreign subsidiary.  

The
functional currency of the Company s other foreign subsidiary (Synergy CHC Inc.) is the Canadian Dollar (CAD). The Company s
foreign subsidiary maintains its records using local currency (CAD). All assets and liabilities of the foreign subsidiary were
translated into U.S. Dollars at period end exchange rates and stockholders equity is translated at the historical rates.
Income and expense items were translated using average exchange rate for the period. The resulting translation adjustments, net
of income taxes, are reported as other comprehensive income and accumulated other comprehensive income in the stockholder s
equity in accordance with ASC 220   Comprehensive Income.  

Translation
gains and losses that arise from exchange rate fluctuations from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional
currency are translated into either Australian Dollars or Canadian Dollars, as the case may be, at the rate on the date of the
transaction and included in the results of operations as incurred.  

Concentrations
of Credit Risk   

In
the normal course of business, the Company provides credit terms to its customers; however, collateral is not required. Accordingly,
the Company performs credit evaluations of its customers and maintains allowances for possible losses which, when realized, were
within the range of management s expectations. From time to time, a higher concentration of credit risk exist on outstanding
accounts receivable for a select number of customers due to individual buying patterns.  

Warehousing
costs   

Warehouse
costs include all third party warehouse rent fees and any additional costs relating to assembly or special pack-outs of the Company s
products are charged to general and administrative expenses as incurred.  

Product
display costs   

All
displays manufactured and purchased by the Company are for placement of product in retail stores. This also includes all costs
for display execution and setup and retail services are charged to general and administrative expenses as incurred.  

Warrant
Derivative Liabilities   

ASC
815 generally provides three criteria that, if met, require companies to bifurcate conversion options from their host instruments
and account for them as free standing derivative financial instruments. These three criteria include circumstances in which (a)
the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative instrument are not clearly and closely related to the economic
characteristics and risks of the host contract, (b) the hybrid instrument that embodies both the embedded derivative instrument
and the host contract is not re-measured at fair value under otherwise applicable generally accepted accounting principles with
changes in fair value reported in earnings as they occur and (c) a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative
instrument would be considered a derivative instrument subject to the requirements of ASC 815. ASC 815 also provides an exception
to this rule when the host instrument is deemed to be conventional, as described.  

A
Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model, with dilution effects, was utilized to estimate the fair value of the Warrant Derivative
Liabilities as of September 30, 2016. This model is subject to the significant assumptions discussed below and requires the following
key inputs with respect to the Company and/or instrument:  

Cost
of Sales   

Cost
of sales includes the purchase cost of products sold and all costs associated with getting the products into the retail stores
including buying and transportation costs.  

Debt
Issuance Costs   

Debt
issuance costs consist primarily of arrangement fees, professional fees and legal fees. These costs are netted off with the related
loan and are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the related debt facilities.  

Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets   

When
facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of long-lived assets, including fixed assets, may be impaired, an evaluation
of recoverability is performed by comparing the carrying value of the assets to projected future cash flows in addition to other
quantitative and qualitative analyses. Upon indication that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable, the Company
recognizes an impairment loss as a charge against current operations. Long-lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the
lower of the carrying amount or fair value, less estimated costs to sell. The Company makes judgments related to the expected
useful lives of long-lived assets and its ability to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of such
assets which are affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance and improvements of the assets, changes in economic conditions
and changes in operating performance. As the Company assesses the ongoing expected cash flows and carrying amounts of its long-lived
assets, these factors could cause the Company to realize a material impairment charge.  

Shipping
Costs   

Shipping
and handling costs billed to customers are recorded in sales. Shipping costs incurred by the company are recorded in selling and
marketing expenses.

Accounting Pronouncements   

ASU
2016-10  

In
April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations
and Licensing, which provides further guidance on identifying performance obligations and improves the operability and understandability
of licensing implementation guidance. The effective date for ASU 2016-10 is the same as the effective date of ASU 2014-09 as amended
by ASU 2015-14, for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those years.
The Company has not yet determined the impact of ASU 2016-10 on its consolidated financial statements.  

ASU
2016-09  

In
March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation   Stock Compensation, or ASU No. 2016-09. The areas for simplification
in this Update involve several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences,
classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. For public entities,
the amendments in this Update are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those
annual periods. Early adoption is permitted in any interim or annual period. If an entity early adopts the amendments in an interim
period, any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period. An entity
that elects early adoption must adopt all of the amendments in the same period. Amendments related to the timing of when excess
tax benefits are recognized, minimum statutory withholding requirements, forfeitures, and intrinsic value should be applied using
a modified retrospective transition method by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to equity as of the beginning of the period
in which the guidance is adopted. Amendments related to the presentation of employee taxes paid on the statement of cash flows
when an employer withholds shares to meet the minimum statutory withholding requirement should be applied retrospectively. Amendments
requiring recognition of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies in the income statement and the practical expedient for estimating
expected term should be applied prospectively. An entity may elect to apply the amendments related to the presentation of excess
tax benefits on the statement of cash flows using either a prospective transition method or a retrospective transition method.
We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU No. 2016-09 on our consolidated financial statements.  

ASU
2016-08  

In
March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations
(Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net) that clarifies how to apply revenue recognition guidance related to whether an entity is
a principal or an agent. ASU 2016-08 clarifies that the analysis must focus on whether the entity has control of the goods or
services before they are transferred to the customer and provides additional guidance about how to apply the control principle
when services are provided and when goods or services are combined with other goods or services. The effective date for ASU 2016-08
is the same as the effective date of ASU 2014-09 as amended by ASU 2015-14, for annual reporting periods beginning after December
15, 2017, including interim periods within those years. The Company has not yet determined the impact of ASU 2016-08 on its consolidated
financial statements.  

ASU
2016-01  

In
January 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU )
2016-01, which amends the guidance in U.S. GAAP on the classification and measurement of financial instruments. Changes to the
current guidance primarily affect the accounting for equity investments, financial liabilities under the fair value option, and
the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. In addition, the ASU clarifies guidance related to the
valuation allowance assessment when recognizing deferred tax assets resulting from unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt
securities. The new standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and upon adoption,
an entity should apply the amendments by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet at the beginning of the
first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. Early adoption is not permitted except for the provision to record
fair value changes for financial liabilities under the fair value option resulting from instrument-specific credit risk in other
comprehensive income. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance on its consolidated financial statements.  

ASU
2015-17  

In
November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes. Currently deferred taxes for each
tax jurisdiction are presented as a net current asset or liability and net noncurrent asset or liability on the balance sheet.
To simplify the presentation, the new guidance requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets for all jurisdictions along with
any related valuation allowances be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. This guidance is
effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and early adoption is permitted. The Company
adopted this guidance in the fourth quarter of the year ended December 31, 2015 on a retrospective basis. The adoption of this
guidance did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements., and did not have any effect
on prior periods due to the full valuation allowance against the Company s net deferred tax assets.  

ASU
2015-16  

In
September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16, Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement  Period Adjustments. Changes to
the accounting for measurement-period adjustments relate to business combinations. Currently, an acquiring entity is required
to retrospectively adjust the balance sheet amounts of the acquiree recognized at the acquisition date with a corresponding adjustment
to goodwill as a result of changes made to the balance sheet amounts of the acquiree. The measurement period is the period after
the acquisition date during which the acquirer may adjust the balance sheet amounts recognized for a business combination (generally
up to one year from the date of acquisition). The changes eliminate the requirement to make such retrospective adjustments, and,
instead require the acquiring entity to record these adjustments in the reporting period they are determined. The new standard
is effective for both public and private companies for periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Adoption of this new standard
did not have any impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.  

ASU
2015-14  

In
August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, Revenue From Contracts With Customers (Topic 606). The amendments in this ASU defer
the effective date of ASU 2014-09. Public business entities should apply the guidance in ASU 2014-09 to annual reporting periods
beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. Earlier application is permitted
only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting
period. We are still evaluating the effect of the adoption of ASU 2014-09 on our consolidated financial statements.  

ASU
2015-11  

In
July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory (Topic 330). ASU 2015-11 simplifies the accounting
for the valuation of all inventory not accounted for using the last-in, first-out ( LIFO ) method by prescribing that
inventory be valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. ASU 2015-11 is effective for financial statements issued for
fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016 on a prospective basis. We do not
expect the adoption of ASU 2015-11 to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.  

ASU
2015-05  

In
April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-05, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40). ASU 2015-05
provides guidance regarding the accounting for a customer s fees paid in a cloud computing arrangement; specifically about
whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, and if so, how to account for the software license. ASU 2015-05
is effective for public companies  annual periods, including interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after
December 15, 2015 on either a prospective or retrospective basis. Early adoption is permitted. Adoption of this new standard did
not have any impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.  

ASU
2015-07  

In
May 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-07, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities
That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent) This guidance eliminates the requirement to categorize investments
within the fair value hierarchy if their fair value is measured using the net asset value ( NAV ) per share practical
expedient in the FASB s fair value measurement guidance. The new standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods
within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. Adoption of this new standard did not have any impact on the Company s
consolidated financial statements.  

ASU
2015-03  

In
April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation
of Debt Issuance Costs. The amendments in this ASU require that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be
presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts.
The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by the amendments in this ASU. The amendments
are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after
December 15, 2015. The amendments are to be applied on a retrospective basis, wherein the balance sheet of each individual period
presented is adjusted to reflect the period-specific effects of applying the new guidance. The Company reclassified debt issuance
cost of $208,569 and $378,852 from other assets to liabilities and netted off with the related loans in the liabilities as of
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  

ASU
2015-02  

In
February 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02, Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis, which is
intended to improve targeted areas of consolidation guidance for legal entities such as limited partnerships, limited liability
corporations, and securitization structures (collateralized debt obligations, collateralized loan obligations, and mortgage-backed
security transactions). The ASU focuses on the consolidation evaluation for reporting organizations that are required to evaluate
whether they should consolidate certain legal entities. In addition to reducing the number of consolidation models from four to
two, the new standard simplifies the FASB Accounting Standards Codification and improves current U.S. GAAP by placing more emphasis
on risk of loss when determining a controlling financial interest, reducing the frequency of the application of related-party
guidance when determining a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity ( VIE ), and changing consolidation
conclusions for companies in several industries that typically make use of limited partnerships or VIEs. The ASU will be effective
for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted,
including adoption in an interim period. Adoption of this new standard did not have any impact on the Company s consolidated
financial statements.  

ASU
2015-01  

In
January 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-01, Income Statement - Extraordinary and Unusual Items (Subtopic 225-20): Simplifying
Income Statement Presentation by Eliminating the Concept of Extraordinary Items. This ASU eliminates from U.S. GAAP the concept
of extraordinary items. ASU 2015-01 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after
December 15, 2015. A reporting entity may apply the amendments prospectively. Adoption of this new standard did not have any impact
on the Company s consolidated financial statements.  

ASU
2014-17  

In
November 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-17, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Pushdown Accounting. This ASU provides an acquired
entity with an option to apply pushdown accounting in its separate financial statements upon occurrence of an event in which an
acquirer obtains control of the acquired entity. An acquired entity may elect the option to apply pushdown accounting in the reporting
period in which the change-in-control event occurs. If pushdown accounting is applied to an individual change-in-control event,
that election is irrevocable. ASU 2014-17 was effective on November 18, 2014. The adoption of ASU 2014-17 did not have any effect
on our consolidated financial statements.  

ASU
2014-16  

In
November 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-16, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815). ASU 2014-16 addresses whether the host contract
in a hybrid financial instrument issued in the form of a share should be accounted for as debt or equity. ASU 2014-16 is effective
for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. We have not previously and
do not currently have issued, nor were we or are we investors in, hybrid financial instruments. Adoption of this new standard
did not have any impact on the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  

ASU
2014-15  

In
August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40). ASU 2014-15
provides guidance related to management s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity s
ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosure. ASU 2014-15 is effective for annual periods
ending after December 15, 2016, and for interim and annual periods thereafter. Early application is permitted. We do not expect
the adoption of ASU 2014-15 to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.  

ASU
2014-12  

In
June 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-12, Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Accounting for Share-Based Payments
When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period. This ASU requires
that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance
condition. ASU 2014-12 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December
15, 2015. Adoption of this new standard did not have any impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.  

ASU
2014-09  

In
May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). ASU 2014-09 affects any entity using
U.S. GAAP that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into contracts for the transfer
of nonfinancial assets unless those contracts are within the scope of other standards (e.g., insurance contracts or lease contracts).
ASU 2014-09 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016. In
August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, which defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year for all entities and permits
early adoption on a limited basis. ASU 2014-09 will be effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2018, and early adoption
is permitted in the first quarter of 2017. We are still evaluating the effect of the adoption of ASU 2014-09 on our consolidated
financial statements. .  

ASU
2014-08  

In
April 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-08, Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205) and Property, Plant, and Equipment
(Topic 360) and Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity. ASU 2014-08 amends
the definition for what types of asset disposals are to be considered discontinued operations, as well as amending the required
disclosures for discontinued operations and assets held for sale. ASU 2014-08 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods
within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December 15, 2014. The adoption of ASU 2014-08 did not have any effect on our
consolidated financial statements.

Note 9   Accounts Payable and Accrued
Liabilities  

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015,
accounts payable and accrued liabilities consisted of the following: 

Note 10   Notes Payable  

The Company s
loans payable at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are as follows: 

$6,000,000 January 22, 2015 Loan:  

On January 22, 2015, the Company entered into
a Loan and Security Agreement ( Loan Agreement ) with Knight Therapeutics (Barbados) Inc. ( Knight ), pursuant
to which Knight agreed to loan the Company $6.0 million (the  Loan ), and which amount was borrowed at closing (the
 Financing ) for the purpose of acquiring the Focus Factor Business (defined below). At closing, the Company paid Knight
an origination fee of $120,000 and a work fee of $60,000 and also paid $40,000 of Knight s expenses associated with the Loan.
The Loan bears interest at a rate of 15% per year; provided, however, that upon the occurrence of an equity or convertible equity
offering by the Company of at least $1.0 million, the interest rate will drop to 13% per year. Interest accrues quarterly and is
payable in arrears on March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31 in each year, beginning on March 31, 2015. 

All outstanding principal and accrued and unpaid
interest is due on the earliest to occur of either January 20, 2017 (the  Maturity Date ), or the date that Knight,
in its discretion, accelerates the Company s obligations due to an event of default. The Company may extend the Maturity
Date for two successive additional 12-month periods if at March 31, 2016 and March 31, 2017, respectively, the Company s
revenues exceed $13.0 million and its EBITDA exceeds $2.0 million for the respective 12-month period then ending. These covenants
were achieved, therefore the Company chose to extend the loan for the first 12-month period. Principal payments under the Loan
Agreement commenced on June 30, 2015 and continue quarterly as set forth on the Repayment Schedule to the Loan Agreement. 

Subject to certain restrictions, the Company
may prepay the outstanding principal of the Loan (in whole but not in part) at any time if the Company pays a concurrent prepayment
fee equal to the greater of (i) the total unpaid annual interest that would have been payable during the year in which the prepayment
is made if the prepayment is made prior to the first anniversary of the closing, and (ii) $300,000. The Company s obligations
under the Loan Agreement are secured by a first priority security interest in all present and future assets of the Company. The
Company also agreed to not pledge or otherwise encumber its intellectual property assets, subject to certain customary exceptions. 

The Loan Agreement includes customary representations,
warranties, and affirmative and restrictive covenants, including covenants to attain and maintain certain financial metrics, and
to not merge or dispose of assets, acquire other businesses (except for businesses substantially similar or complementary to the
Company s business and the aggregate consideration to be paid does not exceed $100,000) or make capital expenditures in excess
of $100,000 over the Company s annual business plan in any year. The Loan Agreement also includes customary events of default,
including payment defaults, breaches of covenants, change of control and material adverse effect default. Upon the occurrence of
an event of default and during the continuation thereof, the principal amount of the Loan will bear a default interest rate of
an additional 5%. 

In connection with the Loan Agreement, the
Company issued to Knight a warrant that entitled Knight to purchase 4,595,187 shares of common stock of the Company ( Common
Stock ) on or prior to close of business on January 30, 2015 (the  ST Warrant ). The aggregate exercise price
of the Common Stock under the ST Warrant is $1.00. Knight exercised the ST Warrant on January 22, 2015. Also in connection with

Note 15   Derivatives  

The Company has incurred a liability for the
estimated fair value of a derivative warrant instrument. The estimated fair value of the derivative warrant instruments has been
calculated using the Black-Scholes fair value option-pricing model with key input variables provided by management, as of the issue
date, with the valuation offset against additional paid in capital, and at each reporting date, with changes in fair value recorded
as gains or losses on revaluation in non-operating income (expense). 

The Company identified embedded derivatives
related to the warrants issued along with loan payable entered into in November 2015. These embedded derivatives included certain
conversion features. The accounting treatment of derivative financial instruments requires that the Company record the fair value
of the derivatives as of the inception date of the warrants and to adjust the fair value as of each subsequent balance sheet date.
At the inception of the warrants, the Company determined a fair value of $2,067,258 of the embedded derivative. The fair value
of the embedded derivative was determined using the Black-Scholes Model based on the following assumptions: 

The initial fair values of the embedded derivative
of $2,067,258 was allocated as a debt discount $2,067,258. 

Fair value at December 31, 2015 was estimated
to be $3,096,179 and based on the following assumptions: 

During the year ended December 31, 2015, the
increase in the fair value of the warrant derivative liability of $1,028,921 was recorded as a loss on change in fair value of
derivative liability. 

Fair value at September 30, 2016 was estimated
to be $1,535,795 and based on the following assumptions: 

During the nine months ended September 30,
2016, the decrease in the fair value of the warrant derivative liability of $1,560,384 was recorded as a gain on change in fair
value of derivative liability. 

During the three months ended September 30,
2016, the decrease in the fair value of the warrant derivative liability of $1,137,309 was recorded as a gain on change in fair
value of derivative liability. 

Note 16   Segments

management structure and method of internal reporting, the Company has one operating segment. The Company s chief operating
decision maker does not review operating results on a disaggregated basis; rather, the chief operating decision maker reviews operating
results on an aggregate basis.

Note 3   Acquisitions 

Asset Purchase Agreement with Factor Nutrition
Labs : 

The Company has accounted
for this transaction under the acquisition method of accounting. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total acquisition
consideration price is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their preliminary estimated fair values
based on the management s estimates as of the date of the acquisition. The Company expects to retain the services of independent
valuation firm to determine the fair value of these identifiable intangible assets. Once determined, the Company will reallocate
the purchase price of the acquisition based on the results of the independent evaluation if they are materially different from
the allocations as recorded on January 22, 2015. The Company expects the purchase price allocations for the acquisition of Focus
Factor Business to be completed by the filing of first quarter 2016 statements.  

The Company has consulted with a valuation
professional to assist in determining the fair value of the identifiable FOCUSfactor intangible assets. As a result of this work,
the Company has increased the amount allocated to the FOCUSfactor indefinite-lived brand and patent by $450,000 and reduced the
amount recorded to goodwill by an identical amount. This adjustment had no effect on the income statement. The Company believes
that the restated amount of $1,450,000 properly states the fair value of the FOCUSfactor brand and patent. 

In the Company s Annual Report on Form

allocated to a Non-Compete agreement by $50,000 and reduced the amount recorded to goodwill by the identical amounts. In addition,
it was determined that an incorrect stock price was used to calculate the purchase price of the transaction. As a result of this
determination, the Company decreased Additional Paid In Capital and Goodwill by $1,170,000. These adjustments had no effect on
the income statement. The Company believes that these restated amounts properly states the fair value of the Breakthrough Products,
Inc. transaction.

Note 18   Income Taxes  

Income tax expense was $264,377 and $659,462
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to $0 for the same periods in 2015. The current
provision is attributable to Australian operations and the current tax rate in effect in that country. 

The total deferred tax asset is calculated
by multiplying a domestic (US) 34% marginal tax rate by the cumulative net operating loss carryforwards ( NOL ). The
Company currently has NOLs, which expire through 2035. Management has determined based on all the available information that a
100% valuation reserve is required. 

For U.S. purposes, the Company has not completed
its evaluation of NOL utilization limitations under Internal Revenue Code, as amended (the  Code ) Section 382, change
of ownership rules. If the Company has had a change in ownership, the NOL s would be limited as to the amount that could
be utilized each year, based on the Code.

no subsequent events have occurred that would require adjustments or disclosure into the unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements. 

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND
ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

The following discussion
and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition of Synergy for the three and nine months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, should be read in conjunction with the financial statements of Synergy, and the notes to those financial statements
that are included elsewhere in this Form 10-Q. Our discussion includes forward-looking statements based upon current expectations
that involve risks and uncertainties, such as our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. Actual results and the timing
of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors,
including those set forth under the Risk Factors, Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Business sections
in our Form 10-K filed on March 31, 2016. We use words such as  anticipate,   estimate,   plan, 
 project,   continuing,   ongoing,   expect,   believe,   intend, 
 may,   will,   should,   could,  and similar expressions to identify forward-looking
statements.  

Overview  

The Company is in the
business of marketing and distributing consumer branded products through various distribution channels primarily in the health
and wellness industry. The Company s strategy is to grow both organically and by future acquisition. 

During 2015, we completed
five acquisitions, with at least one in each of the three targeted verticals of Nutraceuticals, Cosmeceuticals and Over the Counter
(OTC). Our objective is to grow all three verticals to provide a balanced and synergistic portfolio that drives consumer demand
via multiple channels. We expect the incorporation of these acquisitions into the Company will have a significant impact on our
revenue and results of operations. 

Our management s
discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are only based on Synergy s current business.
Our previous shell company s results of operations are immaterial and will not be included in the discussion below. Key factors
affecting our results of operations include revenues, cost of revenues, operating expenses and income and taxation. 

Non-GAAP Financial
Measures  

We currently focus on
Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate our business relationships and our resulting operating performance and financial position. Adjusted
EBITDA is defined as EBITDA (net income plus interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization), further adjusted
to exclude certain non-cash expenses and other adjustments as set forth below. We present Adjusted EBITDA because we consider it
an important measure of our performance and it is a meaningful financial metric in assessing our operating performance from period
to period by excluding certain items that we believe are not representative of our core business, such as certain non-cash items
and other adjustments. 

We believe that Adjusted
EBITDA, viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of, our reported results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States ( U.S. GAAP ), provides useful information to investors. 

EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA
are considered non-GAAP financial measures. EBITDA represents earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted
EBITDA represents EBITDA, further adjusted to exclude the impact of higher-than-normal revenue change order activity and certain
expenses and transactions that we believe are not representative of our core operating results, including gain on change in fair
value of derivative liability; stock-based compensation; one-time expenses for acquisitions; and the gain on foreign currency translation
and transaction. The Company s definitions of EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA might not be comparable to similarly titled measures
reported by other companies. 

Results of Operations
for the Three months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  

Revenue  

For the three months ended
September 30, 2016, we had revenue of $11,569,568 from sales of our products, as compared to revenue of $3,181,623 for the same
period in 2015. This is primarily due to the acquisitions we completed during 2015 and is comprised of the following categories: 

Cost of Revenue  

For the three months ended
September 30, 2016, our cost of revenue was $3,475,159. Our cost of revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2015, was
$1,469,910. This increase is also due to the acquisitions we completed during 2015 and is comprised of the following categories: 

Gross Profit  

Gross profit was $8,094,409
for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to gross profit of $1,711,713 for the same period in 2015. 

Operating Expenses  

Selling and Marketing Expenses 

For the three months ended
September 30, 2016, our selling and marketing expenses were $3,051,808 as compared to $814,640 for the same period in 2015, which
is primarily due to marketing our various products in multiple media channels including print, television and online. This increase
is solely attributable to the acquisitions we completed during 2015. 

General and Administrative Expenses 

For the three months ended
September 30, 2016, our general and administrative expenses were $1,811,395. For the three months ended September 30, 2015, our
general and administrative expenses were $706,806. The increase is primarily due to the acquisitions completed during 2015 and
having general costs now to run and manage each brand.

For the three months ended
September 30, 2016, our depreciation and amortization expenses were $298,079 as compared to $103,103 for the same period in 2015.
The increase in 2016 is due to the acquisitions completed during 2015. 

Other Income and Expenses

For the three months ended
September 30, 2016, we had interest expense of $432,622 as compared to $212,904 for the same period in 2015. The increase was due
to the issuance of loans for the purpose of acquisitions of various companies during 2015. We also issued warrants along with the
loans and paid debt issuance cost in 2015 which led to the amortization of debt discount and debt issuance costs. We issued warrants
with a reset provision in 2015 which led to the calculation of warrant derivative liability and hence we recorded a gain on change
in fair value of derivative liability of $1,137,309. During 2015, we acquired a foreign subsidiary and thus recorded a remeasurement
gain on the foreign currency translation. 

Net Income (Loss)  

For the three months ended
September 30, 2016, our net income was $3,050,666 as compared to a net loss of ($467,610) for the same period in 2015.

This increase is also due to the acquisitions we completed during 2015 and is comprised of the following categories: 

Gross Profit  

Gross profit was $20,417,866
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to gross profit of $4,134,375 for the same period in 2015. 

Operating Expenses  

Selling and Marketing Expenses 

For the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, our selling and marketing expenses were $6,688,663 as compared to $2,228,418 for the same period in 2015, which
is primarily due to marketing our various products in multiple media channels including print, television and online. This increase
is solely attributable to the acquisitions we completed during 2015. 

General and Administrative Expenses 

For the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, our general and administrative expenses were $5,359,578. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, our
general and administrative expenses were $1,407,458. The increase is primarily due to the acquisitions completed during 2015 and
having general costs now to run and manage each brand. 

Depreciation and Amortization Expenses 

For the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, our depreciation and amortization expenses were $871,089 as compared to $282,256 for the same period in 2015.
The increase in 2016 is due to the acquisitions completed during 2015. 

Other Income and Expenses  

For the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, we had other (income) and expense items of the following: 

For the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, we had interest expense of $1,265,844 as compared to $612,094 for the same period in 2015. The increase was
due to the issuance of loans for the purpose of acquisitions of various companies during 2015. We also issued warrants along with
the loans and paid debt issuance cost in 2015 which led to the amortization of debt discount and debt issuance costs. We issued
warrants with a reset provision in 2015 which led to the calculation of warrant derivative liability and hence we recorded a gain
on change in fair value of derivative liability of $1,560,384. During 2015, we acquired a foreign subsidiary and thus recorded
a remeasurement gain on the foreign currency translation. 

Net Income (Loss)  

For the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, our net income was $5,848,552, as compared to a net loss of ($3,072,148) for the same period in 2015. 

Liquidity and Capital
Resources  

Overview  

As of September 30, 2016,
we had $4,220,141 cash on hand and a $2,487,840 working capital deficit. The deficit is largely due to a derivative liability for
stock warrants outstanding of $1,535,795. In addition, we also had restricted cash of $291,620 which is comprised of $191,620 for
a rolling reserve with Paypal and $100,000 for credit card collateral. 

Going Concern  

The Company s unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements are prepared using U.S. GAAP applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and
liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company had an accumulated deficit at September 30, 2016 of $2,721,289.
The Company had a working capital deficit of $2,487,840 as of September 30, 2016. Due to acquisitions during 2015 of revenue-producing
products, the Company believes it has established an ongoing source of revenue that is sufficient to cover its operating costs. 

Management s plans to continue as a going
concern include growing sales revenue on our existing brands, raising additional capital through borrowing and sales of common
stock. However, management cannot provide any assurances that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans. 

The ability of the Company to continue as a
going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plans described in the preceding paragraph and eventually
secure other sources of financing and attain profitable operations. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. 

Nine months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015  

Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities  

Net cash provided by operating
activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $6,247,059, compared to $800,030 for the same period in 2015. This
increase in net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily attributable to
an increase in net income due to the acquisitions in 2015 as well as the changes in operating assets and liabilities. 

The $6,247,059 consists of our net income of
$5,848,552 increased by: 

Net Cash Used in Investing Activities  

Net cash used in investing
activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $2,446,641, compared to net cash used of $4,754,045 for the same period
in 2015. The decrease in cash used in investing activities during 2016 is attributable to the release of restricted cash and the
cash used in 2015 is attributable to the purchase of the Focus Factor assets. 

Net Cash (Used in) Provided by Financing
Activities  

Net cash used in financing
activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $3,225,000, compared to net cash provided of $4,778,625 for the same
period in 2015. This is attributable to the repayment of notes during 2016 and the proceeds of the notes in 2015. 

Key 2016 Initiatives  

During 2016, we have plans for organic growth
within our current product lines by developing and launching new products. We have new marketing campaigns in process and intend
to expand our online presence for each product. While we intend to grow further through additional acquisitions, we feel it is
important to also develop our existing products. 

Contractual Obligations
and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

Contractual Obligations  

None. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

None. 

Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies  

Basis of Presentation  

The unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions
have been eliminated in consolidation. 

Use of Estimates  

The preparation of the consolidated financial
statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts
of expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates are assumptions
about collection of accounts receivable, useful life of fixed and intangible assets, goodwill and assumptions used in Black-Scholes-Merton,
or BSM, valuation methods, such as expected volatility, risk-free interest rate, and expected dividend rate. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents  

The Company considers all cash on hand and
in banks, including accounts in book overdraft positions, certificates of deposit and other highly-liquid investments with maturities
of three months or less, when purchased, to be cash and cash equivalents. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had no cash equivalents. 

Capitalization of Fixed Assets  

The Company capitalizes expenditures related
to property and equipment, subject to a minimum rule, that have a useful life greater than one year for: (1) assets purchased;
(2) existing assets that are replaced, improved or the useful lives have been extended; or (3) all land, regardless of cost. Acquisitions
of new assets, additions, replacements and improvements (other than land) costing less than the minimum rule in addition to maintenance
and repair costs, including any planned major maintenance activities, are expensed as incurred. 

Intangible Assets  

We evaluate the recoverability of intangible
assets periodically and take into account events or circumstances that warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate
that impairment exists. All of our intangible assets are subject to amortization except intellectual property of $1,450,000 acquired
as part of Asset Purchase Agreement entered into with Factor Nutrition LLC on January 22, 2015. Intangible assets are amortized
on a straight line basis over the useful lives. 

Long-lived Assets  

Long-lived assets include equipment and intangible
assets other than those with indefinite lives. We assess the carrying value of our long-lived asset groups when indicators of impairment
exist and recognize an impairment loss when the carrying amount of a long-lived asset is not recoverable when compared to undiscounted
cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. 

Indicators of impairment include significant
underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in our use of the assets or
in our business strategy, loss of or changes in customer relationships and significant negative industry or economic trends. When
indications of impairment arise for a particular asset or group of assets, we assess the future recoverability of the carrying
value of the asset (or asset group) based on an undiscounted cash flow analysis. If carrying value exceeds projected, net, undiscounted
cash flows, an additional analysis is performed to determine the fair value of the asset (or asset group), typically a discounted
cash flow analysis, and an impairment charge is recorded for the excess of carrying value over fair value. As of September 30,
2016, our qualitative analysis of long-lived assets did not indicate any impairment. 

Goodwill  

An asset purchase is accounted for under the
purchase method of accounting. Under that method, assets and liabilities of the business acquired are recorded at their estimated
fair values as of the date of the acquisition, with any excess of the cost of the acquisition over the estimated fair value of
the net tangible and intangible assets acquired recorded as goodwill. As of September 30, 2016, our qualitative analysis of goodwill
did not indicate any impairment. 

Revenue Recognition  

The Company recognizes revenue in accordance
with the Financial Accounting Standards Board s ( FASB ), Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC )
605, Revenue Recognition ( ASC 605 ). ASC 605 requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized:
(1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred and/or service has been performed; (3) the selling
price is fixed and determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. The Company believes that these criteria are satisfied
upon shipment from its fulfillment centers. Certain of our distributors may also perform a separate function as a co-packer on
our behalf. In such cases, ownership of and title to our products that are co-packed on our behalf by those co-packers who are
also distributors, passes to such distributors when we are notified by them that they have taken transfer or possession of the
relevant portion of our finished goods. Freight billed to customers is presented as revenues, and the related freight costs are
presented as cost of goods sold. Cancelled orders are refunded if not already dispatched, refunds are only paid if stock is damaged
in transit, discounts are only offered with specific promotions and orders will be refilled if lost in transit. 

Accounts receivable  

Accounts receivable are generally unsecured.
The Company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable based on the age of outstanding invoices and management s
evaluation of collectability. Accounts are written off after all reasonable collection efforts have been exhausted and management
concludes that likelihood of collection is remote. Any future recoveries are applied against the allowance for doubtful accounts. 

Advertising Expense  

The Company expenses marketing, promotions
and advertising costs as incurred. Such costs are included in selling expense in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated
statements of operations. 

Research and Development  

Costs incurred in connection with the development
of new products and processing methods are charged to general and administrative expenses as incurred. 

Income Taxes  

The Company utilizes FASB ASC 740,  Income
Taxes,  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of
events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities
are determined based on the difference between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts based
on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income.
A valuation allowance is recorded when it is  more likely-than-not  that a deferred tax asset will not be realized. 

The Company generated a deferred tax asset
through net operating loss carry-forward. However, a valuation allowance of 100% has been established due to the uncertainty of
the Company s realization of the net operating loss carry forward prior to its expiration. 

NomadChoice Pty Ltd, the Company s foreign
wholly-owned subsidiary, is subject to income taxes in the jurisdictions in which it operates. Significant judgment is required
in determining the provision for income tax. There are many transactions and calculations undertaken during the ordinary course
of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. The Company recognizes liabilities for anticipated tax audit
issues based on the Company s current understanding of the tax law. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different
from the carrying amounts, such differences will impact the current and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination
is made. 

Net Earnings (Loss) Per Common Share  

The Company computes earnings per share under
ASC subtopic 260-10, Earnings Per Share. Basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing the net income (loss) attributable
to the common stockholders (the numerator) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding (the denominator)
during the reporting periods. Diluted earnings per share is computed by increasing the denominator by the weighted average number
of additional shares that could have been outstanding from securities convertible into common stock (using the  treasury
stock  method), unless their effect on net loss per share is anti-dilutive. As of September 30, 2016, options to purchase
5,000,000 shares of common stock and warrants to purchase 9,132,002 shares of common stock were outstanding. These potential shares
were included in the shares used to calculate diluted earnings per share. 

Going Concern  

The Company s unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements are prepared using U.S. GAAP applicable to a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and
liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company had an accumulated deficit at September 30, 2016 of $2,721,289.
The Company had a working capital deficit of $2,487,840 as of September 30, 2016. Due to acquisitions during 2015 of revenue-producing
products, the Company believes it has established an ongoing source of revenue that is sufficient to cover its operating costs. 

Management s plans to continue as a going
concern include growing sales revenue on our existing brands, raising additional capital through borrowing and sales of common
stock. However, management cannot provide any assurances that the Company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans. 

The ability of the Company to continue as a
going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plans described in the preceding paragraph and eventually
secure other sources of financing and attain profitable operations. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as a going concern. 

Fair Value Measurements  

The Company measures and discloses the fair
value of assets and liabilities required to be carried at fair value in accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures.
ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and enhances fair value measurement disclosure. 

ASC 825 defines fair value as the price that
would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at
the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required or permitted to be recorded
at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and considers assumptions
that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions, and risk
of nonperformance. ASC 825 establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs
and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 825 establishes three levels of inputs that may be used
to measure fair value: 

Level 1 - Quoted prices for identical assets
or liabilities in active markets to which we have access at the measurement date. 

Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices within
Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. 

Level 3 - Unobservable inputs for the asset
or liability. 

The determination of where assets and liabilities
fall within this hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. 

As of September 30, 2016, the Company has determined
that there were no assets or liabilities measured at fair value, except for the warrant derivative liability. 

Inventory  

Inventory consists of raw materials, components
and finished goods. The Company s inventory is stated at the lower of cost (FIFO cost basis) or market. Finished goods include
the cost of labor to assemble the items. 

Stock-Based Compensation  

The Company adopted the provisions of ASC 718.
We estimate the fair value of stock options using a binomial model, consistent with the provisions of ASC 718 and SEC Staff Accounting
Bulletin No. 107, Share-Based Payment. Option-pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the
price volatility of the underlying stock. We determined that the use of implied volatility is expected to be more reflective of
market conditions and, therefore, could reasonably be expected to be a better indicator of our expected volatility than historical
volatility. The expected term assumption used in calculating the estimated fair value of our stock-based compensation awards using
the Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) model is based on detailed historical data about employees  exercise behavior, vesting schedules,
and death and disability probabilities. In addition, we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize
expense for those shares expected to vest. We estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical experience of our stock-based awards
that are granted, exercised and cancelled. We believe the resulting BSM calculation provides a more refined estimate of the fair
value of our employee stock options. 

Foreign Currency Translation  

The functional currency of one of the Company s
foreign subsidiaries (Nomadchoice Pty Ltd.) is the U.S. Dollar. The Company s foreign subsidiary maintains its records using
local currency (Australian Dollar). All monetary assets and liabilities of the foreign subsidiary were translated into U.S. Dollars
at quarter end exchange rates, non-monetary assets and liabilities of the foreign subsidiary were translated into U.S. Dollars
at transaction day exchange rates. Income and expense items related to non-monetary items were translated at exchange rates prevailing
during the transaction date and other incomes and expenses were translated using average exchange rate for the period. The resulting
translation adjustments, net of income taxes, were recorded in statements of operations as Remeasurement gain or loss on translation
of foreign subsidiary. 

The functional currency of the Company s
other foreign subsidiary (Synergy CHC Inc.) is the Canadian Dollar (CAD). The Company s foreign subsidiary maintains its
records using local currency (CAD). All assets and liabilities of the foreign subsidiary were translated into U.S. Dollars at period
end exchange rates and stockholders equity is translated at the historical rates. Income and expense items were translated
using average exchange rate for the period. The resulting translation adjustments, net of income taxes, are reported as other comprehensive
income and accumulated other comprehensive income in the stockholder s equity in accordance with ASC 220   Comprehensive
Income. 

Translation gains and losses that arise from
exchange rate fluctuations from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency are translated either
into Australian Dollars or Canadian Dollars, as the case may be, at the rate on the date of the transaction and included in the
results of operations as incurred. 

Concentrations of Credit Risk  

In the normal course of business, the Company
provides credit terms to its customers; however, collateral is not required. Accordingly, the Company performs credit evaluations
of its customers and maintains allowances for possible losses which, when realized, were within the range of management s
expectations. From time to time, a higher concentration of credit risk exists on outstanding accounts receivable for a select number
of customers due to individual buying patterns. 

Warehousing costs  

Warehouse costs include all third party warehouse
rent fees and any additional costs relating to assembly or special pack-outs of the Company s products are charged to general
and administrative expenses as incurred. 

Product display costs  

All displays manufactured and purchased by
the Company are for placement of product in retail stores. This also includes all costs for display execution and setup and retail
services are charged to general and administrative expenses as incurred. 

Warrant Derivative Liabilities  

ASC 815 generally provides three criteria that,
if met, require companies to bifurcate conversion options from their host instruments and account for them as free standing derivative
financial instruments. These three criteria include circumstances in which (a) the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded
derivative instrument are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract, (b) the
hybrid instrument that embodies both the embedded derivative instrument and the host contract is not re-measured at fair value
under otherwise applicable generally accepted accounting principles with changes in fair value reported in earnings as they occur
and (c) a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative instrument would be considered a derivative instrument
subject to the requirements of ASC 815. ASC 815 also provides an exception to this rule when the host instrument is deemed to be
conventional, as described. 

A Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model,
with dilution effects, was utilized to estimate the fair value of the Warrant Derivative Liabilities as of September 30, 2016.
This model is subject to the significant assumptions discussed below and requires the following key inputs with respect to the
Company and/or instrument: 

Cost of Sales  

Cost of sales includes the purchase cost of
products sold and all costs associated with getting the products into the retail stores including buying and transportation costs. 

Debt Issuance Costs  

Debt issuance costs
consist primarily of arrangement fees, professional fees and legal fees. These costs are netted off with the related loan and are
being amortized to interest expense over the term of the related debt facilities. 

Impairment of Long-Lived
Assets  

When facts and circumstances
indicate that the carrying values of long-lived assets, including fixed assets, may be impaired, an evaluation of recoverability
is performed by comparing the carrying value of the assets to projected future cash flows in addition to other quantitative and
qualitative analyses. Upon indication that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable, the Company recognizes an
impairment loss as a charge against current operations. Long-lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying
amount or fair value, less estimated costs to sell. The Company makes judgments related to the expected useful lives of long-lived
assets and its ability to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of such assets which are affected by
factors such as the ongoing maintenance and improvements of the assets, changes in economic conditions and changes in operating
performance. As the Company assesses the ongoing expected cash flows and carrying amounts of its long-lived assets, these factors
could cause the Company to realize a material impairment charge. 

Shipping Costs  

Shipping and handling
costs billed to customers are recorded in sales. Shipping costs incurred by the company are recorded in selling and marketing expenses. 

Related parties  

Parties are considered
to be related to the Company if the parties, directly or indirectly, through one or more intermediaries, control, are controlled
by, or are under common control with the Company. Related parties also include principal owners of the Company, its management,
members of the immediate families of principal owners of the Company and its management and other parties with which the Company
may deal if one party controls or can significantly influence the management or operating policies of the other to an extent that
one of the transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own separate interests. All transactions with related
parties shall be recorded at fair value of the goods or services exchanged. Property purchased from a related party is recorded
at the cost to the related party and any payment to or on behalf of the related party in excess of the cost is reflected as a distribution
to the related party. 

Segment Reporting  

Segment identification
and selection is consistent with the management structure used by the Company s chief operating decision maker to evaluate
performance and make decisions regarding resource allocation, as well as the materiality of financial results consistent with that
structure. Based on the Company s management structure and method of internal reporting, the Company has one operating segment.
The Company s chief operating decision maker does not review operating results on a disaggregated basis; rather, the chief
operating decision maker reviews operating results on an aggregate basis. 

Reclassification of Prior Period Presentation  

Certain reclassifications have been made to
conform the prior period data to the current presentations. These reclassifications had no effect on the reported results. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements  

ASU 2016-10 

In April 2016, the
FASB issued ASU 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing,
which provides further guidance on identifying performance obligations and improves the operability and understandability of licensing
implementation guidance. The effective date for ASU 2016-10 is the same as the effective date of ASU 2014-09 as amended by ASU
2015-14, for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those years. The Company
has not yet determined the impact of ASU 2016-10 on its consolidated financial statements. 

ASU 2016-09 

In March 2016, the
FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation   Stock Compensation, or ASU No. 2016-09. The areas for simplification in this
Update involve several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification
of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. For public entities, the amendments
in this Update are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods.
Early adoption is permitted in any interim or annual period. If an entity early adopts the amendments in an interim period, any
adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period. An entity that elects
early adoption must adopt all of the amendments in the same period. Amendments related to the timing of when excess tax benefits
are recognized, minimum statutory withholding requirements, forfeitures, and intrinsic value should be applied using a modified
retrospective transition method by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to equity as of the beginning of the period in which
the guidance is adopted. Amendments related to the presentation of employee taxes paid on the statement of cash flows when an employer
withholds shares to meet the minimum statutory withholding requirement should be applied retrospectively. Amendments requiring
recognition of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies in the income statement and the practical expedient for estimating expected
term should be applied prospectively. An entity may elect to apply the amendments related to the presentation of excess tax benefits
on the statement of cash flows using either a prospective transition method or a retrospective transition method. We are currently
evaluating the impact of adopting ASU No. 2016-09 on our consolidated financial statements. 

ASU 2016-08 

In March 2016, the
FASB issued ASU 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue
Gross versus Net) that clarifies how to apply revenue recognition guidance related to whether an entity is a principal or an agent.
ASU 2016-08 clarifies that the analysis must focus on whether the entity has control of the goods or services before they are transferred
to the customer and provides additional guidance about how to apply the control principle when services are provided and when goods
or services are combined with other goods or services. The effective date for ASU 2016-08 is the same as the effective date of
ASU 2014-09 as amended by ASU 2015-14, for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods
within those years. The Company has not yet determined the impact of ASU 2016-08 on its consolidated financial statements. 

ASU 2016-01 

In January 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-01, which amends the guidance in U.S. GAAP
on the classification and measurement of financial instruments. Changes to the current guidance primarily affect the accounting
for equity investments, financial liabilities under the fair value option, and the presentation and disclosure requirements for
financial instruments. In addition, the ASU clarifies guidance related to the valuation allowance assessment when recognizing deferred
tax assets resulting from unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities. The new standard is effective for fiscal years
and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and upon adoption, an entity should apply the amendments by means of a cumulative-effect
adjustment to the balance sheet at the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. Early adoption
is not permitted except for the provision to record fair value changes for financial liabilities under the fair value option resulting
from instrument-specific credit risk in other comprehensive income. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting
this guidance on its consolidated financial statements. 

ASU 2015-17 

In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17,
Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes. Currently deferred taxes for each tax jurisdiction are presented as a net current
asset or liability and net noncurrent asset or liability on the balance sheet. To simplify the presentation, the new guidance requires
that deferred tax liabilities and assets for all jurisdictions along with any related valuation allowances be classified as noncurrent
in a classified statement of financial position. This guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning
after December 15, 2016, and early adoption is permitted. The Company adopted this guidance in the fourth quarter of the year ended
December 31, 2015 on a retrospective basis. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company s
consolidated financial statements, and did not have any effect on prior periods due to the full valuation allowance against the
Company s net deferred tax assets. 

ASU 2015-16 

In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-16,
Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement Period Adjustments. Changes to the accounting for measurement-period adjustments
relate to business combinations. Currently, an acquiring entity is required to retrospectively adjust the balance sheet amounts
of the acquiree recognized at the acquisition date with a corresponding adjustment to goodwill as a result of changes made to the
balance sheet amounts of the acquiree. The measurement period is the period after the acquisition date during which the acquirer
may adjust the balance sheet amounts recognized for a business combination (generally up to one year from the date of acquisition).
The changes eliminate the requirement to make such retrospective adjustments, and, instead require the acquiring entity to record
these adjustments in the reporting period they are determined. The new standard is effective for both public and private companies
for periods beginning after December 15, 2015. Adoption of this new standard did not have any material on the Company s consolidated
financial statements. 

ASU 2015-14 

In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14,
Revenue From Contracts With Customers (Topic 606). The amendments in this ASU defer the effective date of ASU 2014-09. Public business
entities should apply the guidance in ASU 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim
reporting periods within that reporting period. Earlier application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning
after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. We are still evaluating the effect of
the adoption of ASU 2014-09 on our consolidated financial statements. 

ASU 2015-11 

In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11,
Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory (Topic 330). ASU 2015-11 simplifies the accounting for the valuation of all inventory
not accounted for using the last-in, first-out ( LIFO ) method by prescribing that inventory be valued at the lower
of cost and net realizable value. ASU 2015-11 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years, and interim periods
within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016 on a prospective basis. We do not expect the adoption of ASU 2015-11
to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. 

ASU 2015-05 

In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-05,
Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40). ASU 2015-05 provides guidance regarding the accounting
for a customer s fees paid in a cloud computing arrangement; specifically about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes
a software license, and if so, how to account for the software license. ASU 2015-05 is effective for public companies  annual
periods, including interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015 on either a prospective or retrospective
basis. Early adoption is permitted. Adoption of this new standard did not have any impact on the Company s consolidated financial
statements. 

ASU 2015-07 

In May 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-07,
Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or
Its Equivalent) ( ASU 2015-07 ). This guidance eliminates the requirement to categorize investments within the fair
value hierarchy if their fair value is measured using the net asset value ( NAV ) per share practical expedient in
the FASB s fair value measurement guidance. The new standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those
fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. Adoption of this new standard did not have any impact on the Company s consolidated
financial statements. 

ASU 2015-03 

In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03,
Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs. The amendments in this
ASU require that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction
from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt
issuance costs are not affected by the amendments in this ASU. The amendments are effective for financial statements issued for
fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. The amendments are to be applied
on a retrospective basis, wherein the balance sheet of each individual period presented is adjusted to reflect the period-specific
effects of applying the new guidance. The Company reclassified debt issuance cost of $208,569 and $378,852 from other assets to
liabilities and netted off with the related loans in the liabilities as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 

ASU 2015-02 

In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02,
Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis, which is intended to improve targeted areas of consolidation
guidance for legal entities such as limited partnerships, limited liability corporations, and securitization structures (collateralized
debt obligations, collateralized loan obligations, and mortgage-backed security transactions). The ASU focuses on the consolidation
evaluation for reporting organizations that are required to evaluate whether they should consolidate certain legal entities. In
addition to reducing the number of consolidation models from four to two, the new standard simplifies the FASB Accounting Standards
Codification and improves current U.S. GAAP by placing more emphasis on risk of loss when determining a controlling financial interest,
reducing the frequency of the application of related-party guidance when determining a controlling financial interest in a variable
interest entity ( VIE ), and changing consolidation conclusions for companies in several industries that typically
make use of limited partnerships or VIEs. The ASU will be effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years,
beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. Adoption of this new standard
did not have any impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 

ASU 2015-01 

In January 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-01,
Income Statement - Extraordinary and Unusual Items (Subtopic 225-20): Simplifying Income Statement Presentation by Eliminating
the Concept of Extraordinary Items. This ASU eliminates from U.S. GAAP the concept of extraordinary items. ASU 2015-01 is effective
for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. A reporting entity may apply
the amendments prospectively. Adoption of this new standard did not have any impact on the Company s consolidated financial
statements. 

ASU 2014-17 

In November 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-17,
Business Combinations (Topic 805): Pushdown Accounting. This ASU provides an acquired entity with an option to apply pushdown accounting
in its separate financial statements upon occurrence of an event in which an acquirer obtains control of the acquired entity. An
acquired entity may elect the option to apply pushdown accounting in the reporting period in which the change-in-control event
occurs. If pushdown accounting is applied to an individual change-in-control event, that election is irrevocable. ASU 2014-17 was
effective on November 18, 2014. The adoption of ASU 2014-17 did not have any effect on our consolidated financial statements. 

ASU 2014-16 

In November 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-16,
Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815). ASU 2014-16 addresses whether the host contract in a hybrid financial instrument issued in
the form of a share should be accounted for as debt or equity. ASU 2014-16 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within
those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. We have not previously issued and do not currently have issued, nor were
we or are we investors in, hybrid financial instruments. Accordingly, we do not expect the adoption of ASU 2014-16 to have any
effect on our consolidated financial statements. 

ASU 2014-15 

In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15,
Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40). ASU 2014-15 provides guidance related to management s
responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern and
to provide related footnote disclosure. ASU 2014-15 is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016, and for interim
and annual periods thereafter. Early application is permitted. We do not expect the adoption of ASU 2014-15 to have a material
effect on our consolidated financial statements. 

ASU 2014-12 

In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-12,
Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That
a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period. This ASU requires that a performance target that affects
vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition. ASU 2014-12 is effective
for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. Adoption of this new standard
did not have any impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 

ASU 2014-09 

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,
Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). ASU 2014-09 affects any entity using U.S. GAAP that either enters into contracts
with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets unless those contracts
are within the scope of other standards (e.g., insurance contracts or lease contracts). ASU 2014-09 is effective for fiscal years,
and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14,
which defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year for all entities and permits early adoption on a limited basis. ASU
2014-09 will be effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2018, and early adoption permitted in the first quarter of 2017.
We are still evaluating the effect of the adoption of ASU 2014-09 on our consolidated financial statements. 

ASU 2014-08 

In April 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-08,
Presentation of Financial Statements (Topic 205) and Property, Plant, and Equipment (Topic 360) and Reporting Discontinued Operations
and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity. ASU 2014-08 amends the definition for what types of asset disposals are
to be considered discontinued operations, as well as amending the required disclosures for discontinued operations and assets held
for sale. ASU 2014-08 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning on or after December
15, 2014. The adoption of ASU 2014-08 did not have any effect on our consolidated financial statements. 

There were various updates recently issued,
most of which represented technical corrections to the accounting literature or application to specific industries and are not
expected to a have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE
AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK  

As a  smaller reporting
company  as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, we are not required to provide the information required by this item. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND
PROCEDURES  

Evaluation of Disclosure
Controls and Procedures  

Our Chief Executive Officer
(principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (principal financial officer) reviewed the effectiveness of our disclosure
controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report and concluded that as of September 30, 2016, (i) the
Company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective to ensure that material information relating to the Company
is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and
Exchange Commission (the  Commission ), and (ii) the Company s controls and procedures have not been designed
to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its principal executive
and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure. 

Changes in Internal
Controls Over Financial Reporting  

There were no changes
in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with our evaluation of these controls as of the fiscal
quarter covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control
over financial reporting. 

Inherent Limitations
on Effectiveness of Controls  

The Company s management
does not expect that its disclosure controls or its internal control over financial reporting, when and if effective, will prevent
or detect all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not
absolute, assurance that the control system s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact
that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because
of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements
due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.
These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur
because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two
or more people, or management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions
about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals
under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration
in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. 

PART II   OTHER INFORMATION  

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  

From time to time, we may
become involved in various lawsuits and legal proceedings, which arise, in the ordinary course of business. However, litigation
is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time to time that may harm
our business. We are currently not aware of any such legal proceedings or claims that we believe will have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial condition or operating results. 

ITEM 1A.   RISK
FACTORS  

As a  smaller reporting
company  as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, we are not required to provide information required by this Item.

to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.
