Forward-Looking Statements  

This Quarterly Report contains  forward-looking
statements  within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, and
Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. The forward-looking statements are only
predictions and provide our current expectations or forecasts of future events and financial performance and may be identified
by the use of forward-looking terminology, including the terms  believes,   estimates,   anticipates, 
 expects,   plans,   intends,   may,   will  or  should 
or, in each case, their negative, or other variations or comparable terminology, though the absence of these words does not necessarily
mean that a statement is not forward-looking. Forward-looking statements include all matters that are not historical facts and

the risk that changes in the national or international political and
regulatory environment may make it more difficult to gain FDA or other regulatory approval of our drug product candidates;    

risks that the FDA or other regulatory authorities may not accept
any applications we file;    

risks that the FDA or other regulatory authorities may withhold or
delay consideration of any applications that we file or limit such applications to particular indications or apply other label
limitations;    

risks that, after acceptance and review of applications that we file,
the FDA or other regulatory authorities will not approve the marketing and sale of our drug product candidates;    

risks relating to our drug manufacturing operations, including those
of our third-party suppliers and contract manufacturers;    

risks relating to the ability of our development partners and third-party

1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS  

Arno Therapeutics, Inc. ( Arno 
or the  Company ) is developing innovative drug candidates intended to treat patients with cancer and other life threatening
diseases. The Company was incorporated in Delaware in March 2000, at which time its name was Laurier International, Inc. ( Laurier ).
Pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated March 6, 2008 (as amended, the  Merger Agreement ), by and among
the Company, Arno Therapeutics, Inc., a Delaware corporation formed on August 1, 2005 ( Old Arno ), and Laurier Acquisition,
Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company ( Laurier Acquisition ), on June 3, 2008, Laurier
Acquisition merged with and into Old Arno, with Old Arno remaining as the surviving corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Laurier. Immediately following this merger, Old Arno merged with and into Laurier and Laurier s name was changed to Arno
Therapeutics, Inc. These two merger transactions are hereinafter collectively referred to as the  Merger.  Immediately
following the Merger, the former stockholders of Old Arno collectively held 95% of the outstanding common stock of Laurier, assuming
the issuance of all shares issuable upon the exercise of outstanding options and warrants, and all of the officers and directors
of Old Arno in office immediately prior to the Merger were appointed as the officers and directors of Laurier immediately following
the Merger. Further, Laurier was a non-operating shell company prior to the Merger. The merger of a private operating company into
a non-operating public shell corporation with nominal net assets is considered to be a capital transaction in substance, rather
than a business combination, for accounting purposes. Accordingly, the Company treated this transaction as a capital transaction
without recording goodwill or adjusting any of its other assets or liabilities. All costs incurred in connection with the Merger
have been expensed. Upon completion of the Merger, the Company adopted Old Arno s business plan. 

2. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES  

The Company has not yet generated any revenue
from the sale of products and, through September 30, 2016, its efforts have been principally devoted to developing its licensed
technologies and raising capital. The Company has experienced negative cash flows from operating activities since its inception
and has an accumulated deficit of approximately $103.0 million at September 30, 2016. The Company expects to incur substantial
and increasing losses and to have negative net cash flows from operating activities as it enhances its technology portfolio and
engages in further research and development activities, particularly from conducting clinical trials, manufacturing activities
and pre-clinical studies.  

The accompanying unaudited Condensed Financial
Statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information and
with the instructions to Form 10-Q adopted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Accordingly, they do not include
all of the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America for complete
financial statements. In the opinion of Arno s management, the accompanying Condensed Financial Statements contain all adjustments
(consisting of normal recurring accruals and adjustments) necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations
and cash flows of the Company at the dates and for the periods indicated. The interim results for the periods ended September 30,
2016 are not necessarily indicative of results for the full 2016 fiscal year or any other future interim periods. 

These unaudited Condensed Financial Statements
have been prepared by management and should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in
the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, as filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. 

The preparation of financial statements
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires that management make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Estimates and assumptions principally
relate to services performed by third parties but not yet invoiced, estimates of the fair value and forfeiture rates of stock options
issued to employees and consultants, and estimates of the probability in the fair value of derivative liabilities. Actual results
could differ from those estimates. 

Research and Development  

Research and development costs are charged
to expense as incurred. Research and development includes employee costs, fees associated with operational consultants, contract
clinical research organizations, contract manufacturing organizations, clinical site fees, contract laboratory research organizations,
contract central testing laboratories, licensing activities, and allocated office, insurance, depreciation, and facilities expenses.
The Company accrues for costs incurred as the services are being provided by monitoring the status of the study and the invoices
received from its external service providers. The Company adjusts its accruals when actual costs become known. Costs related to
the acquisition of technology rights for which development work is still in process are charged to operations as incurred and considered
a component of research and development expense. 

8  

Warrant Liability  

The Company accounts for the warrants issued
in connection with the 2013, 2012 and 2010 Purchase Agreements (see Note 8) in accordance with the guidance on Accounting for Certain
Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity, which provides that the Company classify the warrant
instrument as a liability at its fair value and adjusts the instrument to fair value at each reporting period. This liability is
subject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date until exercised, and any change in fair value is recognized as a component
of other income or expense. The fair value of warrants issued by the Company, in connection with private placements of securities,
has been estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation model and, in doing so, the Company s management utilized a third-party
valuation report. The Monte Carlo simulation is a generally accepted statistical method used to generate a defined number of stock
price paths in order to develop a reasonable estimate of the range of the Company s future expected stock prices and minimizes
standard error. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements  

In January 2016, the Financial Accounting
Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-01,  Financial Instruments  ( ASU
2016-01 ). Equity investments not accounted for under the equity method of accounting will be measured at fair value, with
changes in fair value recognized in current earnings. ASU 2016-01 becomes effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2017. Early adoption is permitted provided that the guidance is applied from the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The
Company does not believe the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on its financial statements, results of operations
or related financial statement disclosures. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting
Standards Update No. 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842)  ( ASU 2016-02 ). Leasees will need to recognize virtually
all of their leases on the balance sheet, by recording a right-of-use asset and lease liability. ASU 2016-02 becomes effective
for the Company on January 1, 2019, and early adoption is permitted upon issuance. The Company is evaluating the potential impact
of adopting this standard on its financial statements. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued two updates
to Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815). Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-05,  Effect of Derivative Contract Novations
on Existing Hedge Accounting Relationships  ( ASU 2016-05 ). ASU 2016-05 clarifies that a change in the counterparty
to a derivative instrument that has been designated as a hedging instrument does not, on its own, require dedesignation of that
hedge accounting relationship provided that all other hedge accounting criteria continue to be met. Accounting Standards Update
No. 2016-06,  Contingent Put and Call Options in Debt Instruments  ( ASU 2016-06 ). ASU 2016-06 clarifies
that an entity is required to assess the embedded call or put option solely in accordance with a specific four-step decision sequence
and are not also required to assess whether the contingency for exercising the option is indexed to interest rate or credit risk.
ASU 2016-05 and ASU 2016-06 will take effect for public companies in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including
interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company does not believe the requirements of these updates will have a material
effect in the presentation of its financial statements. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued an update
to Compensation- Stock Compensation (Topic 718). Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09,  Improvements to Employee Share-Based
Payment Accounting  ( ASU 2016-09 ). ASU 2016-09 identifies areas for simplification involving several aspects
of accounting for stock-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity
or liabilities, an option to recognize gross stock compensation expense with actual forfeitures recognized as they occur, as well
as certain classifications on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective for reporting periods beginning after December
31, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating the potential impact of adopting this standard on its financial
statements. 

In August 2016, the FASB issued an update
to Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230). Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-15,  Classification of Certain Cash Receipts
and Cash Payments  ( ASU 2016-15 ). ASU 2016-15 provides guidance in the presentation and classification of eight
specific cash flow issues in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 will take effect for public companies in fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating
the potential impact of adopting this standard on its financial statements. 

3. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  

Cash resources as of September 30,
2016 were approximately $2.1 million, compared to approximately $0.1 million as of December 31, 2015. Based on resources at
September 30, 2016 and the current plan of expenditure for continuing the development of the Company s current product,
the Company believes that its existing capital resources, including the $3.0 million of proceeds received, or that will be
received, from our August 2016 Purchase Agreement, are only sufficient to fund its operations into January 2017. The Company
is therefore in immediate need of additional capital to fund its continuing operations beyond such period. Further, the
Company will need substantial additional capital in order to complete the development and obtain regulatory approval of
its product candidates, if ever. The Company depends on its ability to raise additional funds through various potential
sources, such as equity and debt financing, or from a transaction in which it would license rights to its product
candidates to another pharmaceutical company. The Company will continue to fund operations from cash on hand and through
sources of capital similar to those previously described. The Company cannot assure that it will be able to secure such
additional financing, or if available, that it will be sufficient to meet its needs. 

9  

The long-term success of the Company depends
on its ability to develop new products to the point of regulatory approval and subsequent revenue generation and, accordingly,
to raise enough capital to finance these developmental efforts. Management plans to raise additional capital either by selling
shares of its stock or other securities, issuing additional indebtedness or by licensing the rights to one or more of its product
candidates to finance the continued operating and capital requirements of the Company. Amounts raised will be used to further develop
the Company s product candidates, acquire rights to additional product candidates and for other working capital purposes.
While the Company will extend its best efforts to raise additional capital to fund all operations into January, 2017 and beyond,
management can provide no assurances that the Company will be successful in raising sufficient funds. If the Company is not successful,
it may be required to discontinue its operations. 

In addition, to the extent that the Company
raises additional funds by issuing shares of its common stock or other securities convertible or exchangeable for shares of common
stock, stockholders will experience dilution, which may be significant. In the event the Company raises additional capital through
debt financings, the Company may incur significant interest expense and become subject to covenants in the related transaction
documentation that may affect the manner in which the Company conducts its business. To the extent that the Company raises additional
funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements, it may be necessary to relinquish some rights to its technologies or product
candidates, or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to the Company. Any or all of the foregoing may have a material
adverse effect on the Company s business and financial performance. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern. The Company s financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which
contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. The
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the in ability of the Company to continue as a going
concern. 

4. BASIC AND DILUTED INCOME/(LOSS) PER SHARE  

Basic net loss per share is calculated by
dividing the loss available to common shareholders by weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the
period. Diluted net loss per share is calculated similarly to basic loss per share except that the denominator is based on the
weighted-average number of shares of common stock and other dilutive securities outstanding during the period. The potential dilutive
shares of common stock resulting from the assumed exercise of stock options and warrants are determined under the treasury stock
method. 

As of September 30, 2016 and 2015, potentially
dilutive securities include: 

For all periods presented, potentially dilutive
securities are excluded from the computation of fully diluted net loss per share as their effect is anti-dilutive. In addition
to the potentially dilutive securities, the aggregate number of common equivalent shares (related to options and warrants) that
have been excluded from the computations of diluted loss per common share at September 30, 2016 and 2015 were 56,585,279 and 30,707,113,
respectively, as their exercise prices are greater than the fair market price per common share as of September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively. 

5. INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY  

License Agreements  

Onapristone License Agreement   

The Company s rights to onapristone
are governed by a license agreement with Invivis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ( Invivis ), dated February 13, 2012. Under
this agreement, the Company holds an exclusive, royalty-bearing license for the rights to commercialize onapristone for all therapeutic
uses. The license agreement provides the Company with worldwide rights to develop and commercialize onapristone with the exception
of the commercialization rights in France; provided that the Company has an option to acquire French commercial rights from Invivis
upon notice to Invivis together with additional consideration. 

The onapristone license agreement provides
the Company with exclusive, worldwide rights to a United States provisional patent application that relates to assays for predictive
biomarkers for anti-progestin efficacy. The Company intends to expand its patent portfolio by filing additional patent applications
covering the use of onapristone, the manufacture of onapristone and/or a companion diagnostic product. If the pending patent application
issues, the issued patent would be scheduled to expire in 2031. 

10  

The Company made a one-time cash payment
of $500,000 to Invivis upon execution of the license agreement on February 13, 2012. Additionally, Invivis will receive performance-based
cash payments of up to an aggregate of $15.1 million upon successful completion of clinical and regulatory milestones relating
to onapristone, which milestones include the marketing approval of onapristone in multiple indications in the United States or
the European Union as well as Japan. The first milestone was due upon the dosing of the first patient in a pharmacokinetic study
and was achieved during August 2013 and the Company made a $150,000 payment to Invivis during October 2013. The Company made its
next milestone payment of $100,000 to Invivis upon the dosing of the first subject in the first Company-sponsored Phase I clinical
trial of onapristone in January 2014. A milestone payment of $350,000 for the enrollment of the first patient in a Phase II clinical
trial sponsored by Arno was paid in July 2015. In addition, the Company will pay Invivis low single digit sales royalties based
on net sales of onapristone by the Company or any of its sublicensees. Pursuant to a separate services agreement which expired
in April 2014, Invivis provided the Company with certain clinical development support services, which includes the assignment of
up to two full-time employees to perform such services, in exchange for a monthly cash payment of approximately $70,833. Effective
April 1, 2014, the Company renewed the services agreement for a period of one year for a monthly cash payment of $50,000 and certain
other performance based milestones. The services agreement was not renewed upon its expiration on April 1, 2015. 

Under the license agreement with Invivis,
the Company also agreed to indemnify and hold Invivis and its affiliates harmless from any and all claims arising out of or in
connection with the production, manufacture, sale, use, lease, consumption or advertisement of onapristone, provided, however,
that the Company shall have no obligation to indemnify Invivis for claims that (a) any patent rights infringe third party intellectual
property, (b) arise out of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Invivis, or (c) result from a breach of any representation,
warranty confidentiality obligation of Invivis under the license agreement. The license agreement will terminate upon the later
of (i) the last to expire valid claim contained in the patent rights, and (ii) February 13, 2032. In general, Invivis may terminate
the license agreement at any time upon a material breach by the Company to the extent the Company fails to cure any such breach
within 90 days after receiving notice of such breach or in the event the Company files for bankruptcy. The Company may terminate
the agreement for any reason upon 90 days  prior written notice. 

University of Minnesota License   

In February 2014, we entered into an Exclusive
Patent License Agreement with the Regents of the University of Minnesota, or  UM , pursuant to which we were granted
an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license for the rights to develop and commercialize technology embodied by certain patent
applications relating to a gene expression signature derived from archived breast cancer tissue samples. We plan to develop and
commercialize this technology as part of our companion diagnostic development program as a tool to identify progesterone-stimulated
pathway activation, which in turn may identify patients who would be more likely to benefit from treatment with onapristone. 

The license agreement requires us to use
commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize the licensed technology as soon as practicable, and includes several performance
milestones relating to the development and commercialization of the technology to be achieved by us at specified dates. Under the
terms of the agreement, we made a small one-time cash payment and reimbursed UM for past patent expenses it has incurred. The agreement
also provides that we will pay royalties to UM on net sales of  Licensed Products  (as defined in the agreement) at
a rate in the low-single digits, which royalty obligation terminates on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country
basis upon the first date when there is no longer a valid claim under a licensed patent or patent application covering such licensed
product in the country where the licensed product is made or sold. 

The term of the license agreement continues
until the last date on which there is any active licensed patent or pending patent application. UM may terminate the agreement
earlier upon a breach by us of one or more of our obligations that remains uncured for a period specified in the agreement. UM
may also terminate the agreement if we voluntarily file for bankruptcy or similar proceeding, or if a petition for an involuntary
bankruptcy proceeding is filed and is not released for 60 days. The agreement may be immediately terminated upon notice to us if
we commence or maintain a proceeding in which we assert that the licensed patents are invalid or unenforceable. We may terminate
the agreement at any time and for any reason upon 90 days  written notice. 

The license agreement further provides that
we will indemnify and hold UM and its affiliates harmless from any and all suits, actions, claims, liabilities, demands, damages,
losses or expenses relating to our exercise of its rights under the agreement, including our right to commercialize the licensed
technology. UM is required to indemnify us with respect to claims relating to or resulting from its breach of the agreement. 

AR-12 and AR-42 License Agreements   

The Company s rights to both AR-12
and AR-42 are governed by separate license agreements with The Ohio State University Research Foundation ( Ohio State )
entered into in January 2008. Pursuant to each of these agreements, Ohio State granted the Company exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing
licenses to commercialize certain patent applications, know-how and improvements relating to AR-12 and AR-42 for all therapeutic
uses. 

11  

Under our license agreement for AR-12, we
have exclusive, worldwide rights to seven issued U.S. patent and three pending U.S. patent applications that relate to AR-12, AR-12
analogs, and particular uses of AR-12 according to our business plan. On July 9, 2015, the Company and The Ohio State Innovation
Foundation (formerly, The Ohio State Research Foundation) ( Ohio State ) entered into an amendment, dated effective
as of May 15, 2015 (the  Amendment ), to the parties  License Agreement dated January 3, 2008 (the  AR-12
License ), pursuant to which the Company was granted an exclusive license to certain patents and other technology relating
to its AR-12 product candidate. The purpose of the Amendment was to clarify the scope of AR-12 analogs covered by the license grant
in the original AR-12 License. In addition, the Amendment provides the Company with a first option to an exclusive license to patents
and other technology relating to compounds related to AR-12 held by Ohio State. The issued patents include composition of matter
claims. The issued patents are currently scheduled to expire in 2024. If the pending patent applications issue, the latest of the
issued patent or patents would be scheduled to expire in 2034. In 2014, we filed a provisional patent application directed to methods
using AR-12 that, if issued, would expire in 2035. In addition, Arno has exclusive rights to a pending US and international patent
application directed to AR-12 formulations which, if issued, would expire in 2034. 

Under our license agreement for AR-42, we
have exclusive, worldwide rights to one issued and two pending U.S. patent applications that relate to AR-42 and particular uses
of AR-42 according to our business plan. If one of the pending patent applications issues, the issued patent or patents would be
scheduled to expire in 2024. If the other pending patent application issues, it would be scheduled to expire in 2034. 

In 2008, pursuant to our license agreements
for AR-12 and AR-42, we made one-time cash payments to Ohio State in the aggregate amount of $450,000 and reimbursed it for past
patent expenses. Additionally, we are required to make performance-based cash payments upon successful completion of clinical and
regulatory milestones relating to AR-12 and AR-42 in the U.S., Europe and Japan. The license agreements for AR-12 and AR-42 provide
for aggregate potential milestone payments of up to $6.1 million for AR-12, of which $5.0 million is due only after marketing approval
in the United States, Europe and Japan, and $5.1 million for AR-42, of which $4.0 million is due only after marketing approval
in the United States, Europe and Japan. In September 2009, we paid Ohio State a milestone payment upon the commencement of the
Phase I clinical study of AR-12. Pursuant to the license agreements for AR-12 and AR- 42, we must pay Ohio State royalties on net
sales of licensed products at rates in the low-single digits. To the extent we enter into a sublicensing agreement relating to
either or both of AR-12 or AR-42, we will be required to pay Ohio State a portion of all non-royalty income received from such
sublicensee. 

The license agreements with Ohio State further
provide that we will indemnify Ohio State from any and all claims arising out of the death of or injury to any person or persons
or out of any damage to property, or resulting from the production, manufacture, sale, use, lease, consumption or advertisement
of either AR-12 or AR-42, except to the extent that any such claim arises out of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of
Ohio State. The license agreements for AR-12 and AR-42, respectively, expire on the later of (i) the expiration of the last valid
claim contained in any licensed patent and (ii) 20 years after the effective date of the license. Ohio State will generally be
able to terminate either license upon our breach of the terms of the license the extent we fail to cure any such breach within
90 days after receiving notice of such breach or our bankruptcy. We may terminate either license upon 90 days  prior written
notice. 

AR-67 License Agreement   

During the nine months ended September
30, 2016, the Company sold to a third party for approximately $500,000 the Company s research data related to AR-67, a
product candidate the development of which was halted by the Company and the license to which was terminated in 2012. The
proceeds from the sale have been recorded as a component of other income in the condensed statement of operations. 

6. CONVERTIBLE NOTES PAYABLE  

On October 21, 2015, the Company issued
a series of 6% convertible promissory notes (the  6% Notes ) in the aggregate principal amount of $2,100,000 with an
original maturity date of October 21, 2016. The 6% Notes provided for automatic conversion into shares of the Company s equity
securities upon the closing of a  qualified financing,  defined as one in which the Company received cumulative gross
proceeds of at least $3,500,000 (including the $2,100,000 of proceeds from the sale of the 6% Notes) through the issuance of shares
of its equity securities, either alone or as part of units with other equity or equity-linked securities of the Company, at a conversion
price equal to the price paid by investor for such equity securities in the qualified financing. The Company incurred $12,528 of
issuance costs related to the 6% Notes. 

On January 12, 2016, in
connection with the Company s entry into the  January 2016 Purchase Agreement (See Note 8) the $2,100,000 principal
balance and accrued interest of $28,652 under the 6% Notes was converted into 6,081,858 shares of the Company s common
stock at a per share price of $0.35 per share. In addition the remaining unamortized issuance costs of $10,091 was
expensed. 

7. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS  

The Company defines fair value as the amount
at which an asset (or liability) could be bought (or incurred) or sold (or settled) in a current transaction between willing parties,
that is, other than in a forced or liquidation sale. The fair value estimates presented in the table below are based on information
available to the Company as of September 30, 2016. 

The accounting standard regarding fair value
measurements discusses valuation techniques, such as the market approach (comparable market prices), the income approach (present
value of future income or cash flow), and the cost approach (cost to replace the service capacity of an asset or replacement cost).
The standard utilizes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into
three broad levels. The following is a brief description of those three levels: 

Level 1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices (unadjusted) in active
markets for identical assets or liabilities.    

Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the
asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. These include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets
and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active.    

12  

Level 3: Unobservable inputs that reflect the reporting entity s
own assumptions.    

The Company has determined the fair value
of certain liabilities using the market approach. The following table presents the Company s fair value hierarchy for these
liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2016: 

The following table presents the Company s
fair value hierarchy for these liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2015: 

13  

The following table provides a summary of
changes in fair value of the Company s liabilities, as well as the portion of losses included in income attributable to unrealized
depreciation that relate to those liabilities held at September 30, 2016:

8. STOCKHOLDERS  EQUITY  

Common Stock  

As of September 30, 2016, the Company had
47,849,036 shares of common stock issued and outstanding and approximately 68,338,022 shares of common stock reserved for issuance
upon the exercise of outstanding options and warrants. 

On January 12, 2016, the Company entered
into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the  January 2016 Purchase Agreement ) with certain purchasers identified therein
(the  Purchasers ) pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell, and the Purchasers agreed to purchase, an aggregate
of 21,153,997 shares of the Company s common stock at a purchase price of $0.35 per share for an aggregate gross proceeds
of approximately $7.4 million, including $2,128,652 from the automatic conversion of the outstanding principal and accrued and
unpaid interest under the 6% Notes. An aggregate of 6,081,858 shares were sold under the January 2016 Purchase Agreement pursuant
to the conversion of the 6% Notes sold pursuant to the January 2016 Purchase Agreement. 

On August 15, 2016, the
Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the  August 2016 Purchase Agreement ) with certain
purchasers pursuant to which it agreed to issue and sell in a private placement 8,501,421 units of its securities at a price
of $0.35 per unit, with each unit consisting of one share of common stock and a five-year Series F Common Stock Purchase
Warrant to purchase one-half share (rounded to the nearest whole share) of common stock at an exercise price of $0.4375 per
share (the  Series F Warrants ). On August 15 the Company closed on the sale of 6,286,423 units for proceeds
of approximately $2.2 million and on October 4, 2016 the Company closed on the sale of 285,714 units for an additional
$100,000 in proceeds. In connection with the October closing the Company received $150,000 of the proceeds prior to September
30, 2016 and has recorded the proceeds as a stock subscription as of September 30, 2016. The closing on the sale of the
remaining 1,929,284 units, which will result in additional gross proceeds to us of approximately $675,250, is subject to
the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including the effectiveness of a registration statement under the
Securities Act covering the resale of the shares and warrant shares sold pursuant to the purchase agreement. The Company
filed a registration statement covering such shares on October 12, 2016 and it was declared effective by the Securities and
Exchange Commission on November 3, 2016. On November 4, 2016, the Company closed on 1,214,999 units, which resulted in
additional gross proceeds to the Company of approximately $425,250. There are 714,285 units ($250,000 in proceeds) subject to
the August 2016 Purchase Agreement that remain to be closed upon. 

14  

Warrants  

In accordance with the 2010 sale and issuance
of Series A preferred stock, the Company issued two-and-one-half-year  Class A  warrants to purchase an aggregate of
152,740 shares of Series A Preferred Stock at an initial exercise price of $8.00 per share (the  2010 Class A Warrants )
and five-year Class B warrants to purchase an aggregate of 801,885 shares of Series A Preferred Stock at an initial exercise price
of $9.20 per share (the  2010 Class B Warrants,  and together with the 2010 Class A Warrants, the  2010 Warrants ).
Upon the automatic conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock in January 2011, the 2010 Warrants automatically converted to the
right to purchase an equal number of shares of common stock. The terms of the warrants contain an anti-dilutive price adjustment
provision, such that, in the event the Company issues common shares at a price below the current exercise price of the 2010 Warrants,
the exercise price will be decreased pursuant to a customary  weighted-average  formula. In accordance with this provision
and as a result of the issuances made pursuant to the 2012 Purchase Agreement and 2013 Purchase Agreement, the exercise price of
the 2010 Class B warrants has been adjusted to $3.55 per share. Because of this anti-dilution provision and the inherent uncertainty
as to the probability of future common share issuances, the Black-Scholes option pricing model the Company uses for valuing stock
options could not be used.  Management used a Monte Carlo simulation model and, in doing so, utilized a third-party valuation
report to determine the warrant liability to be approximately $0.0 million at December 31, 2015. The Monte Carlo simulation is
a generally accepted statistical method used to generate a defined number of stock price paths in order to develop a reasonable
estimate of the range of the Company s future expected stock prices and minimizes standard error. This valuation is revised
on a quarterly basis until the warrants are exercised or they expire, with the changes in fair value recorded in other income (expense)
on the statement of operations. The 2010 Class A warrants, representing the right to purchase an aggregate of 152,740 shares of
common stock, expired unexercised during the year ended December 31, 2013, and the Class B warrants, representing the right to
purchase an aggregate of 801,885 shares of common stock, expired unexercised during September 2015. 

Pursuant to the 2012 Purchase
Agreement for the sale and issuance of 8% Senior Convertible Debentures, the Company issued five-year Series A Common Stock
Purchase Warrants (The  Series A Warrants ) to purchase an aggregate of approximately 6,190,500 shares of
common stock at an initial exercise price of $4.00 per share and 18-month Series B  Common Stock Purchase Warrants (The
 Series B Warrants  and together with the Series A Warrant, the  2012 Warrants ) to purchase an
aggregate of approximately 6,190,500 shares of common stock at an initial exercise price of $2.40 per share. The terms of the
2012 Warrants contain a  full-ratchet  anti-dilutive price adjustment provision. In accordance with such
full-ratchet anti-dilution provision, in the event that the Company sells or issues additional shares of common stock,
including securities convertible or exchangeable for common stock (subject to customary exceptions), at a per share price
less than the applicable 2012 Warrant exercise price, such warrant exercise price will be reduced to an amount equal to the
issuance price of such subsequently issued shares; after such time as the Company has raised at least $12 million in
additional equity financing, the 2012 Warrants are subject to further anti-dilution protection based on a weighted-average
formula. Further, the anti-dilution provisions of the 2012 Warrants provide that, in addition to a reduction in the
applicable exercise price, the number of shares purchasable thereunder is increased such that the aggregate exercise price of
the warrants (exercise price per share multiplied by total number of shares underlying the warrants) remained unchanged. In
accordance with the terms of this anti-dilution provision and as a result of the Company s issuances under the 2013
Purchase Agreement, the exercise price of the Series A Warrants was reduced to $2.40 per share and the aggregate number of
shares underlying such warrants was increased to 10,317,464 shares. Further in accordance with the terms of this
anti-dilution provision and as a result of the Company s issuances under the 2016 Purchase Agreement, the exercise
price of the Series A Warrants was reduced to $1.36 per share and the aggregate number of shares underlying such warrants was
increased to 18,207,273 shares. In August, 2016 further in accordance with the terms of this anti-dilution provision and as a
result of the Company s issuances under the 2016 Securities Agreement, the exercise price of the Series A Warrants was
reduced to $1.18 per share and the aggregate number of shares underlying such warrants was increased to 21,009,562 shares.
The 2012 Warrants also contain a provision that may require the Company to repurchase such warrants from their holders in
connection with a sale of the Company or similar transactions. As a result of such anti-dilution and repurchase provisions,
the Company is required to record the fair value of the 2012 Warrants as a liability on the accompanying balance sheet.
Because of this anti-dilution provision and the inherent uncertainty as to the probability of future common share issuances,
the Black-Scholes option pricing model the Company uses for valuing stock options could not be used.  Management
used a Monte Carlo simulation model and, in doing so, utilized a third-party valuation report to determine the warrant
liability to be approximately $2.1 million and $1.8 million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The
Debentures were converted to common stock in 2013. At the time of the conversion of the Debentures, the expiration date of
the Series B Warrants was extended to October 31, 2014, and was thereafter further extended to January 31, 2015. The
Series B warrants, representing the right to purchase an aggregate of approximately 6,190,500 shares of common stock,
expired unexercised on January 31, 2015. 

In connection with the sale of the Debentures
and 2012 Warrants, the Company engaged Maxim Group LLC, or Maxim, to serve as placement agent. In consideration for its services,
the Company paid Maxim a placement fee of $1,035,000. In addition, the Company issued to an affiliate of Maxim 7,500 shares of
common stock and five-year warrants to purchase an additional 283,750 shares of common stock at an initial exercise price of $2.64
per share. The warrants issued to Maxim are in substantially the same form as the 2012 Warrants issued to the investors, except
that they do not include certain anti-dilution provisions contained in the investors  2012 Warrants. However, the placement
warrants do contain a provision that could require the Company to repurchase the warrants from the holder in connection with a
sale of the Company or similar transaction. As a result of such repurchase provision, the Company is required to record the fair
value of such warrants as a liability on the accompanying balance sheet. Management used a Monte Carlo simulation model and, in
doing so, utilized a third-party valuation report to determine the warrant liability to be approximately $0.0 million at September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 

15  

Under the terms of the 2013
Purchase Agreement for the issuance and sale of common stock, each Purchaser received Series D Common Stock Purchase Warrant
(a  Series D Warrant ) and a Series E Common Stock Warrant (a  Series E Warrant  and together with
the Series D Warrant, the  2013 Warrants )) and had the option to elect to receive a Series C Common Stock
Purchase Warrant (a  Series C Warrant ) in lieu of a share in connection with each unit it purchased. The Series
C Warrants have a five-year term and are exercisable at an initial exercise price of $0.01 per share. The Series D
Warrants have a five-year term and are exercisable at an initial exercise price of $4.00 per share, subject to adjustment for
stock splits, combinations, recapitalization events and certain dilutive issuances (as described below). The Series E
Warrants were initially exercisable until October 31, 2014, which exercise date was subsequently extended by the Company to
January 31, 2015. The initial exercise price of the Series E Warrants was $2.40 per share, subject to adjustment for stock
splits, combinations, recapitalization events and certain dilutive issuances (as described below). The applicable exercise
price of the Series D Warrants and Series E Warrants (but not the Series C Warrants) is subject to a weighted-average price
adjustment in the event the Company makes future issuances of common stock or rights to acquire common stock (subject to
certain exceptions) at a per share price less than the applicable warrant exercise price. In accordance with the terms of
this anti-dilution provision and as a result of the Company s issuances under the 2016 Purchase Agreement, the
exercise price of the Series D warrants was reduced from $4.00 to $2.14 per share and the aggregate number of shares
underlying such warrants was increased from 12,868,585 to 24,053,398 shares.  Further in accordance with the terms of this
anti-dilution provision and as a result of the Company s issuances under the August 2016  Purchase Agreement,
the exercise price of the Series D Warrants was reduced to $1.81 per share and the aggregate number of shares underlying
such warrants was increased to 28,369,815 shares. The 2013 Warrants also contain a provision that may require the Company
to repurchase such warrants from their holders in connection with a sale of the Company or similar transactions. As a result
of such anti-dilution and repurchase provisions, the Company is required to record the fair value of the 2013 Warrants as
a liability on the accompanying balance sheet. Because of this anti-dilution provision and the inherent uncertainty as to
the probability of future common share issuances, the Black-Scholes option pricing model the Company uses for valuing
stock options could not be used.  Management used a Monte Carlo simulation model and, in doing so, utilized a
third-party valuation report to determine the warrant liability for the Series D Warrants to be approximately $4.5 million
and $3.0 million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The Series E Warrants, representing the
right to purchase an aggregate of 12,868,585 shares of common stock, expired unexercised on January 31, 2015. The 2013
Warrants are required to be exercised for cash, provided that if during the term of the Warrants there is not an effective
registration statement under the Securities Act covering the resale of the shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrants,
then the Warrants may be exercised on a cashless (net exercise) basis. 

Pursuant to the terms of the August
2016  Purchase Agreement for the issuance and sale of common stock, the Company issued Series F Warrants to purchase an
aggregate of approximately 3,145,208 shares of common stock. The Series F Warrants have a five-year term and are exercisable
at an initial exercise price of $0.4375 per share, subject to adjustment for stock splits, combinations, recapitalization
events. The  Series F Warrants are required to be exercised for cash, provided that if during the term of the warrants there
is not an effective registration statement under the Securities Act covering the resale of the shares issuable upon exercise
of the Series F  Warrants, then the warrants may be exercised on a cashless (net exercise) basis. 

Below is a table that
summarizes all outstanding warrants to purchase shares of the Company s common stock as of September 30, 2016: 

9. STOCK BASED COMPENSATION  

The Company s 2005 Stock Option Plan
(the  2005 Plan ) was originally adopted by the Board of Directors of Old Arno in August 2005, and was assumed by the
Company on June 3, 2008 in connection with the Merger. After giving effect to the Merger, there were initially 373,831 shares of
the Company s common stock reserved for issuance under the 2005 Plan. On April 25, 2011, the Company s Board of Directors
(the  Board ) approved an amendment to the 2005 Plan to increase the number of shares of common stock issuable under
the 2005 Plan to 875,000 shares. On January 14, 2013, the Board approved an amendment to the 2005 Plan to increase the number of
shares of common stock issuable under the 2005 Plan to 945,276 shares. On October 7, 2013, the Board adopted an amendment to the
2005 Plan, as amended that increased the number of shares of common stock authorized for issuance thereunder from 945,276 to 11,155,295.
Under the 2005 Plan, incentives may be granted to officers, employees, directors, consultants, and advisors. Incentives under the
2005 Plan may be granted in any one or a combination of the following forms: (a) incentive stock options and non-statutory stock
options, (b) stock appreciation rights, (c) stock awards, (d) restricted stock and (e) performance shares. 

The 2005 Plan is administered by the Board,
or a committee appointed by the Board, which determines recipients and types of awards to be granted, including the number of shares
subject to the awards, the exercise price and the vesting schedule. The term of stock options granted under the 2005 Plan cannot
exceed 10 years. Options shall not have an exercise price less than the fair market value of the Company s common stock on
the grant date, and generally vest over a period of three to four years. 

The 2005 Plan expired on March 31, 2016
with 7,018,549 options outstanding which will continue to vest. No further awards will be made pursuant to this plan. 

16  

On March 14, 2016, the Board of the Company
adopted the Company s 2016 Equity Incentive Plan (the  2016 Plan ). The 2016 Plan replaces the Company s
2005 Plan. Incentives under the 2016 Plan may be granted in any one or a combination of the following forms: (a) incentive stock
options and non-statutory stock options, (b) stock appreciation rights, (c) stock awards, (d) restricted stock and (e) performance
shares. The stock to be awarded or optioned under the 2016 Plan will consist of authorized but unissued or reacquired shares of
common stock. The maximum aggregate number of shares of common stock reserved and available for awards under the 2016 Plan is 9,000,000
shares; provided, that all shares of stock reserved and available under the 2016 Plan will constitute the maximum aggregate number
of shares of stock that may be issued through incentive stock options. 

Any employee, director, or consultant may
participate in the 2016 Plan; provided, however, that only employees are eligible to receive incentive stock options. Additionally,
the Company may grant certain performance-based awards to  covered employees  in compliance with Section 162(m) of
the Internal Revenue Code. These covered employees include our executive officers. No person may be granted options, stock appreciation
rights, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units or performance awards under the 2016 Plan for more than 4,000,000 shares
of common stock in any calendar year. 

The term of stock options granted under
the 2016 Plan cannot exceed 10 years. Options shall not have an exercise price less than the fair market value of the Company s
common stock on the grant date, and generally vest over a period of three to four years. Incentive stock options may not be granted
after March 13, 2026. 

As of September 30, 2016, there are 5,007,743
shares available for future grants and awards under the 2016 Plan, which covers stock options, warrants and restricted stock awards. 

Stock-based compensation costs under
the  Company s equity incentive plans for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are as
follows: 

The Company grants stock options to employees
and members of the Board of Directors with the exercise prices equal to the closing price of the underlying shares of the Company s
common stock on the date that the options are granted. Options granted have a term of 10 years from the grant date. Options granted
to employees generally vest over a three- year period and options granted to members of the Board of Directors vest in equal monthly
installments over a one-year period from the date of grant. Options to members of the Board of Directors are granted on an annual
basis and represent compensation for services performed on the Board of Directors. Compensation cost for stock options is charged
against operations on a straight-line basis between the grant date for the option and each vesting date. The Company estimates
the fair value of the stock options on the grant date by applying the Black-Scholes option pricing valuation model. The application
of this valuation model involves assumptions that are highly subjective, judgmental and sensitive in the determination of compensation
cost. 

In addition during the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 the Company granted stock options to members of senior management that contain certain conditions to
the exercisability of the shares subject thereto ( Contingent Options ) with the exercise prices equal to the
closing price of the underlying shares of the Company s common stock on the date that the options are granted. The
Contingent Options granted have a term of 10 years from the grant date. The Contingent Options are exercisable only to the
extent that the Company s outstanding Series A Warrants and Series D Warrants are exercised prior to their expiration.
Compensation cost for the Contingent Options is charged against operations over the implicit, explicit or derived requisite
service period unless the market condition is satisfied at an earlier date, in which case any unrecognized compensation cost
would be recognized immediately upon satisfaction of the market condition. If the requisite service is not rendered, all
previously recognized compensation cost would be reversed. If the requisite service is rendered, the recognized compensation
is not reversed even if the market condition is never satisfied. The Company utilized a Monte Carlo simulation model for the
valuation of market options. The application of this valuation model involves assumptions that are highly subjective,
judgmental and sensitive in the determination of compensation cost. 

The Company issued the following stock options
during the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively: 

17  

The Company estimated the fair value of
the stock options granted using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Company estimated the fair value of the Market Options
granted using the Monte Carlo simulation model. The following key assumptions were used for both option grants for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 as no options were granted in the three months ended September 30, 2016 and the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2015:  

A summary of the status of the options
issued under the Company s  equity incentive plans at September 30, 2016, and information with respect to the
changes in options outstanding, is as follows:   

The following table summarizes information
about stock options outstanding at September 30, 2016: 

18  

The grant date fair value of options
vested under the  Company s equity incentive plans was approximately $952,576 and $935,446 for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, and $2,802,664 and $3,590,708 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively. 

At September 30, 2016, total unrecognized
estimated compensation cost related to stock options granted prior to that date was approximately $1,784,552 which is expected
to be recognized over a weighted-average vesting period of 2.5 years. This unrecognized estimated employee compensation cost does
not include any estimate for forfeitures of performance-based stock options. 

Common stock, stock options or other
equity instruments issued to non-employees (including consultants and all members of the Company s Scientific Advisory Board)
as consideration for goods or services received by the Company are accounted for based on the fair value of the equity instruments
issued (unless the fair value of the consideration received can be more reliably measured). The fair value of stock options is
determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and is expensed as the underlying options vest. The fair value of any options
issued to non-employees is recorded as expense over the applicable service periods. 

10. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS  

As described above under  Note
8, Stockholders  Equity - Common Stock,  on October 4, 2016, the Company closed on the sale of an additional
285,714 shares of common stock and Series F Warrants to purchase 142,857 shares of common stock pursuant to the August 2016
Purchase Agreement, resulting in gross proceeds of $100,000. The closing on the sale of the remaining 1,929,284 units, which
will result in additional gross proceeds to us of approximately $675,250, is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing
conditions, including the effectiveness of a registration statement under the Securities Act covering the resale of the
shares and warrant shares sold pursuant to the purchase agreement. 

The registration statement
covering such shares and warrant shares was declared effective on November 3, 2016 by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The Company closed on the sale of 1,214,999 units on November 4, 2016, which resulted in additional gross proceeds to us
of approximately $425,250. There are 714,285 units ($250,000 proceeds) subject to the August 2016 Purchase Agreement that
remain to be closed upon.

Item 2.    Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations.  

Overview  

We are focused on developing innovative
products for the treatment of cancer and other life threatening diseases. We currently have exclusive worldwide rights to three
innovative clinical stage compounds with unique mechanisms of action that have the potential to be first-in-class therapeutics. 

The following is a summary of our product
development pipeline: 

Onapristone     We are
currently developing onapristone, an oral anti-progestin hormone blocker that has been shown to have considerable anti-tumor activity
in patients with breast cancer. Onapristone appears to have a unique ability to block the activation of the progesterone receptor
and inhibit tumor growth. In connection with the development of onapristone, we have engaged Leica Biosystems to develop an immunohistochemistry
based diagnostic test to identify tumors with the activated form of the progesterone receptor (APR), which is intended to identify
patients more likely to benefit from treatment with onapristone. Additional biomarker development is ongoing to develop a diagnostic
test to identify progesterone receptor (PR) in tumor types other than breast cancer.    

In April 2014, we enrolled the
first patient in a Phase I/II clinical trial of onapristone in men with advanced castration-resistant prostate cancer, or CRPC,
after failure of abiraterone or enzalutamide. This study is currently being conducted at three sites in the United Kingdom, led
by the Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust in London. The randomized, open-label trial is designed to evaluate the safety and anti-cancer
activity of onapristone in the defined patient population. The Phase I component of the study evaluated onapristone extended-release
tablet formulations in five dose levels (10-50 mg, twice daily) in patients with prostate cancer and has completed enrollment.
The protocol has been amended to study the combination of onapristone plus abiraterone in a Phase I setting with an expansion phase.
In addition, the protocol also includes a Phase II cohort of patients that will be enrolled to gain additional understanding of
the onapristone as a potential treatment in men with CRPC. The Phase II aspect of the study includes a component that will evaluate
the combination of onapristone plus Zytiga    (abiraterone acetate) in men who have had evidence of progression of
disease while on abiraterone acetate. The ongoing phase 2 clinical trial evaluating the combination of onapristone plus abiraterone
acetate has completed the lead-in phase at 30 mg BID of onapristone plus  full dose  abiraterone acetate (5 patients)
and the independent data review committee (DRC) found the combination safe and recommended moving forward with the 50 mg BID onapristone
dose. The onapristone 50 mg BID plus  full dose  abiraterone acetate cohort is currently accruing patients in the UK
and US. It is anticipated that the DRC will have safety data from first group of patients (approximately 6 patients) treated at
the 50 mg BID dose of onapristone in combination with abiraterone acetate for review in October 2016. Another component of this
Phase II aspect of the study will further evaluate the safety profile and potential anti-cancer activity of single agent onapristone
in men with advanced CRPC after failure of abiraterone or enzalutamide. Screening of patients under the amended study protocol
began in the first quarter of 2016 and the Phase II study will include approximately 75 patients. 

In addition, in December 2014,
we enrolled the first patient in the expansion phase of our ongoing Phase I/II clinical trial evaluating onapristone in women with
progesterone receptor (PR) expressing tumors. The protocol was subsequently amended to include a formal Phase II study in patients
with recurrent or metastatic endometrioid tumors that have been shown to express PR, and who have received no more than one prior
chemotherapy and no prior hormone therapy. Patients in the Phase II endometrioid cancer component of the study received 50mg of
extended release onapristone twice daily, the dose determined by an independent data review committee to be safely administered
to patients based on the results of the Phase I component of this study. The study also incorporated a diagnostic test targeting
women with tumors expressing APR, which was intended to select those patients more likely to respond to onapristone treatment.
In April 2016, we determined to close this clinical trial to further accrual in order to focus our resources on our prostate cancer
program. 

AR-12
    and analogues     AR-12 was initially being developed as an orally available agent which demonstrated to inhibit
    multiple different kinase targets. We believe AR-12 may also cause malignant cell death through the induction of stress in
    the endoplasmic reticulum and recent work has demonstrated that AR-12 inhibits various molecular protein chaperones including
    GRP78, HSP70, HSP90 and HSP27. We have completed a Phase I clinical trial of AR-12 in adult patients with advanced or recurrent
    solid tumors or lymphoma using the original non optimized formulation of AR-12. Subsequently, an improved formulation of AR-12
    that has been shown to substantially increase bioavailability in preclinical models has been developed. Based on additional
    pre-clinical research conducted on AR-12, we are currently pursuing various opportunities with the potential for securing
    non-dilutive funding, via government and philanthropic agency grants and contracts, for further research into the potential
    use of AR-12 as an anti-microbial agent. In April 2015, the EMA granted two orphan drug designations for AR-12 for the treatment
    of cryptococcosis and tularaemia. Cryptococcosis is an infectious
disease of the lungs caused by the fungus  Cryptococcus neoformans  and is one of the most common life-threatening fungal
infections in people with AIDS. Tularaemia is an infection which can be spread from animals to humans that is caused by the bacterium
 Francisella tularensis  and is a Category A Priority Pathogen on the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease
(NIAID) list of Biodefense and Emerging Infectious Diseases. A CRADA is in place with the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute
of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) for the evaluation of AR-12 and analogues against pathogens of biodefense interests. Other analogues
of AR-12 such as AR-13 are being investigated for activity against certain microbial pathogens through a number of collaborations.   

20  

AR-42
        AR-42 is being developed as an orally available, broad spectrum inhibitor of both histone and non-histone
    deacetylation proteins, or Pan-DAC, which play an important role in the regulation of gene expression, cell growth and
    survival.     AR-42 recently completed an investigator-initiated dose escalation clinical study with an expansion phase in
    adult subjects     with relapsed or refractory hematological malignancies (multiple myeloma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia
    (CLL), or lymphoma)     and solid tumors. The recommended Phase II dose, or RP2D, in patients with hematological malignancies
    has been determined     and the expansion phase of the program has been completed. The protocol has been amended to include a
    separate solid tumor     dose escalation cohort and expansion phase. The solid tumor component of the study has been
    completed. We also supported an     investigator initiated Phase I study of AR-42 in combination with decitabine in patients
    with hematological malignancies that     was initiated during the third quarter of 2013. The FDA has granted two orphan drug
    designations for AR-42 for the treatment     of meningioma and the treatment of schwannoma of the central nervous system.
    Meningioma and schwannoma are rare, benign tumors     that can present in different locations within the brain and the spinal
    cord and may cause substantial morbidity for those     affected individuals. Additionally, AR-42 has been granted three
    orphan drug designations by the European Medicines Agency,     or EMA, for the treatment of neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2),
    the treatment of meningioma and the treatment of schwannoma.     NF2 is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the growth
    of noncancerous tumors in the brain and spinal cord, juvenile cataracts,     and neurofibromas of the skin. Additional
    investigator sponsored clinical trials of AR-42 are currently underway or being     planned. Preclinical data indicates that
    AR-42 may be additive/synergistic with certain immuno-oncology therapeutic targets and     additional preclinical
    investigations are underway to determine the best developmental path for these potential combination
    therapies.   

We have no product sales to
date and we will not generate any product revenue until we receive approval from the FDA or equivalent foreign regulatory bodies
to begin selling our pharmaceutical product candidates. Developing pharmaceutical products is a lengthy and very expensive process.
Assuming we do not encounter any unforeseen safety or other issues during the course of developing our product candidates, we do
not expect to complete the development of a product candidate for several years, if ever. To date, almost all of our development
expenses have been incurred on each of our product candidates: Onapristone, AR-12, AR-42 and AR-67 (a compound we are no longer
developing). As we proceed with the clinical development of our product candidates, primarily focusing our resources on onapristone,
our research and development expenses will further increase. To the extent we are successful in acquiring additional product candidates
for our development pipeline, our need to finance further research and development will continue increasing. Accordingly, our success
depends not only on the safety and efficacy of our product candidates, but also on our ability to finance the development of the
products. To date, our major sources of working capital have been proceeds from private and public sales of our common and preferred
stock and debt financings. 

Research and development, or R D, expenses
consist primarily of salaries and related personnel costs, fees paid to consultants and outside service providers for pre-clinical,
clinical, and manufacturing development, legal expenses resulting from intellectual property prosecution, costs related to obtaining
and maintaining our product license agreements, contractual review, and other expenses relating to the design, development, testing,
and enhancement of our product candidates. We expense our R D costs as they are incurred. 

General and administrative, or G A,
expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for executive, finance and other administrative personnel, accounting,
legal and other professional fees, business development expenses, rent, business insurance and other corporate expenses. 

Our results include non-cash compensation
expense as a result of the issuance of stock options. We expense the fair value of stock options over the vesting period. When
more precise pricing data is unavailable, we determine the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
The terms and vesting schedules for share-based awards vary by type of grant and the employment status of the grantee. Generally,
the awards vest based upon time-based or performance-based conditions. Performance-based conditions generally include the attainment
of goals related to our financial performance and product development. Stock-based compensation expense is included in the respective
categories of expense in the statements of operations. We expect to record additional non-cash compensation expense in the future,
which may be significant. 

Results of Operations  

General and Administrative Expenses .
 G A expenses for each of the three month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were approximately $1.1 million and
$1.1 million, respectively. Spending was flat for the third quarter of 2016 over the same period in 2015. 

G A expenses for each of the nine
month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were approximately $3.7 million and $3.8 million, respectively. The decrease
of approximately $0.1 million for the nine months of 2016 over the same period in 2015 is primarily the result of decreased
compensation expense. 

21  

Research and Development Expenses .
 R D expenses for each of the three month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were approximately $1.1 million and
$1.8 million, respectively. The decrease of approximately $0.7 million for the third quarter of 2016 compared to the same period
in 2015 is primarily due to a decrease in spending for our lead product candidate, onapristone and general research and development.
Total direct onapristone development costs for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 were approximately $0.6 million compared to
approximately $1.0 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2015. This decrease of approximately $0.4 million over the same
period of 2015 is primarily due to decreased spending on onapristone s clinical trials of $0.3 million and non-clinical research
activities of $0.1 million. The company also incurred lower compensation costs of $0.1 million in 2016 over the same period
of 2015. 

R D expenses for the nine
month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were approximately $4.7 million and $6.9 million, respectively. The decrease
of approximately $2.2 million for the nine months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 is primarily due to a decrease
in spending for our lead product candidate, onapristone and general research and development. Total direct
onapristone development costs for the nine  months ended September 30, 2016 were approximately $3.3 million compared to
approximately $4.5 million for the  nine months ended September 30, 2015. This decrease of approximately $1.2 million over
the same period of 2015 is primarily due to decreased spending on onapristone s clinical trials of $0.2 and
non-clinical research activities of $1.0 million. The company also incurred lower compensation costs of $0.6 million in 2016
over the same period of 2015. 

The following table summarizes our R D
expenses incurred for preclinical support, contract manufacturing of clinical supplies, clinical trial services provided by third
parties and milestone payments for in-licensed technology for each of our product candidates for the three and nine month periods
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, as well as the cumulative amounts since we began development of each product candidate through
September 30, 2016. The table also summarizes unallocated costs, which consist of personnel, facilities and other costs not directly
allocable to specific development programs (the amounts stated are expressed in thousands): 

Our expenditures on current and future clinical
development programs are expected to be substantial and to increase particularly in relation to our available capital resources.
Based on our current development plans, during the fiscal year 2016 we anticipate external development costs to be approximately
$3.7 million for onapristone and $0.5 for other research and development projects. However, these planned expenditures are subject
to many uncertainties, including the availability of necessary capital, the results of clinical trials and whether we develop any
of our drug candidates with a partner or independently. As a result of such uncertainties, it is very difficult to accurately predict
the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects or whether, when and to what extent we will generate
revenues from the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates. The duration and cost of clinical trials may vary
significantly over the life of a project as a result of unanticipated events arising during clinical development and a variety
of factors, including: 

the number of trials and studies in a clinical program;    

the number of patients who participate in the trials;    

the number of sites included in the trials;    

the rates of patient recruitment and enrollment;    

the duration of patient treatment and follow-up;    

the costs of manufacturing our drug candidates; and    

the costs, requirements, timing of, and ability to secure regulatory
approvals.    

Interest Income .  Interest
income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $904 and $530 respectively. The increase in interest income compared
to the same period in 2015 is primarily due to higher average cash balances held during 2016 compared to the same period of 2015. 

Interest income for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $3,889 and $7,625 respectively. The decrease in interest income compared to the same period in
2015 is primarily due to lower average cash balances held during 2016 compared to the same period of 2015. 

Interest Expense .  Interest
expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $214 and $349 respectively. The decrease in interest expense
in 2016 over 2015 is the result of lower interest expense on capitalized leases. 

Interest expense for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $14,982 and $1,139 respectively. The increase in interest expense in 2016 over 2015 is the result
of interest expense and amortization of financing costs associated with convertible notes issued in October, 2015. 

22  

Other Income (Expense).   Other
expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was approximately $1.6 million compared to other income of approximately
$2.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The change in 2016 over 2015 is related to noncash adjustments to the
warrant liability primarily driven by increased number of warrants outstanding partly offset by $0.4 million of proceeds from the
sale of AR-67 preclinical and clinical data package. 

Other expense for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 was approximately $1.3 million compared to other income of approximately $3.2 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2015. The change in 2016 over 2015 is related to noncash adjustments to the warrant liability primarily driven by
lower valuation price per warrant outstanding partly offset by $0.5 million of proceeds from the sale of AR-67 preclinical and
clinical data package. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

The following table summarizes our liquidity
and capital resources as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 and our net changes in cash and cash equivalents for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 (the amounts stated are expressed in thousands): 

Our total cash resources as of September
30, 2016 were approximately $2.1 million compared to approximately $0.1 million as of December 31, 2015. As of September 30, 2016,
we had approximately $8.1 million in liabilities (of which approximately $6.5 million represented non-cash derivative liabilities),
and a net working capital of approximately $0.8 million. We realized net loss of approximately $9.7 million and had negative
cash flow from operating activities of $5.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. As we continue to develop our
product candidates, we expect to incur substantial and increasing losses, which will continue to generate negative net cash flows
from operating activities as we expand our technology portfolio and engage in further research and development activities, particularly
the conduct of additional pre-clinical studies and clinical trials. 

From inception through September 30, 2016,
we have financed our operations through private sales of our equity and debt securities.  As we have not generated any revenue
from operations to date, and we do not expect to generate revenue for several years, if ever, we will need to raise substantial
additional capital in order to continue to fund our research and development, including our long-term plans for clinical trials
and new product development, as well as to fund operations generally.  We may seek to raise additional funds through various
potential sources, such as equity and debt financings, or through strategic collaborations and license agreements.  We can
give no assurances that we will be able to secure such additional sources of funds to support our operations, or if such funds
are available to us, that such additional financing will be sufficient to meet our needs.  

In January 2016, we completed a private
placement of 21,153,997 shares of our common stock at a purchase price of $0.35 per share for an aggregate gross proceeds of approximately
$7.4 million, including the satisfaction of $2.1 million of indebtedness represented by convertible notes that we issued in October
2015. The number of shares sold in the private placement included an aggregate of 6,081,858 shares that were issued upon the automatic
conversion of the Company s convertible notes issued in the principal amount of $2.1 million and $28,652 of accrued interest. 

On August 15, 2016, we entered into
a Securities Purchase Agreement with certain purchasers pursuant to which we agreed to issue and sell in a private
placement 8,501,421 units of our securities at a price of $0.35 per unit, with each unit consisting of one share of common
stock and a five-year warrant to purchase one-half share (rounded to the nearest whole share) of common stock at an exercise
price of $0.4375 per share. On August 15, October 4 and November 4, 2016 we closed on the sale of a total 7,787,136 units,
resulting in total gross proceeds to us of approximately $2.7 million. There are 714,285 units ($250,000 proceeds) subject to the August 2016 Purchase Agreement that
remain to be closed upon. 

23  

Based on our current
development plans, we believe our existing cash resources, including approximately the $3.0 million proceeds received, or
that will be received, pursuant to the August 2016 securities purchase agreement, are sufficient to fund our operations into
January 2017. We are therefore in immediate need of additional capital to fund its continuing operations beyond such period.
Further, we will need substantial additional capital in order to complete the development and obtain regulatory approval of
our product candidates, if ever. Based on the various options for future clinical studies of onapristone, AR-12 and AR-42,
our projected cash needs are difficult to predict. In addition, there are other factors which may also cause our actual cash
requirements to vary materially, including changes in the focus and direction of our research and development programs; the
acquisition and pursuit of development of new product candidates; competitive and technical advances; costs of
commercializing any of the product candidates; and costs of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims
and any other intellectual property rights. If we are unable to raise additional funds when needed, we may not be able to
continue development and regulatory approval of our products, and we could be required to delay, scale back or eliminate some
or all of our research and development programs and we may need to wind down our operations altogether. Each of these
alternatives would likely have a material adverse effect on our business and may result in a loss of your entire investment
in our common stock. 

The actual amount of funds we will need
to operate is subject to many factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include the following: 

the progress of our research activities;    

the costs of hiring additional full-time personnel;    

the number and scope of our research programs;    

the progress of our pre-clinical and clinical development activities;    

the costs and timing of manufacturing our drug candidates;    

the progress of the development efforts of parties with whom we have
entered into research and development agreements;    

our ability to maintain current research and development programs
and to establish new research and development and licensing arrangements;    

the cost involved in prosecuting and enforcing patent claims and other
intellectual property rights; and    

the cost and timing of regulatory approvals.    

We have based our estimates on assumptions
that may prove to be wrong. We may need to obtain additional funds sooner than planned or in greater amounts than we currently
anticipate. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. The Company s
financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the settlement
of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might
result from the inability of the Company to continue as a going concern. 

License Agreement Commitments   

Onapristone License Agreement  

Our rights to onapristone are governed by
a license agreement with Invivis dated February 13, 2012. Under this agreement, we hold an exclusive, royalty-bearing license for
the rights to commercialize onapristone for all therapeutic uses. The license agreement provides us with worldwide commercial rights
to onapristone with the exception of France, although under the license agreement we have an option to acquire French commercial
rights from Invivis by providing notice to Invivis and making a cash payment. 

The onapristone license agreement provides
us with exclusive, worldwide rights to a U.S. patent that relates to assays for predictive biomarkers for anti-progestin efficacy.
We intend to expand our patent portfolio by filing additional patent applications covering the use and manufacture of onapristone
and/or a companion diagnostic product. This patent is scheduled to expire in 2031. 

We made a one-time cash payment of $500,000
to Invivis upon execution of the license agreement on February 13, 2012. Additionally, Invivis will receive performance-based cash
payments of up to an aggregate of $15.1 million upon successful completion of clinical and regulatory milestones relating to onapristone,
which milestones include the marketing approval of onapristone in multiple indications in the United States or the European Union
as well as Japan. The first milestone was due upon the dosing of the first patient in a pharmacokinetic study and was achieved
during August 2013 and we made a $150,000 payment to Invivis during October 2013. We made our next milestone payment of $100,000
to Invivis upon the dosing of the first subject in the first Company-sponsored Phase I clinical trial of onapristone in January
2014. A milestone payment of $350,000 for the enrollment of the first patient in a Phase II clinical trial sponsored by Arno was
paid in July 2015. In addition, we will pay Invivis low single digit sales royalties based on net sales of onapristone by us or
any of our sublicensees. Pursuant to a separate services agreement which expired in April 2014, Invivis provided us with certain
clinical development support services, which included the assignment of up to two full-time employees to perform such services,
in exchange for a monthly cash payment of approximately $70,833. Effective April 1, 2014, we renewed the services agreement for
a period of one year for a monthly cash payment of $50,000 and certain other performance based milestones. The services agreement
was not renewed upon its expiration on April 1, 2015. 

24  

Under the license agreement with
Invivis, we also agreed to indemnify and hold Invivis and its affiliates harmless from any and all claims arising out of or in
connection with the production, manufacture, sale, use, lease, consumption or advertisement of onapristone, provided, however,
that we shall have no obligation to indemnify Invivis for claims that (a) any patent rights infringe third party intellectual property,
(b) arise out of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Invivis, or (c) result from a breach of any representation, warranty,
or confidentiality obligation of Invivis under the license agreement. The license agreement will terminate upon the later of (i)
the last to expire valid claim contained in the patent rights, and (ii) February 13, 2032. In general, Invivis may terminate the
license agreement at any time upon a material breach by us to the extent we fail to cure any such breach within 90 days after receiving
notice of such breach or in the event we file for bankruptcy. We may terminate the agreement for any reason upon 90 days 
prior written notice. 

University of Minnesota License  

In February 2014, we entered into an Exclusive
Patent License Agreement with the Regents of the University of Minnesota, or UM, pursuant to which we were granted an exclusive,
worldwide, royalty-bearing license for the rights to develop and commercialize technology embodied by certain patent applications
relating to a gene expression signature derived from archived breast cancer tissue samples. We plan to develop and commercialize
this technology as part of our companion diagnostic development program as a tool to identify progesterone-stimulated pathway activation,
which in turn may identify patients who would be more likely to benefit from treatment with onapristone. 

The license agreement requires us to use
commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize the licensed technology as soon as practicable, and includes several performance
milestones relating to the development and commercialization of the technology to be achieved by us at specified dates. Under the
terms of the agreement, we made a small one-time cash payment and reimbursed UM for past patent expenses it has incurred. The agreement
also provides that we will pay royalties to UM on net sales of  Licensed Products  (as defined in the agreement) at
a rate in the low-single digits, which royalty obligation terminates on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country
basis upon the first date when there is no longer a valid claim under a licensed patent or patent application covering such licensed
product in the country where the licensed product is made or sold. 

The term of the license agreement continues
until the last date on which there is any active licensed patent or pending patent application. UM may terminate the agreement
earlier upon a breach by us of one or more of our obligations that remains uncured for a period specified in the agreement. UM
may also terminate the agreement if we voluntarily file for bankruptcy or similar proceeding, or if a petition for an involuntary
bankruptcy proceeding is filed and is not released for 60 days. The agreement may be immediately terminated upon notice to us if
we commence or maintain a proceeding in which we assert that the licensed patents are invalid or unenforceable. We may terminate
the agreement at any time and for any reason upon 90 days  written notice. 

The license agreement further provides that
we will indemnify and hold UM and its affiliates harmless from any and all suits, actions, claims, liabilities, demands, damages,
losses or expenses relating to our exercise of our rights under the agreement, including our right to commercialize the licensed
technology. UM is required to indemnify us with respect to claims relating to or resulting from its breach of the agreement. 

AR-12 and AR-42 License Agreements  

Our rights to AR-12 and AR-42 are governed
by separate license agreements with The Ohio State University Innovation Foundation (formerly The Ohio State Research Foundation),
or Ohio State, entered into in January 2008. Pursuant to each of these agreements, we have exclusive, worldwide, royalty bearing
licenses for the rights to commercialize technologies embodied by certain issued patents, patent applications, know-how and improvements
relating to AR-12 and AR-42 for all therapeutic uses. 

Under our license agreement for AR-12, we
have exclusive, worldwide rights to seven issued U.S. patent and three pending U.S. patent applications that relate to AR-12, AR-12
analogs, and particular uses of AR-12 according to our business plan. On July 9, 2015, the Company and The Ohio State Innovation
Foundation (formerly, The Ohio State Research Foundation) ( Ohio State ) entered into an amendment, dated effective
as of May 15, 2015 (the  Amendment ), to the parties  License Agreement dated January 3, 2008 (the  AR-12
License ), pursuant to which the Company was granted an exclusive license to certain patents and other technology relating
to its AR-12 product candidate. The purpose of the Amendment was to clarify the scope of AR-12 analogs covered by the license grant
in the original AR-12 License. In addition, the Amendment provides the Company with a first option to an exclusive license to patents
and other technology relating to compounds related to AR-12 held by Ohio State. The issued patents include composition of matter
claims. The issued patents are currently scheduled to expire in 2024. If the pending patent applications issue, the latest of the
issued patent or patents would be scheduled to expire in 2034. In 2014, we filed a provisional patent application directed to methods
using AR-12 that, if issued, would expire in 2035. In addition, Arno has exclusive rights to a pending US and international patent
application directed to AR-12 formulations which, if issued, would expire in 2034. 

Under our license agreement for AR-42, we
have exclusive, worldwide rights to one issued and two pending U.S. patent applications that relate to AR- 42 and particular uses
of AR-42 according to our business plan. If one of the pending patent applications issues, the issued patent or patents would be
scheduled to expire in 2024. If the other pending patent application issues, it would be scheduled to expire in 2034. 

25  

In 2008, pursuant to our license agreements
for AR-12 and AR-42, we made one-time cash payments to Ohio State in the aggregate amount of $450,000 and reimbursed it for past
patent expenses. Additionally, we are required to make performance-based cash payments upon successful completion of clinical and
regulatory milestones relating to AR-12 and AR-42 in the U.S., Europe and Japan. The license agreements for AR-12 and AR-42 provide
for aggregate potential milestone payments of up to $6.1 million for AR-12, of which $5.0 million is due only after marketing approval
in the United States, Europe and Japan, and $5.1 million for AR-42, of which $4.0 million is due only after marketing approval
in the United States, Europe and Japan. In September 2009, we paid Ohio State a milestone payment upon the commencement of the
Phase I clinical study of AR-12. Pursuant to the license agreements for AR-12 and AR- 42, we must pay Ohio State royalties on net
sales of licensed products at rates in the low-single digits. To the extent we enter into a sublicensing agreement relating to
either or both of AR-12 or AR-42, we will be required to pay Ohio State a portion of all non-royalty income received from such
sublicensee. 

The license agreements with Ohio State further
provide that we will indemnify Ohio State from any and all claims arising out of the death of or injury to any person or persons
or out of any damage to property, or resulting from the production, manufacture, sale, use, lease, consumption or advertisement
of either AR-12 or AR-42, except to the extent that any such claim arises out of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of
Ohio State. The license agreements for AR-12 and AR-42, respectively, expire on the later of (i) the expiration of the last valid
claim contained in any licensed patent and (ii) 20 years after the effective date of the license. Ohio State will generally be
able to terminate either license upon our breach of the terms of the license the extent we fail to cure any such breach within
90 days after receiving notice of such breach or our bankruptcy. We may terminate either license upon 90 days  prior written
notice. 

Off -Balance Sheet Arrangements  

There were no off-balance sheet arrangements
as of September 30, 2016. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  

Our financial statements are prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosures. We evaluate
our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis, including research and development and clinical trial accruals, and stock-based
compensation estimates. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable
under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates. We believe the following critical accounting policies
reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements and accompanying notes. 

Research and Development Expenses and Accruals   

R D expenses consist primarily of salaries
and related personnel costs, fees paid to consultants and outside service providers for pre-clinical, clinical, and manufacturing
development, legal expenses resulting from intellectual property prosecution, costs related to obtaining and maintaining our product
licenses, contractual review, and other expenses relating to the design, development, testing, and enhancement of our product candidates.
Amounts due under such arrangements may be either fixed fee or fee for service, and may include upfront payments, monthly payments,
and payments upon the completion of milestones or receipt of deliverables. 

Our cost accruals for clinical trials and
other R D activities are based on estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with numerous
clinical trial centers and clinical research organizations, or CROs, clinical study sites, laboratories, consultants, or other
clinical trial vendors that perform the activities. Related contracts vary significantly in length, and may be for a fixed amount,
a variable amount based on actual costs incurred, capped at a certain limit, or for a combination of these elements. Activity levels
are monitored through close communication with the CROs and other clinical trial vendors, including detailed invoice and task completion
review, analysis of expenses against budgeted amounts, analysis of work performed against approved contract budgets and payment
schedules, and recognition of any changes in scope of the services to be performed. Certain CROs and significant clinical trial
vendors provide an estimate of costs incurred but not invoiced at the end of each quarter for each individual trial. The estimates
are reviewed and discussed with the CRO or vendor as necessary, and are included in R D expenses for the related period. For
clinical study sites, which are paid periodically on a per-subject basis to the institutions performing the clinical study, we
accrue an estimated amount based on subject screening and enrollment in each quarter. All estimates may differ significantly from
the actual amount subsequently invoiced, which may occur several months after the related services were performed. 

In the normal course of business we contract
with third parties to perform various R D activities in the on-going development of our product candidates. The financial terms
of these agreements are subject to negotiation and vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. Payments
under the contracts depend on factors such as the achievement of certain events, the successful enrollment of patients, and the
completion of portions of the clinical trial or similar conditions. The objective of our accrual policy is to match the recording
of expenses in our financial statements to the actual services received and efforts expended. As such, expense accruals related
to clinical trials and other R D activities are recognized based on our estimate of the degree of completion of the event or
events specified in the specific contract. 

26  

No adjustments for material changes in estimates
have been recognized in any period presented. 

Stock-Based Compensation   

Our results include non-cash compensation
expense as a result of the issuance of stock, stock options and warrants. We have issued stock options to employees, directors,
consultants and Scientific Advisory Board members under two stock option plans. 

We expense the fair value of employee stock-based
compensation over the vesting period. When more precise pricing data is unavailable, we determine the fair value of stock options
using either the Black-Scholes option-pricing model or Monte Carlo simulation model. These valuation models require us to make
assumptions and judgments about the variables used in the calculation. These variables and assumptions include the weighted-average
period of time that the options granted are expected to be outstanding, the volatility of our common stock, the risk-free interest
rate and the estimated rate of forfeitures of unvested stock options. 

Stock options or other equity instruments
to non-employees (including consultants and all members of our Scientific Advisory Board) issued as consideration for goods or
services received by us are accounted for based on the fair value of the equity instruments issued (unless the fair value of the
consideration received can be more reliably measured). The fair value of stock options is determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing
model. The fair value of any options issued to non-employees is recorded as expense over the applicable service periods. 

The terms and vesting schedules for share-based
awards vary by type of grant and the employment status of the grantee. Generally, the awards vest based upon time-based or performance-based
conditions. Performance-based conditions generally include the attainment of goals related to our financial and development performance.
Stock-based compensation expense is included in the respective categories of expense in the Statements of Operations. We expect
to record additional non-cash compensation expense in the future, which may be significant. 

Warrant Liability   

We account for the warrants issued in connection
with the 2013 private placement, the 2012 private placement and the 2010 private placement in accordance with the guidance on Accounting
for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity, which provides that we classify the warrant
instrument as a liability at its fair value and adjust the instrument to fair value at each reporting period. This liability is
subject to re-measurement at each balance sheet date until exercised, and any change in fair value is recognized as a component
of other income or expense. The fair value of warrants issued by us, in connection with private placements of securities, has been
estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The Monte Carlo simulation is a generally accepted statistical method used to generate
a defined number of stock price paths in order to develop a reasonable estimate of the range of our future expected stock prices
and minimizes standard error.       

Recent Accounting Pronouncements   

In January 2016, the FASB issued Accounting
Standards Update No. 2016-01,  Financial Instruments  ( ASU 2016-01 ). Equity investments not accounted
for under the equity method of accounting will be measured at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in current earnings.
ASU 2016-01 becomes effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted provided that the
guidance is applied from the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The Company does not believe the adoption of this standard
will have a material impact on its financial statements, results of operations or related financial statement disclosures. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting
Standards Update No. 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842)  ( ASU 2016-02 ). Leasees will need to recognize virtually
all of their leases on the balance sheet, by recording a right-of-use asset and lease liability. ASU 2016-02 becomes effective
for the Company on January 1, 2019, and early adoption is permitted upon issuance. The Company is evaluating the potential impact
of adopting this standard on its financial statements. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued two updates
to Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815). Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-05,  Effect of Derivative Contract Novations
on Existing Hedge Accounting Relationships  ( ASU 2016-05 ). ASU 2016-05 clarifies that a change in the counterparty
to a derivative instrument that has been designated as a hedging instrument does not, on its own, require dedesignation of that
hedge accounting relationship provided that all other hedge accounting criteria continue to be met. Accounting Standards Update
No. 2016-06,  Contingent Put and Call Options in Debt Instruments  ( ASU 2016-06 ). ASU 2016-06 clarifies
that an entity is required to assess the embedded call or put option solely in accordance with a specific four-step decision sequence
and are not also required to assess whether the contingency for exercising the option is indexed to interest rate or credit risk.
ASU 2016-05 and ASU 2016-06 will take effect for public companies in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including
interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company does not believe the requirements of these updates will have a material
effect in the presentation of its financial statements. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued an update
to Compensation- Stock Compensation (Topic 718). Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09,  Improvements to Employee Share-Based
Payment Accounting  ( ASU 2016-09 ). ASU 2016-09 identifies areas for simplification involving several aspects
of accounting for stock-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity
or liabilities, an option to recognize gross stock compensation expense with actual forfeitures recognized as they occur, as well
as certain classifications on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective for reporting periods beginning after December
31, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating the potential impact of adopting this standard on its financial
statements. 

27  

In August 2016, the FASB issued an update
to Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230). Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-15,  Classification of Certain Cash Receipts
and Cash Payments  ( ASU 2016-15 ). ASU 2016-15 provides guidance in the presentation and classification of eight
specific cash flow issues in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 will take effect for public companies in fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating
the potential impact of adopting this standard on its financial statements. 

Item 3.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
Risk.  

Not applicable. 

Item 4.    Controls and Procedures.  

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures
that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms and
that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal
Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating the
disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated,
can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment
in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. 

As required by Commission Rule 13a-15(b),
we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Principal Executive
Officer and Principal Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures
as of the end of the quarter covered by this report. Based on the foregoing, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial
Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level. 

There has been no change in our internal
control over financial reporting during the most recent fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to
materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II   OTHER
INFORMATION  

Item 1.    Legal Proceedings.  

We are not involved in any pending legal
proceedings. 

Item 1A.    Risk Factors.  

An investment in our common stock involves
significant risk. You should carefully consider the information described in the following risk factor, together with the other
information appearing elsewhere in this report, before making an investment decision regarding our common stock. You should also
consider the risk factors set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 ( 2015 Annual
Report ) under the caption  Item 1A. Risk Factors.   If any of the risks described below or in our
2015 Annual Report actually occur, our business, financial conditions, results of operation and future growth prospects would likely
be materially and adversely affected. In these circumstances, the market price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose
all or a part of your investment in our common stock.  Moreover, the risks described below and in our 2015 Annual Report are
not the only ones that we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect
our business, operating results, prospects or financial condition.  

We are in immediate need of additional
financing to fund our continuing operations beyond January 2017, and substantial additional capital in order to complete the development
of any of our product candidates. If we are unable to obtain such additional capital, we will be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate
our product development programs and may be forced to cease our operations altogether.   

We are in immediate need of additional
capital to fund our operations. As of September 30, 2016, we had approximately $2.1 million in cash and cash resources, and a
net working capital of approximately $0.8 million. During the year ended December 31, 2015 and the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, we had negative cash flow from operating activities of $10.0 million and $5.5 million, respectively, and
we expect our negative cash flows from operations to continue for the foreseeable future. Including the $3.0 million of
proceeds received, or that will be received, from our August 2016 Purchase Agreement, we believe that our existing capital is
only sufficient to fund our operations into January 2017 based on the current plan of expenditure on continuing development
of the current product candidates. We are therefore in immediate need of additional capital. Further, beyond funding our
basic corporate activities, we require substantial additional funds to support our continued research and development
activities, and the anticipated costs of preclinical studies and clinical trials, regulatory approvals and eventual
commercialization.  

Since we do not currently generate any revenue
from operations, nor do we expect to for the foreseeable future, the most likely sources of such additional capital include private
placements of our equity securities, including our common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for our common stock,
debt financing or funds from a potential strategic licensing or collaboration transaction in which we would license or otherwise
relinquish the rights to one or more of our product candidates. To the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing equity
securities, our stockholders will likely experience dilution, which may be significant depending on the number of shares we may
issue and the price per share. If we raise additional funds through collaborations and licensing arrangements, it may be necessary
to relinquish some rights to our technologies, product candidates or products, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable
to us. If we raise additional funds by incurring debt, we could incur significant interest expense and become subject to restrictive
covenants that could affect the manner in which we conduct our business. 

We currently have no committed sources of
additional capital and our access to capital funding is always uncertain. Despite our ability to secure adequate capital in the
past, there is no assurance that additional equity or debt financing will be available to us when needed, on acceptable terms or
even at all. If we fail to obtain the necessary additional capital when needed, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of,
or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs. In addition, we could be forced to discontinue product development,
reduce or forego attractive business opportunities and even cease our operations altogether.

Not applicable. 

Item 3.    Defaults Upon Senior Securities.  

Not applicable.

Pursuant to an Asset Purchase Option
Agreement dated March 21, 2016, as amended, between the Company and Vivacitas Oncology Inc. ( Vivacitas ),
on September 30, 2016, the Company sold all of its rights to the remaining assets related to the Company s former
AR-67 development program, which the Company had terminated in early 2012.  Such assets consisted primarily of
pre-clinical and clinical data, regulatory documentation and correspondence and certain intellectual property and
know-how.  In consideration for these assets, Vivacitas paid the Company $500,000.
