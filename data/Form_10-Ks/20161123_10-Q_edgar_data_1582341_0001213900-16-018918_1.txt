1.   
       Organization    

MyDx,
Inc. (the  Company ,  we ,  us  or  our ) (formally known as Brista Corp.) was
incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on December 20, 2012. The Company s wholly-owned subsidiary, CDx, Inc.,
was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on September 16, 2013.  

2.   
       Nature
    of Business    

We
are a science and technology company that has created the first battery operated, handheld, electronic analyzer for consumers.
Our products leverage the latest nanotechnology to accurately measure chemicals of interest in nearly any solid, liquid, or gas
sample, anywhere, anytime. Our mission is to enable people to live a healthier life by revealing the purity of certain compounds
they eat, drink and inhale in real time through a device they can hold in the palm of their hand. We believe that the broad application
and ease of use of our technology puts us in an ideal position to provide consumers with a practical and affordable way to trust
and verify what they are putting into their bodies without leaving the comfort of their homes.   

Our
initial product which we introduced in the third quarter of 2015, utilizes the CannaDx sensor to allow consumers to analyze cannabis.
During the third quarter of 2016 we introduced our AquaDx (water) and OrganaDx (food) sensors. Our product roadmap includes future
development and commercialization of these sensors and our AeroDx (air) sensor in 2017. We will require substantial additional
capital to finalize development and commercialize of our existing sensors and the AeroDx.  

We
have a portfolio of intellectual property rights covering principles and enabling instrumentation of chemical sensing technology
across solid, liquid, and gas samples, including certain patented and patent pending technologies from a third party pursuant
to a joint development agreement.

3.   
       Going
    Concern    

The
Company had limited revenues during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The Company currently has limited working capital,
and has not completed its efforts to establish a source of revenues sufficient to cover operating costs. The Company has a limited
operating history and its prospects are subject to risks, expenses and uncertainties frequently encountered by early-stage companies.
These risks include, but are not limited to, the uncertainty of availability of financing and the uncertainty of achieving future
profitability. Management anticipates that the Company will be dependent, for the near future, on investment capital to fund operating
expenses. The Company intends to position itself so that it may be able to raise funds through the capital markets. There can
be no assurance that such financing will be available at terms acceptable to the Company, if at all. Failure to generate sufficient
cash flows from operations, raise capital or reduce certain discretionary spending could have a material adverse effect on the
Company s ability to achieve its intended business objectives.  

We
reported negative cash flow from operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.
It is anticipated that we will continue to report negative operating cash flow in future periods, likely until one or more of
our products generates sufficient revenue to cover our operating expenses. If any of the warrants are exercised, all net proceeds
of the warrant exercise will be used for working capital to fund negative operating cash flow.  

Our
cash balance of $183,752 will not be sufficient to fund our operations for the next 12 months. Additionally, if we are unable
to generate sufficient revenues to pay our expenses, we will need to raise additional funds to continue our operations. We have
historically financed our operations through private equity and debt financings. The delays in our ability to ship products and
generate revenues may have adversely affected our capital raising opportunities. We do not have any commitments for financing
at this time, and financing may not be available to us on favorable terms, if at all. If we are unable to obtain debt or equity
financing in amounts sufficient to fund our operations, if necessary, we will be forced to suspend or curtail our operations.
In that event, current stockholders would likely experience a loss of most or all of their investment. Additional funding that
we do obtain may be dilutive to the interests of existing stockholders.

       Summary
    of Significant Accounting Policies    

Basis
of Presentation    

These
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States ( GAAP ) and applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC )
regarding interim financial reporting and include the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiary. Certain information
and note disclosures normally included in the consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed
or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. Accordingly, these interim condensed consolidated financial statements should
be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained in the Company s Form 10-K
filed with the SEC on April 27, 2016 and Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on August 15, 2016.

INC.   

   Notes
to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements   

  (unaudited)  

  continued  

The
unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated
financial statements and include all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for the fair presentation
of the Company s statement of financial position as of September 30, 2016 and the Company s results of operations
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 and its cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015. The results for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected
for the year ending December 31, 2016. All references to September 30, 2016 or to the three and nine months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015 in the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements are unaudited.  

Reclassifications    

Certain
prior year amounts in the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto have been reclassified where necessary to conform
to the current year presentation. These reclassifications did not affect the prior period total assets, total liabilities, stockholders'
deficit, net loss or net cash used in operating activities.  

Use
of Estimates    

The
preparation of the consolidated finance statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at
the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Such management estimates include allowance for doubtful accounts, estimates of product returns, warranty expense, inventory
valuation, valuation allowances of deferred taxes, stock-based compensation expenses and fair value of warrants. The Company bases
its estimates on historical experience and also on assumptions that it believes are reasonable. The Company assesses these estimates
on a regular basis; however, actual results could materially differ from those estimates.  

Concentration
of Credit Risk    

The
Company s policy is to place its cash with high credit quality financial instruments and institutions and limit the amounts
invested with any one financial institution or in any type of instrument. Deposits held with banks may exceed the amount of insurance
provided on such deposits. The Company has not experienced any losses on its deposits of cash.  

Concentration
of Risk Related to Third-party Suppliers     

We
depend on a limited number of third-party suppliers for the materials and components required to manufacture our products. A delay
or interruption by our suppliers may harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition, and could also adversely
affect our future profit margins. In addition, the lead time needed to establish a relationship with a new supplier can be lengthy,
and we may experience delays in meeting demand in the event we must change or add new suppliers. Our dependence on our suppliers
exposes us to numerous risks, including but not limited to the following: our suppliers may cease or reduce production or deliveries,
raise prices, or renegotiate terms; we may be unable to locate a suitable replacement supplier on acceptable terms or on a timely
basis, or at all; and delays caused by supply issues may harm our reputation, frustrate our customers, and cause them to turn
to our competitors for future needs.

Cash
and Cash Equivalents    

The
Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. As of
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company held no cash equivalents.  

Accounts
Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts    

Accounts
receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and are not interest bearing. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts
for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. The Company makes ongoing assumptions
relating to the collectability of its accounts receivable in its calculation of the allowance for doubtful accounts. In determining
the amount of the allowance, the Company makes judgments about the creditworthiness of customers based on ongoing credit evaluations
and assesses current economic trends affecting its customers that might impact the level of credit losses in the future and result
in different rates of bad debts than previously seen. The Company also considers its historical level of credit losses. As of
September 30, 2016, there was no allowance for doubtful accounts.  

Inventory    

Inventory
is stated at the lower of cost or market value. Inventory is determined to be salable based on demand forecast within a specific
time horizon, generally eighteen months or less. Inventory in excess of salable amounts and inventory which is considered obsolete
based upon changes in existing technology is written off. At the point of recognition, a new lower cost basis for that inventory
is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that new cost
basis.  

Property
and Equipment    

Property
and equipment are recorded at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are provided
using the straight-line method over the useful life as follows:  

Internal-use
    software       
      3
    years   
 
      Equipment       
      3
    to 5 years   
 
      Computer
    equipment       
      3
    to 7 years   
 
      Furniture
    and fixtures       
      5
    to 7 years   
 
      Leasehold
    improvements       
      Shorter
    of life of asset or lease   

Accounting
for Website Development Costs    

The
Company capitalizes certain external and internal costs, including internal payroll costs, incurred in connection with the development
of its website. These costs are capitalized beginning when the Company has entered the application development stage and cease
when the project is substantially complete and is ready for its intended use. The website development costs are amortized using
the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of three years.

Impairment
of Long-Lived Assets    

Long-lived
assets, such as property and equipment, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison
of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying
amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying
amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. Assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the condensed
balance sheets and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell, and no longer depreciated. The
assets and liabilities of a disposed group classified as held for sale would be presented separately in the appropriate asset
and liability sections of the condensed balance sheets.  

Convertible
Debt    

The
Company records a discount to convertible notes for the intrinsic value of conversion options embedded in debt instruments based
upon the differences between the fair value of the underlying common stock at the commitment date of the note transaction and
the effective conversion price embedded in the note. Debt discounts under these arrangements are amortized to noncash interest
expense using the effective interest rate method over the term of the related debt through their date of maturity. If a security
or instrument becomes convertible only upon the occurrence of a future event outside the control of the Company, or, is convertible
from inception, but contains conversion terms that change upon the occurrence of a future event, then any contingent beneficial
conversion feature is measured and recognized when the triggering event occurs and the contingency has been resolved.  

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments    

The
Company recognizes and discloses the fair value of its assets and liabilities using a hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to
valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to valuations based upon unadjusted
quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to valuations
based upon unobservable inputs that are significant to the valuation (Level 3 measurements). Each level of input has different
levels of subjectivity and difficulty involved in determining fair value.  

Level
    1  
      Inputs
    are unadjusted, quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets at the measurable date.   

Level
    2  
      Inputs,
    other than quoted prices included in Level 1, that are observable for the asset or liability through corroboration with market
    data at the measurement date.   

Level
    3  
      Unobservable
    inputs that reflect management s best estimate of what participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the
    measurement date.   

The
carrying amounts of the Company s financial assets and liabilities, including cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable,
and accrued liabilities approximate fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments. The carrying value of the Company s
loan payable and convertible notes payable approximates fair value based upon borrowing rates currently available to the Company
for loans with similar terms.  

Research
and Development Costs    

Research
and development costs are charged to expense as incurred. These costs consist primarily of salaries and direct payroll-related
costs. It also includes purchased materials and services provided by independent contractors, software developed by other companies
and incorporated into or used in the development of our final products.

Income
Taxes    

Deferred
tax assets and liabilities are recognized for expected future consequences of events that have been included in the financial
statements or tax returns. Under the asset and liability method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based
on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the currently
enacted tax rates and laws. A valuation allowance is provided for the amount of deferred tax assets that, based on available evidence,
are not expected to be realized. The provision for income taxes represents the tax payable for the period and the change during
the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities.  

Revenue
Recognition    

The
Company recognizes revenue from product sales upon shipment as long as evidence of an arrangement exists, the fee is fixed or
determinable, collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured and title and risk of loss have passed. If those criteria
are not met, then revenue will not be recognized until all of the criteria are satisfied.  

Product
Returns    

For
any product in its original, undamaged and unmarked condition, with its included accessories and packaging along with the original
receipt (or gift receipt) within 30 days of the date the customer receives the product, the Company will exchange it or offer
a refund based upon the original payment method.  

Customer
Deposits    

The
Company accounts for funds received from crowdfunding campaigns and pre-sales as a liability on the condensed consolidated balance
sheets as the investments made entitle the investor to apply these funds towards future shipments once the product has been developed
and available for commercial use.  

Stock-Based
Compensation    

The
Company accounts for stock-based awards granted to employees based on the fair value of the award measured at the grant date.
Accordingly, stock-based compensation is recognized in the condensed consolidated statements of operations as an operating expense
over the requisite service period. The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model adjusted for the estimated forfeiture
rate for the respective grant to determine the estimated fair value of stock-based compensation arrangements on the date of grant
and expenses this value ratably over the requisite service period of the stock option. The Black-Scholes option pricing model
requires the input of highly subjective assumptions. Because the Company s stock options have characteristics significantly
different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair
value estimate, in management s opinion, the existing models may not provide a reliable single measure of the fair value
of the Company s stock options. In addition, management will continue to assess the assumptions and methodologies used to
calculate estimated fair value of stock-based compensation. Circumstances may change and additional data may become available
over time, which could result in changes to these assumptions and methodologies for future grants, and which could materially
impact the Company s fair value determination.  

For
equity instruments granted to non-employees, excluding non-employee directors, the Company records the expense of such services
based on the estimated fair value of the equity instrument. If the equity instrument is a stock option, the Company uses the Black-Scholes
option pricing model to determine the fair value. Assumptions used to value the equity instruments are consistent with equity
instruments issued to employees as the terms of the awards are similar. The Company recognizes the fair value of the equity instruments
as expense over the term of the service agreement and revalues that fair value at each reporting period over the vesting periods
of the equity instruments.

Warranty    

The
Company provides a limited warranty for its analyzers and sensors for a period of 1 year from the date of shipment that such goods
will be free from material defects in material and workmanship. The Company has assessed the historical claims and, to date, warranty
claims have not been significant. The Company will continue to assess the need to record a warranty accrual at the time of sale
going forward.  

Warrant
Liability    

The
Company accounted for its freestanding warrant for shares of the Company s convertible preferred stock as a liability at
fair value on the condensed consolidated balance sheets because the warrants are potentially redeemable. The warrants are remeasured
at each balance sheet date with any changes in fair value being recognized as a component of interest expense, net on the consolidated
statements of operations. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the contingency was resolved and the warrant liability was
reclassified into addition paid-in capital upon their extinguishment.  

Comprehensive
Loss    

Comprehensive
loss is defined as the change in equity of a company during a period from transactions and other events and circumstances excluding
transactions resulting from investment owners and distributions to owners. For the periods presented, comprehensive loss did not
differ from net loss.  

Collaborative
Arrangements    

The
Company and its collaborative partners are active participants in the collaborative arrangements and both parties are exposed
to significant risks and rewards depending on the commercial success of the activity. The Company records all expenses related
to collaborative arrangements as research and development expense in the consolidated statements of operations as incurred.  

Advertising
Costs    

Advertising
costs are charged to sales and marketing expenses and general and administrative expenses as incurred. Advertising expenses, which
are recorded in sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses, totaled $51,774 and $10,933 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The advertising costs were $51,774 and $10,186 in sales and marketing and $0 and $747
in general and administrative expenses, respectively, for the years ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

Net
Loss per Share    

Basic
net loss per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. The number of shares used in the
computation of diluted net loss per share is the same as those used for the computation of basic net loss per share as the inclusion
of dilutive securities would be anti-dilutive because the Company is in a loss position for the periods presented. Potentially
dilutive securities are composed of the incremental common shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options and the conversion
of convertible preferred stock.  

For
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, options to purchase 4,123,186 shares of common stock and warrants to purchase
7,571,395 shares of common stock have been excluded from the calculation of net loss per share because the inclusion would be
anti-dilutive. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, options to purchase 4,438,867 shares of common stock and
warrants to purchase 7,571,395 shares of common stock have been excluded from the calculation of net loss per share because the
inclusion would be anti-dilutive.  

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements    

In
March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the  FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU )
No. 2016-09, ( ASU 2016-09 ), Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based
Payment Accounting. The amendments in this update simplify several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions
including: (a) income tax consequences; (b) classification of awards as either equity or liabilities; and (c) classification on
the statement of cash flows. For public entities, ASU 2016-09 is effective for financial statements issued for annual periods
beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. We do not expect the adoption of this standard
will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.

In
February 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, ( ASU 2016-02 ), Leases (Topic 842). The amendments in this update require
lessees to recognize a lease liability measured on a discounted basis and a right-of-use asset for all leases at the commencement
date. For public entities, ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within
those fiscal years, and is to be applied using a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at, or entered
into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. We are evaluating the new
guidelines to see if they will have a significant impact on our consolidated results of operation, financial condition or cash
flows.

issued upon conversion could not be determined at the date the Notes were issued. As such, upon conversion of the Notes the number
of shares will be determined and the Company will evaluate whether or not a beneficial conversion feature exists based on the
conversion price compared to the price of the Company s common stock at the date of issuance of the Notes. The Notes also
contain certain representations, warranties, covenants and events of default, and increases in the amount of the principal and

description of the rights and obligations of the parties thereunder, and such descriptions are qualified in their entirety by
reference to the agreements which are filed as an exhibit to the Company s Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on December
24, 2015. The issuance of the Note was made in reliance on the exemption provided by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act for the
offer and sale of securities not involving a public offering, and Regulation D promulgated under the Securities Act. The Company's
reliance upon Section 4(2) of the Securities Act in issuing the securities was based upon the following factors: (a) the issuance
of the securities was an isolated private transaction by us which did not involve a public offering; (b) there was only one recipient;
(c) there were no subsequent or contemporaneous public offerings of the securities by the Company; (d) the securities were not
broken down into smaller denominations; (e) the negotiations for the issuance of the securities took place directly between the
individual and the Company; and (f) the recipient of the Notes was an accredited investor. The Company recorded the original issue
discount of $2,750 as debt issuance cost on its balance sheet which is netted against the face value of the Note and is being
accreted over the term of the Note. For the three months ended September, 2016, the Company amortized a total of $3,250, of the
debt issuance cost.  

During
the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Note holder elected to convert a portion of the Note into 6,449,615 shares of the

Additional
Stock Plan Information

model with the weighted-average assumptions set forth in the following table. Volatility is based on historical volatility rates
obtained for certain public companies that operate in the same or related businesses as that of the Company since there is no
market for or historical volatility data for the Company s common stock. he risk-free interest rate is determined by using
a U.S. Treasury rate for them any uses a simplified method for  plain vanilla  share options in determining the expected
term of an employee share option as its equity shares are not publicly traded.

In
the normal course of business, the Company may be subject to other legal proceedings, lawsuits and other claims. Although the
ultimate aggregate amount of probable monetary liability or financial impact with respect to these matters is subject to many
uncertainties and is therefore not predictable with assurance, the Company s management believes that any monetary liability
or financial impact to the Company from these other matters, individually and in the aggregate, would not be material to the Company s
financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.  

However,
there can be no assurance with respect to such result, and monetary liability or financial impact to the Company from these other
matters could differ materially from those projected.

the historical financial statements that will be reflected in the Company s future financial statements filed with the SEC
will be those of CDx, and the Company s assets, liabilities and results of operations will be consolidated with the assets,
liabilities and results of operations of CDx. Accordingly, for clarity and continuity, we are presenting the historical financial
statements for CDx, Inc. for the periods presented.   

Overview   

The
Company s first product, MyDx   , is a multiuse hand-held chemical analyzer. Using one device with interchangeable
sensors, MyDx is intended to allow consumers to test for selected pesticides in food, fruits, herbs, plants and vegetables; chemicals
in water; and, toxins in the air. As of the date of this filing, the Company is offering the CannaDx TM  reusable electronic
sensor to be used for analyzing cannabis that is compatible with MyDx analyzer. The analyzer itself has an interface designed
to communicate with most iOS or Android smartphones via Bluetooth. Once the app is downloaded and the device is synced, a sample
can be placed in the sample chamber, which can be stimulated to release the chemicals of interest into the vapor phase for detection,
with the results reported on the smartphone App. The company has also recently launched its single use AquaDx TM  and
OrganaDx TM  sensors, which leverage established technology to detect pesticides and heavy metals in water and produce,
respectively.  

Plan
of Operations   

We
are aggressively pursuing plans to expand our distribution network and to continue our efforts to sell our products through our
on-line store. Our overall objective is to increase our revenues to generate adequate operating income sufficient to cover our
operating expenses going forward. The following are some of the recent achievements we have made during 2016 in our mission to
achieve our plan:  

In
June we launched our new, feature-rich CannaDx TM  smart phone App for both iOS and Android platforms. Along with the
wireless, multi-use MyDx chemical analyzer and its CannaDx sensor, this smart phone app is an integral component of the MyDx CannaDx
system.  

In
June we announced MyDx has signed an agreement with Arrow Electronics to scale its supply chain and contract manufacturing capabilities
for its MyDx product line. Under the terms of the agreement, Arrow Electronics will provide end-to-end supply chain management
and contract manufacturing support, technical support and a credit facility for the MyDx chemical analyzer product line.  

In
September we announced MyDx is launching its AquaDx  sensor chip for the analysis of toxic chemicals in water, and is now
accepting pre-orders at special pricing for early adopters.  The AquaDx Sensor works interchangeably with the MyDx Analyzer
and, along with the CannaDx  sensor.  

In
September we entered into a Distribution and License Agreement with a company operating under the charter of the People s
Republic of China as an authorized dealer of the Company s MyDx Sensor and MyDx Analyzer products with exclusive rights
to package and distribute the products in the People s Republic of China.  

In
October we announced MyDx is launching its OrganaDx TM  single use sensor chip for the analysis of pesticides and heavy
metals in cannabis, fruits and vegetables.   

In
November we announced that the  MyDx One  smart-phone app catapulted to the top of the iOS App Store charts fueled
by Novembers historic passage of state ballot initiatives in eight new states passing cannabis laws. The Company anticipates an
increase in revenues from this additional interest in our technology.

period ended September 30, 2015, the Company had completed its research and development stage and shipped its first product. The
decline in net revenues reflects the shipments in 2015 that were a cumulative buildup of pre-sales from the company inception.
During 2015, sales returns and allowances amounted to 7.3% of gross revenues versus 3.4% in 2016.  

Cost
of Goods Sold and Gross Profit

Expense   

Interest
expense totaled $807,622 and $1,051 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase of 806,571
resulted primarily from the increase of interest expense related to the convertible notes payable and amortization of debt issuance
costs related to the convertible notes payable outstanding during the three months ended September 30, 2016.

The
$198,338 gain on changes in fair value of derivative liabilities is resulted from the changes in fair value of embedded conversion
feature associated from the convertible notes payables.  

Loss
on settlement of debt   

Loss
on settlement of debt totaled $335,952 for the three month period ended September 30 2016. The loss reflects the discounted value
share conversion prices versus the market values for shares of common stock issued in settlement of debts.

the third quarter. The net revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 included $68,000 of revenue related to the sale
test result data.  

Cost
of Goods Sold and Gross Profit   

Gross
profit as a percentage of net revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 201 were 50.4% and 40.2%, respectively.
The gross margin was positively affected by the sale of test result data which had no related cost of sales. The effective gross
margin for product sales was 43.8%. This effective gross margin includes returns and allowances and discounts of approximately
9%. Excluding returns and allowances and discounts, our gross profit percentage was approximately 48.4% which is below our expected
normal gross margin of 50%.  

Operating
Expenses

for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. These operating expenses were composed of research and development costs, sales
and marketing and general and administrative expenses. The decrease is mainly resulted from the decrease of research and development
activities and the departure of certain independent contractors and officers of the Company which were partially offset by the
increase in marketing expenses for our marketing efforts in China P.R.  

Research
and Development Expenses   

Research
and development expenses primarily consist of engineering and product development, incurred in the design, development, testing
and enhancement of our products. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company expended $352,407 for various research

and amortization of debt issuance costs related to the convertible notes payable outstanding during the nine months ended September
30, 2016.  

Changes
in Fair Value of Derivative Liabilities   

The
$198,338 gain on changes in fair value of derivative liabilities is resulted from the changes in fair value of embedded conversion
feature associated from the convertible notes payables.  

Loss
on settlement of debt   

Loss
on settlement of debt totaled $409,887 for the nine month period ended September 30 2016. The loss reflects the discounted value
share conversion prices versus the market values for shares of common stock issued in settlement of a debts.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

Since
its inception, capital raised by the Company has been used primarily for the Company s research and development efforts
and to support its operations. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had remaining cash of $183,752 with a net working capital
deficit of $2,420,840. As a result of the Company s significant operating expenditures and the lack of significant product
sales revenue, we expect to incur losses from operations for the near future and will be required to seek additional capital to
sustain our operations.  

We
reported negative cash flow from operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.
It is anticipated that we will continue to report negative operating cash flow in future periods, likely until one or more of
our products generate sufficient revenue to cover our operating expenses. If any of the warrants are exercised, all net proceeds
of the warrant exercise will be used for working capital to fund negative operating cash flow.  

Our
cash balance of  $183,752 will not be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months. Additionally,
if we are unable to generate sufficient revenues to pay our expenses, we will need to raise additional funds to continue our operations.
We have historically financed our operations through private equity and debt financings. Recent economic turmoil and severe lack
of liquidity in the debt capital markets together with volatility and rapidly falling prices in the equity capital markets have
severely and adversely affected capital raising opportunities. We do not have any commitments for financing at this time, and
financing may not be available to us on favorable terms, if at all. If we are unable to obtain debt or equity financing in amounts
sufficient to fund our operations, if necessary, we will be forced to suspend or curtail our operations. In that event, current
stockholders would likely experience a loss of most or all of their investment. Additional funding that we do obtain may be dilutive
to the interests of existing stockholders.  

To
the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities or obtaining borrowings convertible into equity, ownership
dilution to existing stockholders will result and future investors may be granted rights superior to those of existing stockholders.
The incurrence of indebtedness or debt financing would result in increased fixed obligations and could also result in covenants
that would restrict our operations. Our ability to obtain additional capital may depend on prevailing economic conditions and
financial, business and other factors beyond our control. Economic crisis and disruptions in the U.S. and global financial markets
may adversely impact the availability and cost of credit, as well as our ability to raise money in the capital markets. Instability
in these market conditions may limit our ability to access the capital necessary to fund and grow our business. The Company cannot
provide any assurances that it will be able to raise the additional capital needed to fund its operations, or if the Company is
able to raise such additional capital, that any such financing will be on terms which are beneficial to the existing shareholders.  

Working
Capital   

Current
assets for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 decreased compared to December 31, 2015 primarily due to a decrease in inventories
and prepaid expenses.  

Current
liabilities for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 increased compared to December 31, 2015 primarily due to an increase in accrued
liabilities; asset based loans; accounts payable; derivative liability; plus, an increase in the current portion of convertible
notes payable.  

Cash
Flows   

Net
Cash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities     

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, cash used in operations was $698,547 which was primarily the result of a net loss of
approximately $4,348,000 and increases of approximately $30,000 in accounts receivable and a decrease of $2,000 in long-term portion
of leases payable which were partially offset by increases of approximately $1,770,000 in accounts payable and accrued liabilities
and decreases of approximately $111,000 in inventories; $69,000 in customer deposits; and $34,000 in prepaid expenses; and, non-cash
adjustments to net loss of approximately $410,000 in loss on debt settlement; $378,000 in stock-based compensation; $72,000 in
depreciation and impairment expense; and, $182,000, in interest expense related to amortization of debt issuance costs; and $549,000
resulted from the amortization of debt discount. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, cash used in operations was
approximately $4,105,000 which was primarily the result of a net loss of $5,729,000 increases of $522,000 in inventory purchases
and an increase of $99,000 in prepaid expenses; $117,000 in customer deposits; $7,000 in accounts receivable; a decrease of $165,000
in accounts payable and accrued liabilities all of which were partially offset by non-cash adjustments to net loss of $1,702,000
in common stock issued in exchange for services rendered; $419,000 in interest expense related to amortization of debt issuance
costs, $376,000 in stock-based compensation, and $37,000 in depreciation expense.  

Net
Cash Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities   

For
the nine months ended September, 2016 and 2015 cash used in investing activities totaled zero and $177,313, respectively, which
resulted from purchases of equipment for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  

Net
Cash Provided by Financing Activities   

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, financing activities provided cash of $738,619 which resulted from an increase of approximately
$223,000 in net proceeds from the issuance of asset based loans, net of issuance costs, $490,000 in proceeds from the issuance
of convertible notes payable, net of issuance costs; and $25,000 in proceeds from note payable related party, For the nine
months ended September 30, 2015, financing activities provided approximately $3,661,000 which resulted from an increase of approximately
$3,633,000 in proceeds from the issuance of convertible preferred stock, net of issuance costs; $25,000 in proceeds from note
payable-related party; and $3,000 in proceeds from issuance of common stock from exercise of stock options.  

Going
Concern     

At
September 30, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $14,245,551 and incurred a net loss of $4,347,986 for the nine month period
ended September 30, 2016.  We expect to incur further losses in the development of our business, all of which casts
substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon
our ability to generate future profitable operations and/or to obtain the necessary financing to meet our obligations and repay
our liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due.  

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements    

We
do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4) of Regulation S-K as of September 3, 2016.  

Item
3.      QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE
DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKS.   

There
have not been any material changes to our exposures to market risk during the three months ended September 30, 2016 that would
require an update to the relevant disclosures provided in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on April 27,
2016 and Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on August 15, 2016.  

Item
4.      CONTROLS AND PROCEDURE   S  

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   

Our
management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of our
disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended, as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, to provide reasonable assurance that
information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated
to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure, and that such information is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the SEC rules and forms. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer
have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective as of September 30, 2016, due to the fact that management
has not fully remediated the material weakness described in our Current Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission on April 27, 2016.  

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  

Limitations
on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures   

It
should be noted that any system of controls, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute,
assurance that the objectives of the system will be met. In addition, the design of any control system is based in part upon certain
assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its
stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions
or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective
control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.  

We
must maintain effective internal controls to provide reliable financial reports and to detect and prevent fraud. If we cannot
provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, we may not be able to manage our business as effectively as would be possible
with an effective control system in place. We have not performed an in-depth analysis to determine if historical undiscovered
failures of internal controls exist, and may in the future discover areas of our internal control that need improvement.  

We
have been assessing our internal controls to identify areas that need improvement. We are in the process of implementing changes
to internal controls, but have not yet completed implementing these changes. Failure to implement these changes to our internal
controls or any others that it identifies as necessary to maintain an effective system of internal controls could harm our operating
results and cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information. Any such loss of confidence would have a
negative effect on the trading price of our common stock.  

For
the year ended December 31, 2015, we and our independent registered public accounting firm identified a material weakness in our
internal control over financial reporting due to the Company not maintaining a sufficient complement of personnel with an appropriate
level of accounting knowledge and experience in the application of accounting for warrants to purchase common and preferred stock
issued in connection with convertible notes payable and convertible preferred stock and accounting for non-employee stock options.
A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that
there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company's annual or interim financial statements will not
be prevented or detected on a timely basis. If the Company does not address the material weaknesses, we may not be able to manage
our business as effectively as would be possible with an effective control system in place.

respective businesses across China, including Hong Kong and Taiwan, and 

Whereas,
 MyDx desires to expand its business in the Asian Market, mainly China, and needs certain expertise which the Developer possesses
or has access to in order to help achieve its growth, and 

  Whereas,  MyDx desires
to retain the Developer to provide executive business development services to take advantage of the Developer s expertise
and to exploit commercial opportunities, and the Developer is willing to provide such consulting services acting on behalf of MyDx. 

Now therefore,  in
consideration of the mutual covenants and promises contained herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:

    Engagement; Developer Relationship; Duties; Title .  MyDx hereby engages the Developer, and the Developer
hereby agrees to render, consulting services to MyDx in connection to the creation and development of MyDx Asia, the staffing of
the office and the future expansion of its business with a focus on the Greater China Region. The Developer shall perform the services
with a level of care, skill, and diligence that a prudent professional acting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters
would use, and shall agree to abide by the rules of governance established by MyDx s board of directors, including but not
limited to, the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and the Insider Trading Policies (copies of which are available and maintained
on the MyDx website).

other than for cause, it shall provide the Developer with thirty days notice. Should MyDx subsequently conclude a transaction
among those listed on Schedule A, within 12 months of Termination Date, MyDx shall pay to Developer any fees deriving from
such transactions in accordance with this Agreement.
