1. Basis of Presentation 
  Nature of Operations and Principles of Consolidation 
  Capital Bank Financial Corp. ( CBF  or the  Company  formerly known as North American Financial Holdings, Inc.) is a bank holding company incorporated in late 2009 in Delaware and headquartered in North Carolina whose business is conducted primarily through Capital Bank Corporation ( Capital Bank Corporation  or the  Bank ). The Company was incorporated with the goal of creating a regional banking franchise in the southeastern region of the United States through organic growth and acquisitions of other banks, including failed, underperforming and undercapitalized banks. CBF has raised   $955.6 million   to make acquisitions through a series of private placements and an initial public offering of its common stock. Since inception, CBF has acquired   seven   depository institutions, including the assets and certain deposits from failed banks. CBF has a total of   151   full service banking offices located in Florida, North and South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia. Through its branches CBF offers a wide range of commercial and consumer loans and deposits, as well as ancillary financial services. 
  The accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) for interim financial information and Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and disclosures required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statement presentation. In the opinion of management, all adjustments consisting of normal recurring accruals and disclosures considered necessary for a fair interim presentation have been included. All significant inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. For further information, refer to the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto included in the Company s annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. 
  Use of Estimates and Assumptions 
  To prepare financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as presented in the financial statements. These estimates and assumptions affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the disclosures provided, and actual results could differ. 
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
  In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standard Board (the  FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2016-15, "Statement of Cash Flows Credit Losses (Topic 230)". The amendments in this Update provide guidance on the following eight specific cash flow issues: (1) Debt Prepayment or Debt Extinguishment Costs: Cash payments for debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs should be classified as cash outflows for financing activities; (2) Settlement of Zero-Coupon Debt Instruments or Other Debt Instruments with Coupon Interest Rates That Are Insignificant in Relation to the Effective Interest Rate of the Borrowing: At the settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments or other debt instruments with coupon interest rates that are insignificant in relation to the effective interest rate of the borrowing, the issuer should classify the portion of the cash payment attributable to the accreted interest related to the debt discount as cash outflows for operating activities, and the portion of the cash payment attributable to the principal as cash outflows for financing activities; (3) Contingent Consideration Payments Made after a Business Combination: Cash payments not made soon after the acquisition date of a business combination by an acquirer to settle a contingent consideration liability should be separated and classified as cash outflows for financing activities and operating activities. Cash payments up to the amount of the contingent consideration liability recognized at the acquisition date (including measurement-period adjustments) should be classified as financing activities; any excess should be classified as operating activities. Cash payments made soon after the acquisition date of a business combination by an acquirer to settle a contingent consideration liability should be classified as cash outflows for investing activities; (4) Proceeds from the Settlement of Insurance Claims: Cash proceeds received from the settlement of insurance claims should be classified on the basis of the related insurance coverage (that is, the nature of the loss). For insurance proceeds that are received in a lump-sum settlement, an entity should determine the classification on the basis of the nature of each loss included in the settlement; (5) Proceeds from the Settlement of Corporate-Owned Life Insurance Policies, including Bank-Owned Life Insurance Policies: Cash proceeds received from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies should be classified as cash inflows from investing activities. The cash payments for premiums on corporate-owned policies may be classified as cash outflows for investing activities, operating activities, or a combination of investing and operating activities; (6) Distributions Received from Equity Method Investees: When a reporting entity applies the equity method, it should make an accounting policy election to classify distributions received from equity method investees using either of the following approaches: a. Cumulative earnings approach: Distributions received are considered returns on investment and classified as cash inflows from operating activities, unless the investor s cumulative distributions received less distributions received in prior periods that were determined to be returns of investment exceed cumulative equity in earnings recognized by the investor. When such an excess occurs, the current-period distribution up to this excess should be considered a return of investment and classified as cash inflows from investing activities. b. Nature of the distribution approach: Distributions received should be classified on the basis of the nature of the activity or activities of the investee that generated the distribution as either a return on investment (classified as cash inflows from operating activities) or a return of investment (classified as cash inflows from investing activities) when such information is available to the investor. If an entity elects to apply the nature of the distribution approach and the information to apply that approach to distributions received from an individual equity method investee is not available to the investor, the entity should report a change in accounting principle on a retrospective basis by applying the cumulative earnings approach in (1) for that investee. In such situations, an entity should disclose that a change in accounting principle has occurred with respect to the affected investee(s) due to the lack of available information and should provide the disclosures required in paragraphs 250-10-50-1(b) and 250-10-50-2, as applicable. This amendment does not address equity method investments measured using the fair value option; (7) Beneficial Interests in Securitization Transactions: A transferor s beneficial interest obtained in a securitization of financial assets should be disclosed as a non cash activity, and cash receipts from payments on a transferor s beneficial interests in securitized trade receivables should be classified as cash inflows from investing activities; (8) Separately Identifiable Cash Flows and Application of the Predominance Principle: The classification of cash receipts and payments that have aspects of more than one class of cash flows should be determined first by applying specific guidance in generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). In the absence of specific guidance, an entity should determine each separately identifiable source or use within the cash receipts and cash payments on the basis of the nature of the underlying cash flows. An entity should then classify each separately identifiable source or use within the cash receipts and payments on the basis of their nature in financing, investing, or operating activities. In situations in which cash receipts and payments have aspects of more than one class of cash flows and cannot be separated by source or use, the appropriate classification should depend on the activity that is likely to be the predominant source or use of cash flows for the item. The amendments in this Update are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. For all other entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. If an entity early adopts the amendments in an interim period, any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period. An entity that elects early adoption must adopt all of the amendments in the same period. The amendments in this Update should be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented. If it is impracticable to apply the amendments retrospectively for some of the issues, the amendments for those issues would be applied prospectively as of the earliest date practicable.  The Company is currently evaluating this ASU to determine the impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, "Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326)". Assets Measured at Amortized Cost this update requires a financial asset (or a group of financial assets) measured at amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. The allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial asset(s) to present the net carrying value at the amount expected to be collected on the financial asset. The income statement reflects the measurement of credit losses for newly recognized financial assets, as well as the expected increases or decreases of expected credit losses that have taken place during the period. The measurement of expected credit losses is based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. An entity must use judgment in determining the relevant information and estimation methods that are appropriate in its circumstances. The allowance for credit losses for purchased financial assets with a more-than insignificant amount of credit deterioration since origination (PCD assets) that are measured at amortized cost basis is determined in a similar manner to other financial assets measured at amortized cost basis; however, the initial allowance for credit losses is added to the purchase price rather than being reported as a credit loss expense. Only subsequent changes in the allowance for credit losses are recorded as a credit loss expense for these assets. Interest income for PCD assets should be recognized based on the effective interest rate, excluding the discount embedded in the purchase price that is attributable to the acquirer assessment of credit losses at acquisition. Available-for-Sale Debt Securities Credit losses relating to available-for-sale debt securities should be recorded through an allowance for credit losses. Available-for-sale accounting recognizes that value may be realized either through collection of contractual cash flows or through sale of the security. Therefore, the amendments limit the amount of the allowance for credit losses to the amount by which fair value is below amortized cost because the classification as available for sale is premised on an investment strategy that recognizes that the investment could be sold at fair value, if cash collection would result in the realization of an amount less than fair value. The allowance for credit losses for purchased available-for-sale securities with a more-than-insignificant amount of credit deterioration since origination is determined in a similar manner to other available-for-sale debt securities; however, the initial allowance for credit losses is added to the purchase price rather than reported as a credit loss expense. Only subsequent changes     in the allowance for credit losses are recorded in credit loss expense. Interest income should be recognized based on the effective interest rate, excluding the discount embedded in the purchase price that is attributable to the acquirer s assessment of credit losses at acquisition. For public business entities that are U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filers, the amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. For all other public business entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently evaluating this ASU to determine the impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
  In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)". The core principle of the guidance in Topic 606 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in 2 exchange for those goods or services. To achieve that core principle, an entity should apply the following steps: (1) Identify the contract(s) with a customer; (2) Identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) Determine the transaction price; (4) Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; (5) Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. The amendments in this Update do not change the core principle of the guidance in Topic 606. The amendments in this Update affect the guidance in Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which is not yet effective. The effective date and transition requirements for the amendments in this Update are the same as the effective date and transition requirements for Topic 606 (and any other Topic amended by Update 2014-09). Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date, defers the effective date of Update 2014-09 by one year. The Company is currently evaluating this ASU to determine the impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-9, "Compensation Stock compensation (Topic 718)". Improvements to employee share-based payment accounting" which objective is the simplification through the identification, evaluation, and improvement of areas of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for which cost and complexity can be reduced while maintaining or improving the usefulness of the information provided to users of financial statements. The areas for simplification involve several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. Some of the areas for simplification apply only to nonpublic entities. The adoption of ASU 2016-9 will be effective for the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company is currently evaluating this ASU to determine the impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-7, "Investments Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323)". The amendments in this Update eliminate the requirement that when an investment qualifies for use of the equity method as a result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence, an investor must adjust the investment, results of operations, and retained earnings retroactively on a step-bystep basis as if the equity method had been in effect during all previous periods that the investment had been held. The amendments require that the equity method investor add the cost of acquiring the additional interest in the investee to the current basis of the investor s previously held interest and adopt the equity method of accounting as of the date the investment becomes qualified for equity method accounting. Therefore, upon qualifying for the equity method of accounting, no retroactive adjustment of the investment is required. The amendments in this Update require that an entity that has an available-forsale equity security that becomes qualified for the equity method of accounting recognize through earnings the unrealized holding gain or loss in accumulated 2 other comprehensive income at the date the investment becomes qualified for use of the equity method. The amendments in this Update are effective for all entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016. The amendments should be applied prospectively upon their effective date to increases in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence that result in the adoption of the equity method. Earlier application is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating this ASU to determine the impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-6, "Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Contingent Put and Call Options in Debt Instruments". The amendments in this Update clarify the requirements for assessing whether contingent call (put) options that can accelerate the payment of principal on debt instruments are clearly and closely related to their debt hosts. An entity performing the assessment under the amendments in this Update is required to assess the embedded call (put) options solely in accordance with the four-step decision sequence. For public business entities, the amendments in this Update are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. If an entity early adopts the amendments in an interim period, any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period. The Company is currently evaluating this ASU to determine the impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-2, "Leases (Topic 842)" which increases transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. To meet that objective, the FASB is amending the FASB Accounting Standards Codification and creating Topic 842, Leases. This Update, along with IFRS 16, Leases, are the results of the FASB s and the International Accounting Standards Board s (IASB s) efforts to meet that objective and improve financial reporting. The Boards decided to not fundamentally change lessor accounting with the amendments in this Update. However, some changes have been made to lessor accounting to conform and align that guidance with the lessee guidance and other areas within generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), such as Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The main difference between previous GAAP and Topic 842 is the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases under previous GAAP. The adoption of ASU 2016-2 will be effective for the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating this ASU to determine the impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-1, "Financial instruments Overall (Subtopic 825-10)" which requires all equity investments to be measured at fair value with changes in the fair value recognized through net income (other than those accounted for under equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee). The amendments in this Update also require an entity to present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument specific credit risk when the entity has elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments. In addition, the amendments in this Update eliminate the requirement to disclose the fair value of financial instruments measured at amortized cost for entities that are not public business entities and the requirement to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet for public business entities. For public business entities, the amendments in ASU 2016-1 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The adoption of ASU 2016-1 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 

2. Earnings Per Common Share 
  Basic earnings per share is computed as net income attributable to common shareholders divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share include the dilutive effect of additional potential common shares issuable under stock options and unvested restricted shares computed using the treasury stock method. Earnings per share have been computed based on the following: 

The dilutive effect of stock options and unvested restricted shares are the only common stock equivalents for purposes of calculating diluted earnings per common share. 
  Weighted average anti-dilutive stock options and unvested restricted shares excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share are as follows:

3. Business Combinations and Acquisitions 
    
  Pending Acqusitions at September 30, 2016 
    
  On November 22, 2015, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with CommunityOne Bancorp, or CommunityOne, pursuant to which CommunityOne will merge with and into CBF on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the CommunityOne Merger Agreement (the  Merger ). CommunityOne is a bank holding company headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina. Founded in 1907 as First National Bank of Asheboro, CommunityOne operates   45   banking centers. At June 30, 2016 CommunityOne reported total assets of    $2.4 billion    and net loans of   $1.5 billion  . Pursuant to the merger agreement, shareholders of CommunityOne have the right to receive,   $14.25   per share in cash or   0.43   of a share of Capital Bank Class A common stock, with the total consideration to consist of   85%   stock and   15%   cash. The transaction closed on October 26, 2016. Based on Capital Bank's closing share price of   $32.20  , this represents a total transaction value of approximately   $338 million  . Due to the timing of the acquisition, the Company is continuing to determine the preliminary fair values of the assets and liabilities assumed and the purchase price allocation. The Company expects to finalize the analysis of the acquired assets and liabilities over the next few months and within   one year   of the acquisition. 

4. Investment Securities 
  Trading securities totaled $  3.7 million   and   $3.0 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  The amortized cost and estimated fair value of investment securities available-for-sale and held-to-maturity at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , are presented below:

Securities with unrealized losses not recognized in income, and the period of time they have been in an unrealized loss position, are as follows:

  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 

As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company s security portfolio consisted of   143   securities,   11   of which were in an unrealized loss position. The majority of unrealized losses are related to the Company s corporate bonds and mortgage-backed securities. 
  The corporate bonds in an unrealized loss position at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   continue to perform and are expected to perform through maturity. Unrealized losses associated with these securities are primarily due to changes in interest rates and market volatility, and the corporate issuers have not experienced significant adverse events that would call into question their ability to repay those debt obligations according to contractual terms. Further, because the Company does not have the intent to sell these corporate bonds and it is more likely than not that it will not be required to sell the securities before their anticipated recovery of their amortized cost bases, the Company does not consider these securities to be other-than-temporarily impaired as of   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  . 
  All of the mortgage-backed securities at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   were issued by U.S. government-sponsored entities and agencies, which the government has affirmed its commitment to support. Unrealized losses associated with these securities are attributable to changes in interest rates and illiquidity, and not credit quality, and because the Company does not have the intent to sell these mortgage-backed securities and it is more likely than not that it will not be required to sell the securities before their anticipated recovery, the Company does not consider these securities to be other-than-temporarily impaired at   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  . 
  Investment securities having carrying values of approximately   $404.0 million   and   $311.5 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, were pledged to secure public funds on deposit, securities sold under agreements to repurchase, and for other purposes as required by law.

5. Loans 
  Major classifications of loans, including loans held for sale, are as follows: 

Total loans include   $8.2 million   and   $10.6 million   of   1  -4   family residential loans held for sale,   $87.1 million   and   $0.0 million   of Commercial and Industrial loans held for sale and   $16.1 million   and   $17.1 million   of net deferred loan origination costs and fees as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , other loans include   $38.9 million  ,   $134.4 million   and   $1.2 million   of farm land, state and political subdivision obligations and deposit customer overdrafts, respectively. As of   December 31, 2015  , other loans include   $42.8 million  ,   $96.2 million   and   $1.3 million   of farm land, state and political subdivision obligations and deposit customer overdrafts, respectively.  
  Covered loans represent loans acquired from the FDIC subject to loss sharing agreements. Covered loans are further broken out into (i) loans acquired with evidence of credit impairment ( Purchased Credit Impaired", "Acquired Impaired", or "PCI Loans ) and (ii) non-PCI loans. Loans originated or purchased by the Company ( New Loans ) and loans acquired through the purchase of Capital Bank Corp. ("CBKN"), Green Bankshares ("GRNB"), Southern Community Financial ("SCMF" or "Southern Community") and TIB Financial ("TIBB"), are not subject to the loss sharing agreements and are classified as  non-covered.  Additionally, certain consumer loans acquired through the acquisition of First National Bank of the South, Metro Bank and Turnberry Bank (collectively, the  Failed Banks ) from the FDIC, are specifically excluded from the loss sharing agreements. 
  On March 18, 2016, the Bank entered into an agreement to terminate all existing loss sharing agreements with the FDIC effective January 1, 2016. All rights and obligations of the Bank and the FDIC under these loss sharing agreements have been resolved and terminated under this agreement. Covered loans and OREO that were subject to the loss sharing agreements were reclassified and are presented as non-covered. 
  The Company designates loans as PCI by evaluating both qualitative and quantitative factors. At the time of acquisition, the Company accounted for the PCI loans by segregating each portfolio into loan pools with similar risk characteristics. Over the lives of the acquired PCI loans, the Company continues to estimate cash flows expected to be collected on each loan pool. The Company evaluates, at each balance sheet date, whether its estimates of the present value of the cash flows from the loan pools, determined using the effective interest rates, has decreased, such that the present value of such cash flows is less than the recorded investment of the pool, and if so, recognizes a provision for loan loss in its Consolidated Statements of Income, unless related to non-credit events.  
  Additionally, if the Company has favorable changes in estimates of cash flows expected to be collected for a loan pool such that the then-present value exceeds the recorded investment of that pool, the Company will first reverse any previously established allowance for loan and lease losses for the pool. If such estimate exceeds the amount of any previously established allowance, the Company will accrete future interest income over the remaining life of the pool at a rate which, when used to discount the expected cash flows, results in the then-present value of such cash flows equaling the recorded investment of the pool at the time of the revised estimate.

The table below presents a roll forward of accretable yield and income expected to be earned related to PCI loans and the amount of non-accretable difference at the end of the period. Nonaccretable difference represents estimated contractually required payments in excess of estimated cash flows expected to be collected. The accretable yield represents the excess of estimated cash flows expected to be collected over the carrying amount of the PCI loans. Other represents reductions of accretable yield due to non-credit events such as interest rate reductions on variable rate PCI loans and prepayment activity on PCI loans. 

The accretable yield is accreted into interest income over the estimated life of the PCI loans using the level yield method. The accretable yield will change due to changes in: 
             
    The estimate of the remaining life of PCI loans which may change the amount of future interest income, and possibly principal, expected to be collected; 
                
    The estimate of the amount of contractually required principal and interest payments over the estimated life that will not be collected (the nonaccretable difference); and 
                
    Indices for PCI loans with variable rates of interest. 
     For PCI loans, the impact of loan modifications is included in the evaluation of expected cash flows for subsequent decreases or increases of cash flows. For variable rate PCI loans, expected future cash flows will be recalculated as the rates adjust over the lives of the loans. At acquisition, the expected future cash flows were based on the variable rates that were in effect at that time.

Credit Quality Indicators 
  The Company categorizes loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as: current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other factors. The Company analyzes loans individually by classifying the loans as to credit risk. This analysis is performed at origination and upon identification of a material change for all loans, on an annual basis for commercial loans exceeding   $0.5 million  , and at least quarterly for commercial loans not rated pass. The Company uses the following definitions for risk ratings: 

Pass    These loans range from superior quality with minimal credit risk to loans requiring heightened management attention but that are still an acceptable risk and continue to perform as contracted. 
                
    Special Mention    Loans classified as special mention have a potential weakness that deserves management s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of the institution s credit position at some future date. 
                
    Substandard    Loans classified as substandard are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. 
                
    Doubtful    Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable.

Troubled Debt Restructuring 
  If a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, the Bank may consider, in certain circumstances, modifying the terms of their loan to maximize collection of amounts due. A troubled debt restructuring ( TDR ) typically involves either a reduction of the stated interest rate of the loan, an extension of the loan s maturity date(s) with a stated rate lower than the current market rate for a new loan with similar risk, or in limited circumstances, a reduction of the principal balance of the loan or the loan s accrued interest. Upon modification of a loan, the Bank measures the related impairment as the excess of the recorded investment in the loan over the discounted expected future cash flows. The present value of expected future cash flows is discounted at the loan s effective interest rate. If the impairment analysis results in a loss, an allowance for loan and lease losses is established for the loan. During the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , loans modified in TDRs were nominal. Because of the insignificance of the amount and the nature of the modifications, the modifications did not have a material impact on the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements or on the determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses at   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . The Company had loans modified in TDRs with recorded investments of   $0.2 million   and   $2.3 million   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively. The Company had loans modified in TDRs with recorded investments of   $0.7 million   and   $1.4 million   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , respectively. 
   
  7. FDIC Indemnification Asset 
  The Company has recorded an indemnification asset related to loss sharing agreements entered into with the FDIC wherein the FDIC will reimburse the Company for certain amounts related to certain acquired loans and other real estate owned should the Company experience a loss. Under the loss sharing arrangements, the FDIC has agreed to absorb   80%   of all future credit losses and workout expenses on these assets which occur prior to the expiration of the loss sharing agreements. These agreements resulted from the purchase of the Failed Banks. 
  The loss sharing agreements consisted of   three   (one for each Failed Bank) single-family shared-loss agreements and   three   (one for each Failed Bank) commercial and other loans shared-loss agreements. The single family shared-loss agreements provided for FDIC loss sharing and our reimbursement for recoveries to the FDIC for   ten years   from July 16, 2010 for single-family residential loans. The commercial shared-loss agreements provided for FDIC loss sharing for   five years   from July 16, 2010 and our reimbursement for recoveries to the FDIC for   eight years   from July 16, 2010 for all other covered assets. On March 18, 2016, the Bank entered into an agreement to terminate all existing loss share agreements with the FDIC effective January 1, 2016.  All rights and obligations of the Bank and the FDIC under these FDIC loss share agreements have been resolved and terminated under this agreement. 
  The FDIC received   $3.0 million   as consideration for the early termination of the agreements. The early termination was recorded in the Bank's financial statements by removing the FDIC Indemnification Asset receivable, the FDIC Clawback liability and recording a one-time, pre-tax expense on termination of    $9.2 million  . 
  The following is a summary of the activity in the FDIC indemnification asset:

  The activity within Other Real Estate Owned ( OREO ) for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   is presented in the table below. 

The loss share agreements with the FDIC were terminated effective January 1, 2016. As of September 30, 2015, the ending balance for OREO covered by loss sharing agreements with the FDIC was   $0.3 million   and non-covered OREO ending balance was   $54.4 million  . For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , proceeds on sales of OREO were   $1.4 million   and   $13.2 million  , respectively and net gains were   $0.2 million   and   $1.3 million  , respectively. For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , proceeds on sales of OREO were   $9.2 million   and   $28.0 million   , respectively and net gains were   $0.4 million   and   $1.3 million  , respectively. 
   
  9. Federal Home Loan Bank Advances and Short-Term Borrowings 
  Short-term borrowings include securities sold under agreements to repurchase, cash received from counterparties as collateral for mark-to-market exposure on interest rate swaps and advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank ( FHLB ). 
  The Bank has securities sold under agreements to repurchase with customers. These overnight agreements are collateralized by investment securities of the United States Government or its agencies which are chosen by the Bank. The amounts outstanding at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   were   $10.9 million   and   $11.6 million  , respectively, and were collateralized by   $15.4 million   and   $22.9 million  , respectively, of agency mortgage-backed securities. 
  The Bank has   $4.5 million   of short term borrowings related to cash received from counterparties as collateral for mark-to-market exposure on interest rate swaps at   September 30, 2016  . 
  The Bank invests in FHLB stock for the purpose of establishing credit lines with the FHLB. The credit availability to the Bank is based on a percentage of the Bank s total assets as reported on the most recent quarterly financial information submitted to the regulators subject to the pledging of sufficient collateral. The Bank s collateral with the FHLB consists of a blanket floating lien pledge of the Bank s residential 1-4 family mortgage, multifamily, home equity line of credit and commercial real estate secured loans. The amounts of eligible collateral at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   provided for incremental borrowing availability of up to   $342.6 million   and   $416.9 million  , respectively. 
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Bank had   $15.4 million   and   $25.4 million   in letters of credit issued by the FHLB respectively, of which   $15.2 million   and   $25.2 million   are used as collateral for public funds deposits in lieu of pledging securities to the State of Florida, respectively. 
    
  The FHLB advances as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   consisted of the following:

10. Long-Term Borrowings 
    
  Subordinated Debentures 
  Through its acquisitions of CBKN, GRNB, SCMF and TIBB, the Company assumed the   eleven   separate pooled offerings of trust preferred securities listed below. The Company is not considered the primary beneficiary of the trusts (variable interest entities), therefore the trusts are not consolidated in the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements, but rather the subordinated debentures are presented as liabilities. The trusts consist of wholly-owned statutory trust subsidiaries for the purpose of issuing the trust preferred securities. The trusts used the proceeds from the issuance of trust preferred securities to acquire junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures of the Company. The trust preferred securities essentially mirror the debt securities, carrying a cumulative preferred dividend equal to the interest rate on the debt securities. The debt securities and the trust preferred securities each have   30  -year lives. The trust preferred securities and the debt securities are callable by the Company or the trust, at their respective option after a period of time, and at varying premiums and sooner in specific events, subject to prior approval by the Federal Reserve Board ( FRB ), if then required. Deferral of interest payments on the trust preferred securities is allowed for up to   60 months   without being considered an event of default.  
    
  The subordinated debentures as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   consisted of the following:

11. Shareholders  Equity and Minimum Regulatory Capital Requirements 
  The Company (on a consolidated basis) and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by federal and state banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements results in certain discretionary and required actions by regulators that could have an effect on the Company s operations. The regulations require the Company and the Bank to meet specific capital adequacy guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets, liabilities, and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Company s capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings, and other factors. 
  To be considered well capitalized or adequately capitalized as defined under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Bank must maintain minimum Tier 1 leverage, Tier 1 common, Tier 1 risk-based and Total Risk-based ratios. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   the Bank maintained capital ratios exceeding the requirement to be considered well capitalized. These minimum ratios along with the actual ratios for the Company and the Bank are presented in the following tables: 

31 

     Table of Contents  
  Capital Bank Financial Corp. 
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 

In August 2010, the Bank entered into an Operating Agreement with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the  OCC Operating Agreement ). The OCC Operating Agreement required the Bank to maintain total capital equal to at least   12%   of risk-weighted assets, Tier 1 Capital equal to at least   11%   of risk-weighted assets and a minimum leverage ratio of   10%   (Tier 1 Capital ratio). On August 31, 2015, the OCC terminated this agreement and as a result the Bank is no longer subject to special de novo capital requirements and other restrictions. 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company and the Bank met all capital requirements to which they were subject. Tier 1 Capital for the Company includes trust preferred securities to the extent allowable. 
  The OCC Operating Agreement required prior approval from the OCC before paying a dividend to the Company. Dividends that may be paid by a national bank are limited to that bank s retained net profits for the preceding   two years   plus retained net profits up to the date of any dividend declaration in the current calendar year. Subsequent to receiving approval from the OCC, the Company received dividends from the Bank totaling   $64.2 million  ,   $199.4 million  ,   $56.0 million   and   $105.0 million   on June 1, 2016, January 30, 2015, July 15, 2014 and September 24, 2013, respectively. The Company may use these dividends for general corporate purposes including acquisitions, or as a return of capital to shareholders through future share repurchases or dividends.  
   In July 2013, the U.S. banking regulators adopted a final rule which implements the Basel III regulatory capital reforms from the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, and certain changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act. The final rule established an integrated regulatory capital framework and introduces the  Standardized Approach  for risk-weighted assets, which replaces the Basel I risk-based guidance for determining risk-weighted assets as of January 1, 2015, the date the Company became subject to the new rules. Based on the Company's current capital composition and levels, the Company believes it is in compliance with the requirements as set forth in the final rules. 
  The rules include new risk-based capital and leverage ratios, which will be phased in from 2015 to 2019, and refine the definition of what constitutes  capital  for purposes of calculating those ratios. The new minimum capital level requirements applicable to the Company and the Bank under the final rules are as follows: (i) a new common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of   4.5%  ; (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of   6%   (increased from   4%  ); (iii) a total capital ratio of   8%   (unchanged from previous rules); and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of   4%   for all institutions. The final rules also establish a  capital conservation buffer  above the new regulatory minimum capital requirements. The capital conservation buffer will be phased-in over   four   years beginning on January 1, 2016, as follows: the maximum buffer will be   0.625%   of risk-weighted assets for 2016,   1.25%   for 2017,   1.875%   for 2018, and   2.5%   for 2019 and thereafter. This will result in the following minimum ratios beginning in 2019: (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of   7.0%  , (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of   8.5%  , and (iii) a total capital ratio of   10.5%  . Under the final rules, institutions are subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying  
  
   32 

     Table of Contents  
  Capital Bank Financial Corp. 
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 

discretionary bonuses if its capital level falls below the buffer amount. These limitations establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions. As of   September 30, 2016  , our capital buffer would be   4.7%  ; exceeding the   2.5%   2019 requirement. 
  The final rules also contain revisions to the prompt corrective action framework, which is designed to place restrictions on insured depository institutions if their capital levels begin to show signs of weakness. Under the prompt corrective action requirements, which are designed to complement the capital conservation buffer, insured depository institutions are required to meet the following increased capital level requirements in order to qualify as  well capitalized:  (i) a new common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of   6.5%  ; (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of   8%   (increased from   6%  ); (iii) a total capital ratio of   10%   (unchanged from previous rules); and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of   5%   (unchanged from previous rules). 
    
  Dividend Program 
    
  On October 19, 2016, the Company's board of directors approved a quarterly common dividend of   $0.12   per share   payable on November 22, 2016, to shareholders of record as of November 9, 2016. 
  S  hare Repurchases 
  The Company s Board of Directors has authorized stock repurchases of up to   $400.0 million  . Stock repurchases may be made from time to time, on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The approved stock repurchase program does not obligate the Company to repurchase any particular amount of shares, and the program may be extended, modified, suspended, or discontinued at any time.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company has repurchased a total of   $298.6 million  , or   12,644,660   common shares at an average price of   $24.19   per share with   $101.4 million   remaining under the current board authorized stock repurchase program.  
  The Company accounts for treasury stock using the cost method as a reduction of shareholders  equity in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and Statements of Changes in Shareholders  Equity.

  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   two   compensation plans, the 2010 Equity Incentive Plan ("the "2010 Plan") and the 2013 Omnibus Compensation Plan (the  2013 Plan ) under which shares of its common stock are issuable in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock awards, stock bonus awards and other incentive awards. The 2010 Plan was replaced by the 2013 Plan and no further awards may be made pursuant to the 2010 Plan. 
  The 2013 Plan was effective   May 22, 2013   and expires on   May 22, 2023  , the tenth anniversary of the effective date. The maximum number of shares of common stock of the Company that may be optioned or awarded under this plan is   2,639,000   shares. Awards under this plan may be made to any person selected by the Compensation Committee. 
  The following table summarizes the components and classification of stock-based compensation expense for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

The tax benefit related to stock-based compensation expense arising from restricted stock awards and non-qualified stock options was   $0.3 million   and   $0.1 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively and   $0.6 million   and   $0.3 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
  Stock Options 
  Under the 2010 Plan and 2013 Plan, the exercise price for common stock must equal at least   100%   of the fair market value of the stock on the day an option is granted. The exercise price under an incentive stock option granted to a person owning stock representing more than   10%   of the common stock must equal at least   110%   of the fair market value at the date of grant, and such option is not exercisable after   five years   from the date the incentive stock option was granted. The Board of Directors may, at its discretion, provide that an option not be exercised in whole or in part for any period or periods of time as specified in the option agreements. Stock options have an expiration of   ten   years from the date it is granted. Under these plans,    36,000   options were exercised and   30,207   stock options were granted during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  .  
  ASC 718 requires the recognition of stock-based compensation expense for the number of awards that are ultimately expected to vest. During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , stock based compensation expense was recorded based upon assumptions that the Company would experience no forfeitures. This assumption of forfeitures will be reassessed in subsequent periods based on historical forfeiture rates and may change based on new facts and circumstances. Any changes in assumptions will be accounted for prospectively in the period of change. 
  A summary of the stock option activity for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   is as follows:

At   September 30, 2016  , the weighted average remaining contractual life for outstanding stock options was approximately   4.24 years   and the aggregate intrinsic values was   $39.3 million   for stock options outstanding and exercisable.  
  The intrinsic value for stock options is calculated as the difference between the exercise price of the underlying awards and the market price of the Company s common stock as of the reporting date. 
  Options outstanding at   September 30, 2016   were as follows: 

Restricted Stock 
  Restricted stock provides the grantee with voting, dividend and anti-dilution rights equivalent to common shareholders, but is restricted from transfer until vested, at which time all restrictions are removed. The restricted stock vests ratably over a   three  -year period subject to continued employment with the company. The value of the restricted stock is being amortized on a straight-line basis over the implied service periods. There were   194,636   restricted stock awards granted under the 2013 Plan during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  .

13. Income Taxes 
  A reconciliation of income tax computed at applicable Federal statutory income tax rates to total income tax expense reported for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   is as follows: 

The Company uses an estimated annual effective tax rate method of computing its interim tax provision. The effective tax rate is based on forecasted annual pre-tax income, permanent differences and statutory tax rates. For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the effective income tax rate was   31%   and   35%  . For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , the effective income tax rate was   36%  . The change in effective income tax rate was mainly due to a favorable adjustment for discrete items offset by an increase in state taxes as a result of changes in certain statutory rates in North Carolina that were enacted into law during the third quarter of 2016 and lower tax-exempt interest income. 
  The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to U.S. federal income tax, as well as income tax of the states of Florida, South and North Carolina, and Tennessee. The net deferred tax assets as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   were   $80.4 million   and   $105.3 million  , respectively. A valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets is required when it is considered more likely than not that all or part of the benefit related to such assets will not be realized. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, the Company considered both positive and negative evidence in concluding that   no   valuation allowance was necessary at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the company had   $121.7 million   and   $107.7 million   of gross federal net operating loss carryforwards, respectively, which begin to expire after   2029   and are subject to annual cumulative limitation of   $7.9 million  . 
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had   no   unrecognized tax benefits and   no   material amounts recorded for uncertain tax positions.

14. Fair Value 
  FASB guidance on fair value measurements defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and requires fair value disclosures for certain assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring and non-recurring basis. 
  This guidance defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability. 
  This guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurements to maximize the use of observable inputs, that is, inputs that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity. The valuation hierarchy is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date. A financial instrument s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. 
    
           Level 1: 
    Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the entity can access as of the measurement date. 
              Level 2: 
    Significant other observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. 
              Level 3: 
    Significant unobservable inputs that reflect a reporting entity s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. 
     Cash   cash equivalents 
  Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and highly-liquid items with an original maturity of three months or less. Accordingly, the carrying amount of such instruments is considered to be a reasonable estimate of fair value. 
  Derivative financial instruments 
  Interest rate swaps are valued by a third party, using models that primarily use market observable inputs, such as yield curves, and are validated by comparison with valuations provided by the respective counterparties. The credit risk associated with derivative financial instruments that are subject to master netting agreements is measured on a net basis by counterparty portfolio. Forward loan sales agreements are based upon the amounts required to settle the contracts. Fair values for commitments to originate loans held for sale are based on fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements. Fair values for fixed-rate commitments consider the difference between current levels of interest rates and the committed rates. 
  Valuation of Investment Securities 
  The fair values of available-for-sale, held-to-maturity and trading securities are determined by: 1) obtaining quoted prices on nationally recognized securities exchanges when available (Level 1 inputs); 2) matrix pricing, which is a mathematical technique widely used in the financial markets to value debt securities without relying exclusively on quoted prices for the specific securities but rather by relying on the securities  relationship to other benchmark quoted securities (Level 2 inputs); and 3) for certain other debt securities that are not actively traded, custom discounted cash flow modeling (Level 3 inputs).  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Bank held industrial revenue bonds, which are floating rate issues. Since there is no active secondary market for the trading of the bonds, the Company has developed a model to estimate fair value. This model determines an appropriate discount rate for the bonds based on current market rates for liquid corporate bonds with an equivalent credit rating plus an estimated illiquidity factor, and calculates the present value of expected future cash flows using this discount rate.

Mortgage Loans Held for Sale 
  Mortgage loans held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or estimated fair value. The fair values of mortgage loans held for sale are based on commitments on hand from investors within the secondary market for loans with similar characteristics. As such, the fair value adjustment for mortgage loans held for sale is classified as nonrecurring Level 2. 
  Valuation of Impaired Loans and Other Real Estate Owned 
  The fair value of collateral dependent impaired loans with specific allocations of the allowance for loan and lease losses and other real estate owned is generally based on recent real estate appraisals and other available observable market information. These appraisals may utilize a single valuation approach or a combination of approaches including comparable sales and the income approach. 
  The Company generally uses independent external appraisers in this process who routinely make adjustments to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data available. Such adjustments are typically significant and result in a Level 3 classification of the inputs for determining fair value. The Company s policy is to update appraisals, at a minimum, annually for classified assets, which include collateral dependent loans and OREO. The Company considers appraisals dated within the past 12 months to be current and do not typically make adjustments to such appraisals. In the Company s process for reviewing third-party prepared appraisals, any differences of opinion on values, assumptions or adjustments to comparable sales data are typically reconciled directly with the independent appraiser prior to acceptance of the final appraisal. 
  Sensitivity to Changes in Significant Unobservable Inputs 
  As discussed above, as of   September 30, 2016  , the Company owns industrial revenue bonds, which require recurring fair value estimates categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of these securities are incorporated in the discounted cash flow modeling valuation. Rates utilized in the modeling of these securities are estimated based upon a variety of factors including the market yields of other non-investment grade corporate debt. Significant changes in any inputs in isolation would result in significantly different fair value estimates. 
  Assets and Liabilities Measured on a Recurring Basis

  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) 

(1) Includes Federal Home Loan Bank stock. 
  The methods and assumptions used to estimate fair value are described as follows: 
  Carrying amount is the estimated fair value for cash and cash equivalents, receivable from FDIC, derivatives, noncontractual demand deposits and certain short-term borrowings. As it is not practicable to determine the fair value of Federal Home Loan Bank stock due to restrictions placed on transferability, the estimated fair value is equal to their carrying amount. Security fair values are based on market prices or dealer quotes and, if no such information is available, on the rate and term of the security and information about the issuer including estimates of discounted cash flows when necessary. For fixed rate loans or contractual deposits and for variable rate loans or deposits with infrequent repricing or repricing limits, fair value is based on discounted cash flows using current market rates applied to the estimated life, adjusted for the allowance for loan and lease losses. Fair values for impaired loans are estimated using discounted cash flow analysis or underlying collateral values. Fair value of loans does not necessarily represent exit price. Fair value of long-term debt is based on current rates for similar financing. The fair value of off-balance sheet items that include commitments to extend credit to fund commercial, consumer, real estate construction and real estate-mortgage loans and to fund standby letters of credit is considered nominal.

15. Derivative and Hedging Activities  
  The Company principally manages its exposures to a wide variety of business and operational risks through management of its core business activities. The Company enters into derivative financial instruments to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the receipt or payment of future known and uncertain cash amounts, the value of which are determined by interest rates.  
  The Company records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative, whether the Company has elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting. The Company may enter into derivative contracts that are intended to economically hedge certain of its risks, even though hedge accounting does not apply or the Company elects not to apply hedge accounting. 
  During 2015, the company entered into LIBOR-based interest rate swaps with the objective of limiting the variability of interest payment cash flows resulting from changes in the benchmark interest rate LIBOR. These interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges involving the receipt of fixed-rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making variable-rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying notional amount. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivatives is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. Any ineffective portion of a financial instrument s change in fair value is immediately recognized in earnings. 
  During the next twelve months, the Company estimates that an additional   $2.0 million   will be reclassified as an increase to interest income from amounts reported in accumulated comprehensive income. During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  ,   no   derivative position designated as cash flow hedges were discontinued and   none   of the gains and losses reported in other comprehensive income were reclassified into earnings as a result of discontinuance of cash flow hedges.  
  During the second quarter of 2016, the company implemented an interest rate swap program to allow customers to convert variable rate loans to fixed rates. The interest rate swaps are simultaneously offset by interest rate swaps that the Company executes with its derivative counterparties. The changes in the fair value of the swaps offset each other, except for any differences in the credit risk of the counterparties. None of these interest rate swaps are designated or qualify as hedging relationships. As the interest rate swaps associated with this program do not meet hedge accounting requirements, changes in fair value of both the customer swaps and the offsetting swaps are recognized directly in earnings. The Company recorded   $0.2 million   and   $0.5 million   of customer swap fees in non-interest income for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively. 
  The Company also enters into forward loan sales contracts, which are derived from loans held for sale, or in the Company s pipeline, to enable those borrowers to manage their exposure to interest rate fluctuations. The forward loan sales derivative contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and all changes in fair value are recognized in non-interest income or non-interest expense during the period of change. For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company recorded   $30 thousand   and   $27 thousand   respectively in non-interest income and   $0.1 thousand   and   $0.1 thousand   in non-interest expense as a result of changes in fair value of derivatives. For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , the company recorded   $1 thousand   and   $35 thousand   respectively in non-interest income and   $22 thousand   and   $21 thousand   in non-interest expense as a result of changes in fair value of derivatives.

  As a financial institution, we manage and evaluate various aspects of both our results of operations and our financial condition. We evaluate the levels and trends of the line items included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and Statements of Income, as well as various financial ratios that are commonly used in our industry. We analyze these ratios and financial trends against our budgeted performance and the financial condition and performance of comparable financial institutions in our region and nationally. Our financial information is prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Application of these principles requires management to make complex and subjective estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the following discussion and in our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes.

Quarterly Summary 
  For the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , we had net income of   $18.5 million  , or   $0.42   per diluted share, and core net income of   $18.5 million  , or   $0.42   per diluted share. Year over year net income per diluted share and core net income per diluted share rose   27%   and   27%  , respectively. Results include the following non-core items: $1.5 million of legal settlement expense, $0.3 million of tax deductible merger related expenses, offset by a $1.1 million tax adjustment and $0.1 million of gains on sales investment securities. 
   
  Results of Operations 
  Net Interest Income 
  Net interest income is the largest component of our income and is affected by the interest rate environment and the volume and composition of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Our interest-earning assets include loans, interest-bearing deposits in other banks and investment securities. Other earning assets include Federal Home Loan Bank stock. Our interest-bearing liabilities include deposits, subordinated debentures, repurchase agreements and other short-term borrowings.  
  In the net interest margin and rate/volume analyses below, interest income and rates include the effects of a tax equivalent adjustments using applicable statutory tax rates in adjusting tax-exempt interest on tax-exempt investment securities and loans to a fully taxable basis. In the rate/volume analyses, average loan volumes include non-performing assets which results in the impact of the non-accrual of interest being reflected in the change in average rate. For each major category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, information is provided with respect to changes due to average volumes and changes due to rates, with the changes in both volumes and rates allocated to these two categories based on the proportionate absolute changes in each category. 
  Three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   three months ended     June 30, 2016  : 
  Net interest income for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016     increased   by   $1.1 million  , or   1.8%  , to   $62.6 million   from   $61.5 million  . The net interest margin   decline  d   four   basis points to   3.58%   from   3.62%   and the net interest spread   declined     five   basis points to   3.43%   from   3.48%  . Loan yields   declined     eight   basis points to   4.40%   from   4.48%   due to the lower average yield on new loans, which represent $5.0 billion with an average yield of 3.67%, compared to the yields of the Company's  
  
   47 

acquired loans, which represent $0.9 billion with an average yield of 8.55%. During the quarter, we had new loan fundings of   $471.5 million   with an average yield of   3.84%  , compared to   $473.3 million   and   3.63%   in the prior quarter. The cost of core deposits increased one basis point to   0.19%   from 0.18%. The cost of total deposits remained flat at   0.41%  .

  Three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   three months ended     September 30, 2015  : 
  Net interest income for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   increased by   $1.0 million  , or   1.6%  , to   $62.6 million   from   $61.6 million   . The net interest margin   declined     24   basis points to   3.58%   from   3.82%   and the net interest spread   declined   25 basis points to   3.43%   from   3.68%  . Loan yields   declined   31 basis points to   4.40%   from   4.71%   due to the lower average yield on new loans compared to the yields of the Company's acquired loans. During the quarter, we had new loan fundings of   $471.5 million   with an average yield of   3.84%  , compared to   $490.2 million   with an average yield of 3.74%, during the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  . New loans represent   81%   of our total loan portfolio, up from 79% at   September 30, 2015  . Investment securities yields   increased     29   basis points to   2.43%   due to the reinvestment of funds into higher yielding securities to assist with interest rate risk and liquidity management. The cost of core deposits increased four basis points to   0.19%  . The cost of total deposits increased   two   basis points to   0.41%   mainly due to re-pricing of deposits as a result of the federal funds rate increase in December 2015 and increased money market balances. Total funding cost   increased     four   basis points to   0.51%  .

Nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  : 
  Net interest income for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   increased by   $3.5 million  , or   1.90%  , to   $185.5 million   from   $182.1 million  . The increase was due to the higher loan balances and yields on investment securities. The net interest margin declined 29 basis points to   3.61%   from   3.90%   and the net interest spread declined 30 basis points to   3.47%   from   3.77%  . Loan yields declined 35 basis points to   4.47%   from   4.82%   due to the lower average yield on new loans in addition to the decline of our higher yielding acquired loan portfolio as we continue to resolve legacy problem assets. During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we funded new loans of   $1,241.2 million   with an average yield of 3.73%, compared to $1,296 million new loans with an average yield of 3.62% during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . New loans represent   81%   of our total loan portfolio, up from 79% at   September 30, 2015  . The weighted average yield of acquired impaired loans outstanding at   September 30, 2016   is 8.55%.  Investment securities yields increased due to the reinvestment of funds into higher yielding securities to assist with interest rate risk and liquidity management. The cost of core deposits increased four basis points to 0.19%. The cost of total deposits increased five basis point to 0.41% mainly due to an increase in wholesale time deposits, which provided a lower cost source of funding than higher rate legacy time deposits. Total funding cost increased four basis points to 0.51%.

  Provision for Loan and Lease Losses 
  The following table presents the provision for loan and lease losses for PCI and non-PCI Loans for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  :   

  Three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   three months ended     September 30, 2015  : 
  The provision for loan and lease losses for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   was   $0.6 million   compared to   $0.8 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  . The provision on the new loan portfolio was   $0.6 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , as compared to   $0.3 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  . 
  Nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   : 
  The provision for loan and lease losses for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was   $3.1 million   compared to a provision of   $1.3 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The change is primarily due to a $2.0 million reversal of impairment associated with PCI Loans in the prior year. The reversal of impairment associated with PCI Loans was due to improvements in our expectations of future cash flows resulting from higher than anticipated payoffs and resolutions. The provision on the new loan portfolio increased to   $4.0 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , from $3.2 million for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . 
  The table below illustrates the impact of our   third quarter   of   2016   estimates of expected cash flows on PCI Loans on impairment and prospective yield:

Non-interest Income 
  Three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   three months ended     September 30, 2015  : 
  Non-interest income   increased     $1.0 million  , or   8%  , to   $12.4 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   from   $11.4 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  . The   increase   was mainly due to the absence of $1.4 million of FDIC indemnification asset expense recorded in the prior year. Partially offsetting the increase was a $0.6 million decline in investment advisory income and a $0.7 million decline in service charges. 
  Nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  : 
  Non-interest income   declined     $4.8 million  , or   15%  , to   $26.9 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   from   $31.7 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The decline was mainly driven by the termination of the FDIC loss share agreements, which resulted in additional FDIC indemnification asset expense of $9.2 million year over year, a decline in service charges of $1.3 million and investment advisory income of $1.8 million. Partially offsetting the decline was the absence of $6.4 million of FDIC indemnification asset amortization expense. 
    
  The following table sets forth the components of non-interest income for the periods indicated: 

Non-interest Expense 
  Three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to three months ended   September 30, 2015  : 
     Non-interest expense   declined     $0.8 million  , or   2%  , to   $47.5 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   from   $48.3 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The improvement was mainly due to a reduction of   $1.7 million   in employee compensation as a result of cost savings initiatives, and a reduction of   $1.8 million   in the OREO valuation, foreclosed asset and loan workout expense components of our legacy credit expenses. Partially offsetting the decline, were $1.5  
  
   53 

million of legal settlement, $0.5 million of stock based compensation, and   $0.4 million   of conversion and merger related expenses incurred as part of CommunityOne acquisition costs. 
  Our efficiency ratios for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   were   63.38%   and 66.18%, respectively. Our core efficiency ratios for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   were   61.06%   and 66.02%, respectively. 
  Nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  : 
     Non-interest expense declined   $11.5 million  , or   8%  , to   $139.0 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   from   $150.5 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The improvement was mainly due to a reduction of   $5.1 million   in employee compensation as a result of cost savings initiatives, a reduction of   $5.0 million   in the OREO valuation, foreclosed asset and loan workout expense components of our legacy credit expenses, the absence of a   $2.5 million   restructuring charges, and the absence of $1.4 million net losses on extinguishment of debt. Partially offsetting the decline, were   $3.3 million   of conversion and merger related expenses incurred as part of CommunityOne acquisition costs, and $1.5 million of legal settlement. 
  Our efficiency ratios for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and 2015 were   65.45%   and   70.41%  , respectively. Our core efficiency ratios for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and 2015 were   60.58%   and   68.35%  , respectively. 
  The following table sets forth the components of non-interest expense for the periods indicated: 

54 

Legacy credit expenses for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   are presented below: 

The core efficiency ratio, which equals core non-interest expense divided by core net revenues (net interest income plus core non-interest income), for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   is as follows: 

The core efficiency ratio is a non-GAAP measure which we believe provides analysts and investors with information useful in understanding our business and evaluating our operating efficiency. We monitor the core efficiency ratio to evaluate and control operating costs. The core efficiency ratio is also a measure utilized by our Board of Directors in measuring management s performance in controlling operating costs in comparison to peers. This non-GAAP measure has inherent limitations and is not required to be uniformly applied. It should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of  
  
   55 

results reported under GAAP. This non-GAAP measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies and should not be viewed as a substitute for non-interest expense. 

Income Taxes 
  The provision for income taxes was   $8.4 million   and   $24.5 million   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively. The effective income tax rate was   31%   and   35%   for these periods, respectively. The change in effective income tax rate was mainly due to a favorable adjustment for discrete items offset by an increase in state taxes as a result of changes in certain statutory rates in North Carolina that were enacted into law during the third quarter of 2016 and lower tax-exempt interest income. 
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had   no   material amounts recorded for uncertain tax positions and   no   material unrecognized tax benefits. We do not expect to identify any material unrecognized tax benefits during the next 12 months. 
  Refer to Note 13. Income Taxes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our provision for income taxes. 
   
  Financial Condition 
  Our assets totaled   $7.8 billion   at   September 30, 2016   and   $7.4 billion   at   December 31, 2015  . Total loans increased $0.3 million to $5.9 billion at   September 30, 2016   compared to $5.6 billion at   December 31, 2015  . The increase in loans was due to new loans of   $1,241.2 million  , partially offset by   $67.0 million   in resolutions of problem loans and   $871.0 million   in net principal repayments. Investment securities   increased   by   $9.9 million   mainly due to $205.2 million of investment purchases and $16.4 million change in market valuation on available for sale investment securities, partially offset by $92.1 million of security sales and calls and $119.8 million of principal reductions and amortization. Total deposits increased by   $173.0 million   or 3% to   $6.0 billion   at   September 30, 2016   compared to   $5.9 billion   at   December 31, 2015  . Core deposits   increased   by   $276.6 million  . Non-interest bearing checking accounts increased   $86.6 million  , interest bearing demand deposits increased by   $80.8 million  , money market balances increased   $126.8 million   and savings deposits decreased by   $17.7 million  . Core deposits represent   70.3%   and   67.6%   of total deposits at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. Partially offsetting the increase in core deposits was a decrease in higher rate brokered deposits and time deposits of   $103.5 million  . Borrowed funds, consisting of FHLB advances, short-term borrowings, notes payable and subordinated debentures, totaled   $678.6 million   and   $559.1 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. FHLB advances increased by   $114.9 million   to   $575.8 million   at   September 30, 2016   compared to $460.9 million at December 31, 2015. 
  Shareholders  equity was   $1.0 billion   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . The Company s Board of Directors has authorized a stock repurchase plan of up to   $400.0 million  . Stock repurchases may be made from time to time, on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The approved stock repurchase program does not obligate the Company to repurchase any particular amount of shares, and the programs may be extended, modified, suspended, or discontinued at any time. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company has repurchased a total of   $298.6 million  , or   12,644,660   common shares at an average price of   $24.19   per share, and had   $101.4 million   remaining under the current board authorized stock repurchase program. 
  Core return-on-assets ( core ROA ) is a non-GAAP measure which we believe provides management and investors with useful information to understand the effects of certain non-interest items and provides an alternative view of the Company s performance over time and in comparison to the Company s competitors. This non-GAAP measure has inherent limitations and is not required to be uniformly applied. It should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of results reported under GAAP. This non-GAAP measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies and should not be viewed as a substitute for results determined in accordance to GAAP. A reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is shown in the table below:

Loans 
  Our loan portfolio is our largest earning asset. Our strategy is to increase the loan portfolio by originating commercial and consumer loans that we believe to be of high quality, that comply with our conservative credit policies and that produce revenues consistent with our financial objectives.  
    
  The following table sets forth the carrying amounts of our loan portfolio: 

The following tables set forth the carrying amounts of our non-PCI and PCI loan portfolio by category:

During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , our loan portfolio   increased   by   $303.2 million  , as   $1.2 billion   of new loans were partially offset by   $67.0 million   in resolutions of problem loans and   $871.0 million   in net principal repayments. New and acquired non-impaired loans represent   85.4%   of our total loan portfolio as compared to 81.1% at December 31, 2015.  
  The composition of new loan production is indicative of our business strategy of emphasizing commercial and industrial and consumer loans. New loan production during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was absent of indirect auto lending, as illustrated in other consumer loans below. Additionally, commercial loans and consumer and other loans represented approximately 40.2% and 32.0%, respectively, of new loan production for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  .  
  The following table sets forth our new loans (excluding renewals of existing loans) segmented by loan type: 

We underwrite commercial real estate loans based on the value of the collateral, the ratio of debt service to property income and the creditworthiness of tenants. Due to the inherent risk of commercial real estate lending, we underwrite loans selectively. 
  
   59 

Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee accounted for   34.5%  ,   27.6%  ,   9.6%   and   28.3%   of our new loans, respectively, for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee accounted for 31.5%, 31.6%, 12.6% and 24.3% of our new loans, respectively, for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . 
   
  Asset Quality 
  Consistent with our strategy of operating with a sound risk profile, we focus on originating loans we believe to be of high quality, and disposing of non-performing assets rapidly and at reasonable valuations. To achieve these objectives, we underwrite new loans and manage existing loans in accordance with our underwriting standards under the direction of our Chief Credit Officer. Additionally, we have assigned senior credit officers to oversee the Florida, Tennessee and Carolinas markets, and we have established a special assets division to dispose of legacy problem loans and OREO. 
  We refer to our loans covered under loss sharing agreements with the FDIC as  covered loans.  These are the legacy loans of Metro Bank, Turnberry Bank, and First National Bank of the South where the FDIC reimbursed us for 80% of net charge-offs and OREO losses over a five-year period for commercial loans (expired in the third quarter of 2015 but required sharing of recoveries until 2018) and a ten-year period for residential loans (expiring in the third quarter of 2020). We refer to all other loans as  non-covered loans.  These are new loans we originate or purchase, loans acquired through the acquisitions of Capital Bank, TIB Bank, Green Bank and Southern Community Bank and Trust and certain loans of the Failed Banks that we acquired, which are no longer covered by any loss sharing agreement effective January 1, 2016. 
   
  Covered Loans 
  On March 18, 2016, the Bank entered into an agreement to terminate all existing loss share agreements with the FDIC effective January 1, 2016. All rights and obligations of the Bank and the FDIC under these FDIC loss share agreements have been resolved and terminated under this agreement. Covered loans and OREO that were subject to the loss share agreements were reclassified and are presented as non-covered as of   September 30, 2016  .  As of   December 31, 2015  , covered loans were $73.5 million, representing 1.3% of our loan portfolio of which 1.0% were past due 30-89 days, 3.8% were nonperforming PCI (of which 1.8% were  90 days past due and still accreting) and 1.3% were nonaccrual. The status of these loans reflects the severity of the real estate downturn and the excessive concentrations in commercial real estate and poor quality underwriting that characterized the banks we acquired from the FDIC under their prior business models. We have recorded these loans at estimated fair value reflecting expected lifetime losses estimated as of their acquisition date. 
  We managed credit risk associated with loans covered under loss sharing agreements in the same manner as credit risk associated with non-covered loans. This included following consistent policies and procedures relating to the process of working with borrowers in efforts to resolve problem loans resulting in the lowest losses possible and collection including foreclosure, repossession and the ultimate liquidation of any applicable underlying collateral. The loss sharing agreements also contained certain restrictions and conditions which, among other things, provide that certain credit risk management strategies such as loan sales, under certain conditions, could be prohibited under the agreements and may lead to the termination of coverage of any applicable losses on the related loans. 
  Collection of loss claims under the loss sharing agreements required extensive and specific recordkeeping and incremental quarterly reporting to the FDIC on the status of covered loans. The loss claims filed and the related reporting on covered loans to the FDIC were subject to review and approval by the FDIC and various subcontractors utilized by the FDIC. The requirements for such reporting and interpretations thereof were occasionally revised by the FDIC and its subcontractors. Such changes along with our ability to comply with the requirements and revisions required interpretation and can lead to delays in the collection of claims on losses incurred. Additionally, the loss sharing agreements provided for regular examination of compliance with loss sharing agreements including reviews of relevant policies and procedures and detailed audits of claims filed. 
  
   60 

Non-Covered Loans 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , non-covered loans were   $5.9 billion  , representing   100.0%   of our loan portfolio, of which   0.2%   were past due 30-89 days,   0.8%   were nonperforming PCI (of which 0.1% were  90 days past due and still accreting) and   0.2%   were nonaccrual. As of   December 31, 2015  , non-covered loans were $5.6 billion, representing 98.7% of our loan portfolio, of which 0.2% were past due 30-89 days, 1.0% were nonperforming PCI (of which 0.2% were  90 days past due and still accreting) and 0.1% were nonaccrual. 
  At   September 30, 2016  ,   14.6%   of the non-covered loans were acquired impaired loans. These acquired loans had disproportionate commercial real estate concentrations. In connection with the acquisitions, we applied acquisition accounting adjustments to the acquired non-covered loans to reflect estimates at the time of acquisition of the expected lifetime losses of such loans.

Covered and Non-Covered Loan Credit Quality Summary 
  The table below summarizes key loan credit quality indicators for covered and non-covered loan portfolios as of the dates indicated: 

Of the loans that were non-performing PCI as   December 31, 2015  , $2.8 million (or approximately 4.8%) were covered by loss sharing agreements with the FDIC. Of these loans $1.3 million (or approximately 2.2%) were  90 days past due and still accreting as of   December 31, 2015  . There were no non-PCI loans included in this category at the end of each period presented. 
  Total non-performing loans as of   September 30, 2016     declined   by   $7.8 million  , or   11%  , to   $60.4 million   as compared to   $68.1 million   at   December 31, 2015  . The change in non-performing loans during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was attributable to   $14.4 million   in resolutions and   $5.1 million   in transfers to other real estate owned through foreclosures or receipt of deeds in lieu of foreclosures. Partially offsetting these decreases were   $11.6 million   of loans that became non-performing. 
  
   62 

During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , of the loans we foreclosed, or received deeds in lieu of foreclosure, approximately   26.0%   consisted of residential loans and   74.0%   consisted of commercial real estate loans. The customer-owed principal balances and carrying amounts as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   are set forth in the tables below: 

(1) 
    The carrying amount for total non-covered loans represents a discount from the total gross customer balance of   $821.3 million   or   12.2%  . 
              (2) 
    Includes loans greater than 90 days past due, and nonperforming loans less than 90 days past due. 

63 

(1) 
    The carrying amount for total covered and non-covered loans represents a discount from the total gross customer balance of $33.2 million, or 31.1%, and $812.5 million, or 12.8%, respectively. 
              (2) 
    Includes loans greater than 90 days past due, and nonperforming loans less than 90 days past due.

Allowance and Provision for Loan and Lease Losses 
  At   September 30, 2016  , the allowance for loan and lease losses was   $44.0 million  , of which   $23.7 million   was associated with PCI loans and   $20.3 million   related to new loans or acquired non-PCI loans. At   September 30, 2016  , the allowance for loan and lease losses represents   0.75%   of our total   $5.9 billion   loan portfolio. At   December 31, 2015  , the allowance for loan and lease losses was $45.0 million, of which $24.5 million was associated with PCI loans and $20.5 million related to new loans or acquired non-PCI loans. At December 31, 2015, the allowance for loan and lease losses represented 0.80% of our total $5.6 billion loan portfolio. 
  For non-PCI loans, the allowance for loan and lease losses reflects an allowance for probable incurred credit losses in the loan portfolio. Our formalized process for assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses and the resultant need, if any, for periodic provisions to the allowance charged to income, includes both individual loan analysis and loan pool analysis. Individual loan analysis are periodically performed on loan relationships of a significant size, or when otherwise deemed necessary, and are performed primarily on commercial real estate and other commercial loans. The result is that commercial real estate loans and commercial loans are divided into the following risk categories: Pass, Special Mention, Substandard and Loss. The allowance consists of specific and general components. When appropriate, a specific reserve will be established for individual loans based upon the risk classifications and the estimated potential for loss. The specific component relates to loans that are individually classified as impaired. 
  Home equity loans, indirect auto loans, residential loans and consumer loans generally are not analyzed individually or separately identified for impairment disclosures. These loans are grouped into pools and assigned risk categories based on their current payment status and management s assessment of risk inherent in the various types of loans. The allocations are based on the same factors mentioned above. However, should such loans exceeding certain size thresholds exhibit signs of impairment, they may be individually evaluated for impairment. 
  For PCI loans, the allowance for loan and lease losses is a measure of impairment based upon our most recent estimates of expected cash flows. Our estimation of expected cash flows, which is used to determine the need for provisions to or reversals of the allowance every reporting period, is determined by assigning probability of default ( PD ) and loss given default ( LGD ) assumptions, amongst other assumptions such as prepayment speeds and recovery or liquidation timing. For commercial real estate and other commercial loans, we generally assign PD assumptions through the mapping of the following loan level risk ratings: Pass, Watch, Sub-Performing and Non-Performing. For home equity loans, residential loans, and consumer loans, PD is determined by mapping payment performance and delinquency status to market based default assumptions. Estimated loan to value ratios, determined using appraisals and/or real estate indices, are used to derive loss given default assumptions for real estate collateralized loans. 
  Senior management and our Board of Directors review this calculation and the underlying assumptions on a routine basis, not less frequently than quarterly. 
  The provision for loan and lease losses is a charge to income in the current period to establish or replenish the allowance and maintain it at a level that management has determined to be adequate to absorb estimated incurred losses in the loan portfolio for new loans. A provision for loan and lease losses is also required for any unfavorable changes in expected cash flows related to pools of purchased impaired loans. The provision for loan and lease losses and expectations of cash flows may be impacted by many factors, including changes in the value of real estate collateralizing loans, net charge-offs and credit losses incurred, changes in loans outstanding, changes in impaired loans, historical loss rates and the mix of loan types. 
  As the majority of our acquired loans are considered PCI loans, our provision for loan and lease losses in future periods for acquired loans will be most significantly influenced in the short term by the differences between the actual credit losses resulting from the resolution of problem loans and the estimated credit losses used in determining the estimated fair values of purchased impaired loans as of their acquisition dates. For new loans, the provision for loan and lease losses will be affected by the loss potential of impaired loans and trends in the delinquency of loans, non-performing loans and net charge offs, which cannot be reasonably predicted. Refer to   Provision for loan and lease losses   section for further discussion. 
  Management continuously monitors and actively manages the credit quality of the entire loan portfolio and will continue to recognize the provision required to maintain the allowance for loan and lease losses at an appropriate level. 
  The following table presents the roll-forward of the allowance for loan and lease losses for PCI and non-PCI loans for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   by the class of loans against which the allowance is allocated: 

65 

66 

67 

No portion of the allowance allocated to non-PCI loans is in any way restricted to any individual loan or group of new loans or non-PCI loans, and the entirety of such allowance is available to absorb probable incurred credit losses from any and all such loans. The following table represents management s best estimate of the allocation of the allowance for loan and lease losses for non-PCI loans to the various segments of the loan portfolio based on information available as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

Criticized and Classified Loans 
  Loans with the following attributes are categorized as criticized and classified loans: (1) a potential weakness that deserves management s close attention; (2) inadequate protection by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged; or (3) weaknesses which make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. 
  
   68 

The following table summarizes criticized and classified loans at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

(1) PCI and non-PCI loans are included in the balances presented. 
  Total criticized and classified loans   declined     $29.7 million  , or   17.6%   annualized, during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   as a result of $5.7 million in transfers to other real estate owned and   $64.0 million   of pay downs, charge offs and upgrades. Loan downgrades of   $39.9 million   partially offset the decline. 
  Impaired Loans 
  Non-performing loans and impaired loans are defined differently. Some loans may be included in both categories, whereas other loans may only be included in one category. A loan is considered impaired when it is probable that not all principal and interest amounts will be collected according to the loan contract. Generally, residential mortgages, commercial and commercial real estate loans exceeding certain size thresholds established by management are individually evaluated for impairment. Non-accrual loans and restructured loans where loan term concessions benefiting the borrowers have been made are generally designated as impaired. 
  Within the context of the accounting for impaired loans described in the preceding paragraph, other than the PCI loans described above, as of   September 30, 2016  , there were   126   loans individually evaluated for impairment and   78   deemed impaired with a related allowance for loan and lease losses of   $898 thousand  . At   December 31, 2015  , there were 66 loans individually evaluated for impairment and 32 deemed impaired with a related allowance for loan and lease losses of $75 thousand.  
  Due to the pool method of accounting for purchased credit impaired loans, non-performing PCI loans may be reported as 90 days past due and still accruing/accreting. Going forward, additional acquired loans not classified as purchased credit impaired and new loans originated by us may become impaired and will be classified as such. Impaired loans also include loans which were not classified as non-accrual, but otherwise meet the criteria for classification as an impaired loan (i.e., loans for which the collection of all principal and interest amounts as specified in the original loan contract are not expected, or where management has substantial doubt that the collection will be as specified, but is still expected to occur in its entirety). In our evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses, we consider (1) purchased credit impaired loans and loans classified as impaired, (2) our historical portfolio loss experience and trends as well as that of peers and (3) certain other quantitative and qualitative factors. 

69 

Non-Performing Assets 
  Non-performing assets include accruing/accreting loans delinquent 90 days or more, accreting PCI loans less than 90 days past due with expected cash flows less than contractual terms, non-accrual loans, repossessed personal property and other real estate. Non-PCI loans are placed on non-accrual status when management has concerns relating to the ability to collect the principal and interest and generally when such assets are 90 days past due. Non-performing assets were as follows: 

At   September 30, 2016   non-covered loans and   December 31, 2015  , covered and non-covered loans classified as delinquent 90 days or more and accruing/accreting are entirely comprised of components of PCI loan pools. There were no non-PCI loans included in this category at the end of each period presented. In addition to the discussion in the previous section, please refer to Note 5. Loans in our Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the accounting for pooled PCI loans. 
  Total non-performing assets at   September 30, 2016     declined   by   $14.8 million   to   $106.5 million   compared to $121.3 million at   December 31, 2015  , which represents an annualized decline of   16.2%  . The change in non-performing assets was attributable to the net decline in non-performing loans and other real estate owned of   $7.8 million   and   $6.8 million  , respectively. The net decline in non-performing loans was due to   $13.7 million   in resolutions and $5.7 million in transfers to other real estate owned through foreclosures or receipt of deeds in lieu of foreclosures, offset by   $11.6 million   of loans that became non-performing. The decline in other real estate owned was mainly due to sales of   $12.0 million  , partially offset by acquisitions as noted above. 
   
  Investment Securities 
  Investment securities represent a significant portion of our assets. We invest in a variety of securities including obligations of U.S. government agencies, U.S. government-sponsored entities, including mortgage-backed securities, obligations of states or political subdivisions, privately issued mortgage-backed securities, bank eligible corporate obligations, mutual funds and limited types of equity securities. 
  Our investment activities are governed internally by a written, Board-approved policy. The investment policy is carried out by our Treasury department. Investment strategies are reviewed by the Risk Committee of the Board based on the interest rate environment, balance sheet mix, actual and anticipated loan demand, funding opportunities and our overall interest rate sensitivity. In general, the investment portfolio is managed in a manner appropriate to the attainment of the following goals: (1) to provide a margin of liquid assets sufficient to meet unanticipated deposit and loan fluctuations and overall funds management objectives; (2) to provide eligible securities to secure public funds and other borrowings; and (3) to manage interest rate risk and earn the maximum return on funds invested that is commensurate with meeting our first two goals. 
  Trading securities related to our non-qualified deferred compensation program and CRA investment fund totaled $  3.7 million   and   $3.0 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  
   70 

Our investment securities consisted primarily of U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities, which expose us to a low degree of credit and liquidity risk. The following tables set forth our investment securities as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

71 

Contractual maturities of investment securities at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   are shown below. Expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or repay obligations without call or prepayment penalties. Other securities include mortgage-backed securities which are not due at a single maturity date. The following table segments our investment portfolio by maturity date: 

We regularly review each investment security for impairment based on criteria that include the extent to which cost exceeds the estimated fair value, the financial health of and specific prospects for the issuer(s) and our ability and intention with regard to holding the security to maturity. Future declines in the fair value of securities may result in impairment charges which may be material to our financial condition and results of operations. More specifically, our impairment analysis is based on the following: (1) whether it is  more likely than not  we would have to sell a security prior to recovery of the amortized cost; (2) whether we intend to sell the security; and (3) whether or not we expect to recover our recorded investment on an amortized cost basis based on credit characteristics of the investment. If, based upon our analysis, any of those conditions exist for a given security, we would  
  
   72 

generally be required to record an impairment charge in the amount of the difference between the carrying amounts and estimated fair value of such security. Based on our analysis there were no investment securities considered to be other-than-temporarily impaired at   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  . 
   
  Deposits 
  Our strategy is to fund asset growth primarily with low-cost customer deposits in order to maintain a stable liquidity profile and net interest margin.  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our core deposits, which we define as demand deposits, savings and money market accounts, excluding brokered,   increased   by   $276.6 million   as compared to   December 31, 2015  . The increase was mainly the result of the Company's continued focus on growing low-cost core deposits. The average contractual rate on core deposits   increased   to   0.19%   at   September 30, 2016  , from   0.16%   at   December 31, 2015  . 
  Time deposit balances   declined   by   $78.5 million   during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . At   September 30, 2016  , our wholesale time deposits   declined   by   $76.1 million  , while retail time deposits   decreased   by   $2.4 million   as compared to   December 31, 2015  . The average contractual rate on time deposits   increased   to   0.99%   from   0.96%   at   December 31, 2015  . The total cost of deposits increased to   0.42%   from   0.41%   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 
  The following table sets forth the balances and average contractual rates payable to customers on our deposits, segmented by account type as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  : 

73 

The following table sets forth our average deposits and the average rates expensed for the periods indicated: 

(1) 
    The average rates on time deposits include the amortization of premiums on time deposits assumed in connection with the acquisitions and paid to brokers on wholesale deposits. Such premiums were required to be recorded to initially record these deposits at their fair values as of the respective acquisition dates. 
       
  The following table sets forth our time deposits segmented by maturity and deposit amount: 

Capital Resources and Liquidity 
  Capital Resources 
  In order to maintain a conservative risk profile, we operate with a prudent cushion of capital in relation to regulatory requirements and to the risk of our assets and business model. For planning purposes, we expect to operate with a minimum capital target equal to an 8% leverage ratio (defined as Tier 1 capital equal to 8% of average tangible assets), which would be in excess of regulatory standards for  well-capitalized  banks. We believe the 8% target is appropriate for our business model because of our conservative loan underwriting policies, investment portfolio composition, funding strategy, interest rate risk management limits and liquidity risk profile and because of the experience of our senior management team and Board of Directors. 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had   11.55%   and 11.46% tangible common equity ratios, respectively. We calculate tangible common equity, tangible assets and the tangible common equity ratio, which are non-GAAP measures, because we believe they are useful for both investors and management as these are measures commonly used by financial institutions, regulators and investors to measure the capital adequacy of financial institutions. The tangible common equity ratio is calculated as tangible common shareholders  equity divided by tangible assets. Tangible common equity is calculated as total shareholders  equity less preferred stock and less goodwill and other intangible assets, net. Tangible assets are total assets less goodwill and other intangible assets, net. We believe these measures facilitate comparison of the quality and composition of the Company s capital over time and in comparison to its competitors. 
  These non-GAAP measures have inherent limitations and are not required to be uniformly applied. They should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of results reported under GAAP. These non-GAAP measures may not be  
  
   74 

comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies and should not be viewed as a substitute for shareholders  equity or total assets. The following table provides reconciliations of tangible common equity and the tangible common equity ratio to GAAP total common shareholders  equity and tangible assets to GAAP total assets: 

We calculate tangible book value, and tangible book value per share, which are non-GAAP measures because we believe they are useful for both investors and management as these are measures commonly used by financial institutions, regulators and investors to measure the capital adequacy of financial institutions. Tangible book value is equal to book value, or stockholders' equity, less goodwill and core deposit intangibles, net of related deferred tax liabilities. 
  The following table sets forth a reconciliation of tangible book value and tangible book value per share to total shareholders  equity, which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure: 

The Company operates with a significant level of excess capital above regulatory requirements (see the table below for the historical capital ratios as well as minimum and well capitalized ratio requirements). 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had a Tier 1 leverage ratio of   12.9%  , which provided us with   $357.9 million   in excess capital relative to our longer-term target of 8%. As of   September 30, 2016  , Capital Bank Corporation had a   10.5%   Tier 1 leverage ratio, a   12.0%   Tier 1 common capital ratio, a   12.0%   Tier 1 risk-based ratio and a   12.7%   Total risk-based capital ratio. 
  As of   December 31, 2015  , we had a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 12.7%, which provided us with $335.1 million in excess capital relative our longer-term planning target of 8%. As of December 31, 2015, Capital Bank Corporation had a 11.1% Tier 1 leverage ratio, a 12.9% Tier I common capital ratio, a 12.9% Tier 1 risk-based ratio and an 13.7% total risk-based capital ratio. 

75 

The minimum ratios along with the actual ratios for us and Capital Bank Corporation as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   are presented in the following tables: 

In July 2013, the U.S. banking regulators adopted a final rule which implements the Basel III regulatory capital reforms from the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, and certain changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act. The final rule establishes an integrated regulatory capital framework and introduces the  Standardized Approach  for risk weighted assets, which replaces the Basel I risk-based guidance for determining risk-weighted assets as of January 1, 2015, the date we became subject to the new rules. 
  The rules include new risk-based capital and leverage ratios, which will be phased in from 2015 to 2019, and refine the definition of what constitutes  capital  for purposes of calculating those ratios. The new minimum capital level requirements applicable to the Company and the Bank under the final rules are as follows: (i) a new common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6% (increased from 4%); (iii) a total capital ratio of 8% (unchanged from previous rules); and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4% for all institutions. The final rules also establish a  capital conservation buffer  above the new regulatory minimum capital requirements. The capital conservation buffer will be phased-in over four years beginning on January 1, 2016, as follows: the maximum buffer will be 0.625% of risk-weighted assets for 2016, 1.25% for 2017, 1.875% for 2018, and 2.5% for 2019 and thereafter. This will result in the following minimum ratios beginning in 2019: (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%, (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5%, and (iii) a total capital ratio of 10.5%. Under the final rules, institutions are subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital level  
  
   76 

falls below the buffer amount. These limitations establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions. As of   September 30, 2016  , our capital buffer would be 4.7%; well exceeding the 2.5% 2019 requirement. 
  The final rules also contain revisions to the prompt corrective action framework, which is designed to place restrictions on insured depository institutions if their capital levels begin to show signs of weakness. Under the prompt corrective action requirements, which are designed to complement the capital conservation buffer, insured depository institutions are now required to meet the following increased capital level requirements in order to qualify as  well capitalized:  (i) a new common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8% (increased from 6%); (iii) a total capital ratio of 10% (unchanged from previous rules); and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 5% (unchanged from previous rules). 
    
  Dividend Program 
  On October 19, 2016, the Company's board of directors approved a quarterly common dividend of $0.12 per share   payable on November 22, 2016, to shareholders of record as of November 9, 2016. 
  Liquidity 
  Liquidity involves our ability to raise funds to support asset growth or reduce assets to meet deposit withdrawals and other funding needs, to maintain reserve requirements and to otherwise operate on an ongoing basis. To mitigate liquidity risk, our strategy is to fund asset growth primarily with low-cost customer deposits. We also operate under a liquidity policy and contingent liquidity plan that require us to monitor indicators of potential liquidity risk, utilize cash flow projection models to forecast liquidity needs, identify alternative back-up sources of liquidity and maintain a cushion of cash and liquid securities at 15% of total assets. 
  Our liquidity needs are met primarily by our cash position, growth in core deposits and cash flow from our amortizing investment and loan portfolios (including scheduled payments, prepayments, and maturities from portfolios of loans and investment securities). Our ability to borrow funds from non-deposit sources provides additional flexibility in meeting our liquidity needs. Short-term borrowings include federal funds purchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements and brokered deposits. We also utilize longer-term borrowings when management determines that the pricing and maturity options available through these sources create cost effective options for funding asset growth and satisfying capital needs. Our long-term borrowings include structured repurchase agreements and subordinated notes underlying our trust preferred securities. 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , cash and liquid securities totaled   17.0%   and 16.9% of assets, respectively, providing ample liquidity to support our existing bank franchise. As of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, the ratio of wholesale to total funding was   18.7%  , and 19.4%, respectively, which is below our policy limit of 25%. In addition to maintaining a stable core deposit base, we maintain adequate liquidity primarily through the use of investment securities, short term investments such as federal funds sold and unused borrowing capacity. We hold investments in FHLB stock for the purpose of maintaining credit lines with the FHLB. The credit availability is based on a percentage of the Bank s total assets as reported in its most recent quarterly financial information submitted to the FHLB and subject to the pledging of sufficient collateral. 
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , there were   $575.8 million   and $460.9 million, respectively, in FHLB advances outstanding. In addition, we had   $15.4 million   and $25.4 million in letters of credit outstanding as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. Collateral available under our agreements with the FHLB provided for incremental borrowing availability of up to approximately   $342.6 million   and $416.9 million, respectively. 
  We believe that we have adequate funding sources through unused borrowing capacity from the FHLB, unpledged investment securities, cash on hand and on deposit in other financial institutions, loan principal repayment and potential asset maturities and sales to meet our foreseeable liquidity requirements and contractual obligations. 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , our holding company had cash of approximately $138.3 million and $95.3 million, respectively. This cash is available for providing capital support to our subsidiary bank and for other general corporate purposes, including potential future acquisitions. The increase in cash was due to $64.2 million of dividend received from the Bank, offset by $4.4 million of common share buybacks and $12.9 million in dividends paid to shareholders during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  .

ITEM 3: QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
  Interest Rate Risk Management 
  The Company pursues a conservative strategy with respect to interest rate risk management, with the goal of minimizing the risk that interest rate volatility will negatively impact our financial results. Due to the current low level of interest rates, we regard rising interest rates as the most likely source of risk and accordingly have sought to maintain an asset-sensitive position. 
  There are several components to our conservative interest rate strategy. First, we avoid holding loans with long duration. At   September 30, 2016  , approximately   54%   of the loan portfolio was variable rate and of the remaining fixed rate loans, the vast majority had terms of less than five years. Second, the purpose of our securities portfolio is to provide liquidity and to manage interest rate sensitivity, and as such we limit its duration. At   September 30, 2016  , securities accounted for   14%   of assets, and the effective duration of the portfolio was   3.2   years with limited extension risk to   4.2   years in a plus 300 immediate parallel shift in interest rates. We utilize average life estimates based on prepayment rates obtained from an independent source. Third, we seek to fund the Bank, to the extent possible, with long-duration core deposits, and within core deposits, we emphasize checking account balances as the most stable and least risky source of funds. At   September 30, 2016  , core deposits accounted for   70%   of total deposits, and checking balances accounted for   63%   of core deposits. 
  We continuously monitor the Bank s interest rate risk profile through our Asset Liability Committee, which consists of our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Credit Officer, Chief of Strategic Planning, Treasurer, business unit heads and certain other officers. To manage interest rate risk, our Board of Directors has established quantitative and qualitative guidelines with respect to our net interest income exposure and how predefined interest rate shocks affect our financial performance, measured in terms of forecast net interest income and economic value of equity, which is the intrinsic value of assets, less the intrinsic value of liabilities. Under our policy, these predefined rate shocks include minus 300, minus 200, minus 100, plus 100, plus 200 and plus 300 basis point immediate parallel shifts in interest rates. 
  If a predefined immediate parallel rate shock cannot be modeled due to the low level of interest rates, a proportional rate shock and policy limit applies and all other declining rate shocks will be suspended until such scenarios can be modeled. Because of the current low level of interest rates, the minus 100, minus 200 and minus 300 rate shocks have been suspended. The maximum negative impact on forecast net interest income and economic value of equity in a minus 50 basis point immediate parallel shift in interest rates is measured on a proportional basis. In addition to monitoring our compliance with these policies, management undertakes additional analysis, considering a wide range of possible interest rate fluctuations, including changes in the shape of the yield curve, and assessing the sensitivity of these results to key assumptions, including the behavior of depositors and loan customers. 
  Based upon the current interest rate environment, as of   September 30, 2016  , our sensitivity to interest rate risk was as follows: 

We used many assumptions to calculate the impact of changes in interest rates on our portfolio, and actual results may not be similar to projections due to several factors, including the timing and frequency of rate changes, market conditions and the shape of the yield curve. Actual results may also differ due to our actions, if any, in response to the changing rates. In calculating these exposures, we use an interest rate simulation model which is validated by third-party reviewers on an annual basis. 
  In the event the model indicates an unacceptable level of risk, we may take a number of actions to reduce this risk, including changing the terms, pricing, and conditions of new loans and deposits, the sale of a portion of our available-for-sale investment portfolio or the use of risk management strategies such as interest rate swaps and caps and cash flow hedges. As of   September 30, 2016  , we were in compliance with all of the limits and policies established by our Board of Directors in predefined plus rate shocks and remained temporarily out of compliance in the minus 50 basis point proportional rate shocks. We continuously evaluate all balance sheet strategies to optimize the Company s interest rate risk position and plan to take prudent  
  
   78 

and deliberate actions which we anticipate will moderate our asset sensitivity and move the Company back into compliance with the limits and policies established by our Board of Directors. As a component of these strategies, the Company has entered into $235.0 million of notional receive-fixed interest rate swaps during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . 
  Inflation Risk Management 
  Inflation has an important impact on the growth of total assets in the banking industry and creates a need to increase equity capital to higher than normal levels in order to maintain an appropriate equity-to-assets ratio. We cope with the effects of inflation by managing our interest rate sensitivity position through our asset/liability management program, and by periodically adjusting our pricing of services and banking products to take into consideration current costs. 

ITEM 4: CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
    
           (a) 
    Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
     The Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have evaluated the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, they have concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms and are also designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed in the reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
    
           (b) 
    Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
     Changes in internal control over financial reporting    
  There have been no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the period ended   September 30, 2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.  

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1: LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
    
  From time to time we are party to various litigation matters incidental to the conduct of our business.  On January 16, 2016, a case captioned Robert Garfield v. Capital Bank Financial Corp., et al., Index No. 2016-001194-CA-01 (Fla. Cir. Ct.) (the  Garfield Action ), was filed on behalf of a putative class of Capital Bank Financial shareholders against Capital Bank Financial, its directors, and CommunityOne in the Circuit Court of the Eleventh Judicial Circuit in Miami-Dade County, Florida in connection with the merger. The complaint alleges, among other things, that the Capital Bank Financial director defendants breached their fiduciary duties by approving the merger, that CommunityOne aided and abetted such breaches, and that Capital Bank Financial, its directors and CommunityOne failed to disclose material information in connection with the merger. The complaint seeks, among other things, an order enjoining the merger, as well as other equitable relief and/or money damages, interest, costs, fees (including attorneys  fees) and expenses.  
    
  On February 29, 2016, a case captioned Curtis R. Pendleton v. Robert L. Reid, et al., Case 5:16-cv-00037 (W.D.N.C.) (the  Pendleton Action ), was filed on behalf of a putative class of CommunityOne shareholders against CommunityOne, its directors, and Capital Bank Financial in the United States District Court for the Western District of North Carolina in connection with the merger. The complaint alleges, among other things, that certain defendants violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by issuing a Registration/Joint Proxy Statement that, plaintiff alleges, is materially incomplete and misleading. On March 14, 2016, a case captioned Floyd Scrogham v. Robert L. Reid, et al., No. 5:16-cv-00045 (the  Scrogham Action ) was filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of North Carolina on behalf of a putative class of CommunityOne shareholders against CommunityOne, its directors, and Capital Bank Financial. The complaint in the Scrogham Action, like the complaint in the Pendleton Action, alleges, among other things, that certain defendants violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by issuing a Registration/Joint Proxy Statement that, plaintiffs allege, is materially incomplete and misleading. The Pendleton and Scrogham Actions seek, among other things, an order enjoining the merger, as well as other equitable relief and/or money damages, interest, costs, fees (including attorneys  fees) and  
  
   79 

expenses. On March 31, 2016, the Pendleton and Scrogham Actions were consolidated for all purposes under the caption In re CommunityOne Bancorp Consolidated Stockholder Litigation, No. 5:16-cv-00037 (the  Consolidated WDNC Action ). 
    
  On April 1, 2016, the parties to the Consolidated WDNC Action filed with the Court a memorandum of understanding in which the parties agreed on the terms of a settlement of those lawsuits. In connection with the settlement, CommunityOne made certain supplemental disclosures related to the merger on April 6, 2016. The proposed settlement is conditional upon, among other things, the execution of an appropriate stipulation of settlement following completion of confirmatory discovery, consummation of the merger and final approval of the proposed settlement by the court. There can be no assurance that the parties to the Consolidated WDNC Action will ultimately enter into a stipulation of settlement or that the court will approve the settlement even if the parties were to enter into such stipulation. In such event, the proposed settlement as contemplated by the memorandum of understanding may be terminated. If the proposed settlement is finally approved by the court, it will release all claims in the Consolidated WDNC Action that were or could have been brought challenging any aspect of the merger and any disclosures made in connection therewith and preclude further proceedings. 
    
  On April 4, 2016, the parties to the Garfield Action reached an agreement in principle regarding the settlement of the Garfield Action and entered into a stipulation of settlement. In connection with the settlement, Capital Bank Financial made certain supplemental disclosures related to the merger on April 6, 2016. The proposed settlement is conditional upon, among other things, the completion of confirmatory discovery, consummation of the merger and final approval of the proposed settlement by the court. If the proposed settlement is finally approved by the court, it will release all claims in the Garfield Action that were or could have been brought challenging any aspect of the merger and any disclosures made in connection therewith and preclude further proceedings.  There can be no assurance that the settlement will be approved. 
    
  The defendants agreed to the settlement of these lawsuits to avoid the uncertainty, costs, distraction and disruption inherent in litigation and without admitting that further supplemental disclosure is required under any applicable rule, statute, regulation or law. Settlement hearings will be scheduled to consider the fairness, reasonableness, and adequacy of the proposed settlements following notice to the Capital Bank Financial and CommunityOne stockholders. If each of the proposed settlements is finally approved by the respective courts considering such settlements, the settlements will resolve and release all claims in the Garfield Action and the Consolidated WDNC Action that were or could have been brought challenging any aspect of the proposed merger or the merger agreement and any disclosure made in connection therewith, pursuant to terms that will be disclosed to stockholders prior to final approval of the settlement by the respective courts. In addition, in connection with the proposed settlements, the parties contemplate that plaintiffs  counsel will seek awards of attorneys  fees and expenses from each respective court. Capital Bank Financial, CommunityOne or their successors will pay or cause to be paid those attorneys  fees and expenses awarded by the respective courts. There can be no assurance that the courts will approve the settlements. 
    
  On September 16, 2016, the Company entered into a settlement agreement to settle a purported class action litigation regarding the alleged improper assessment and collection of overdraft fees (the  Settlement Agreement ). The litigation was filed in the Chancery Court for Tennessee, 20th Judicial District, on February 1, 2011 against GreenBank ( GreenBank ) regarding activity that occurred between February 1, 2005 and June 30, 2011. The Company completed the acquisition of GreenBank on September 8, 2011. The Company agreed to the Settlement Agreement solely by way of compromise and settlement and to avoid further litigation expense. The Company s agreement is not in any way an admission of liability, fault or wrongdoing by the Company or by GreenBank. 
    
  Pursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement, the Company will pay $1.5 million to settle the litigation which will be payable within fourteen days after preliminary court approval of the settlement. In addition, the Company agreed not to use debit re-sequencing, weekend and holiday high-to-low posting or weekend and holiday batch processing for a period of at least 36 months following final court approval of the settlement. The Company does not currently engage in such re-sequencing or batching process described above.
