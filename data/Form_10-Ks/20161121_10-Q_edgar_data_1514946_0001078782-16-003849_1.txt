   September 30, 2016 and 2015   
  (unaudited)  
   
  NOTE 1: ORGANIZATION  
   
 The Company was originally incorporated in Nevada on November 18, 2010, as Axim International Inc. On July 24, 2014, the Company changed its name to AXIM Biotechnologies, Inc. to better reflect its business operations. The Company s principal executive office is located at 18 East 50th Street, 5th Floor, New York, NY 10022. On August 7, 2014, the Company formed a wholly owned Nevada subsidiary named Axim Holdings, Inc. This subsidiary will be used to help facilitate the anticipated activities planned by the Company. On May 11, 2015 the Company acquired a 100% interest in Can Chew License Company a Nevada incorporated licensing Company, through the exchange of 5,826,706 shares of its common stock.  
   
  NOTE 2: BASIS OF PRESENTATION:  
   
 The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of AXIM Biotechnologies, Inc.  (formerly Axim International, Inc.)  as of September 30, 2016, and for the nine months period ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ( US GAAP ). 
   
 The following (a) balance sheets as of September 30, 2016 (unaudited) and December 31, 2015, which have been derived from audited financial statements, and (b) the unaudited interim statements of operations and cash flows of AXIM Biotechnologies, Inc. (the  Company ) have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 8-03 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016. These unaudited financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2015 included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) on April 14, 2016. 
   
  NOTE 3: SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   
   
  Use of estimates  
   
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during reporting periods. Actual results could differ from these estimates. 
   
  Cash equivalents  
   
 The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. 
   
  Inventory  
   
 Inventory consists of finished goods available for sale and raw materials owned by the Company and are stated at the lower of cost or market. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company wrote off finished goods inventory worth $-0- and $9,753; respectively. As of September 30, 2016 the finished goods inventory totaled $151,058 and the shelf life of the finished goods inventory is set to expire on April 6, 2017. 
   
  Property and equipment  
   
 Property and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using straight-line method over the estimated useful life. New assets and expenditures that extend the useful life of property or equipment are capitalized and depreciated. Expenditures for ordinary repairs and maintenance are charged to operations as incurred. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded $839 and $2,516; respectively, of depreciation expense. 

7 

Intangible Assets  
   
 As required by generally accepted accounting principles, trademarks and patents are not amortized since they have an indefinite life. Instead, they are tested annually for impairment. Intangible assets as of September 30, 2016 amounted to $63,167 net of accumulated impairment losses of $652,265. 
   
  Revenue Recognition  
   
 The Company recognizes revenue on four basic criteria that must be met before revenue can be recognized: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; (3) the fee is fixed or determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. Determination of criteria (3) and (4) are based on management s judgments regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for services rendered and products delivered and the collectability of those fees. Revenue is generally recognized upon shipment. 
   
 Revenues from continuing operations recognized for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 amounted to $9,600 and $21,610, respectively. 
   
 Revenues from continuing operations recognized for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 amounted to $34,846 and $33,722, respectively.  
   
  Principles of consolidation  
   
 The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Axim Biotechnologies, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries Axim Holdings, Inc. and Can Chew License Company as of September 30, 2016 and 2015. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. 
   
  Derivative Liabilities  
   
 The Company assessed the classification of its derivative financial instruments as of September 30, 2016, which consist of convertible instruments and rights to shares of the Company s common stock, and determined that such derivatives meet the criteria for liability classification under ASC 815. 
   
 ASC 815 generally provides three criteria that, if met, require companies to bifurcate conversion options from their host instruments and account for them as free standing derivative financial instruments. These three criteria include circumstances in which (a) the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative instrument are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract, (b) the hybrid instrument that embodies both the embedded derivative instrument and the host contract is not re-measured at fair value under otherwise applicable generally accepted accounting principles with changes in fair value reported in earnings as they occur and (c) a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative instrument would be considered a derivative instrument subject to the requirements of ASC 815. ASC 815 also provides an exception to this rule when the host instrument is deemed to be conventional, as described. 
   
  Fair Value of Financial Instruments  
   
 Effective January 1, 2008, the Company adopted FASB ASC 820-Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, or ASC 820, for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis. ASC 820 establishes a common definition for fair value to be applied to existing generally accepted accounting principles that require the use of fair value measurements establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure about such fair value measurements. The adoption of ASC 820 did not have an impact on the Company s financial position or operating results, but did expand certain disclosures. 
   
 ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Additionally, ASC 820 requires the use of valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. These inputs are prioritized below: 
   
 Level 1: Observable inputs such as quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
 Level 2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data 
 Level 3: Unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data, which require the use of the reporting entity s own assumptions. 

8 

The Company did not have any Level 2 or Level 3 assets or liabilities as of September 30, 2016, with the exception of its convertible notes payable and derivative liability. The carrying amounts of these liabilities at September 30, 2016 approximate their respective fair value based on the Company s incremental borrowing rate. 
   
 Cash is considered to be highly liquid and easily tradable as of September 30, 2016 and therefore classified as Level 1 within our fair value hierarchy. 
   
 In addition, FASB ASC 825-10-25 Fair Value Option, or ASC 825-10-25, was effective for January 1, 2008. ASC 825-10-25 expands opportunities to use fair value measurements in financial reporting and permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. The Company did not elect the fair value options for any of its qualifying financial instruments. 
   
  Convertible Instruments  
   
 The Company evaluates and accounts for conversion options embedded in its convertible instruments in accordance with professional standards for  Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities . 
   
 Professional standards generally provides three criteria that, if met, require companies to bifurcate conversion options from their host instruments and account for them as free standing derivative financial instruments. These three criteria include circumstances in which (a) the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative instrument are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract, (b) the hybrid instrument that embodies both the embedded derivative instrument and the host contract is not re-measured at fair value under otherwise applicable generally accepted accounting principles with changes in fair value reported in earnings as they occur and (c) a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative instrument would be considered a derivative instrument. Professional standards also provide an exception to this rule when the host instrument is deemed to be conventional as defined under professional standards as  The Meaning of  Conventional Convertible Debt Instrument . 
   
 The Company accounts for convertible instruments (when it has determined that the embedded conversion options should not be bifurcated from their host instruments) in accordance with professional standards when  Accounting for Convertible Securities with Beneficial Conversion Features,  as those professional standards pertain to  Certain Convertible Instruments.  Accordingly, the Company records, when necessary, discounts to convertible notes for the intrinsic value of conversion options embedded in debt instruments based upon the differences between the fair value of the underlying common stock at the commitment date of the note transaction and the effective conversion price embedded in the note. Debt discounts under these arrangements are amortized over the term of the related debt to their earliest date of redemption. The Company also records when necessary deemed dividends for the intrinsic value of conversion options embedded in preferred shares based upon the differences between the fair value of the underlying common stock at the commitment date of the note transaction and the effective conversion price embedded in the note. 
   
 ASC 815-40 provides that, among other things, generally, if an event is not within the entity s control could or require net cash settlement, then the contract shall be classified as an asset or a liability. 
   
  Income taxes  
   
 The Company follows Section 740-10, Income tax ( ASC 740-10 ) Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent management concludes it is more likely than not that the assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the Statements of Operations in the period that includes the enactment date. 
   
 The Company recognizes deferred tax assets to the extent that the Company believes that these assets are more likely than not to be realized. In making such a determination, the Company considers all available positive and negative evidence, including reversals of any existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, and the results of recent operations. If the Company determines that it would be able to realize a deferred tax asset in the future in excess of any recorded amount, the Company would make an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, which would reduce the provision for income taxes.  

9 

The Company adopted section 740-10-25 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification ( Section 740-10-25 ). Section 740-10-25 addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements. Under Section 740-10-25, the Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent (50%) likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Section 740-10-25 also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties on income taxes, accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures. The Company had no liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits according to the provisions of Section 740-10-25. 
   
  Concentrations of Credit Risk  
   
 Financial instruments and related items, which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk, consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents. The Company places its cash and temporary cash investments with credit quality institutions. At times, such amounts may be in excess of the FDIC insurance limit. The Company does not have accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 
   
  Net loss per common share  
   
 Net loss per common share is computed pursuant to section 260-10-45 Earnings Per Share ( ASC 260-10 ) of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding and the member potentially outstanding during each period. In periods when a net loss is experienced, only basic net loss per share is calculated because to do otherwise would be anti-dilutive. 
   
 There were 41,802,659 common share equivalents at September 30, 2016 and 39,364,706 at September 30, 2015. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 these potential shares were excluded from the shares used to calculate diluted earnings per share as their inclusion would reduce net loss per share. 
   
  Stock Based Compensation  
   
 All stock-based payments to employees and to nonemployee directors for their services as directors, including any grants of restricted stock and stock options, are measured at fair value on the grant date and recognized in the statements of operations as compensation or other expense over the relevant service period. Stock-based payments to nonemployees are recognized as an expense over the period of performance. Such payments are measured at fair value at the earlier of the date a performance commitment is reached or the date performance is completed. In addition, for awards that vest immediately and are non-forfeitable the measurement date is the date the award is issued. 
   
  Cost of Sales  
   
 Cost of sales includes the purchase cost of products sold and all costs associated with getting the products to the customers including buying and transportation costs. 
   
  Research and Development  
   
 The Company accounts for research and development costs in accordance with the Accounting Standards Codification subtopic 730-10, Research and Development ( ASC 730-10 ). Under ASC 730-10, all research and development costs must be charged to expense as incurred. Accordingly, internal research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Third-party research and development costs are expensed when the contracted work has been performed or as milestone results have been achieved. Company-sponsored research and development costs related to both present and future products are expensed in the period incurred. The Company incurred research and development expenses of $163,946 and $507,014 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The Company incurred research and development expenses of $87,718 and $133,087 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 
   
  Shipping Costs  
   
 Shipping and handling costs billed to customers are recorded in sales. Shipping costs incurred by the company are recorded in general and administrative expenses.

Recently issued accounting standards  
   
 In October 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-16 - Income Taxes: Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory. ASU 2016-16 will require the tax effects of intercompany transactions, other than sales of inventory, to be recognized currently, eliminating an exception under current GAAP in which the tax effects of intra-entity asset transfers are deferred until the transferred asset is sold to a third party or otherwise recovered through use. The guidance will be effective for the first interim period of our 2019 fiscal year, with early adoption permitted.  
   
 In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) ASU No. 2016-15,  Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  ( ASU 2016-15 ). ASU 2016-15 provides guidance regarding the classification of certain items within the statements of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 with early adoption permitted.  
   
 In connection with its financial instruments project, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13 - Financial Instruments - Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments in June 2016 and ASU 2016-01 - Financial Instruments - Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities in January 2016.  

ASU 2016-13 introduces a new impairment model for most financial assets and certain other instruments. For trade and other receivables, held-to-maturity debt securities, loans and other instruments, entities will be required to use a forward-looking  expected loss  model that will replace the current  incurred loss  model and generally will result in earlier recognition of allowances for losses. The guidance will be effective for the first interim period of our 2021 fiscal year, with early adoption in fiscal year 2020 permitted. 

ASU 2016-01 addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. Among other provisions, the new guidance requires the fair value measurement of investments in certain equity securities. For investments without readily determinable fair values, entities have the option to either measure these investments at fair value or at cost adjusted for changes in observable prices minus impairment. All changes in measurement will be recognized in net income. The guidance will be effective for the first interim period of our 2019 fiscal year. Early adoption is not permitted, except for certain provisions relating to financial liabilities. 
   
 In April 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued an Accounting Standards Update (ASU)  ASU 2016   10 Revenue from Contract with Customers: identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing . The amendments in this Update clarify the two following aspects (a) contracts with customers to transfer goods and services in exchange for consideration and (b) determining whether an entity s promise to grant a license provides a customer with either a right to use the entity s intellectual property (which is satisfied at a point in time) or a right to access the entity s intellectual property (which is satisfied over time). The amendments in this Update are intended to reduce the degree of judgment necessary to comply with Topic 606. This guidance has no effective date as yet. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance. 
   
 In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued an Accounting Standards Update (ASU)  ASU 2016   09 Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  which is intended to improve the accounting for employee share-based payments. The ASU simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions, including; the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and the classification on the statement of cash flows. The new standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and upon adoption, an entity should apply the amendments by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet at the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance. 
   
 In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-02, which amends the guidance in U.S. GAAP on accounting for operating leases, a lessee will be required to recognize assets and liabilities for operating leases with lease terms of more than 12 months on the balance sheet. The new standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and upon adoption, an entity should apply the amendments by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet at the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. Early adoption is not permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance. 

11 

In January 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-01, which amends the guidance in U.S. GAAP on the classification and measurement of financial instruments. Changes to the current guidance primarily affect the accounting for equity investments, financial liabilities under the fair value option, and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. In addition, the ASU clarifies guidance related to the valuation allowance assessment when recognizing deferred tax assets resulting from unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities. The new standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and upon adoption, an entity should apply the amendments by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet at the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. Early adoption is not permitted except for the provision to record fair value changes for financial liabilities under the fair value option resulting from instrument-specific credit risk in other comprehensive income. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance. 
   
 The amendments also clarify that the guidance in Topic 275, Risks and Uncertainties, is applicable to entities that have not commenced planned principal operations.

NOTE 9: CONVERTIBLE NOTES PAYABLE  
   
 On November 26, 2012, the Company entered into an interest free $50,000 convertible loan payable maturing on December 31, 2014. The note was convertible into the Company's common stock at a conversion price of $0.10 per share. The Company was unable to repay the loan as of December 31, 2014, and obtained multiple extensions until December 31, 2015. The Company had paid no interest or other consideration in return for the extensions of the loan. Unable to obtain further extension of the maturity date, on June 29, 2016, the Company entered into a Debt Exchange Agreement with the note holder whereby the Company exchanged the note having a balance due of $50,000 as of December 31, 2015, for a long-term convertible note in the amount of $50,000. The new Convertible Note ( Note ) bears interest at the rate of 3.5% per annum, payable annually beginning on July 1, 2017, and matures on July 1, 2028. The Note is convertible, in whole or in part at any time at the option of the holder, into the Company's common stock at a conversion price of $0.01, provided however, the holder of the Note is not permitted to convert an amount of the Note that would result in the holder and its affiliates owning more than 4.9% of the Company's outstanding common stock. The Company determined fair value of new debt $1,435,000 and as a result was recorded $1,385,000 as a loss on debt extinguishment during the period ended September 30, 2016. On June 30, 2016, the holder of the Note converted $5,000 face value into 500,000 shares of the Company's common stock. The balance on the Note as of September 30, 2016 is $45,394, including interest accrued thereon of $394. 
   
 The Company has outstanding convertible note payable having a balance due of $265,490 and $400,000 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 respectively.

The Note was issued in April of 2015 to a third-party as a non-refundable payment for consultancy services to be provided to the Company for a period of at least one year. The Note is convertible, in whole or in part at any time at the option of the holder, into shares of the Company's common stock at a conversion price of $0.10, provided however, the holder of the Note is not permitted to convert an amount of the Note that would result in the holder and its affiliates owning more than 4.9% of the Company's outstanding common stock.

The balance on the Note as of September 30, 2016 is $267,946, including interest accrued thereon of $2,457.  
   
 On September 16, 2016, we entered into a convertible note purchase agreement (the  Convertible Note Purchase Agreement  or  Agreement ) with a third-party investor. Under the terms of the Convertible Note Purchase Agreement the investor may acquire up to $5,000,000 of convertible notes from the Company, with various closings, under terms acceptable to the Company and the investor as of the time of each closing. Pursuant to the Agreement, on September 16, 2016 the investor provided the Company with $850,000 secured convertible note financing pursuant to four (4) Secured Convertible Promissory Notes (the  Notes ). Each of the Notes mature on October 1, 2029, and pay 3.5% compounded interest paid bi-annually. The Notes are secured by the assets of the Company, may not be pre-paid without the consent of the holder, and are convertible at the option of the holder into shares of the Company s common stock at a conversion price equal to the lesser of: (i) $0.2201 or (ii) 80% of closing price of the Company s common stock as of the date of conversion. These financial statements reflect a derivative liability of $1,062,500 which gives effect to such conversion and the corresponding decrease in Notes Payable. The balance on the Note as of September 30, 2016 is $851,240, including interest accrued thereon of $1,240 and net of. unamortized debt discount of $847,313. During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 the Company amortized debt discount of $2,687 and $2,687, respectively.  
   
  NOTE 10: DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES  
   
  The Company applies the provisions of ASC Topic 815-40,    Contracts in Entity s Own Equity    ( ASC Topic 815-40 ), under which convertible instruments, which contain terms that protect holders from declines in the stock price (reset provisions), may not be exempt from derivative accounting treatment. As a result, embedded conversion options in convertible debt are recorded as a liability and are revalued at fair value at each reporting date. If the fair value of the warrants exceeds the face value of the related debt, the excess is recorded as change in fair value in operations on the issuance date. The Company has $850,000 of convertible debt with variable conversion pricing outstanding at September 30, 2016.  

14 

The Company identified embedded derivatives related to the Convertible Promissory Notes. These embedded derivatives included certain conversion features. The accounting treatment of derivative financial instruments requires that the Company record the fair value of the derivatives as of the inception date of the Convertible Promissory Note and to adjust the fair value as of each subsequent balance sheet date. At the inception of the Convertible Promissory Note, the Company determined a fair value of $1,062,500 of the embedded derivative. The fair value of the embedded derivative was determined using the Black Scholes Model based on the following assumptions: 

The initial fair values of the embedded debt derivative $850,000 was allocated as a debt discount up to the proceeds of the note with the remainder $212,500 was charged to current period operations as interest expense. 
   
 The fair value of the described embedded derivative on all debt was valued at $1,062,500 at September 30, 2016 with same assumption on above table. The Company adjusted the recorded fair value of the derivative liability on debt to market resulting in non-cash, non-operating loss of $0 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

The following table provides a summary of changes in fair value of the Company s Level 3 derivative liabilities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016:

On September 15, 2016, the Company entered into an employment agreement with Dr. Philip Van A. Damme, its Chief Medical Officer. The agreement does not have a set term and may be terminated at any time by the Company or Dr. Van A. Damme with proper notice. Under the agreement Dr. Van A. Damme receives an annual base compensation of $24,000 and an incentive payment of 200,000 shares of the Company's common stock due upon execution of the agreement. Upon the one year anniversary of the agreement, the Company has the discretion to grant additional equity awards to Dr. Van A. Damme. On September 15, 2016, the Company was obligated to issue 200,000 restricted shares of the Company s common stock pursuant to the terms of the September 1, 2016, employment agreement with Dr. Van A. Damme. . During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 the Company accrued $48,000 and $48,000; respectively. of compensation expense in the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements to account for the required issuance of the incentive shares 
   
 The Company entered into a reservation agreement with the Municipality of Almere in the Netherlands. In October 2015 the Company paid the reservation fee in the amount of $65,170.The reservation fee deposit gives the company an exclusive right to purchase the building land for a purchase price of    1,110,000. Starting in October 2016 the second reservation period was extended for a period of twelve (12) months expiring October 2017. The Company may not have the ability to acquire the land prior to the expiration of the extended reservation term. Therefore, in that case, the Company intends to seek another extension of the reservation period, however, there can be no assurance that the municipality will agree to such an extension in which case the reservation fee would be forfeited. 
   
  NOTE 14: GOING CONCERN  
   
 The Company s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been presented assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As shown in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, the Company has negative working capital of $2,996,614, has an accumulated deficit of $16,886,047 has cash used in operating activities of continuing operations $761,694 and presently does not have the resources to accomplish its objectives during the next twelve months.

   Description of Business   
   
 We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on November 18, 2010, as AXIM International, Inc. (Inception). On July 24, 2014, we changed our name to AXIM Biotechnologies, Inc. to better reflect our business operations. On August 7, 2014, we incorporated a wholly owned Nevada subsidiary named Axim Holdings, Inc. This subsidiary will be used to help facilitate the anticipated activities listed below. Our principal executive office is located at 18 East 50th Street, 5th Floor, New York, NY 10022.  
   
 In early 2014, we discontinued our organic waste marketable by-product business to focus on our anticipated new business to become an innovative biotechnology company working on the treatment of pain, spasticity, anxiety and other medical disorders with the application of cannabinoids based products as well as focusing on research, development and production of pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, oral health and cosmetic products as well as procurement of genetically and nano-controlled active ingredients. 
   
  Current Operations  
   
 The operations of the Company include: the research and development of pharmaceutical products, genetically controlled botanical products, and extraction and purification of cannabinoids technologies. Over the next 12 months, we anticipated the following activities: 
   
 1. 
 Conducting a clinical trial at the Free University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands in collaboration with the University of Plymouth, UK as well as an academic center in the USA for a novel, patented controlled-release delivery form of cannabinoids for treatment of chronic pain and spasticity in patients with multiple sclerosis. The anticipated duration of the trials prior to FDA/ EMA registration is 12 months. 
   
 2. 
 Conducting clinical trials at the university of Wageningen, The Netherlands on patients with irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis and Crohn s disease using innovative, (patented and patent pending technologies) delivery mechanisms containing various cannabinoids. 
   
 3. 
 Conducting a clinical trial at the University of British Columbia, Canada on patients suffering of illicit drug-related psychosis using innovative, (patented) delivery mechanisms containing cannabinoids. This trial is awaiting approval by Health Canada and will result in an NDA. 
   
 4. 
 Completing a proof of concept clinical trial at the Dermatological Center Maurits Clinic The Hague, The Netherlands on patients with psoriasis and atopic dermatitis using innovative, (patent pending and patented) delivery mechanisms containing unique cannabinoids. 
   
 5. 
 Development of novel (patent pending) pharmaceutical cannabinoid and opioid-agonist/ anatagonist-based preparations  CannQuit   formulations for tobacco, opioid and cannabis dependence treatment. 
   
 6. 
 Development of novel (patent pending) antibacterial  Cannocyn    and anti fungal  Cannonych    preparations based on unique cannabinoids. 

20 

7.

 16. 
 Development of sustainable biofuel compositions derived from industrial hemp by-products, such as our high-energy output hemp coal  CannaCoal .  
   
 During the next twelve months we anticipate incurring costs related to: (i) filing Exchange Act reports, (ii) contractual obligations, (iii) clinical trials, and (iv) land purchase. 
   
 We believe we will be able to meet these costs through use of funds in our treasury, through deferral of fees by certain service providers and additional amounts, as necessary, to be loaned to or invested in us by our stockholders, management or other investors. As of the date of the period covered by this report, we have limited cash. There are no assurances that we will be able to secure any additional funding as needed. Currently, however our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to generate future profitable operations and/or to obtain the necessary financing to meet our obligations and repay our liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Management s plan includes obtaining additional funds by equity financing and/or related party advances; however there is no assurance of additional funding being available. 
   
 We are in our early stages of development and growth, without established records of sales or earnings. We will be subject to numerous risks inherent in the business and operations of financially unstable and early stage or potential emerging growth companies. 
   
  CanChew TM  License Agreement  
   
 On May 11, 2015, we entered into a 50 year, worldwide, exclusive intellectual property licensing agreement ( Agreement ) with CanChew Biotechnologies, LLC ( CanChew ). As compensation for the Agreement, CanChew received 5,826,706 restricted shares of the Company s common stock and a royalty fee of approximately 2-3% of all gross sales derived from products produced under the Agreement. So long as we are in compliance with the Agreement, we have the option to purchase the licensed intellectual property after 5 years at a purchase price equal to fifty percent (50%) of the annual royalty fee paid. 

21 

Manufacturing Capabilities  
   
 On November 15, 2014, the Company entered into Reservation Agreement with the City of Almere, The Netherlands, whereby the Company was granted an option to purchase 5,328 square meters of land in the City of Almere. The Company intends to construct an office building on the site featuring: a clean laboratory zone, storage areas, office and technical rooms as well as manufacturing facility furnishings. This facility will be fully compliant with GMP, GLP, FDA, EMA and ISO regulations. The purchase price for the land is 985,680 Euros. The company has paid three reservation fees for options to purchase the property. The most recent reservation fee of 57,742 Euros is due and payable, and extends the option to purchase until October 20, 2017. Should the Company purchase the property by October 20, 2017, the 23,000 Euros of the most recent reservation fee will be applied to the against the purchase price of the property. The total land surface of the property has been slightly increased by 6,000 square meters due to payment of the previous reservation fees which cannot be applied to the purchase price. 
   
  The Industry  
   
  Hemp   An Overview  
   
 Hemp is a cousin to cannabis as both are classified under the same botanical category of  Cannabis sativa  L. The major difference between the two is that recreational cannabis has significant amounts of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) (5 20%), a psychotropic cannabinoid and very little amounts of CBD (cannabidiol) and CBG (cannabigerol), which have no psychotropic properties; whereas industrial hemp has virtually no THC (less than 0.3%). This 0.3% THC in industrial hemp is not enough to provide psychotropic effects, which renders industrial hemp useless for recreational use or abuse. Canada, China and the United Kingdom are examples of major industrialized countries that have grown industrial hemp responsibly deriving maximum economic benefits from its cultivation. 
   
 Hemp is a plant easy to cultivate, with predictable harvests and produces overall negative carbon print compared to other agricultural sources used for production of biodiesels among other uses. 
   
 Industrial hemp is reach in proteins and essential amino acids, which may render it as a preferred source of food and animal feed. 
   
  Importation of Hemp Finished Products  
   
 Despite classification of cannabis under Schedule I, hemp finished products, or certain parts of the plant  Cannabis sativa , are exempted from the definition of marijuana and are considered legal to import since 1937. Under 21 U.S.C.   802(16), the seeds (incapable of germination) and the mature stalks of the  Cannabis sativa  plant, together with products made from these parts, are exempted from the definition of cannabis. These products are commonly known as  hemp finished products , and can be a variety of products as outlined above. Importation of hemp finished products and processing into the United States continues legally, which fuels a hemp market inside the United States. The United States is actually the largest importer of hemp-based products in the world. 
   
  Market, Customers and Distribution Methods  
   
 To understand the market and consumers as well as distribution methods, we have studied all the uses of hemp and its legal structure in the U.S. and abroad. There are more than 25,000 known uses for hemp based products, most of which were used in the past and were replaced by cotton, petroleum\oil, concrete, corn and soybeans. We believe the market potentially represents trillions of dollars in worldwide product sales. We will focus on the products our management feels will have the greatest positive environmental impact, profitability and ease to market. These tend to be new, innovative products as well as the replacement of existing raw base materials for products that exist today, such as pharmaceuticals, nutriceuticals, plastics, fuel, textiles, and medical delivery devices. 
   
 Our focus is on the development of innovative pharmaceutical, nutriceutical and cosmetic products focusing on diseases and conditions for which currently there are no known efficient therapeutic ingredients or delivery systems for known active pharmaceutical ingredients. The body of knowledge regarding therapeutic use of cannabinoid-based formulations is steadily increasing. We plan to be an active player in this field of biosciences with our extensive R D and pipeline of innovative products. 
   
 Our target customers are first and foremost end consumers via Internet sales, direct-to-consumer health and wellness stores, collectives, cooperatives, affiliate sales and master distributors. Secondarily, we are targeting manufactures of products that can readily replace their raw base materials with our materials, making the products more environmentally friendly and sustainable. Next, we will target retail stores with major distribution companies who have preexisting relationships with major retail chain stores. As we continue to develop our business, these markets may change, be re-prioritized or eliminated as management responds to consumer and regulatory developments. 

22 

Competition  
   
 There are many developers of hemp-based consumer products, many of which are under-capitalized which we consider to be viable acquisition targets. We are currently in early-stage negotiations to purchase existing product lines, sources of industrial-hemp-derived-cannabinoids and other assets from certain competing companies. There are also large, well-funded companies that currently do not offer hemp-based products but may do so in the future. 
   
  Intellectual Property  
   
 Currently, our intellectually property includes 9 pending patent applications and 18 trademark applications. 
   
 Our 9 patent applications include oral care, ophthalmic, sugar alcohol kneading method, antimicrobial, extraction method, cosmetic, nicotine dependence treatment gum, opioid dependence treatment gum, and suppositories. Six (6) of our patent applications have entered non-provisional stage in the U.S. and international stage and one (1) licensed patent (chewing gum containing cannabinoids, covering all cannabinoids, including THC). We are in the process of developing and filing more patent applications. 
   
 We have 18 trademark applications some of which are registered trademarks, received Notices of Allowance, or are pending in front of the United States Patent and Trademark Office: Axim, A Axim Biotech, CanChui, Cannonich, Cannanimals, Oraximax, CannaCoal, CanShu, CanQuit, SuppoCann, OpthoCann, CannBelph, Cannocyn, ReneCann, Clean CannaCoal, CanChew Hemp CBD Gum, CanChew, and HempChew. Corresponding trademark applications have been filed in other jurisdictions for some of the marks and have received registration or are pending. 
   
  Research and Development  
   
 We are continuing our research and development at the Free University of Amsterdam with our novel (patent pending) delivery system for treatment of patients with pain and spasticity as a sequence of Multiple Sclerosis. This study will include also the University of Plymouth, UK and academic centers in the US. The study is conducted in strict compliance with FDA/ EMA guidelines and is supervised by QPS as a CRO. The product tested is a pharmaceutical, functional chewing gum containing equal parts of THC and CBD. With our proprietary technology numerous problems related to cannabinoid  water-insolubility due to its lipophilic nature, bypass of first-pass liver metabolism and direct delivery into the systemic circulation have been resolved. 
   
 Clinical studies will commence at the University of Wageningen, The Netherlands testing a new (patent pending) delivery systems with novel cannabinoids for treatment of patients with IBS, IBD and Crohn s disease. A new direct as well as controlled slow-release nano-technology delivery methods will be investigated based on our proprietary IP . 
   
 New, patent pending cannabinoid extraction techniques as well as pure, water soluble, freeze-dried cannabinoids are being developed in cooperation with Syncom, BV, The Netherlands, which practically solves the issue with very poor absorption of currently available, oil based cannabinoids. 
   
 There are numerous other R D projects being considered involving our proprietary intellectual property. These will be strategically planned depending on availability of funds to carry on. 
   
  Source and Availability of Raw Materials  
   
 The Company currently has arrangements with multiple reputable suppliers which are expected to meet the projected needs for materials for the upcoming year. 
   
  Government Regulation  
   
 For the first time since 1937, industrial hemp has been decriminalized at the federal level and can be grown legally in the United States, but on a limited basis. A landmark provision in the recently passed Agricultural Act of 2014 recognizes hemp as distinct from its genetic cousin, marijuana. Federal law now exempts industrial hemp from U.S. drug laws in order to allow for crop research by universities, colleges and state agriculture departments. The new federal law, written by U.S. Rep. Jared Polis (D-CO) and U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY), allows for agricultural pilot programs for industrial hemp  in states that permit the growth or cultivation of hemp.  

23 

Employees  
   
 As of November 21, 2016, we have 6 full-time employees and 4 part-time employees. We allow and utilize the services of independent contractors. We will be considering the conversion of some of our part-time employees to full-time positions. We are currently in discussions with qualified individuals to engage them for positions in sales and marketing, research and development, and operations. Management believes the Company has good relationships with its employees. 
   
  Costs and effects of compliance with environmental laws  
   
 The expense of complying with environmental regulations is of minimal consequence.

  Going concern  
   
 The Company s unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been presented assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As shown in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements, the Company has negative working capital of $2,996,614, has an accumulated deficit of $16,886,047, has cash used in operating activities of continuing operations $761,694 and presently does not have the resources to accomplish its objectives during the next twelve months. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue in operation. 
   
 The Company intends to raise additional capital through private placements of debt and equity securities, but there can be no assurance that these funds will be available on terms acceptable to the Company, or will be sufficient to enable the Company to fully complete its development activities or sustain operations. If the Company is unable to raise sufficient additional funds, it will have to develop and implement a plan to further extend payables, reduce overhead, or scale back its current business plan until sufficient additional capital is raised to support further operations. There can be no assurance that such a plan will be successful.

  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  
   
 We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.  
   
  Contractual Obligations  
   
 As a  smaller reporting company  as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, the Company is not required to provide this information. 
   
  Critical accounting policies  
   
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported periods. The more critical accounting estimates include estimates related to revenue recognition and accounts receivable allowances. We also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results, which are described in Note 3 to our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 
   
  Recently issued accounting standards  
   
 In October 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-16 - Income Taxes: Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory. ASU 2016-16 will require the tax effects of intercompany transactions, other than sales of inventory, to be recognized currently, eliminating an exception under current GAAP in which the tax effects of intra-entity asset transfers are deferred until the transferred asset is sold to a third party or otherwise recovered through use. The guidance will be effective for the first interim period of our 2019 fiscal year, with early adoption permitted.  
   
 In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) ASU No. 2016-15,  Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  ( ASU 2016-15 ). ASU 2016-15 provides guidance regarding the classification of certain items within the statements of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 with early adoption permitted.  
   
 In connection with its financial instruments project, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13 - Financial Instruments - Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments in June 2016 and ASU 2016-01 - Financial Instruments - Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities in January 2016.  

26 

ASU 2016-13 introduces a new impairment model for most financial assets and certain other instruments. For trade and other receivables, held-to-maturity debt securities, loans and other instruments, entities will be required to use a forward-looking  expected loss  model that will replace the current  incurred loss  model and generally will result in earlier recognition of allowances for losses. The guidance will be effective for the first interim period of our 2021 fiscal year, with early adoption in fiscal year 2020 permitted. 

ASU 2016-01 addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. Among other provisions, the new guidance requires the fair value measurement of investments in certain equity securities. For investments without readily determinable fair values, entities have the option to either measure these investments at fair value or at cost adjusted for changes in observable prices minus impairment. All changes in measurement will be recognized in net income. The guidance will be effective for the first interim period of our 2019 fiscal year. Early adoption is not permitted, except for certain provisions relating to financial liabilities. 
   
 In April 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued an Accounting Standards Update (ASU)  ASU 2016   10 Revenue from Contract with Customers: identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing . The amendments in this Update clarify the two following aspects (a) contracts with customers to transfer goods and services in exchange for consideration and (b) determining whether an entity s promise to grant a license provides a customer with either a right to use the entity s intellectual property (which is satisfied at a point in time) or a right to access the entity s intellectual property (which is satisfied over time). The amendments in this Update are intended to reduce the degree of judgment necessary to comply with Topic 606. This guidance has no effective date as yet. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance. 
   
 In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued an Accounting Standards Update (ASU)  ASU 2016   09 Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  which is intended to improve the accounting for employee share-based payments. The ASU simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions, including; the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and the classification on the statement of cash flows. The new standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and upon adoption, an entity should apply the amendments by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet at the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance. 
   
 In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-02, which amends the guidance in U.S. GAAP on accounting for operating leases, a lessee will be required to recognize assets and liabilities for operating leases with lease terms of more than 12 months on the balance sheet. The new standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and upon adoption, an entity should apply the amendments by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet at the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. Early adoption is not permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance. 
   
 In January 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-01, which amends the guidance in U.S. GAAP on the classification and measurement of financial instruments. Changes to the current guidance primarily affect the accounting for equity investments, financial liabilities under the fair value option, and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. In addition, the ASU clarifies guidance related to the valuation allowance assessment when recognizing deferred tax assets resulting from unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities. The new standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and upon adoption, an entity should apply the amendments by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet at the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. Early adoption is not permitted except for the provision to record fair value changes for financial liabilities under the fair value option resulting from instrument-specific credit risk in other comprehensive income. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance. 
   
 The amendments also clarify that the guidance in Topic 275, Risks and Uncertainties, is applicable to entities that have not commenced planned principal operations. 
   
 Other recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB and the SEC did not or are not believed by management to have a material impact on the Company's present or future consolidated financial statements.
