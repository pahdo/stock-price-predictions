1. Description of Business   
     
  Liquidmetal Technologies, Inc. (the  Company ) is a materials technology and manufacturing company that develops and commercializes products made from amorphous alloys. The Company s family of alloys consists of a variety of bulk alloys and composites that utilizes the advantages offered by amorphous alloys technology. The Company designs, develops, manufactures and sells custom products and components from bulk amorphous alloys to customers in a wide range of industries. The Company also partners with third-party manufacturers and licensees to develop and commercialize Liquidmetal alloy products.   
     
  Amorphous alloys are, in general, unique materials that are distinguished by their ability to retain a random atomic structure when they solidify, in contrast to the crystalline atomic structure that forms in other metals and alloys when they solidify. Liquidmetal alloys are proprietary amorphous alloys that possess a combination of performance, processing, and potential cost advantages that the Company believes will make them preferable to other materials in a variety of applications. The amorphous atomic structure of bulk alloys enables them to overcome certain performance limitations caused by inherent weaknesses in crystalline atomic structures, thus facilitating performance and processing characteristics superior in many ways to those of their crystalline counterparts. The Company s alloys and the injection molding technology it employs result in components that exhibit: exceptional dimensional control and repeatability that rivals precision machining, excellent corrosion resistance, brilliant surface finish, high strength, high hardness, high elastic limit, alloys that are non-magnetic, and the ability to form complex shapes common to the injection molding of plastics. Interestingly, all of these characteristics are achievable from the molding process, so design engineers do not have to select specific alloys to achieve one or more of the characteristics as is the case with crystalline materials. The Company believes these advantages could result in Liquidmetal alloys supplanting high-performance alloys, such as titanium and stainless steel, and other incumbent materials in a wide variety of applications. Moreover, the Company believes these advantages could enable the introduction of entirely new products and applications that are not possible or commercially viable with other materials.  
     
  The Company s revenues are derived from i) selling bulk amorphous alloy custom products and components for applications which include, but are not limited to, non-consumer electronic devices, medical products, automotive components, and sports and leisure goods, ii) selling tooling and prototype parts such as demonstration parts and test samples for customers with products in development, iii) product licensing and royalty revenue, and iv) research and development revenue. The Company expects that these sources of revenue will continue to significantly change the character of the Company s revenue mix.  

2    .   Basis of Presentation and Recent Accounting Pronouncements   
     
  The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements as of and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( generally accepted accounting principles ) for interim financial information and in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and notes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Operating results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any future periods or the year ending December 31, 2016. The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company's 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) on March 7, 2016.  
     
   Revenue Recognition   
     
  The Company s revenue recognition policy complies with the requirements of ASC 605. Revenue is recognized when i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, ii) delivery has occurred, iii) the sales price is fixed or determinable, iv) collection is probable and v) all obligations have been substantially performed pursuant to the terms of the arrangement. Revenues primarily consist of bulk amorphous alloy custom products and components, the tooling associated with production and prototyping projects, and licensing and royalty fees for the use of the Liquidmetal brand and certified Liquidmetal bulk amorphous alloys. Revenue is deferred and included in liabilities when the Company receives cash in advance for goods not yet delivered or if the licensing term has not begun.  
     
  License revenue arrangements in general provide for the grant of certain intellectual property rights for patented technologies owned or controlled by the Company. These rights typically include the grant of an exclusive or non-exclusive right to manufacture and/or sell products covered by patented technologies owned or controlled by the Company. The intellectual property rights granted may be perpetual in nature, extending until the expiration of the related patents, or can be granted for a defined period of time.   
     
  Licensing revenues that are one time fees upon the granting of the license are recognized when i) the license term begins in a manner consistent with the nature of the transaction and the earnings process is complete, ii) when collectability is reasonably assured or upon receipt of an upfront fee, and iii) when all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. Pursuant to the terms of these agreements, the Company has no further obligation with respect to the grant of the license. Licensing revenues that are related to royalties are recognized as the royalties are earned over the related period.

   Fair Value   Measurements   
     
  The estimated fair values of financial instruments reported in the consolidated financial statements have been determined using available market information and valuation methodologies, as applicable. The fair value of cash, restricted cash, and short-term debt approximate their carrying value due to their short maturities.   
     
  Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Entities are required to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value based upon the following fair value hierarchy:  

Level 1     
 
  Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;     

Level 2     
 
  Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities; and     

Level 3     
 
  Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.     
     
  The Company has several financial instruments, namely warrant liabilities that are recorded at fair value on a periodic basis using Level 2 measurement inputs. These instruments are evaluated under the hierarchy of FASB ASC Subtopic 480-10, FASB ASC Paragraph 815-25-1 and FASB ASC Subparagraph 815-10-15-74 addressing the accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity and derivative accounting. The fair value of such instruments is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Due to the presence of certain anti-dilution and exercise price reset provisions  , such instruments are required to be classified as liabilities (see Note 11).  
     
  As of September 30, 2016, the following table represents the Company s fair value hierarchy for items that are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis:   

As of December 31, 2015, the following table represents the Company s fair value hierarchy for items that are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis: 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements   
     
   Leases   
       
  In February 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standards update which modifies the accounting for leasing arrangements, particularly those arrangements classified as operating leases. This update will require entities to recognize the assets and liabilities arising from operating leases on the balance sheet. This guidance is effective for fiscal and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and is required to be applied retrospectively to all leasing arrangements. The Company is currently assessing the effects this guidance may have on its consolidated financial statements.  
       
   Stock-Based Compensation   
       
  In March 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standards update which simplifies the accounting for share-based payment transactions, inclusive of income tax accounting and disclosure considerations. This guidance is effective for fiscal and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and is required to be applied retrospectively to all impacted share-based payment arrangements. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.

   Revenue from Contracts with Customers   
       
  In May 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standards update which modifies the requirements for identifying, allocating, and recognizing revenue related to the achievement of performance conditions under contracts with customers. This update also requires additional disclosure related to the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue that is recognized under contracts with customers. This guidance is effective for fiscal and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and is required to be applied retrospectively to all revenue arrangements. The Company is currently assessing the effects this guidance may have on its consolidated financial statements.  
       
   Ability to Continue as a Going Concern   
       
  In August 2014, the FASB issued an accounting standards update which requires an assessment of an entity s ability to continue as a going concern by incorporating and expanding upon certain principles that are currently addressed by U.S. auditing standards. This standard is effective for the fiscal years ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.  
     
   Inventory   
       
  In July 2015, the FASB issued an accounting standards update which modifies the requirements for measuring the value of inventory on a periodic basis. The new requirement will be to measure inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value. This standard is effective for the fiscal years ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.  
     
  Other recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB (including its Emerging Issues Task Force), the AICPA and the SEC did not or are not believed by management to have a material impact on the Company's present or future consolidated financial statements.  

3  .   Significant Transactions   
     
   2016 Purchase Agreement   
     
  On March 10, 2016, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the  2016 Purchase Agreement ) with Liquidmetal Technology Limited, a Hong Kong company (the  Investor ), providing for the purchase by the Investor of up to 405,000,000 shares of the Company s common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $63,400.   
        
  The 2016 Purchase Agreement provided that the Investor is obligated to purchase up to 405,000,000 shares of the Company s common stock in multiple closings, with the Investor having purchased 105,000,000 shares at an aggregate purchase price of $8,400 (or $0.08 per share) at the initial closing on March 10, 2016. The 2016 Purchase Agreement provided that the Investor will purchase the remaining 200,000,000 shares at $0.15 per share and 100,000,000 shares at $0.25 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $55,000 after the satisfaction of certain conditions, including Company shareholder approval of an amendment to the Company s Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation increasing the Company s authorized number of shares of common stock from 700,000,000 to 1,100,000,000 (the  Charter Amendment ).   
           
  In addition to the shares issuable under the 2016 Purchase Agreement, the Company also issued to the Investor a warrant to acquire 10,066,809 shares of common stock of the Company at an exercise price of $0.07 per share. The warrant vests in increments on each closing date under the 2016 Purchase Agreement for a number of warrant shares that is proportionate to the amount of shares purchased under the 2016 Purchase Agreement on such closing date (with 2,609,913 warrant shares having initially vested on March 10, 2016 and the remaining 7,456,896 warrant shares vesting on October 26, 2016). The warrant will expire on the 10th anniversary of its issuance date.  
     
  The 2016 Purchase Agreement also provided that the Investor would have the right to designate one individual to serve on the Company s Board of Directors. Once the Investor purchases the remaining 300,000,000 shares of common stock under the 2016 Purchase Agreement, the Investor would thereafter have the right to designate an additional two individuals to serve on the Company s Board of Directors (such that the Investor would have designation rights with respect to three of the seven members of the Company s Board of Directors, with one such member serving as Chairman). The 2016 Purchase Agreement also provided that, with certain limited exceptions, if the Company issues any shares of common stock at any time through the 5th anniversary of the Purchase Agreement, the Investor will have a preemptive right to subscribe for and to purchase at the same price per share (or at market price, in the case of issuance of shares pursuant to stock options) the number of shares necessary to maintain its ownership percentage of Company-issued shares of common stock.  
     
  On May 19, 2016, the Company s shareholders approved the Charter Amendment, thereby obligating the Investor to purchase the remaining 300,000,000 shares of the Company s common stock for the aggregate purchase price of $55,000.

   Visser Precision Cast, LLC License Agreement      
     
  On June 1, 2012, the Company entered into a Master Transaction Agreement (the  Visser MTA ) with Visser Precision Cast, LLC ( Visser ) relating to a strategic transaction for manufacturing services and financing. On May 20, 2014, the Company and Visser entered into a settlement agreement significantly amending the Visser MTA, whereby the Company granted to Visser a fully paid-up, royalty-free, irrevocable, perpetual, worldwide, non-transferable, nonexclusive sublicense to all of the Company s intellectual property developed on or prior to May 20, 2014 (the  Effective Date ). Visser does not have any rights, now or in the future, to intellectual property of the Company developed after the Effective Date. The license to the Company s intellectual property developed on or prior to the Effective Date does not include the right to use the  Liquidmetal  trademark or any of the Company s other trademarks, except in certain defined situations, as set forth in the amended and restated agreement.  
     
  With the foregoing revised arrangements, the Company is no longer required to use Visser as its exclusive manufacturer and is free to license other manufacturers on a non-exclusive basis in any industry or geographic market as to which the Company has not previously granted an exclusive license to a third party. Additionally, the settlement amended and restated the two warrants the Company issued to Visser in June 2012 to purchase 15,000,000 shares of the Company s common stock at an exercise price of $0.22 per share. The amended and restated warrant agreement includes the effect of anti-dilution adjustments and is exercisable for 18,611,079 shares of common stock (increased further to 21,126,522 shares under the anti-dilution provisions of the warrants, see Note 11) at an exercise price of $0.17 per share (further reduced to $0.16 per share under the anti-dilution provisions of the warrants, see Note 11).   
         
   Other License Transactions   
     
  On January 31, 2012, the Company entered into a Supply and License Agreement for a five year term with Engel Austria Gmbh ( Engel ) whereby Engel was granted a non-exclusive license to manufacture and sell injection molding machines to the Company s licensees. Since that time, the Company and Engel have agreed on an injection molding machine configuration that can be commercially supplied and supported by Engel.  On December 6, 2013, the companies entered into an Exclusivity Agreement for a 10 year term whereby the Company agreed, with certain exceptions and limitations, that the Company and its licensees would purchase amorphous alloy injection molding machines exclusively from Engel, and this exclusivity right was granted in exchange for certain royalties to be paid by Engel to the Company based on a percentage of the net sales price of such injection molding machines.   
     
  The Company s Liquidmetal Golf subsidiary has the exclusive right and license to utilize the Company s Liquidmetal alloy technology for purposes of golf equipment applications. This right and license is set forth in an intercompany license agreement between Liquidmetal Technologies and Liquidmetal Golf. This license agreement provides that Liquidmetal Golf has a perpetual and exclusive license to use Liquidmetal alloy technology for the purpose of manufacturing, marketing, and selling golf club components and other products used in the sport of golf. The Company owns 79% of the outstanding common stock of Liquidmetal Golf.  
     
  In June 2003, the Company entered into an exclusive license agreement with LLPG, Inc. ( LLPG ).  Under the terms of the agreement, LLPG has the exclusive right to commercialize Liquidmetal alloys, particularly precious-metal based compositions, in jewelry and high-end luxury product markets.  The Company, in turn, will receive royalty payments over the life of the contract on all Liquidmetal products produced and sold by LLPG. The exclusive license agreement with LLPG expires on December 31, 2021.   
     
  In March 2009, the Company entered into a license agreement with Swatch Group, Ltd. ( Swatch ) under which Swatch was granted a non-exclusive license to the Company s technology to produce and market watches and certain other luxury products. In March 2011, this license agreement was amended to grant Swatch exclusive rights as to watches and all third parties (including the Company), but non-exclusive as to Apple, and the Company s license agreement with LLPG was simultaneously amended to exclude watches from LLPG s rights. The Company will receive royalty payments over the life of the contract on all Liquidmetal products produced and sold by Swatch. The license agreement with Swatch will expire on the expiration date of the last licensed patent.  

4    . Liquidity   and   Capital Resources      
     
  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company s cash used in operations was $5,962, cash flows from investing activities were $1,876, primarily due to reductions in restricted cash as a result of collateral requirement reductions, and cash provided by financing activities was $7,715 due to cash received from equity sales under the 2016 Purchase Agreement and the exercise of stock options. As of September 30, 2016, the Company s cash and restricted cash balance was $6,407, which consisted of $6,402 of cash and $5 of short-term restricted cash.  
     
  On March 10, 2016, the Company entered into the 2016 Purchase Agreement providing for the purchase by the Investor of up to 405,000,000 shares of the Company s common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $63,400.   
        
  The 2016 Purchase Agreement provides that the Investor is obligated to purchase up to 405,000,000 shares of the Company s common stock in multiple closings, with the Investor having purchased 105,000,000 shares at an aggregate purchase price of $8,400 (or $0.08 per share) at the initial closing on March 10, 2016, with the remaining 200,000,000 shares at $0.15 per share and 100,000,000 shares at $0.25 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $55,000 closing on October 26, 2016 (see Note 3).  
     
  The Company has a relatively limited history of producing bulk amorphous alloy products and components on a mass-production scale. Furthermore, the ability of future contract manufacturers to produce the Company s products in desired quantities and at commercially reasonable prices is uncertain and is dependent on a variety of factors that are outside of the Company s control, including the nature and design of the component, the customer s specifications, and required delivery timelines. These factors have required that the Company engage in equity sales under various stock purchase agreements to support its operations and strategic initiatives. Uncertainty as to the outcome of these factors has previously raised substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. Following the closing of the remaining funding under the 2016 Purchase Agreement, the Company anticipates that its current capital resources, when considering expected losses from operations, will be sufficient to fund the Company s operations for the foreseeable future.

The services provided by the investment banking firm did not result in the identification of any practicable investment transactions and the agreement was considered effectively terminated by the Company during 2013, although no formal notice of termination was ever provided by either party. During the three-months ended September 30, 2016, the Company was contacted and advised by a representative of the investment banking firm that the firm did not consider the engagement agreement to be terminated and that amounts raised under the 2013, 2014, and 2016 Purchase Agreements may be subject to success fees stipulated under their investment banking agreement. The firm advised the Company that such success fees would, based on the language of the engagement agreement, be equal to the greater of (i) 5% of the total proceeds received as a result of equity transactions or (ii) $500. To date no formal claims have been filed against the Company. Subsequent to September 30, 2016, the Company reached a settlement with respect to any and all amounts allegedly due under the engagement agreement in the amount of $750. As a result of the settlement, the engagement agreement is deemed to be terminated in all respects as of the settlement date of November 8, 2016. Such amounts have been reflected as an accrued liability as of September 30, 2016 and reflected as stock issuance costs as a reduction to additional paid in capital.

  This credit facility required the Company to maintain collateral for the full amount of the facility. Following maturity of the facility all collateral requirements have been removed.

11  . Warrant   Liabilities   
       
  Pursuant to FASB ASC 815, the Company is required to report the value of certain warrants as a liability at fair value and record the changes in the fair value of the warrant liabilities as a gain or loss in its consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss due to the price-based anti-dilution rights of the warrants.   
     
  During June 2012, the Company issued warrants to purchase a total of 15,000,000 shares of common stock to Visser under the Visser MTA Agreement (see Note 3). These warrants had an original exercise price of $0.22 per share, expire on June 1, 2017 and were originally valued at $4,260. These warrants have certain anti-dilution and exercise price reset provisions which qualify the warrants to be classified as a liability under FASB ASC 815. As a result of subsequent issuances of the Company s common stock, which resulted in anti-dilutive price resets, the exercise price of these warrants was reduced to $0.16 and $0.17 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. In addition, the number of shares to be issued under the warrants as a result of the anti-dilution provision increased to 21,126,522 and 18,937,931 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. As of September 30, 2016, these warrants were valued at $691 under the Black-Scholes valuation model utilizing the following assumptions: (i) expected life of 0.67 years, (ii) volatility of 72%, (iii) risk-free interest rate of 0.6%, and (iv) dividend rate of 0. The change in fair value for these warrants was a (gain) loss of $(292) and $657 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively.   
     
  On July 2, 2012, the Company issued warrants to purchase a total of 18,750,000 shares of common stock in a private placement (the  July 2012 Private Placement ). These warrants have an exercise price of $0.384 per share, expire on July 2, 2017, and were originally valued at $5,053. These warrants have certain anti-dilution and exercise price reset provisions which qualify the warrants to be classified as a liability under FASB ASC 815. As a result of contractually defined price resets, and issuances under the 2014 and 2016 Purchase Agreements, which resulted in an anti-dilution impact, the exercise price of these warrants was reduced to $0.17 and $0.19 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. As of September 30, 2016 there were warrants to purchase a total of 17,572,000 shares of common stock outstanding, which were valued at $564 under the Black-Scholes valuation model utilizing the following assumptions: (i) expected life of 0.75 years, (ii) volatility of 76%, (iii) risk-free interest rate of 0.6%, and (iv) dividend rate of 0. The change in fair value for these warrants was a (gain) loss of $(172) and $539 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively.  
     
  On March 10, 2016, the Company issued warrants to purchase a total of 10,066,809 shares of common stock as part of the 2016 Purchase Agreement. These warrants have an exercise price of $0.07 per share, expire on March 10, 2026, and were originally valued at $760. These warrants have certain anti-dilution and exercise price reset provisions which qualify the warrants to be classified as a liability under FASB ASC 815. As of September 30, 2016, these warrants were valued at $1,449 under the Black-Scholes valuation model utilizing the following assumptions: (i) expected life of 9.44 years, (ii) volatility of 120%, (iii) risk-free interest rate of 1.60%, and (iv) dividend rate of 0. The change in fair value for these warrants was a (gain) loss of $(99) and $689 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively.  
     
  The following table summarizes the change in the Company s warrant liabilities as of September 30, 2016:

12  .     Option Liabilities   
       
  As part of the 2016 Purchase Agreement, executed on March 10, 2016, the Company granted the Investor the right to purchase shares of the Company s common stock in the future at predetermined prices. These options allow the investor to purchase 200,000,000 shares of the Company s common stock at a price of $0.15 per share and 100,000,000 shares of the Company s common stock at a price of $0.25 per share. Given that the number of shares to be issued upon exercise of these options was in excess of the number of shares authorized for issuance, these options were originally required to be classified as liabilities under FASB ASC 815. The 200,000,000 share option and the 100,000,000 share option were initially valued at $489 and $22, respectively. Following the filing of the Charter Amendment, which allowed for adequate authorized shares, these options were revalued as of May 19, 2016 and reclassified to permanent shareholders  equity. As of May 19, 2016, these written call options were valued at $2,931 and $193, respectively, under the Black-Scholes valuation model utilizing the following assumptions: (i) expected life of 0.25 years, (ii) volatility of 85%, (iii) risk-free interest rate of 0.31%, and (iv) dividend rate of 0. The change in fair value for these options was a loss of $2,442 and $171, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  
     
  The following table summarizes the change in the Company s option liabilities as of September 30, 2016:  

On August 11, 2016, the Company and the Investor entered into an amendment to the 2016 Purchase Agreement. Under the amendment, the Company agreed to extend the deadline for the Investor s purchase of 300,000,000 additional shares of Company common stock under the 2016 Purchase Agreement from the original deadline of August 17, 2016 to a new deadline of December 31, 2016. Other than the extension of the deadline, the amendment does not materially modify the terms of the 2016 Purchase Agreement. As a result of this amendment the Company recorded an additional $2,126 of expense to additional paid in capital. Such amounts are reflected as a loss on contract modification within the consolidated statements of operations.  

13.   Other Long-  T  erm Liabilities       
       
  Other long-term liabilities were $856 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, and consisted of long  -term, aged payables to vendors, individuals, and other third parties that have been outstanding for more than 5 years.

1  6  .   Loss   Per Common Share   
       
  Basic earnings per share ( EPS ) is computed by dividing earnings (loss) attributable to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the periods. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution of securities that could share in the earnings.

Overview   
     
  We are a materials technology company that develops and commercializes products made from amorphous alloys. Our Liquidmetal  family of alloys consists of a variety of proprietary bulk alloys and composites that utilize the advantages offered by amorphous alloy technology. We design, develop and sell custom products and components from bulk amorphous alloys to customers in various industries. We also partner with third-party manufacturers and licensees to develop and commercialize Liquidmetal alloy products.   
     
  Amorphous alloys are, in general, unique materials that are distinguished by their ability to retain a random atomic structure when they solidify, in contrast to the crystalline atomic structure that forms in other metals and alloys when they solidify. Liquidmetal alloys are proprietary amorphous alloys that possess a combination of performance, processing, and potential cost advantages that we believe will make them preferable to other materials in a variety of applications. The amorphous atomic structure of bulk alloys enables them to overcome certain performance limitations caused by inherent weaknesses in crystalline atomic structures, thus facilitating performance and processing characteristics superior in many ways to those of their crystalline counterparts. Our alloys and the injection molding technology we employ result in components that exhibit: exceptional dimensional control and repeatability that rivals precision machining, excellent corrosion resistance, brilliant surface finish, high strength, high hardness, high elastic limit, alloys that are non-magnetic, and the ability to form complex shapes common to the injection molding of plastics. Interestingly, all of these characteristics are achievable from the molding process, so design engineers do not have to select specific alloys to achieve one or more of the characteristics as is the case with crystalline materials. We believe these advantages could result in Liquidmetal alloys supplanting high-performance alloys, such as titanium and stainless steel, and other incumbent materials in a wide variety of applications. Moreover, we believe these advantages could enable the introduction of entirely new products and applications that are not possible or commercially viable with other materials.  
     
  Our revenues are derived from i) selling our bulk amorphous alloy custom products and components for applications which include, but are not limited to, non-consumer electronic devices, medical products, automotive components, and sports and leisure goods; ii) selling tooling and prototype parts such as demonstration parts and test samples for customers with products in development; iii) product licensing and royalty revenue; and iv) research and development revenue. We expect that these sources of revenue will continue to significantly change the character of our revenue mix.  
     
  Our cost of sales consists primarily of the costs of manufacturing, which include raw alloy and internal labor required to operate our on-site production cell. Selling, general, and administrative expenses currently consist primarily of salaries and related benefits, travel, consulting and professional fees, depreciation and amortization, insurance, office and administrative expenses, and other expenses related to our operations.  
     
  Research and development expenses represent salaries, related benefits expenses, depreciation of research equipment, consulting and contract services, expenses incurred for the design and testing of new processing methods, expenses for the development of sample and prototype products, and other expenses related to the research and development of Liquidmetal bulk alloys. Costs associated with research and development activities are expensed as incurred. We plan to enhance our competitive position by improving our existing technologies and developing advances in amorphous alloy technologies. We believe that our research and development efforts will focus on the discovery of new alloy compositions, the development of improved processing technology, and the identification of new applications for our alloys.

   Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates    
       
  The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.  
     
  We believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to our consolidated financial statements since these policies require significant judgment or involve complex estimates that are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results:  

Revenue recognition               

Impairment of long-lived assets and definite-lived intangibles               

Deferred tax assets               

Valuation of liability classified warrants and options and embedded derivatives               

Share based compensation               
   
  Our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 (the  2015 Annual Report ) contains further discussions on our critical accounting policies and estimates.

Results of Operations     
     
   Comparison of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   

In discussing our results of our operations, we have categorized the specific items of our   consolidated   statements of operations into various categories to facilitate the understanding of our core business operations. Explanations of each category as well as analyses of specific items contained in that category are discussed below:   
     
    Operating revenue and expenses    
       
  The  Operating revenue and expenses  category of statements of operations items represent those items that pertain to our core operations in the bulk alloy manufacturing and licensing business as follows:  
       
   Revenue . Total revenue increased to $154 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $42 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Total revenue increased to $356 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $107 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase for both periods was attributable to a higher mix of small scale pre-production orders during 2016 as a result of our continued build out of our on-site manufacturing capabilities.     
     
   Cost of   sales . Cost of sales was $165, or 107% of products revenue, for the three months ended September 30, 2016, an increase from $160, or 381% of products revenue, for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Cost of sales was $336, or 102% of products revenue, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, an increase from $312, or 390% of products revenue, for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.The decrease in our cost of sales as a percentage of product revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily attributable to higher costs of production during the 2015 periods as a result of the initial on-set of manufacturing efforts and the scaling of internal processes. The cost to manufacture products and components from our bulk amorphous alloys is variable and differs based on the unique design of each product. Given the continued development and refinement of our manufacturing efforts during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, our cost of sales as a percentage of products revenue is not necessarily representative of our future cost percentages and is expected to show continued improvement over time with increases in volume and continuous refinements to our internal processes. When we begin increasing our products revenues with shipments of routine, commercial products and components through our manufacturing facility and/or third party contract manufacturers, we expect our cost of sales percentages to decrease, stabilize and be more predictable.     

22

Gross   profit (loss) . Our gross profit increased to $(11) from $(118) for the three month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our gross profit, as a percentage of products revenue, increased to (7)% from (281)% for the three month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our gross profit increased to $20 from $(205) for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our gross profit, as a percentage of products revenue, increased to 6% from (256)% for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As discussed above under  Cost of sales , early pre-production orders are resulting in a higher cost mix, relative to revenue, than would otherwise be incurred in an on-site production environment, with higher volumes and more established operating processes, or through contract manufacturers. As such, our gross profit percentages have fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate based on volume and quoted production prices per unit and may not be representative of our future business. When we begin increasing our products revenues with shipments of routine, commercial products and components through future orders to our manufacturing facility and/or third party contract manufacturers, we expect our gross profit percentages to stabilize, increase and be more predictable.  
     
   Selling,   m  arketing,   g  eneral and   a  dministrative . Selling, marketing, general and administrative expenses were $1,679 and $5,461 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, compared to $1,763 and $5,506 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. The decrease in expense for both periods was due to lower costs associated with employee compensation, inclusive of stock based compensation.   
     
   Research and   d  evelopment . Research and development expenses increased to $548 and $1,730 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, from $491 and $1,428 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. The increase in expense was mainly due to additional research projects and additional personnel hired to support our material and process development efforts. We continue to (i) perform research and development of new Liquidmetal alloys and related processing capabilities, (ii) develop new manufacturing techniques, and (iii) contract with consultants to advance the development of Liquidmetal alloys and related production processes.       
     
   Operating loss . Operating loss was $2,238 and $7,171 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. This compares to $2,372 and $7,139 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. Fluctuations in our operating loss are primarily attributable to variations in operating expenses, as discussed above.   
     
  We continue to invest in our technology infrastructure to expedite the adoption of our technology, but we have experienced long sales lead times for customer adoption of our technology. Until that time where we can either (i) increase our revenues with shipments of routine, commercial products and components through a combination of our manufacturing center or third party contract manufacturers or (ii) obtain significant licensing revenues, we expect to continue to have operating losses for the foreseeable future.  
   
    Non-operational expenses    
       
  Our statement of operations contains various, significant items that are non-operational in nature. These categories of expenses may have significant gains and losses based on the volatility of our stock price as follows:  
       
   Change in   v  alue of   w  arrant   liabilities . The change in value of warrant liabilities was a non-cash gain (loss) of $563 and $(1,885) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. This compares to a non-cash gain of $1,138 and $1,326 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. These adjustments result from periodic valuation adjustments related to fluctuations in our stock price, and other inputs, for warrants issued in connection with the Visser MTA, the July 2012 Private Placement, and the 2016 Purchase Agreement. Changes in the value of our warrants are non-cash and do not affect the core operations of our business or liquidity.  
     
   Change in   v  alue of   option liabilities.  The change in value of option liabilities was a non-cash loss of $0 and $2,613 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. This compares to $0 for the corresponding three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2015. These adjustments result from periodic valuation adjustments related to fluctuations in our stock price, and other inputs, for written call options issued in connection with the 2016 Purchase Agreement. Changes in the value of option liabilities are non-cash and do not affect the core operations of our business or liquidity.   
     
   Loss on contract modification.  As a result of the amendment to the 2016 Purchase Agreement, we incurred an additional $2,126 of expense relating to the extension of the exercise term for the written call options under the 2016 Purchase Agreement. Such expense was recorded directly to additional paid in capital.  
     
   Interest expense.  Interest expense relates to interest incurred under our line of credit agreement. Such amounts were $1 and $9 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. This compares to $1 and $1 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively.  
     
   Interest   i  ncome.  Interest income relates to interest earned from our cash deposits for the respective periods. Such amounts were $0 and $0 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. This compares to $5 and $19 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively.  

23

Liquidity and Capital Resources    
     
   Cash used in operating activities   
     
  Cash used in operating activities totaled $6.0 million and $5.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The cash was primarily used to fund operating expenses related to our business and product development efforts.  

Cash   provided by (used in)   investing activities   
     
  Cash provided by (used in) investing activities totaled $1.9 million and $(2.7) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Investing outflows primarily consist of capital expenditures to support our manufacturing efforts. Also included in investing cash flows are changes in restricted cash to support line of credit collateral requirements of which $2.0 million was recorded as an in-flow during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and $2.0 million was recorded as an outflow during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  
     
   Cash provided by financing activities   
     
  Cash provided by financing activities totaled $7.7 million and $2.3 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Cash provided by financing activities is comprised of cash received for the issuance of shares under the 2016 Purchase Agreement during 2016 and equity sales under the 2014 Purchase Agreement during 2015. Also included were funds received under our line of credit facility and subsequent paydowns of the same facility.  
     
   Financing arrangements and outlook   
     
  On March 10, 2016, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the  2016 Purchase Agreement ) with Liquidmetal Technology Limited, a Hong Kong company (the  Investor ), providing for the purchase by the Investor of up to 405,000,000 shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $63.4 million.   

The 2016 Purchase Agreement provides that the Investor is obligated to purchase up to 405,000,000 shares of our common stock in multiple closings, with the Investor having purchased 105,000,000 shares at an aggregate purchase price of $8.4 million (or $0.08 per share) at the initial closing on March 10, 2016, with the remaining 200,000,000 shares at $0.15 per share and 100,000,000 shares at $0.25 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $55.0 million closing on October 26, 2016. As a result of these purchases, the Investor has completed its entire investment contemplated by the 2016 Purchase Agreement.  
     
  We have a relatively limited history of producing bulk amorphous alloy products and components on a mass-production scale. Furthermore, the ability of future contract manufacturers to produce our products in desired quantities and at commercially reasonable prices is uncertain and is dependent on a variety of factors that are outside of our control, including the nature and design of the component, the customer s specifications, and required delivery timelines. These factors have required that we engage in equity sales under various stock purchase agreements to support our operations and strategic initiatives. Uncertainty as to the outcome of these factors has previously raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Following the closing of the remaining funding under the 2016 Purchase Agreement, we anticipate that our current capital resources, when considering expected losses from operations, will be sufficient to fund our operations for the foreseeable future.  

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements    
     
  As of September 30, 2016, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.  

Item 3   Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk   
     
  None.  
       
   Item 4   Controls and Procedures   
     
   Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures .

Based on their evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of September 30, 2016.

Changes in Internal Control   over Financial Reporting    .
