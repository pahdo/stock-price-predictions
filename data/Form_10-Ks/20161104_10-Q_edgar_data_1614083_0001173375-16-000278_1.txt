  (A Blank Check Company)  
  Notes to Financial Statements  
  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 (Unaudited)  
   
  NOTE 1.   
  NATURE OF BUSINESS  
   
  Organization  
   
 Stem Sales, Inc.  STEM  was formed on April 9, 2014 under the Laws of the State of Florida and is a blank check company formed for the purpose of entering into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination. Our efforts to identify a target business will not be limited to a particular industry or geographic region.  We have contacted several prospective target businesses and professionals who may have knowledge of prospective target businesses however, at this writing no specific business combination is under detailed negotiations for consideration. 
   
  NOTE 2.   
  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  
   
  Basis of Presentation and Use of Estimates  
   
 The Company prepares its financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( GAAP ). These principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Management believes that these estimates are reasonable and have been discussed with the Board of Directors; however, actual results could differ from those estimates. 
   
  Going Concern  
   
 The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities that we have incurred significant costs in pursuit of our acquisition plans. These factors raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time. The Company may not be able to identify a target business for a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination, thus no assurance can be given that the Company will be successful in these efforts. 
   
  Cash and Cash Equivalents  
   
 All cash is maintained with a major financial institution in the United States. Deposits with this bank may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits. Generally, these deposits may be redeemed on demand and, therefore, bear minimal risk. The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the date of acquisition to be cash equivalents. There were no cash equivalents at September 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015. 
   
  Loss Per Share  
   
 The Company has adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification ( FASB ASC ) 260-10-50, Earnings Per Share, which provides for the calculation of  basic  and  diluted  earnings per share. Basic earnings per share includes no dilution and is computed by dividing net income or loss available to common shareholders by the weighted average common shares outstanding for the period.  Diluted earnings per share reflect the potential dilution of securities that could share in the earnings of an entity.  Basic and diluted losses per share were the same at the reporting dates as there were no common stock equivalents outstanding at September 30, 2016 or September 30, 2015. 
   
  Income Taxes  
   
 Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Additionally, the recognition of future tax benefits, such as net operating loss carryforwards, is required to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the assets and liabilities are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income tax expense in the period that includes the enactment date.

    Quick Link to Table of Contents     
   QuickLink to Financial Statements     

In the event the future tax consequences of differences between the financial reporting bases and the tax bases of the Company's assets and liabilities result in deferred tax assets, an evaluation of the probability of being able to realize the future benefits indicated by such asset is required. A valuation allowance is provided for the portion of the deferred tax asset when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In assessing the realizability of the deferred tax assets, management considers the scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies.   
   
 The Company files income tax returns in the United States and Florida, which are subject to examination by the tax authorities in these jurisdictions. Generally, the statute of limitations related to the Company's federal and state income tax return is three years. The state impact of any federal changes for prior years remains subject to examination for a period up to five years after formal notification to the states. 
   
 The open tax years for federal Net Operating Loss carry forward purposes are 2014 and 2015. As of September 30, 2016 the aggregate Net Operating Loss carry forward of $44,355 is available to offset income for twenty (20) years and begins to expire in 2034.   
   
 Management has evaluated tax positions in accordance with FASB ASC 740, Income Taxes, and has not identified any significant tax positions, other than those disclosed. 
   
  Reclassifications  
   
 Certain reclassifications have been made to the prior year balances in order to conform to the current year presentation. 
   
  Recently Accounting Pronouncements  
   
 The Company reviews new accounting standards as issued. No new standards had any material effect on these financial statements.  The accounting pronouncements issued subsequent to the date of these financial statements that were considered significant by management were evaluated for the potential effect on these financial statements. Management does not believe any of the subsequent pronouncements will have a material effect on these financial statements as presented and does not anticipate the need for any future restatement of these financial statements because of the retro-active application of any accounting pronouncements issued subsequent to September 30, 2016 through the date these financial statements were issued. 
   
  NOTE 3.   
  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES  
   
  Related Party  
   
 The controlling shareholders have pledged support to fund continuing operations, as necessary. From time to time, the Company is dependent upon the continued support of these parties, through temporary advances or through arrangements of their personal credit.  Robert M. Snibbe, Jr. advanced $2,000 on February 29, 2016, $2,500 on May 6, 2016, and $2,500 on August 10, 2016.  These and future advances are to be documented in that certain Promissory Note For Advances dated May 6, 2016 with quarterly schedule revisions and maturing at the earlier of January 31, 2018 or any change in equity ownership of the Company.  Accrued simple interest at 3% on the note amounted to $65 at September 30, 2016.  There were no balances due to related parties at December 31, 2015. 
   
 The amounts and terms of the above transactions may not necessarily be indicative of the amounts and terms that would have been incurred had comparable transactions been entered into with independent third parties. The Company does not have employment contracts with its key employees, including the Officers of the Company. 
   
  Leases and Facility  
   
 The Company rents its office facilities on a month to month basis pursuant to a lease dated September 2, 2015, commencing October 1, 2015. The Company rents the space for $268, monthly. 
   
  Legal Matters  
   
 From time to time the Company may become a party to litigation matters involving claims against the Company. Management believes that there are no current matters that would have a material effect on the Company s financial position or results of operations.

There is one class of preferred stock authorized to be defined and issued solely at the discretion of the Board of Directors.  
     
  No preferred or common stock was issued subsequent to the period ended September 30, 2016.  
   
  The Company has no options or warrants issued or outstanding.  
   
   NOTE 5.   
   SUBSEQUENT EVENTS

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  
   
  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our      financial statements          and the notes thereto.   
   
   Forward-Looking Statements    
   
 We were formed on April 9, 2014 for the purpose of entering into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, or other similar business combination with one or more target businesses. Our efforts to identify a target business will not be limited to a particular industry or geographic region.  We intend to utilize cash derived from the proceeds of this offering and the private placement of our securities, debt or a combination of cash, securities and debt, in effecting our initial business combination.  
   
 The issuance of additional shares of common stock or preferred stock in our initial business combination: 

may significantly dilute the equity interest of our investors in this offering who would not have pre-emption rights in respect of any such issuance; 
   
 may subordinate the rights of holders of shares of common stock if we issue shares of preferred stock with rights senior to those afforded to our shares of common stock; 
   
 will likely cause a change in control if a substantial number of our shares of common stock are issued, which may affect, among other things, our ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards, if any, and most likely will also result in the resignation or removal of our present officers and directors; and 
   
 may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our securities. 
   
 Similarly, if we issue debt securities, it could result in: 

default and foreclosure on our assets if our operating revenues after our initial business combination are insufficient to pay our debt obligations; 
   
 acceleration of our obligations to repay the indebtedness even if we have made all principal and interest payments when due if the debt security contains covenants that required the maintenance of certain financial ratios or reserves and we breach any such covenant without a waiver or renegotiation of that covenant; 
   
 our immediate payment of all principal and accrued interest, if any, if the debt security is payable on demand; and; 
   
 our inability to obtain additional financing, if necessary, if the debt security contains covenants restricting our ability to obtain additional financing while such security is outstanding. 
 We have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenues to date. Our entire activity since inception has been to prepare for our proposed fundraising through an offering of our equity securities. 
  Introduction  
 We are a Florida blank check Company incorporated on April 9, 2014 formed for the purpose of entering into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more target businesses. Our efforts to identify a prospective target business will not be limited to a particular industry or geographic region.   
  Business Strategy  
 We have identified the following criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses. While these will be used in evaluating business combination opportunities, we may decide to enter into a business combination with a target business or businesses that do not meet all of the proposed criteria and guidelines. 
   
 Target profile characteristics include: 
   
    Privately-held  
    Target seeking to become public  
    Limited capital expenditure requirements  
    Strong organic and M A driven growth potential  
    Interest in retaining equity to build and grow the company

All of the expenses were planned. 
   
  Financing Activities  
   
 The controlling shareholders have pledged support to fund continuing operations, as necessary. From time to time, the Company is dependent upon the continued support of these parties, through temporary advances or through arrangements of their personal credit.  Robert M. Snibbe, Jr. advanced $2,000 on February 29, 2016, $2,500 on May 6, 2016, and $2,500 on August 10, 2016.  These and future advances are to be documented in that certain Promissory Note For Advances dated May 6, 2016 with quarterly schedule revisions and maturing at the earlier of January 31, 2018 or any change in equity ownership of the Company.  Accrued simple interest at 3% on the note amounted to $65 at September 30, 2016. 
   
  Liquidity and Capital Resources  
   
  General.  At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents of $2,466 and $5,377, respectively. Our operating activities used cash of $9,911 and $23,037 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively.  We met our cash needs through the capital that was raised from the purchase of our stock by our initial shareholders and advances from one of our shareholders as discussed in  Financing Activities , immediately above. Our cash requirements are generally for professional services and general and administrative activities. We believe that our cash balance is not sufficient to finance our  

11 
   
    Quick Link to Table of Contents     
   QuickLink to Financial Statements     

cash requirements for expected operational activities through the next 12 months.  In the event the company needs additional capital it will look to its initial shareholders for capital or it will try to sell shares registered in the offering. 
   
 We had no investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015. 
   
 As of September 30, 2016, Current Assets exceeded Current Liabilities by $2,466.
