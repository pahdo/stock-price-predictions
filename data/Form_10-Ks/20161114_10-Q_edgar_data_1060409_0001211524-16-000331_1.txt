Until     recently,     SunVesta     AG     held     five     wholly-owned     subsidiaries:   SunVesta     Projects     and     Management     AG,     a     Swiss     company;     Rich     Land     Investments   Limitada,    a    Costa    Rican    company    ( Rich    Land     SunVesta    Costa    Rica    Limitada,    a    Costa   Rican  company    ( SVCR ),  Altos  del  Risco  SA,  a  Costa  Rican  company    ( AdR )  and   SunVesta Holding Espa a SL ( Espa a ), a Spanish   company.   Effective    May    21,    2016,    the    three    Costa    Rican    companies    have    been    merged,    whereby   Altos    del    Risco    SA    absorbed    its    two    affiliated    companies    and    subsequently    changed    its   name to SunVesta Costa Rica SA.   In    January    2005,    the    Company    changed    its    business    focus    to    the    development    of    holiday   resorts    and    investments in the hospitality and related industry. The Company has one major   project in Costa Rica.    Planning    for    this    project    has    been    fully    completed,    all    consents    have   been    granted,    and    excavation    work    began    in    March    2013.    The    Company    is    still    in    process   of  securing  financing  for  the  project  and  has  not  realized  revenue  to  date.  Since  the   financing of    the    project    is not    complete,    the    Company s    activities    are    subject    to significant   risks and   uncertainties.   These consolidated   financial statements are prepared   in   US Dollars on the basis of   generally   accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( US   GAAP ).   The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial    statements have been prepared   by    management    in    accordance    with    the    instructions    in    Form    10-Q    and,    therefore,    do    not   include    all    information    and    footnotes    required    by    generally    accepted    accounting    principles   and    should, therefore,    be    read    in    conjunction    with    the    Company s    Form    10-K,    for    the    year   ended    December    31,    2015,    filed    with    the    Securities    and    Exchange    Commission.    These   statements     do     include     all     normal     recurring     adjustments     which     the     Company     believes   necessary    for    a    fair    presentation    of    the    statements.    The    interim   results of operations are not   necessarily    indicative    of    the    results    to    be    expected    for    the    full    year    ended    December    31,   2016.   Except    as    indicated    in    the    notes    below,    there    have    been    no    other    material    changes    in    the   information    disclosed    in    the    notes    to    the    financial    statements    included    in    the    Company s   Form    10-K    for    the    year    ended    December    31,    2015,    filed    with    the    Securities    and    Exchange   Commission.   8          SUNVESTA, INC.    NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     September 30, 2016       2.     SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING       POLICIES     New accounting standard updates   not adopted yet    In    February    2016,    the    Financial    Accounting    Standards    Board    (FASB)    issued    Accounting   Standards    Update    2016-02,       Leases        (Topic        842).     The    standard    requires    the    recognition    of   lease    assets    and    lease    liabilities    by    lessees    for    those    leases    classified    as    operating    leases.   Leases    will    be    classified    as    either    finance    or    operating,    with    classification    affecting    the   pattern    of    expense    recognition.    The    standard    requires    lessors    to    classify    leases    as    either   sales-type,    finance    or    operating.    A    sales-type    lease    occurs    if    the    lessor    transfers    all    of    the   risks    and    rewards,    as    well    as    control    of    the    underlying    asset,    to    the    lessee.    If    risks    and   rewards    are    conveyed    without    the    transfer    of    control,    the    lease    is    treated    as    a    financing   lease. If the lessor does not convey risks and rewards or control, an operating lease results.   The    standard    will  become    effective    for    the    Company    beginning    January    1,    2019.    The   Company  is  currently    assessing    the  impact  adoption  of  this  standard  will  have  on  its   consolidated    results    of    operations,    financial    condition, cash    flows,    and    financial    statement   disclosures.   In    August    2014,    the    Financial    Accounting    Standards    Board    (FASB)    issued    Accounting   Standards    Updates    (ASU)    2014-15    requiring    an    entity s    management    to    evaluate    whether   there    are    conditions    or    events,    considered    in    aggregate,    that    raise    substantial    doubt    about   entity s    ability    to    continue    as    a    going  concern  within  one  year  after  the  date    that  the   financial     statements     are  issued  (or     within     one     year     after     the     date     that     the     financial   statements    are    available    to    be    issued    when    applicable).    The    amendments    to    (ASU)    2014-   15    are    effective    for    the    annual    period    ending    after    December    15,    2016,    and    for    annual   periods    and    interim    periods    thereafter.    Early    application    is    permitted.    The    Company    is    in   the    process    of    evaluating    the    prospective    impact    that    (ASU)    2014-15    will    have    on    its   balance   sheet.    New accounting standard updates - adopted    In  April  2015,  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  (FASB)  issued  Accounting   Standards    Updates    (ASU)    2015-03    which    requires    that    debt    issuance    costs    be    reported    in   the  balance  sheet  as  a  direct  deduction  from  the  face  amount  of  the  related  liability,   consistent    with    the    presentation    of    debt    discounts.    Prior    to    the    amendments,    debt    issuance   costs    were    presented    as    a    deferred    charge    (i.e.,    an    asset)    on    the    balance    sheet.    The    ASU   provides    examples    illustrating    the    balance    sheet    presentation    of    notes    net    of    their    related   discounts    and    debt    issuance    costs.    Further,    the    amendments    require    the    amortization    of   debt    issuance    costs    to    be    reported    as    interest    expense.    Similarly,    debt    issuance    costs    and   any    discount    or    premium    is    considered    in    the    aggregate    when    determining    the    effective   interest    rate    on    the    debt.    The    amendments    are    effective    for    public    business    entities    for   fiscal    years    beginning    after    December    15,    2015,    and    interim    periods    within    those    fiscal   years. The application of this ASU resulted in the reclassification of debt issuance cost and   the relating amortization.   The    Company    had    unamortized    debt    issuance    costs    of    $2,375,877    and    $2,995,209    as    of   September  30,  2016  and  December  31,  2015  respectively.  The  Company  reclassified   amortization  of  debt  issuance  cost  and  commissions  in  the  amount  of  $792,583  and   $674,617 to interest expense for the three- months  periods ended September 30, 2016 and   September 30, 2015,   respectively.   9          SUNVESTA, INC.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING       POLICIES - CONTINUED     New accounting standard updates   adopted - continued    This ASU was applied retrospectively for all periods presented.   In    August    2016,    the    Financial    Accounting    Standards    Board    (FASB)    issued    Accounting   Standards    Updates    (ASU)    2016-15  which    clarifies    how    certain    cash    receipts    and    cash   payments are presented and classified in the statement of    cash flows. The amendments are   intended    to    reduce    diversity    in    practice.    As    the    update    specifies    presentation    in    certain   particular     cases,     they     have     no     impact     on     the     company s     financial     statement     as     of   September 30, 2016, respectively.      3.     GOING       CONCERN    The    Company    is    currently    working    on    building    a    hotel    in    the    Papagayo    Gulf    Tourism   Project    area    of    Guanacaste,    Costa    Rica.    The    project    is    expected    to    open    in    the    fourth   quarter  of  2018.  Until  the  completion  of  the  project,  the  following  expenditures  are   estimated to be incurred:     a.   Gross project cost   $   217,000,000     b.   Less: Proceeds from sale of villas   (25,000,000)       c.   Net project cost   192,000,000     d.   Overhead expenses   20,000,000       e.   Total, excluding other potential projects   $   212,000,000       Seventy    percent    of    the    net    project    cost    is    intended    to    be    financed    through    the    issuance    of   secured    bonds,    for    which    negotiations    have    been    initiated.    The    remaining    thirty    percent    of   the  net  project  cost,  as  well  as  non-recuperated  overhead  expenses  are  intended  to  be   financed by   the   main shareholders or lenders of   the project,   i.e. Zypam   Ltd., shareholder and   related    entity    to    the    late    Mr.    Josef    Mettler,    Mr.    Hans    Rigendinger,    shareholder,    Company   Director    and    interim    Chief    Executive    Officer,    Dr.    Max    R   ssler,    controlling    shareholder    of   Aires International Investment, Inc. and Company   Director.   On July 16, 2012, certain principal    shareholders of    the Company or    principal    lenders to the   project    entered    into    a    Guaranty    Agreement    in    favor    of    the    Company.    The    purpose    of    the   guaranty   is to ensure that until financing is secured for the entire project that they will act as   guarantors  to  creditors  to  the  extent  of  the  project s  ongoing  capital  requirements.  On   September     22,     2015,     the     signatories     to     the     guaranty  formally  agreed  to  maintain  the   guaranty,   as   necessary,   until   December   31,   2018,   after   which date the guaranty will   expire.   On    October    28,    2016,    Hans    Rigendinger    and    Dr.    Max    R ssler    formally    agreed    to    maintain   the    guaranty,    as    necessary, until    completion    of    the    construction of    Paradisus    Papagayo    Bay   Resort   Luxury Villas, after which date the guaranty will expire.   The  Guaranty  Agreement  requires  that  within  30  days  of  receiving  a  demand  notice,   requested  funds  are  made  available  by  the  guarantors  to  the  Company.  Based  on  this   guaranty,    management    believes    that    available funds are sufficient to finance cash flows for   the    twelve    months    subsequent    to    September    30,    2016    and    the    filing    date,    though    future   anticipated    cash    outflows    for    investing    activities    continue    to    depend    on    the    availability    of   financing.   10          SUNVESTA, INC.

Due   to this fact, these restricted cash positions have been classified as long term.   The    restricted    cash    position    in    favor    of    BVK    pension    fund    is    a    rental    deposit    related    to    a   long    term    lease    contract    for    office    space.    Therefore,    this    restricted    cash    position    is    also   classified as long term.      6.

    SUNVESTA, INC.    NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     September 30, 2016       9.     FAIR VALUE       MEASUREMENT    The    guidance    on    fair    value    measurements    defines    fair    value    as    the    exchange    price    that   would    be    received for    an asset    or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price)    in the principal   or    most    advantageous    market    for    the    asset    or    liability    in    an    orderly    transaction    between   market    participants.    This    guidance    also    specifies    a    fair    value    hierarchy    based    upon    the   observability    of    inputs    used    in    valuation    techniques.    Observable    inputs    (highest    level)   reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs (lowest   level)    reflect    internally    developed    market    assumptions.    In    accordance    with    this    guidance,   fair value measurements are classified under the followinghierarchy:      Level 1    Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.      Level 2    Quoted    process    for    similar    instruments    in    active    markets,    quoted    prices    for   identical    or    similar    instruments    in    markets    that    are    not    active;    and    model-   derived    valuations    in    which    significant    inputs    or    significant    value    drivers    are   observable in active markets.      Level 3    Model derived valuations in which one or more significant inputs or   significant value-drivers are unobservable.   When    available,    the    Company    uses    quoted    market    prices    to    determine    fair    value,    and   classifies    such    measurements    within    Level    1.    In    some    cases,    where    market    prices    are    not   available,    the    Company    makes    use    of    observable    market    based    inputs    to    calculate    fair   value,     in     which     case     the     measurements     are  classified  within  Level  2.  If  quoted  or   observable    market    prices    are    not    available,    fair    value    is    based    upon    internally    developed   models    that    use,    where    possible,    current    market-based    parameters    such    as    interest    rates,   yield curves and currency rates. These measurements are classified within Level   3.   Fair    value    measurements are    classified according to the    lowest    level    input    or    value-driver   that    is    significant    to    the    valuation.    A    measurement    may    therefore    be    classified    within   Level 3 even though there may be significant inputs that are readily observable.   Fair    value    measurement    includes    the    consideration    of    nonperformance    risk.   Nonperformance    risk    refers    to    the    risk    that    an    obligation    (either    by    counterparty    or    the   Company)    will    not    be    fulfilled.    For    financial    assets    traded    in an    active    market    (Level    1),   the nonperformance risk is included in the market    price.    For    certain    other    financial    assets   and    liabilities    (Level    2    and    3),    the    Company s    fair    value    calculations    have    been    adjusted   accordingly.   As    of    September    30,    2016    and    December    31,    2015,    respectively,    there    are    no    financial   assets    or    liabilities    measured    on    a    recurring    basis    at    fair    value    with    the    exception    of    the   liability related to the conversion feature.   In     addition     to     the     methods     and     assumptions     to     record     the     fair     value     of     financial   instruments   as   discussed   above,   the   Company   used   the   following   methods   and   assumptions   to estimate the   fair value of our financial   instruments:   15          SUNVESTA, INC.

However,  the  Company  records  the  loan  at  nominal  value.  The   Company    does    not    have    sufficient    cash    to    repurchase    the    shares    as    of    balance    sheet    date    and    hence    repay   the loans in shares.

EUR  bond (old)   carrying amount approximated fair value due to its short term nature         EUR- bonds   The fair values of the bonds payable are classified as level 3 fair values. The fair values of the   bonds have been determined by discounting cash flow projections discounted at the respective interest rates of   7.25% for EUR bonds, which represents the current market rate based on the creditworthiness of the   Company. Hence, the carrying values approximate fair value.         CHF-bonds         The    fair    values    of    the    bonds    payable    are    classified    as    level    3    fair    values.    The    fair    values    of   the    bonds    have    been    determined    by discounting    cash    flow    projections    discounted    at    the    respective    interest   rates    of    7.25%    for    CHF    bonds,    which    represents    the    current    market    rate    based    on    the    creditworthiness    of   the Company. Hence, the carrying values approximate fair value.

The    fair    values    of    the    notes    were    determined    by   discounting cash flow projections discounted at the respective interest rates of 7.25%, which represents the   current market rate based on the creditworthiness of the Company. Hence, the carrying value approximates   fair value.         Convertible    CHF-bonds         The    fair    values    of    the    convertible    bonds    payable    are    classified    as    level    3    fair   values. The fair values of the convertible bonds have been determined by discounting cash flow projections   discounted  at  the  respective  interest  rates  of  6.00%  for  convertible  CHF  bonds,  which  represents  the   current market rate based on the creditworthiness of the Company. Hence, the carrying values approximate   fair value.

The    fair    value    of    the    liability is    determined    using    a    Black   Scholes    model    to    calculate  the  option  value  at  each  reporting  date  and  multiplied  by  the  number  of   potentially convertibleshares.   16          SUNVESTA, INC.

In    the   first quarter of 2016, the Company reclassified $634,186 from Convertible CHF Bond   I.   As    per    date    of    this    report    the    Company    has    realized    a    cumulative    amount    of    CHF    37.20   million   ($38.24 million) related to the Convertible Bond   II.

NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     September 30, 2016       13.     PENSION PLAN    The Company maintains a pension plan covering   all employees in Switzerland.   The   plan   is   considered     a     defined     benefit     plan     and     accounted     for     in     accordance     with     ASC     715    Compensation        -        Retirement        Benefits .    This    model    allocates    pension    costs    over    the    service   period  of  employees  in  the  plan.  The  underlying  principle  is  that  employees  render   services    ratably    over    this    period,    and    therefore,    the    income    statement    effects    of    pensions   should    follow    a    similar    pattern.    ASC    715    requires    recognition    of    the    funded    status,    or   difference    between    the    fair    value    of    plan    assets    and    the    projected    benefit    obligations    of   the    pension    plan    on    the    balance    sheet,    with    a    corresponding    adjustment    recorded    in    the   net    loss.    If    the    projected    benefit    obligation exceeds the fair    value    of    plan    assets,    then    that   difference   or unfunded status represents the pension   liability.   The Company records a net periodic pension cost    in the statement    of    comprehensive loss.   The    liabilities    and    annual    income    or    expense    of    the    pension    plan    is    determined    using   methodologies    that    involve    several    actuarial    assumptions,    the    most    significant    of    which   are    the    discount    rate    and    the    long-    term    rate    of    asset    return    (based    on    the    market-related   value    of    assets). The    fair    values    of    plan    assets    are    determined    based    on    prevailing    market   prices.    Actuarial valuation    Net periodic pension cost has been included in the Company s results as follows:      Three        months     Three        months     Nine        months      Nine        months       ended     ended     ended     ended       Pension expense     September        30,     September        30,   September        30,   September        30,       2016     2015     2016     2015       $     $     $     $                Current service cost   15,357   14,527   46,070   43,582     Net actuarial (gain) loss recognized   -   -   -   -      Interest cost     9 45   1,337   2,836   4,011     Expected return on assets   (1,916)   (1,646)   (5,749)   (4,937)     Employee contributions   (5,877)   (5,914)   (17,631)   (17,741)       Net            periodic pension            cost      8,509     8,304     25,526     24,011    During    the    three-month    periods    ended    September    30,    2016    and    September    30,    2015    the   Company    made    cash    contributions    of    $15,534    and    $5,914,    respectively,    to    its    defined   benefit pension plan.   All of the assets are held under the collective contract by the plan s re-insurance company   and    are    invested    in    a    mix    of    Swiss    and    international    fixed-income    and    equity    securities   within the limits set out by the Swiss pension law.   The  expected  future  cash  flows  to  be  paid  by  the  Company  in  respect  of  employer   contributions   to   the pension plan for the year ended December 31, 2016 are $17,631.   26          SUNVESTA, INC.

Such    share    based    remuneration    includes    either    shares    or    options    to    acquire    shares   of the Company s common stock.   For  all  employees,  fair  value  is  estimated  at  the  grant  date.  Compensation  costs  for   unvested shares are expensed over the requisite service period on a straight-line basis.

NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     September 30, 2016       14.     STOCK COMPENSATION - CONTINUED     Stock Options   Mr. Hans Rigendinger    The Company granted to    Hans    Rigendinger, in connection with    his employment    contract,   10,000,000 stock options on January 1, 2013. Each option entitles Mr. Rigendinger to buy   one  Company  share  at  a  strike  price  of  $0.05.  These  options  will  be  vested  in  two   identical installments (installment A and   B) of 5,000,000 options.   Installment     A     is     contingent     on     obtaining     a     financing     arrangement     with     a     specific   counterparty.    As    of    the    grant    date,    the    fair    value    was    $300,000.    As    of    July    4,    2013,    the   Company    assessed    that    this financing arrangement    with    the    specific    counterparty will    not   be    completed.    Therefore,    the    Company    assessed    the    probability    of    completion    to    be    zero   and    recognized    no    expense.    On    July    4,    2013,    the    Company    authorized    a    revised    stock   option   agreement.   This   removed   the   requirement   for   financing   with   a   specific   counterparty    and    updated    for    any    counterparty.    As    of    date    of    the    revised    stock    option   agreement,    the    fair    value    was    $246,000.    Installment    A    was    modified    on    July    4,    2013,   since    the    initial    performance    condition    was improbable    to    be    met.    Since    the    modification   changed    the    expectation    that    the    options    will    ultimately    vest    and    no    expense    had    been   recognized for the original award, the fair value of the modified award has been expensed   on a straight line basis over the expected vesting period.   For     installment     B,     it     is     required     that     Meli      Hotels     International     ( Mel a )     assumes   management    responsibilities    for    Paradisus    Papagayo    Bay    Resort         Luxury    Villas.    As    of   grant    date,    the    fair    value    was    $340,000    and    the    Company    estimated    that    Meli     would   assume responsibility as of July 1, 2015.

These    options    had    three    different   performance conditions.   For    installment    A    (3,000,000    options),    it    was    required    to    complete    a    bridge    financing   arrangement.

As of the date of this report, the estimated opening date was   postponed  to  the  fourth  quarter  2018,  as  was  the  required  date  of     the  performance   condition.

EARNINGS PER       SHARE    Basic    earnings    per    share    are    the    result    of    dividing the Company s    net    income    (or    net    loss)   by  the  weighted  average  number     of     shares  outstanding  for     the  contemplated  period.   Diluted earnings per share   are   calculated   applying   the   treasury   stock   method. When   there   is   a   net income dilutive effect,   all stock-based compensation awards or participating financial   instruments    are    considered.    When    the    Company    posts    a    loss,    basic    loss    per    share    equals   diluted loss per    share.

Over    time,    the    project    developed    differently    to    what    the   parties     expected.     Consequently,     contract     renegotiations     became     necessary.

In    the  meantime,  a  settlement  agreement  is  being   discussed,    which,    if    signed    by    the    parties,    is    probable    to    settle    for    an    estimated    amount    of   $600,000.  This  amount  is  accounted  for  as  of  September  30,  2016,  under  consulting   expenses.      21.

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial   statements and notes hereto included in this report. All information presented herein is based   on our three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015. Our   fiscal year end is December 31.    Discussion and Analysis      Business Overview     We are in the process of developing high-end luxury hotels and resorts worldwide. Our initial   focus is concentrated on offering luxury hotel products located in attractive, top-class coastal   vacation destinations in countries that are fast emerging as popular tourist destinations. Each   prospective development takes into consideration country specific conditions and general   considerations that include the stability of local political conditions, geologically useful   cultivability, and the types of destinations that attract a five-star clientele. Once identified as   eligible, prospective developments are compared against a validation checklist and then, if   warranted, subjected to a substantial due diligence process. Since location is the key to the success   of any tourist based luxury real estate project, each development will be carefully considered   during the eligibility process.     Initial Development     Our initial real estate development on 20.5 hectares of prime land located in Guanacaste   Province, Costa Rica, is the Paradisus Papagayo Bay Resort   Luxury Villas project includes   two concepts; i.e. the Vista Mar (Family Concierge) and the Vista Bahia (Royal Service), a five-   star luxury hotel.

      Management     Overall project development is led by Hans Rigendinger, Chairman of the Board, Chief Executive   Officer and Chief Operating Officer of the Company, Charles Fessel, Project Director Paradisus   Papagayo Bay Resort   Luxury Villas and Ernst Rosenberger, the Company s Corporate   Controller. The lead architect is Ossenbach, Pendones   Bonilla, one of Costa Rica s largest   architectural offices with over 45 architects and designers. Civil engineering services are provided   by DEHC Engineers and structural engineering services by IEAC. Landscape architects are TPA   and interior designers are led by Laboratiro Quattro.   Resort management is to be provided by Mel a Hotels International ( Mel a ).  Paradisus  is   Meli  s five- star all-inclusive luxury hotel brand that is well recognized in the hospitality   industry around the world. Mel a was founded in 1956 in Palma de Mallorca, Spain and is today   one of the world s largest resort hotel chains, as well as Spain s leading hotel chain for business   or leisure. The company currently offers more than 300 hotels in 26 countries over four   continents under its Gran Sol Mel a, Sol Mel a, ME by Sol Mel a, Innside by Sol Mel a, Tryp,   Sol Mel a, Sol Mel a Vacation Club, and Paradisus brands. The Paradisus brand represents all-   inclusive luxury resorts with hotels in Mexico and the Dominican   Republic.   Since the completion date for the Paradisus Papagayo Bay Resort   Luxury Villas   development is now anticipated for the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company reached an   agreement dated April 28, 2016, to further amend the management agreement with Meli    dated March 8, 2011. The amended agreement presently stipulates that if the Papagayo Bay   Resort   Luxury Villa s is not completed by November 15, 2018, and if an extension date is   not agreed, then Meli  could terminate the management agreement and cause the Company to   pay a penalty of $5 million.     Additional Concession Properties     On April 20, 2012, the Company entered into an agreement with Meridian IBG ( Meridian ), as   amended on November 13, 2012, and replaced on May 7, 2013, to purchase two additional   concession properties in Polo Papagayo, Guanacaste, comprised of approximately 230,000 square   meters for $17,500,000. One of the concessions lies adjacent to the existing concessions (La   Punta) and the other is in close proximity to the Paradisus Papagayo Bay Resort   Luxury Villas   development.   The Company had paid down-payments on the purchase of these properties of $2,669,816 as of   September 30, 2016, and is in discussions with Meridian regarding an amendment to the   agreement. Should the Company not be successful in obtaining an amendment to the agreement,   it would have to write-off $300,000 of that purchase price already paid in addition to a 5%   penalty.Both, the $300,000 write-off (accounted for as impairment expenses) as well as the   $50,000 for additional damages (accounted for as general and administrative expenses) have   been provided for in the results year-to-date 2016.     Swiss Hospitality Project     On September 19, 2015, the Company signed an option agreement to acquire four existing hotels   in the Canton of Graub nden, Switzerland with an unrelated third party. The properties optioned   comprise an aggregate of 141 rooms. The consideration for the option was CHF 300,000, which   amount was paid on October 25, 2015. Dated May 10, 2016, the Company, QuadEquity Holdings   AG and the seller of the four hotels concluded an agreement, whereby QuadEquity Holdings AG   assumed all of the Company s rights and obligations from the original contract. In return,   QuadEquity Holdings AG will pay the Company the amount of $302,000 (CHF 300,000) before   May 30, 2016. This payment was received on June 1, 2016.   40        
      Finance     The anticipated completion of the Paradisus Papagayo Bay Resort   Luxury Villas in the fourth   quarter of 2018 will require a net investment of approximately $212 million (including non-   recuperated overhead expenses), of which approximately $60 million has been expended as of   September 30, 2016. We expect to realize a minimum of $140 million in new funding over the   next twelve months. New funding over the next twelve months is expected to be raised from debt   financing through bonds, shareholder loans and, if necessary, the guaranty agreement borne by   certain principal shareholders and participants in management.

The variance in losses over the comparative three- month periods is reconciled below:      Three        months        July        1    st          to        September        30,        2015     (383,197)           Variances        during        the 3        months      Decrease    in    general    and    administrative    expenses   5,644      There    was    an    increase    due    to   significantly    higher consulting   expenses,    project-related    and    due    to   contemplated    IPO    in    Switzerland.   This    increase    was    overcompensated   by    negative    personnel    costs    due    to    a   reversal    of share-based    payments   for the    late    Josef Mettler       Increase    in    interest    income   6,960     Increase    in    deposits       Decrease    in    interest    expenses   360,179     Significantly    higher    debt,   overcompensated    by    an    increase    in   capitalized interest.

Income Tax Expense (Benefit)     The Company has a prospective income tax benefit resulting from a net operating loss carry-forward   and startup costs that will offset future operating profits.     Capital Expenditures     The Company expended a significant amount on capital expenditures for the period from inception to   September 30, 2016, in connection with the purchase of land concessions in Costa Rica, as well as the   planning and construction of the project and expects to incur future cash outflows on capital   expenditure as discussed in the "Liquidity and Capital Resources" and the "Going Concern" paragraphs   below.   43        
      Liquidity and Capital Resources     Since inception the Company has experienced significant changes in liquidity, capital resources, and   stockholders  equity.   As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the following were working capital items:      September 30,     December 31,       2016     2015     Current assets      Cash    and    cash    equivalents   2,985,698   111,830           Receivable    from    related    parties   20,643   19,945           Other assets   549,978   158,574            Total        current assets     3,556,320     290,349                 Current liabilities      Bank    liabilities   -   179,313           Accounts    payable   4,814,034   8,048,608           Accrued    expenses   9,109,806   7,831,247           Notes    payable   2,660,607   2,736,912           Notes    payable    to    related    parties   6,023,048   1,130,978           Bonds   14,717,618   8,347,717            Total        current liability     37,325,113     28,274,775                   Net       working capital     (33,768,793)     (27,984,426)      As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the following were the items making up the total   stockholders  deficit:            September 30,     December 31,       2016     2015     Assets      Current    assets   3,556,320   290,349           Non-current    assets   69,598,624   67,007,090            Total        assets     73,154,944     67,297,439                 Liabilities      Current liabilities   37,325,112   28,274,775           Non-current liabilities   87,993,941   80,287,652        Total        liabilities     125,319,053     108,562,427                   Total        stockholders  deficit     (52,164,109)     (41,264,988)          The Company s negative net working capital of $33,768,793 is of concern; however, based on the   guaranty signed by certain principals, the Company is convinced that it can address liquidity   problems.   Net cash flow used in operating activities for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, was   $6,053,988, as compared to $3,137,324 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015.   The Company expects to continue to use net cash flow in operating activities until we complete the   Paradisus Papagayo Bay Resort   Luxury Villas project, which completion is projected for the   fourth quarter of 2018.   44        
    Net cash used in investing activities for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, was   $1,480,178 as compared to $8,680,218 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015. Net   cash used in investing activities in the current nine-month period is comprised of the purchase of   property and equipment, and deposits related to construction, offset by a sale of equipment, a   collection of cash for a down payment and restricted cash. Net cash used in investing activities in the   prior comparable nine-month period was comprised of the purchase of property and equipment,   down payments for property and equipment offset by receivables from related parties, deposits   related to construction and restricted cash. We expect negative net cash flow in investing activities to   continue while in the process of developing the Paradisus Papagayo Bay Resort   Luxury Villas.   Net cash provided by financing activities for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, was   $10,382,963 as compared to $12,030,782 for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2015. Net   cash provided by financing activities in the current nine-month period is comprised of proceeds   from notes payable to related parties, and proceeds from bond issuances net of commissions, offset   by a decrease in bank liabilities, repayment of notes payable to related parties, the payment of debt   issuance costs, and changes in other debt. Net cash provided by financing activities in the prior   comparable nine-month period was comprised of proceeds from notes payable related parties, and   proceeds from bond issuances net of commissions, offset by the decrease in bank liabilities, the   payment of debt issuance costs, and changes in other debt. We expect net cash flow provided by   financing activities to continue due to the financing necessary to complete the development of the   Paradisus Papagayo Bay Resort   Luxury Villas.   Management believes that cash on hand, related party loans and the assurance of the Guaranty   Agreement as described in the going concern paragraph below are sufficient for us to conduct   operations over the next twelve months.   We had no formal lines of credit or other bank financing arrangements as of September 30, 2016.   We have commitments for executed purchase orders and agreements in the amount of $57 million   as of September 30, 2016, in connection with the development of the Paradisus Papagayo Bay   Resort   Luxury Villas, which commitments are included in the required estimated net financing of   $192 million (excluding overhead expenses) to complete the project. Most material commitments   are not contractually agreed as of the end of the period. We have cancellable commitments to   Meridian that are not included in the required financing for the development of the Paradisus   Papagayo Bay Resort   Luxury Villas of approximately $15,000,000 as of September 30, 2016, for   the purchase of two additional concession properties in Polo Papagayo, Guanacaste, Costa Rica.   We maintain a defined benefit plan that covers all of our Swiss employees.   We have no current plans for significant purchases or sales of plant or equipment, except in   connection with the planned construction of the Paradisus Papagayo Bay Resort   Luxury Villas.   We have no plans to make any changes in the number of our employees as of September 30, 2016.     Future Financings     On May 9, 2016, the Company signed an agreement with  Median Trust SA , by which this service   provider is mandated to set-up a special purpose vehicle ( SPV ), as a  Compartment  in   accordance with Luxembourg law. The objective of the SPV is to obtain an investment grade rating   and to make a bond offering of not less than $100 million. The SPV will therefore be the issuer,   however, the responsibility to place the bonds remains with the Company. As of the date of this   report, the SPV has not yet been established.   As of September 21, 2016, the Company has started the distribution of a new bond in the amount of   CHF 20.0 million, to be underwritten until November 30, 2016.   45            Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements     As of September 30, 2016, we had no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are   reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial   condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital   resources that are material to stockholders.     Going Concern     The Company intends to build a hotel in the Papagayo Gulf Tourism Project area of Guanacaste,   Costa Rica. The total net investment is estimated to be approximately $212 million.   The project is expected to open in the fourth quarter of 2018. Until the completion of the   project, the following expenditures are estimated to be incurred:     a.    Gross project cost   $   217,000,000     b.    Less: Proceeds from sale of villas   (25,000,000)     c.    Net project cost   192,000,000     d.    Overhead expenses   20,000,000       e.    Total, excluding other potential projects   $   212,000,000       Seventy percent of the  Net project cost  is intended to be financed through the issuance of secured   bonds, for which negotiations have been initiated. The remaining thirty percent of the  Net project   cost , as well as  non-recuperated overhead expenses  and the cost of potential  other projects  are   intended to be financed by the main shareholders or lenders of the project in the absence of   alternative financing committements, i.e. Zypam Ltd., shareholder and related entity to the late Mr.   Josef Mettler, Mr. Hans Rigendinger, shareholder, interim Chief Executive Officer and Company   Board Member and Dr. Max R ssler, Company Board Member and controlling shareholder of   Aires.   On July 16, 2012, certain principal shareholders of the Company or principal lenders to the project   entered into a guaranty agreement in favor of SunVesta AG. The purpose of the guaranty is to   ensure that until such time as financing is secured for the entire project that they will act as a   guarantor to creditors to the extent of the project s ongoing capital requirements.   On September 22, 2015, the signatories to the guaranty formally agreed to maintain the guaranty, as   necessary, until December 31, 2018, after which date the guaranty will expire. The guaranty   agreement requires that within 30 days of receiving a demand notice, the requested funds are made   available by the guarantors to the Company.   On September 12, 2016, the signatories to the guaranty formally agreed to maintain the guaranty, as   necessary, until completion of the construction of Paradisus Papagayo Bay Resort   Luxury Villas,   after which date the guaranty will expire. The guaranty agreement requires that within 30 days of   receiving a demand notice, the requested funds are made available by the guarantors to the   Company.   Based on this Guaranty Agreement, management believes that available funds are sufficient to   finance cash flows for the twelve months subsequent to September 30, 2016, and the filing date,   though future anticipated cash outflows for investing activities will continue to depend on the   availability of financing.   46            Forward-Looking Statements and Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial       Condition     The statements contained in the section titled  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial     Condition and Results of Operations  and elsewhere in this current report, with the exception of   historical facts, are forward-looking statements.

CONTROLS  AND       PROCEDURES      Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures     In connection with the preparation of this quarterly report, an evaluation was carried out by the   Company s management, with the participation of its chief executive officer and chief financial   officer, of the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in   Rules 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ( Exchange Act )).

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting     During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, there has been no change in internal control over   financial reporting that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect our   internal control over financial reporting.   48
