EXPLANATORY NOTE 
    
  Zebra Technologies Corporation (the "Company") is filing this Amendment to its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q ("Form 10-Q/A") for the quarter-ended July 2, 2016 which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on August 9, 2016 (the "Original Filing"). The Company is filing this Form 10-Q/A to reflect restatements of its Consolidated Balance Sheet at July 2, 2016, its Consolidated Statements of Operations, Comprehensive Loss and Cash Flows for the three and six months ended July 2, 2016, and the related notes thereto, as a result of the correction of these primarily related to the Company's underaccrual of certain 2015 estimates, most notably for its sales commissions plan, its accounting for income taxes and an error to the net realizable value of acquired trade receivables impacting goodwill and general and administrative expenses. 
  By restating our financial statements to correct the errors discussed above, we are making adjustments for previously identified accounting errors deemed immaterial in aggregate with respect to the year ended December 31, 2015, which were recorded in the Company's 2016 financial results. When these financial statements were originally issued, we assessed the impact of these unrecorded adjustments and concluded that they were not material individually or in the aggregate to our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 or the three and six months ended July 2, 2016. In conjunction with the restatement, we have determined that it is appropriate within this Amendment to reflect these adjustments in the year ended December 31, 2015 Consolidated Financial Statements. Please refer to Note 2 -  Restatement  included in our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto in this Amendment for more information regarding the impact of these adjustments. 
    
  The following sections in the Original Filing are revised in this Form 10-Q/A, solely as a result of, and to reflect the restatement: 

Part I -  Item 1   Financial Statements 
        
    Part I  - Item 2   Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
        
    Part I  - Item 4   Controls and Procedures 
        
    Part II - Item 6   Exhibits 

Pursuant to the rules of the SEC, Part II, item 6 of the Original Filing has been amended for the currently-dated certifications from the Company's principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as required by Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.  The certifications of the principal executive officer and principal financial officer are included to this Form 10-Q/A as Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2. 
     
  For the convenience of the reader, this Form 10-Q/A sets forth the information in the Original Filing in its entirety, as such information is modified and superseded where necessary to reflect the restatement and related revisions. Except as provided above, this Amendment does not reflect events occurring after the filing of the Original Filing and does not amend or otherwise update any information in the Original Filing. Accordingly, this Form 10-Q/A should be read in conjunction with our filings with the SEC subsequent to filing of the Original Filing with the SEC on August 9, 2016.

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (Unaudited) 
   
  Note 1 Description of Business and Basis of Presentation 
    
  Zebra Technologies Corporation and its subsidiaries ("Zebra" or "Company") is a global leader respected for innovative solutions in the automatic information and data capture industry. We design, manufacture, and sell a broad range of products that capture and move data, including: mobile computers; barcode scanners and imagers; radio frequency identification device ("RFID") readers; wireless LAN ( WLAN ) solutions and software; specialty printers for barcode labeling and personal identification; real-time location systems ( RTLS  related accessories and supplies such as self-adhesive labels and other consumables; and software and services that are associated with these products. End-users of our products include those in the retail, transportation and logistics, manufacturing, healthcare, hospitality, warehouse and distribution, energy and utilities, and education industries around the world.  
    
  Our customers have traditionally benefited from proven solutions that increase productivity and improve efficiency and asset utilization.

EAI solutions offer additional benefits to our customers including real-time, data-driven insights that improve operational visibility and drive workflow optimization. 
    
  Management prepared these unaudited interim consolidated financial statements according to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) for interim financial information and notes. These consolidated financial statements do not include all of the information and notes required by United States generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) for complete financial statements, although management believes that the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. Therefore, these consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. 
  In the opinion of the Company, these interim financial statements include all adjustments (of a normal, recurring nature) necessary to present fairly its consolidated balance sheet as of July 2, 2016 and the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the three and six months ended July 2, 2016 and July 4, 2015 and the consolidated statements of cash flows for the six months ended July 2, 2016 and July 4, 2015. These results, however, are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the full year.  
   
  Note 2   Restatement     
  During the first half of 2016, the Company identified certain errors in its 2015 annual consolidated financial statements primarily related to the underaccrual of certain 2015 estimates, most notably for its sales commission plan, which were partially offset by tax-related items. These errors were originally corrected in the first half of 2016 by recording $11 million of additional pre-tax expenses, primarily within operating expenses, which when combined with tax-related items resulted in a $7 million increase to the net loss within the consolidated statement of operations as of the six months ended July 2, 2016. During the third quarter of 2016, the Company identified additional income tax errors related to 2015 and an error to the net realizable value of trade receivables acquired in connection with the Company's acquisition of the Enterprise business of Motorola Solutions, Inc impacting goodwill and general and administrative expenses. The Company has concluded that these errors were material, in the aggregate, to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015.      
  By restating our financial statements to correct the errors discussed above, we are making adjustments for previously identified accounting errors deemed immaterial with respect to the year ended December 31, 2015, which were recorded in the Company's 2016 financial results. In conjunction with the restatement, we have determined that it is appropriate within this Amendment to reflect these adjustments in the year ended December 31, 2015 Consolidated Financial Statements.     
  The Consolidated Balance Sheet, Consolidated Statements of Operations, Comprehensive Loss, and Cash Flows, and Notes 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 13, 15, 16, and 17 in these financial statements were updated to reflect the restatement.  
  The tables below present the impact of the changes on the Company's financial statement line items:

  The Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss as of the three months and six months ended July 2, 2016 were adjusted for the $4 million and $7 million decreases in net loss, respectively.   Additionally, a correction of   $1 million   in foreign currency translation is reflected in the six months ended July 2, 2016. 
   
  Note 3 Significant Accounting Policies 
    
  Income Taxes 
    
  The Company s interim period tax provision is determined as follows: 
             
    At the end of each fiscal quarter, the Company estimates the income tax provision that will be provided for the fiscal year. 
                
    The forecasted annual effective tax rate is applied to the year-to-date ordinary income (loss) at the end of each quarter to compute the year-to-date tax applicable to ordinary income (loss).  The term ordinary income (loss) refers to income (loss) from continuing operations, before income taxes, excluding significant, unusual or infrequently occurring items. 
                
    The tax effects of significant, unusual or infrequently occurring items are recognized as discrete items in the interim periods in which the events occur. The impact of changes in tax laws or rates on deferred tax amounts, the effects of changes in judgment about valuation allowances established in prior years, and changes in tax reserves resulting from the finalization of tax audits or reviews are examples of significant, unusual or infrequently occurring items. 
       
  The determination of the forecasted annual effective tax rate is based upon a number of significant estimates and judgments, including the forecasted annual income (loss) before income taxes of the Company in each tax jurisdiction in which it operates, the development of tax planning strategies during the year, and the need for a valuation allowance. In addition, the Company s tax expense can be impacted by changes in tax rates or laws, the finalization of tax audits and reviews, as well as other factors that cannot be predicted with certainty. As such, there can be significant volatility in interim tax provisions. 
  Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncement 
  In April 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2015-5,    Intangibles Goodwill and Other Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer s Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement.    This update provides guidance to customers about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license or should be accounted for differently. If a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license, then the customer should account for the software license element of the arrangement consistent with the acquisition of other software licenses. If a cloud computing arrangement does not include a software license, the customer should account for the arrangement as a service contract. The guidance does not change generally accepted accounting principles for a customer s accounting for service contracts. This update is effective for annual periods, including interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2015. The Company has prospectively adopted this new standard on January 1, 2016 and concluded that it does not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. 
  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,    Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  .  The core principle is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the  
  
   10 

     Table of Contents  

consideration which the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08,    Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting revenue gross versus net)  ,  which clarifies gross versus net revenue reporting when another party is involved in the transaction. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10,    Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing  ,  which amends the revenue guidance on identifying performance obligations and accounting for licenses of intellectual property. In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-11,    Rescission of SEC Guidance Because of ASU 2014-09 Pursuant to Staff Announcement at March 3, 2016 EITF Meeting,        which rescinds certain SEC Staff Observer comments upon adoption of Topic 606. In May 2016, the FASB also issued ASU 2016-12,    Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients,        which provides certain improvements and practical expedients in the interpretation and application of this topic. There are two transition methods available under the new standard, either cumulative effect or retrospective. These standards will be effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2018. Earlier adoption is permitted only for annual periods after December 15, 2016. Management is still assessing the impact of adoption on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11,    Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory,    which changes the measurement principle for inventory from the lower of cost or market to the lower of cost or net realizable value for entities that measure inventory using first-in, first-out (FIFO) or average cost. Net realizable value is defined as the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. This ASU is effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2017. Earlier adoption is permitted and the guidance must be applied prospectively after the date of adoption. Management is still assessing the impact of adoption on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting,        which provides for simplification of certain aspects of employee share-based payment accounting including income taxes, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. The standard will be effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2017 and will be applied either prospectively, retrospectively or using a modified retrospective transition approach depending on the area covered in this update. Earlier adoption is permitted. Management is still assessing the impact of adoption on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,    Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.        ASU 2016-01 amends various aspects of the recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure for financial instruments. With respect to the Company's consolidated financial statements, the most significant impact relates to the accounting for equity investments. This standard will be effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2018. Early adoption is prohibited for those provisions that apply to the Company. Amendments should be applied by means of cumulative effect adjustment to the consolidated balance sheet as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The amendments related to equity securities without readily determinable fair values including disclosure requirements should be applied prospectively to equity investments that exist as of the date of adoption of the ASU. Management is still assessing the impact of adoption on its consolidated financial statements.  
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,    Leases (Subtopic 842).        This ASU increases the transparency and comparability of organizations by recognizing lease assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet and disclosing key quantitative and qualitative information about leasing arrangements. The principal difference from previous guidance is that the lease assets and lease liabilities arising from operating leases were not previously recognized in the consolidated balance sheet. The recognition, measurement, presentation and cash flows arising from a lease by a lessee have not significantly changed. This standard will be effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2019, with early adoption permitted. In transition, lessees and lessors are required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach, which includes a number of optional practical expedients that entities may elect to apply. Management is currently assessing the impact of adoption on its consolidated financial statements.  
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,    Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326) No. 2016-13-Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.    The new standard requires the measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets held at amortized cost. It replaces the existing incurred loss impairment model with an expected loss methodology, which will result in more timely recognition of credit losses. There are two transition methods available under the new standard dependent upon the type of financial instrument, either cumulative effect or prospective. The standard will be effective for the Company in the first quarter of 2020. Earlier adoption is permitted only for annual periods after December 15, 2018. Management is currently assessing the impact of adoption on its consolidated financial statements.

Note 4 Fair Value Measurements 
  Financial assets and liabilities are to be measured using inputs from 3 levels of the fair value hierarchy in accordance with ASC Topic 820,    Fair Value Measurements  .  Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. It establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes observable and unobservable inputs used to measure fair value into the following 3 broad levels: 
  Level 1: Quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical assets or liabilities. The fair                         value hierarchy gives the highest priority to Level 1 inputs. 
  Level 2: Observable prices that are based on inputs not quoted on active markets, but corroborated by market data. 
  Level 3: Unobservable inputs are used when little or no market data is available. The fair value hierarchy gives the lowest priority to Level 3 inputs. 
  In determining fair value, the Company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible. In addition, the Company considers counterparty credit risk in the assessment of fair value. 
  Financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value as of July 2, 2016, are classified below (in millions): 

Financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value as of December 31, 2015, are classified below (in millions):

(1) The fair value of the derivative contracts is calculated as follows: 
  a. Fair value of a put option contract associated with forecasted sales hedges is calculated using bid and ask 
      rates for similar contracts. 
  b. Fair value of regular forward contracts associated with forecasted sales hedges is calculated using the period-end 
      exchange rate adjusted for current forward points. 
  c. Fair value of hedges against net assets is calculated at the period-end exchange rate adjusted for current forward 
      points (Level 2). If the hedge has been traded but not settled at period-end, the fair value is calculated at the 
      rate at which the hedge is being settled (Level 1). As a result, transfers from Level 2 to Level 1 of the fair 
      value hierarchy totaled   $2 million   and   $6 million   as of July 2, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 
  (2) The fair value of forward interest rate swaps is based upon a valuation model that uses relevant observable market inputs 
        at the quoted intervals, such as forward yield curves, and is adjusted for the Company s credit risk and the interest rate  
        swap terms. See gross balance reporting in Note 9 Derivative Instruments.

The estimated fair value of the Company s long-term debt approximated   $3.0 billion   and   $3.1 billion   at July 2, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. These fair value amounts represent the estimated value at which the Company s lenders could trade its debt within the financial markets and does not represent the settlement value of these long-term debt liabilities to the Company. The fair value of the long-term debt will continue to vary each period based on fluctuations in market interest rates, as well as changes to the Company s credit ratings. This methodology resulted in a Level 2 classification in the fair value hierarchy.

Note 9 Derivative Instruments 
  The Company conducts business on a multinational basis in a wide variety of foreign currencies; as such, the Company manages these risks using derivative financial instruments. The exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates arises from cross-border financing activities between subsidiaries and foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities. The objective is to preserve the economic value of non-functional currency denominated cash flows. Therefore, the goal is to hedge transaction exposures with natural offsets to the fullest extent possible, and once these opportunities have been exhausted, through foreign exchange forward and option contracts with third parties. 
  The Company entered into a credit agreement which provides for a term loan of   $2.2 billion   ( Term Loan ) and a revolving credit facility of   $250.0 million   ( Revolving Credit Facility ). See Note 11 Long-Term Debt. As such, the Company has exposure to market risk for changes in interest expense calculated off of variable interest rates on the term facility that was used to fund the Acquisition. The Company entered into forward interest rate swaps to hedge a portion of the interest rate risk associated with the Term Loan. 
  In accordance with ASC 815,    Derivative and Hedging  ,  the Company recognizes derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet and measures them at fair value. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value are accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it is designated as and qualifies for hedge accounting. The Company s master netting and other similar arrangements with the respective counterparties allow for net settlement under certain conditions, which are designed to reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement with the same counterparty. 
  Credit and Market Risk 
  Financial instruments, including derivatives, expose the Company to counterparty credit risk for nonperformance and to market risk related to interest and currency exchange rates. The Company manages its exposure to counterparty credit risk through specific minimum credit standards, diversification of counterparties, and procedures to monitor concentrations of credit risk. Its counterparties in derivative transactions are commercial banks with significant experience using derivative instruments. The Company monitors the impact of market risk on the fair value and cash flows of its derivative and other financial instruments considering reasonably possible changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates and restricts the use of derivative financial instruments to hedging activities. The Company continually monitors the creditworthiness of its customers to which it grants credit terms in the normal course of business. The terms and conditions of the Company s credit sales are designed to mitigate or eliminate concentrations of credit risk with any single customer. 
  Non-Designated Foreign Currency Derivatives 
  The Company uses forward contracts to manage exposure related to its British Pound, Canadian Dollar, Czech Koruna, Brazilian Real, Malaysian Ringgit, and Euro denominated net assets. Forward contracts typically mature within three months after execution of the contracts. The Company records monetary gains and losses on these contracts and options in income each quarter along with the transaction gains and losses related to its net asset positions, which would ordinarily offset each other. 
  Summary financial information related to these activities included in the Company s consolidated statements of operations as other (expenses) income is as follows (in millions):

     Table of Contents  

Hedging of Anticipated Sales 
  The Company manages the exchange rate risk of anticipated Euro denominated sales using put options, forward contracts and participating forwards. The Company designates these contracts as cash flow hedges which mature within twelve months after the execution of the contracts. Gains and losses on these contracts are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the contracts are settled and the hedged sales are realized. The deferred gain or loss will then be reported as an increase or decrease to net sales. At the end of the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company expanded its hedging activities to manage the exposure from the Enterprise segment related to fluctuations of foreign currency exchange rates. The impact is reflected in the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss. 
  Summary financial information related to the cash flow hedges within the statements of accumulated comprehensive loss is as follows (in millions):

The Company records its foreign exchange contracts at fair value on its consolidated balance sheets as a current asset or liability, depending upon the fair value calculation as detailed in Note 4 Fair Value Measurements. The amounts recorded on the consolidated balance sheets are as follows (in millions): 

Forward Interest Rate Swaps 
  The Company's forward interest rate swaps hedge the interest rate risk associated with the variable interest payments on its Term Loan. The change in fair value of swaps which are designated as cash flow hedges are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss whereas those which were not designated in a hedging relationship are reported in the Company's consolidated statements of operations as interest expense and other, net. Any ineffectiveness is immediately recognized in earnings. 
  The balance sheet position of the forward interest rate swaps designated in a hedge relationship is as follows (in millions, except percentages): 

The forward interest rate swaps not designated in a hedging relationship are recorded in a net liability position of   $9 million   as of July 2, 2016 and   $11 million   as of December 31, 2015 in the consolidated balance sheets. 
    
  The gross fair values and related offsetting counterparty fair values as well as the net fair value amounts at July 2, 2016 were as follows (in millions): 

Certain of the forward interest rate swaps, each with a term of 1 year, are designated as cash flow hedges of interest rate exposure associated with variability in future cash flows on the Term Loan. The notional amount of these designated swaps effective in each year of the cash flow hedge relationships does not exceed the principal amount of the Term Loan which is hedged.

The unrealized gain/loss recognized in other comprehensive loss on the forward interest rate swaps designated in a hedging relationship is as follows (in millions): 

Losses of   zero   and   $1 million   were reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss into interest expense and other, net on the forward interest rate swaps designated in a hedging relationship during the three and six month periods ended July 2, 2016, respectively. There were no significant reclassifications during the three or six month periods ended July 4, 2015. 
  At July 2, 2016, the Company expects that approximately   $21 million   in losses on the forward interest rate swaps designated in a hedging relationship that will be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss into earnings during the next 4 quarters.

Note 11 Long-Term Debt 
  The following table summarizes the carrying value of the Company s long-term debt (in millions): 

During 2014, the Company entered into a credit agreement which provides for a term loan of   $2.2 billion   and a revolving credit facility of   $250.0 million  . Borrowings under this agreement bear interest at a variable rate plus an applicable margin, subject to an all-in floor of   4.00%  . As of July 2, 2016, the Term Loan interest rate was   4.00%  . Interest payments are payable quarterly. The Company has also entered into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on its long-term debt. The Company is required to make a final scheduled principal payment of   $1.89 billion   due on October 27, 2021. Additionally, the Company may make optional prepayments of the Term Loan, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty. The Company made optional principal prepayments of   $145 million   during the six months ended July 2, 2016. 
  Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a variable rate plus an applicable margin. As of July 2, 2016, the Revolving Credit Facility interest rate was   3.25%  . Interest payments are payable quarterly. As of July 2, 2016, the Company had established letters of credit amounting to   $4 million  , which reduced funds available for other borrowings under the agreement to   $246 million  .  
  On June 2, 2016 (the "Closing Date"), the Company entered into the first amendment to our existing Term Loan credit agreement dated as of October 27, 2014 (the "Refinancing Amendment"). The Refinancing Amendment lowered the index rate spread for LIBOR loans from LIBOR + 400 bp to LIBOR + 325 bp. In accounting for the Refinancing Amendment, the Company applied the provisions of ASC Subtopic 470-50,   Modifications and Extinguishments   ( ASC 470-50 ). The evaluation of the accounting under ASC 470-50 was done on a creditor by creditor basis in order to determine if the terms of the debt were substantially different and, as a result, whether to apply modification or extinguishment accounting. It was determined that the terms of the debt were not substantially different for approximately   96.6%   of the lenders, and applied modification accounting. For the remaining   3.4%   of the lenders, extinguishment accounting was applied. During the three months ended July 2, 2016, the Company recorded a   $2.7 million   charge to interest expense   other, net, primarily related to costs incurred with third parties for arranger, legal and other services and the unamortized fees related to the extinguished debt. Additionally, the Company paid   $4.9 million   to the creditors in exchange for the modification and reported it as a debt discount which is being amortized over the life of the modified debt using the interest method.    
   
  Note 12 Contingencies 
    
  The Company is subject to a variety of investigations, claims, suits and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business, including but not limited to, intellectual property, employment, tort and breach of contract matters. The Company currently believes that the outcomes of such proceedings, individually and in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on its business, cash flows, financial position, or results of operations. Any legal proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties, and the Company's view of these matters and its potential effects may change in the future.   
    
  In connection with the acquisition of the Enterprise business from Motorola Solutions, Inc., the Company acquired Symbol Technologies, Inc., a subsidiary of Motorola Solutions ( Symbol ). A putative federal class action lawsuit,   Waring v. Symbol Technologies, Inc., et al.  , was filed on August 16, 2005 against Symbol Technologies, Inc. and   two   of its former officers in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York by Robert Waring. After the filing of the   Waring   action, several additional purported class actions were filed against Symbol and the same former officers making substantially similar allegations (collectively, the New Class Actions ). The Waring action and the New Class Actions were consolidated for all purposes and on April 26, 2006, the Court appointed the Iron Workers Local # 580 Pension Fund as lead plaintiff and approved its retention of lead counsel on behalf of the putative class. On August 30, 2006, the lead plaintiff filed a Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint (the  Amended Complaint ), and named additional former officers and directors of Symbol as defendants. The lead plaintiff alleges that the defendants misrepresented the effectiveness of Symbol s internal controls and forecasting processes, and that, as a result, all of the defendants violated Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934  
  
   19 

     Table of Contents  

(the  Exchange Act ) and the individual defendants violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. The lead plaintiff alleges that it was damaged by the decline in the price of Symbol s stock following certain purported corrective disclosures and seeks unspecified damages. The court has certified a class of investors that includes those that purchased Symbol common stock between March 12, 2004 and August 1, 2005. The parties have substantially completed fact and expert discovery. However, there are certain discovery motions pending that could, if granted, reopen fact discovery. The court has held in abeyance all other deadlines, including the deadline for the filing of dispositive motions, and has not set a date for trial. One of the insurers in our insurance group has denied insurance coverage and is not agreeing to reimburse defense costs incurred by the Company in connection with this matter. The Company is pursuing the actions it deems necessary and reasonable to obtain reimbursement of its defense costs from the insurer. 
    
  The Company establishes an accrued liability for loss contingencies related to legal matters when the loss is both probable and estimable. In addition, for some matters for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible, an estimate of the amount of loss or range of loss is not possible, and we may be unable to estimate the possible loss or range of losses that could potentially result from the application of non-monetary remedies. Currently, the Company is unable to reasonably estimate the amount of reasonably possible losses for the above mentioned matter. 

Note 13 Loss per Share 
    
  Loss per share were computed as follows (in millions, except share data): 

Anti-dilutive securities consist primarily of stock appreciation rights (SARs) with an exercise price greater than the average market closing price of the Class A common stock. 
  Due to net losses in both the second quarter and first half of 2016 and 2015, options, awards and warrants were anti-dilutive and therefore excluded from the earnings per share calculation. These excluded outstanding options, awards and warrants are as follows: 

Note 14 Share-Based Compensation 
  The Company has share-based compensation and employee stock purchase plans under which shares of the Company s Class A common stock are available for future grants and sales.  
  Pre-tax share-based compensation expense recognized in the statements of operations was   $12 million   and   $18 million   for the six-month periods ended July 2, 2016 and July 4, 2015, respectively. Tax related benefits of   $4 million   and   $6 million   were also recognized for the six-month periods ended July 2, 2016 and July 4, 2015, respectively. 
  
   20 

     Table of Contents  

The fair value of share-based compensation is estimated on the date of grant using a binomial model. Volatility is based on an average of the implied volatility in the open market and the annualized volatility of the Company s stock price over its entire stock history. Stock option grants in the table below include both stock options, all of which were non-qualified, and stock appreciation rights that will be settled in the Class A common stock or cash. Restricted stock grants are valued at the market closing price on the grant date.  
  The following table shows the weighted-average assumptions used for grants of SARs as well as the fair value based on those assumptions:

  As of July 2, 2016, total unearned compensation costs related to the Company s share-based compensation plans was   $61 million   which will be amortized over the weighted average remaining service period of   3.3   years. 
  The fair value of the purchase rights issued to employees under the stock purchase plan is estimated using the following weighted-average assumptions for purchase rights granted. An expected life of   3   months was used to calculate the fair value.

Note 15 Income Taxes (Restated) 
  The Company s effective tax rates for the six month periods ended July 2, 2016 and July 4, 2015 were   1.4%   and   8.4%  , respectively. The Company s effective tax rates differed from the federal statutory rate of   35%   primarily due to the taxation of foreign earnings at lower rates, increases to valuation allowances and discrete items. 

Note 16 Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss 
  Stockholders  equity includes certain items classified as accumulated other comprehensive loss, including: 
             
    Unrealized (loss) gain on anticipated sales hedging transactions   relate to derivative instruments used to hedge the exposure related to currency exchange rates for forecasted Euro sales. These hedges are designated as cash flow hedges, and the Company defers income statement recognition of gains and losses until the hedged transaction occurs. See Note 9 Derivative Instruments. 
                
    Unrealized (loss) gain on forward interest rate swaps hedging transactions   refer to the hedging of the interest rate risk exposure associated with the variable rate commitment entered into for the Acquisition. See Note 9 Derivative Instruments for more details. 
                
    Foreign currency translation adjustment   relates to the Company's non-U.S. subsidiary companies that have designated a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar. The Company is required to translate the subsidiary functional currency financial statements to dollars using a combination of historical, period-end, and average foreign exchange rates. This combination of rates creates the foreign currency translation adjustment component of accumulated other comprehensive income.

Note 17 Segment Information 
  The Company has   2   reportable segments: Legacy Zebra and Enterprise. The operating segments have been identified based on the financial data utilized by the Company's Chief Executive Officer (the chief operating decision maker) to assess segment performance and allocate resources among the Company's segments. The chief operating decision maker uses adjusted operating income to assess segment profitability. Adjusted operating income excludes purchase accounting adjustments, amortization, acquisition, integration and exit and restructuring costs. Segment assets are not reviewed by the Company's chief operating decision maker and therefore are not disclosed below. 
  Financial information by segment is presented as follows (in millions):

Second quarter 2016 compared to second quarter 2015 
    
  The decline in sales in the second quarter compared to the prior year second quarter was primarily a result of lower hardware sales in EMEA and Latin America and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency changes in EMEA, partially offset by growth in hardware sales in Asia-Pacific. The overall decline in hardware sales was primarily due to lower sales volume of barcode printers, wireless LAN, and location solutions. This was partially offset by increased sales of mobile computing and data capture products. On a constant currency basis, overall net sales were comparable to the prior year quarter, reflecting growth of approximately 10% in Asia-Pacific, essentially flat sales in North America, and a decline of approximately 4% in both EMEA and Latin America. 
    
  The improvement in gross margin in the second quarter compared to the year ago period reflects an increase in the Enterprise segment gross margin due primarily to changes in product mix, improved margin on services and reductions in other costs, including prior year rebranding. The Legacy Zebra segment gross margin increased due primarily to improvements in manufacturing and overhead costs for supplies and hardware. 
    
  Operating expenses for the quarter ended July 2, 2016 were $383 million, or 43.6% of net sales, compared to $407 million, or 45.7% of net sales, in the prior year. Selling and marketing expenses were lower in the current quarter as compared to the prior year due to the effects of staff reductions implemented in 2015 and lower promotional expenses. The decrease in research and development costs is primarily due to a reduction in headcount and shifting resources to lower cost engineering locations. The increase in general and administrative costs is primarily attributable to higher professional fees, legal expenses and IT expenses partially offset in part by lower employee benefits costs. Amortization of intangibles declined due to the final adjustments made in 2015 to the fair value of intangibles related to the Acquisition. Following its Acquisition, the Company has moved into the next phase of its IT integration plan wherein Acquisition and integration costs have risen as compared to the prior year quarter which includes winding down the transition services agreement with Motorola Solutions. Exit and restructuring costs were lower due to a reduced level of restructuring activity as the company progresses with its restructuring plan related to the Acquisition.  
    
  Operating income for the quarter ended July 2, 2016 increased $37 million as compared to the prior year, driven by higher gross margin and lower operating expenses, slightly offset by lower sales.

Since the end of the first quarter of 2015, the Company has expanded its balance sheet hedging program to incorporate non-US dollar assets and liabilities associated with the Enterprise segment. This is expected to result in less volatility in the Company s operating results due to changes in foreign currency. 
    
  The current year interest expense and other, net includes approximately $1.5 million of expense related to the loss incurred on the extinguishment of debt resulting from the Company s refinancing of its Term Loan.   
    
  The change in the Company s effective tax rate is due to the reduction of U.S. sourced income and the reduction of discrete expense items. 
    
  Year to date 2016 compared to year to date  2015 
    
  The decline in sales as compared to the prior year period was primarily a result of lower hardware sales in the North America, EMEA and Latin America and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency changes in EMEA, partially offset by higher hardware sales in Asia-Pacific. The overall decline in hardware sales was primarily due to lower sales volume of barcode printer, data capture, and wireless LAN products and location solutions. On a constant currency basis, overall net sales declined approximately 2% compared to the prior year, reflecting growth of approximately 10% in net sales in Asia-Pacific, and a decline of approximately 3%, 1% and 9% in North America, EMEA and Latin America, respectively. 
    
  The improvement in gross margin compared to the year ago period reflects an increase in the Enterprise segment gross margin, due primarily to changes in product mix, improved margin on services, and reductions in other costs, including prior year rebranding. Legacy Zebra segment gross margin increased due primarily to improvements in manufacturing and overhead costs for supplies and hardware. 
    
  Operating expenses for the six months ended July 2, 2016 were $763 million, or 44.2% of net sales, compared to $796 million, or 44.6% of net sales, in the prior year. Selling and marketing expenses were lower for the six months ended July 2, 2016 as compared to the prior year due to the effects of staff reductions implemented in 2015 and lower promotional expenses.  The decrease in research and development costs is primarily due to a reduction in headcount and shifting resources to lower cost engineering locations. The increase in general and administrative costs is primarily due to higher legal expenses, professional fees and IT expenses offset in part by lower employee compensation costs. Amortization of intangibles declined due to the final adjustments made in 2015 to the fair value of intangibles related to the Acquisition.

Exit and restructuring costs were lower due a reduced level of restructuring activity as the company progresses with its restructuring plan related to the Acquisition. 
    
  Operating income for the six months ended July 2, 2016 increased $27 million as compared to the prior year, driven by the increase in gross margin and lower operating expenses being partially offset by the decline in sales. 
    
  Since the end of the first quarter of 2015, the Company has expanded its balance sheet hedging program to incorporate non-US dollar assets and liabilities associated with the Enterprise segment. This is expected to result in less volatility in the Company s operating results due to changes in foreign currency.

Second quarter 2016 compared to second quarter 2015 
    
  The overall sales decline was primarily due to lower sales volume of barcode printers and location solutions as well as the unfavorable impact of foreign currency changes, most notably in EMEA. This was partially offset by a higher volume of supplies. North America, EMEA and Latin America all experienced declines in barcode printer sales. The net sales decline compared to the prior year quarter on a constant currency basis was approximately 3%. This reflects a decline in net sales for the North America, EMEA and Latin America regions partially offset by growth in net sales in Asia-Pacific. 
    
  The increase in gross margin was due primarily to manufacturing cost improvements in supplies and lower hardware overhead costs partially offset by changes in mix and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency changes. 
    
  Operating income for the quarter ended July 2, 2016 decreased 8.1% due to lower sales, partially offset by lower operating expenses.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  As of July 2, 2016, the Company had cash of   $141 million   and long-term debt totaling $2.9 billion and did not have any borrowings against its revolving credit facility with $246 million available ($250 million less $4 million of letters of credit). See Note 11 Long-Term Debt in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details. The primary factors that influence liquidity include, but are not limited to, the amount and timing of revenues, cash collections from customers, cash payments to vendors and capital expenditures. The Company believes that existing capital resources and funds generated from operations are sufficient to meet anticipated capital requirements and to service its indebtedness. The following table summarizes the Company s cash flow activities for the periods indicated (in millions except for percentages): 

The change in the Company s cash and cash equivalents balance as of July 2, 2016 is reflective of the following: 
    
  The increase in cash flows from operations as compared to the prior year was driven by improved inventory management, the extension of payment terms with vendors and lower net operating losses being partially offset by increased loan interest payments, creditor fees as part of the Refinancing Agreement, estimated income tax payments and employee incentive payments.  
    
  The decrease in cash used in investing activities is primarily due to the $49 million paid to MSI as part of the Acquisition, offset by $25 million in proceeds received from sales of investments and marketable securities during 2015 and the $14 million reduction in capital expenditures during 2016. This reduction is primarily due to investments made in IT infrastructure and software applications during 2016 versus the investments made in the Company's corporate office reported in 2015.

     Table of Contents  

The increase in net cash used in financing activities of $23 million over the prior year consisted primarily of the increase in Term Loan repayments of $15 million as well as $8 million of stock activity related to the Company's share-based compensation program.  
  The following table shows the Company s level of long-term debt and other information as of July 2, 2016 (in millions):    

Private Offering 
  On October 15, 2014, the Company completed a private offering of $1.05 billion aggregate principal of 7.25% Senior Notes due October 15, 2022 (the  Senior Notes ). The Senior Notes yielded an effective interest rate of 7.61% at issuance. The Senior Notes are governed by the terms of an indenture, dated as of October 15, 2014, by and among the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee. Interest on the Senior Notes is payable in cash on April 15 and October 15 of each year. 
  The Indenture covering the Senior Notes contains certain restrictive and affirmative covenants. In addition, the Senior Notes are guaranteed jointly and severally, on a senior and unsecured basis, by the Company s direct and indirect wholly-owned existing and future domestic restricted subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions. 
    
  Credit Facilities 
  On October 27, 2014, the Company entered into a new credit agreement which provides for a term loan of $2.2 billion ( Term Loan ) and a revolving credit facility of $250.0 million ( Revolving Credit Facility ). On June 2, 2016 (the "Closing Date"), the Company entered into the first amendment to the credit agreement (the "Refinancing Amendment"). The Refinancing Amendment lowered the index rate spread for LIBOR loans from LIBOR + 400 bp to LIBOR + 325 bp. In accounting for the Refinancing Amendment, the Company applied the provisions of ASC Subtopic 470-50,   Modifications and Extinguishments   ( ASC 470-50 ). The evaluation of the accounting under ASC 470-50 was done on a creditor by creditor basis in order to determine if the terms of the debt were substantially different and, as a result, whether to apply modification or extinguishment accounting. It was determined that the terms of the debt were not substantially different for approximately 96.6% of the lenders, and applied modification accounting. For the remaining 3.4% of the lenders, extinguishment accounting was applied. During the three months ended July 2, 2016, the Company recorded a one-time $2.7 million loss to Interest Expense   Other, net, primarily related to costs incurred with third parties for arranger, legal and other services and the loss incurred on the extinguished debt. Additionally, the Company paid $4.9 million to the creditors in exchange for the modification and reported it as debt discount which is being amortizing over the life of the modified debt using the interest method. Borrowings under the modified Term Loan bear interest at a variable rate plus an applicable margin, subject to an all-in floor of 4.00%. As of July 2, 2016, the Term Loan interest rate was 4.00%. Interest payments are payable quarterly. The Company has entered into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on its long-term debt. 
  The credit agreement requires the Company to prepay the Term Loan and Revolving Credit Facility, under certain circumstances or transactions defined in the credit agreement. Also, the Company may make optional prepayments of the Term Loan, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty. The Company made such optional principal prepayments of   $145 million   in 2016. Unless satisfied by further optional prepayments, the Company is required to make a final scheduled principal payment of   $1.89 billion   due on October 27, 2021. 
  Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at a variable rate plus an applicable margin. As of July 2, 2016, the Revolving Credit Facility interest rate was   3.25%  . Interest payments are payable quarterly. As of July 2, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company did not have any borrowings against the Revolving Credit Facility however, the Company had established letters of credit amounting to   $4 million   and $3 million, respectively, which reduced funds available for other borrowings under the agreement to   $246 million   and $247 million, respectively. 
  The Revolving Credit Facility contains various restrictive and affirmative covenants and is collateralized by a security interest in substantially all of the Company s assets as defined in the security agreement and guaranteed by its direct and indirect wholly-owned existing and future domestic restricted subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions. The Company is in compliance with the covenants as of July 2, 2016.

    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 

There were no material changes in the Company s market risk during the quarter ended July 2, 2016. For additional information on market risk, refer to the  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  section of the Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
  In the normal course of business, portions of the Company s operations are subject to fluctuations in currency values. The Company manages these risks using derivative financial instruments. See Note 9 Derivative Instruments to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report for further discussion of derivative instruments. 
    
  Zebra could be adversely impacted by the United Kingdom s referendum on withdrawal from the European Union.    Zebra maintains its European regional headquarters and a label converting facility in the U.K. and has significant operations and sales throughout Europe.  Because the terms of the U.K. s withdrawal are uncertain, we are unable at this time to determine the impact on Zebra s operations and business in the U.K. and Europe.  The U.K. s referendum has resulted, and is expected to continue to result, in market volatility, including fluctuations in the British Pound, that could adversely impact Zebra s operating costs in the U.K.  Such market volatility could also cause customers to alter or delay buying decisions that would adversely impact Zebra s sales in the U.K. and throughout Europe. A significant portion of our business involves cross border transactions throughout the region. Future trade agreements between the U.K. and the European Union could adversely impact Zebra s operations in the region by increasing costs on or importation requirements on shipments between our distribution center in the Netherlands and customers in the U.K. or between our facility in the U.K. and customers in the European Union. 
   
                 Item 4. 
    Controls and Procedures 

Management s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
  Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting as of July 2, 2016. Based on this assessment, our management believes that, as of July 2, 2016, our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective, due to the identification of a material weakness.  
  A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in the internal controls over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the Company s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.  
  As of the first quarter of 2015, the Company identified a material weakness related to the process to prepare and review its quarterly and annual income tax provision. The material weakness relates to deficiencies in the design and operation of controls in response to the increased complexity in the legal entity structure of the business following the Enterprise acquisition. These deficiencies impacted our ability to accurately forecast pretax income and deferred taxes, by legal entity, in a timely manner.   
  This material weakness has in part resulted in a restatement of the annual financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 and the quarterly financial statements for the three and six months ended July 2, 2016.  
    
  Remediation Plan 
  Management and the Board of Directors are committed to the continued improvement of the Company s overall system of internal controls over financial reporting. With the identification of the material weakness associated with the preparation and review process of our quarterly and annual tax provision in 2015, we began implementing a remediation plan to address these issues. This plan includes the implementation of improved and documented processes and procedures, as well as hiring additional accounting and tax professionals. Since identifying this material weakness, the Company has made substantial progress in executing the remediation plan, including hiring a Vice President of Tax. We believe our actions will be effective in remediating the material weakness, but only after the applicable processes and procedures have been in place for a sufficient period of time is management able to conclude through testing that these controls are effective. Because some of the controls  
  
   33 

     Table of Contents  

are executed only at year-end, we cannot evaluate them for effectiveness until the related processes and procedures are completed and tested. 
  Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting  
  During the quarter covered by this report, other than the changes discussed above and in the next paragraph, there have been no other significant changes in the internal controls that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the internal controls over financial reporting. 
  As of May 1, 2016, we completed the first of two phases of integration of our Enterprise Resource Planning systems for the Asia and Pacific region ("APAC"), migrating many of the region s Enterprise processes and controls onto the Legacy Zebra instance of Oracle. This systems integration focused on our hardware business and included customer order entry and invoicing, inventory procurement and management, accounts payable activity, fixed assets and accounting processes, among other operational processes and related systems. In addition, we have completed the integration of our APAC warehousing, migrating inventory from Penang into our Singapore facility. As part of the systems and warehousing integration, we changed many of the related internal controls primarily by migrating the Enterprise internal controls into the Legacy Zebra internal control structure.   
  Inherent Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls  
  The Company s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that the disclosure controls and procedures or the internal controls over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Controls can also be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of controls effectiveness to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.

    Risk Factors 

In addition to the other information included in this report, you should carefully consider the factors discussed in Part I,  Item 1A. Risk Factors  in the Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended December 31, 2015 and the factors identified under "Safe Harbor" at the end of Item 2 of Part I of the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, which could materially affect our business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. The risks described in the Annual Report are not the only risks facing the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to the Company or that the Company currently considers immaterial also may materially adversely affect its business, financial condition, and/or operating results.  There have been no material changes to the risk factors included in our Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2015, other than the risk entitled  Zebra could be adversely impacted by the United Kingdom s referendum on withdrawal from the European Union  which is described below. 
    
  Zebra could be adversely impacted by the United Kingdom s referendum on withdrawal from the European Union.    Zebra maintains its European regional headquarters and a label converting facility in the U.K. and has significant operations and sales throughout Europe.  Because the terms of the U.K. s withdrawal are uncertain, we are unable at this time to determine the impact on Zebra s operations and business in the U.K. and Europe.  The U.K. s referendum has resulted, and is expected to continue to result, in market volatility, including fluctuations in the British Pound, that could adversely impact Zebra s operating costs in the U.K.  Such market volatility could also cause customers to alter or delay buying decisions that would adversely impact Zebra s sales in the U.K. and throughout Europe. A significant portion of our business involves cross border transactions throughout the region. Future trade agreements between the U.K. and the European Union could adversely impact Zebra s operations in the region by increasing costs on or importation requirements on shipments between our distribution center in the Netherlands and customers in the U.K. or between our facility in the U.K. and customers in the European Union.
