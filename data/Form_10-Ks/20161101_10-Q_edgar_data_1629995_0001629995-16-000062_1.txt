This decreases the noncontrolling interest by the same amount it increases the net parent investment because CPPL's purchase price for its additional   8.4%   interest in Columbia OpCo exceeded book value.

1.    Basis of Accounting Presentation 
  Columbia Pipeline Group, Inc. ("CPG") is a growth-oriented Delaware corporation formed on September 26, 2014 to own, operate and develop a portfolio of pipelines, storage and related midstream assets. CPG owns and operates, through its subsidiaries, approximately   15,000   miles of strategically located interstate gas pipelines extending from New York to the Gulf of Mexico and one of the nation's largest underground natural gas storage systems, with approximately 300 MMDth of working gas capacity, as well as related gathering and processing assets. CPG indirectly owns the general partner of CPPL and all of CPPL's subordinated units and incentive distribution rights. CPG did not have any material assets or liabilities as a separate corporate entity until the contribution of CEG from NiSource on February 11, 2015. 
  CPG is engaged in regulated gas transportation and storage services for LDCs, marketers, producers and industrial and commercial customers located in northeastern, mid-Atlantic, Midwestern and southern states and the District of Columbia along with unregulated businesses such as  midstream services, including gathering, treating, conditioning, processing, compression and liquids handling, and development of mineral rights positions. The regulated services are performed under a tariff at rates subject to FERC approval. 
  Separation.   On June 2, 2015, NiSource announced that its board of directors approved the separation of CPG from NiSource (the "Separation") through the distribution of CPG common stock to holders of NiSource common stock as of June 19, 2015 (the "Record Date"). On July 1, 2015, NiSource distributed, pursuant to an effective registration statement on Form 10,   317.6 million   shares, one share of CPG common stock for every one share of NiSource common stock held by NiSource stockholders on the Record Date. As of July 1, 2015, CPG was an independent, publicly traded company, and NiSource did not retain any ownership interest in CPG. CPG's common stock began trading "regular-way" under the ticker symbol "CPGX" on the NYSE on July 2, 2015. In connection with the Separation, CPG completed the following transactions: 
             
    In May 2015, CPG completed its private placement of senior notes and received proceeds of approximately   $2,722.3 million  . CPG utilized a portion of the proceeds to repay approximately   $1,087.3 million   of intercompany debt and short-term borrowings, including, net amounts due from the money pool between CPG and NiSource Finance Corp. ("NiSource Finance"); 
                
    CPG further utilized the proceeds from the senior notes to make a cash distribution of approximately   $1,450.0 million   to NiSource; and 
                
    Accounts related to NiSource and its subsidiaries, including accounts receivable and accounts payable, were reclassified from affiliated to non-affiliated. 
     Agreements with NiSource following the Separation  . CPG entered into the Separation and Distribution Agreement and several other agreements with NiSource to effect the Separation and provide a framework for CPG's relationship with NiSource, and its subsidiaries, after the Separation. The Separation and Distribution Agreement contains many of the key provisions related to CPG's separation from NiSource and the distribution of CPG's shares of common stock to NiSource's stockholders, including cross-indemnities between CPG and NiSource. In general, NiSource has agreed to indemnify CPG for any liabilities relating to NiSource's business and CPG has agreed to indemnify NiSource for any liabilities relating to CPG's business. In addition to the Separation and Distribution Agreement, CPG entered into the following agreements with NiSource related to the Separation: 
             
    Tax Allocation Agreement - Provides for the respective rights, responsibilities, and obligations of NiSource and CPG with respect to tax liabilities and benefits, tax attributes, the preparation and filing of tax returns, tax contests, and certain other matters regarding taxes. 
                
    Employee Matters Agreement - Provides for the respective obligations to employees and former employees who are or were associated with CPG (including those employees who transferred employment from NiSource to CPG prior to the Separation) and for other employment and employee benefits matters.  
                
    Transition Services Agreement - Provides for the provision of certain transitional services by NiSource to CPG, and vice versa. The services may include the provision of administrative and other services identified by the parties. The charge for these services is expected to be based on actual costs incurred by the party rendering the services without profit. 
     Merger.   On   March 17, 2016  , CPG entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the "Merger Agreement"), among CPG, TCPL, US Parent, Taurus Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of US Parent ("Merger Sub"), and, solely for purposes of Section 3.02, Section 5.02, Section 5.09 and Article VIII of the Merger Agreement, TransCanada. Upon the  
  
   11 

     Table of Contents  
  ITEM 1. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)

  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) (continued) 

terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, effective July 1, 2016, Merger Sub was merged with and into CPG (the "Merger") with CPG surviving the Merger as an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of TransCanada. 
  On   July 1, 2016  , TransCanada closed the acquisition of CPG valued at   $13.0 billion  , comprised of a purchase price of approximately   $10.3 billion   and CPG debt of approximately   $2.7 billion  . CPG became an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of TransCanada as a result of the Merger. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger, each issued and outstanding share of CPG common stock, par value   $0.01   per share, was canceled and converted into the right to receive   $25.50   per share in cash, without interest. Upon completion of the transaction, TransCanada owns the general partner of CPPL, all of CPPL s incentive distribution rights and all of CPPL's subordinated units, which represent a   46.5%   limited partnership interest in CPPL. As a result, CPPL is now effectively managed by TransCanada.  
  For the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , CPG incurred Merger transaction costs of   $43.1 million   and   $66.3 million  , respectively, including legal, advisory and other related fees. These costs are included in "Operation and maintenance" on the Condensed Statements of Consolidated Operations (unaudited). Approximately   $101.5 million   of employee related costs were incurred subsequent to the Merger. Additionally as a result of the Merger, CPG recognized an impairment charge of   $19.1 million   related to the cancellation of IT system upgrades that were in process prior to the Merger. 
  CPG has suspended its obligation to file periodic reports with the SEC based on its common stock as a result of the Merger. CPG will continue to have reporting obligations with respect to its senior notes. Refer to Note 6, "Long-Term Debt" for additional information on CPG's senior notes. 
  The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC. Certain information and note disclosures normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to those rules and regulations, although CPG believes that the disclosures made are adequate to make the information not misleading. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company's audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended   December 31, 2015   (the "2015 Form 10-K"). These financial statements reflect all normal recurring adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary to fairly present CPG's results of operations and financial position. Amounts reported in the Condensed Statements of Consolidated Operations (unaudited) are not necessarily indicative of amounts expected for the respective annual periods. 
  CPG's accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. These financial statements include the accounts of the following subsidiaries: Columbia Gas Transmission, Columbia Gulf, Columbia Midstream, CEVCO, CNS Microwave, Crossroads, CPGSC, CEG, Columbia Remainder Corporation, CPP GP LLC, CPPL, OpCo GP and Columbia OpCo. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. Also included in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) are equity method investments Hardy Storage, Millennium Pipeline and Pennant. 
   
  2.    CPPL Initial Public Offering 
  On December 5, 2007, NiSource formed CPPL (NYSE: CPPL) to own, operate and develop a portfolio of pipelines, storage and related assets. 
  On   February 11, 2015  , CPPL completed its offering of   53.8 million   common units representing limited partner interests, constituting   53.5%   of CPPL's outstanding limited partner interests. CPPL received   $1,168.4 million   of net proceeds from the IPO. CPG owns the general partner of CPPL and all of CPPL's subordinated units and incentive distribution rights. The assets of CPPL consist of a   15.7%   limited partner interest in Columbia OpCo, which prior to the Separation, consisted of substantially all of NiSource's Columbia Pipeline Group Operations segment. The operations of CPPL are consolidated in CPG's results. As of   September 30, 2016  , the portion of CPPL owned by the public is reflected as a noncontrolling interest in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited).

3.    Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  . ASU 2016-15 amends the guidance in ASC 230 on the classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows. CPG is required to adopt ASU 2016-15 for periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods, and the guidance is to be applied retrospectively, with early adoption permitted. CPG is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of ASU 2016-15 will have on the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) or Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited).  
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).   ASU 2014-09 outlines a single, comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance. The core principle of the new standard is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14 to extend the adoption date for ASU 2014-09 to periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods, and the new standard is to be applied retrospectively, with early adoption permitted on the original effective date of ASU 2014-09 on a limited basis. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, which amends the principal-versus-agent implementation guidance and illustrations in ASU 2014-09. Among other things, ASU 2016-08 clarifies that an entity should evaluate whether it is the principal or the agent for each specified good or service promised in a contract with a customer. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10, which clarifies guidance related to identifying performance obligations and licensing implementation guidance contained in ASU 2014-09. In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12, which contains narrow scope improvements for certain aspects of ASU 2014-09 including collectability, presentation of sales tax and other similar taxes collected from customers, noncash consideration, contract modifications and completed contracts at transition and transition technical correction. CPG is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of ASU 2014-09, and the related ASUs, will have on the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) or Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited). 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting (Topic 718)  . ASU 2016-09 simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. CPG is required to adopt ASU 2016-09 for periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods, with early adoption permitted. CPG is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of ASU 2016-09 will have on the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) or Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited). 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842)  . ASU 2016-02 introduces a lessee model that brings most leases on the balance sheet. The new standard also aligns many of the underlying principles of the new lessor model with those in ASC 606, the FASB's new revenue recognition standard (e.g., those related to evaluating when profit can be recognized). Furthermore, ASU 2016-02 addresses other concerns related to the current leases model. For example, ASU 2016-02 eliminates the requirement in current U.S. GAAP for an entity to use bright-line tests in determining lease classification. The standard also requires lessors to increase the transparency of their exposure to changes in value of their residual assets and how they manage that exposure. CPG is required to adopt ASU 2016-02 for periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods, with early adoption permitted. CPG is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of ASU 2016-02 will have on the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) or Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited).

In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03,   Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.   ASU 2015-03 changes the way entities present debt issuance costs in financial statements by presenting issuance costs on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related liability rather than as a deferred charge. Amortization of these costs will continue to be reported as interest expense. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-15 to clarify the SEC staff's position on these costs in relation to line-of-credit agreements stating that the SEC staff would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs related to a line-of-credit arrangement as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of such arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit. CPG adopted ASU 2015-03 and ASU 2015-15 as of January 1, 2016, resulting in the reclassification of unamortized balance of debt issuance costs from "Deferred charges and other" to "Long-term debt." This change in accounting principle was applied retrospectively. As of December 31, 2015, the balance of unamortized debt issuance costs recorded in "Deferred charges and other" was   $20.6 million  . As a result of the retrospective adjustment, the December 31, 2015 balances of "Deferred charges and other" and "Long-term debt" were reduced by   $20.6 million   on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets (unaudited) and Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited). 
  In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02,   Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis  . ASU 2015-02 amends consolidation guidance by including changes to the variable and voting interest models used by entities to evaluate whether an entity should be consolidated. CPG retrospectively adopted ASU 2015-02 as of January 1, 2016. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) or Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited). 
   
  4.    Transactions with Affiliates 
  Transactions with TransCanada 
  Subsequent to the completion of the Merger, CPG engaged in transactions with subsidiaries of TransCanada, which are deemed to be affiliates of CPG. Transactions with affiliates subsequent to the Merger are summarized below: 
  Interest Expense.   CPG was charged interest for short-term borrowings of   $0.5 million   for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. 
  Accounts Receivable  . The affiliated accounts receivable balance of   $40.7 million   due from TransCanada represents amounts allocated to CPG pursuant to TransCanada's tax allocation agreement. 
  Accounts Payable  . The affiliated accounts payable balance of   $9.6 million   primarily includes amounts due for insurance coverage and interest payable to TransCanada.  
  CPG-TransCanada PipeLine USA Ltd. Revolving Credit Facility.   Subsequent to the completion of the Merger, CPG entered into a   $2,000.0 million   revolving credit facility with US Parent. The revolving credit facility became effective as of July 1, 2016, with no termination date. The revolving credit facility is available for general corporate purposes, including capital expenditures. 
  Loans under the revolving credit facility bear interest at CPG s option at either (i) the greatest of (a) the federal funds effective rate plus   0.500 percent  , (b) the reference prime rate as defined by Bloomberg Professional Service or (c) the Eurodollar rate which is based on the one month LIBOR, plus   1.000 percent  , each of which is subject to a margin of   0.250 percent   per annum, or (ii) the Eurodollar rate plus a margin of   1.250 percent   per annum. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , CPG had   $250.0 million   in outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility, with a weighted average interest rate of   1.87%  .  
  Given their maturity and turnover is three months or less, cash flows related to the borrowings and repayments of the revolving credit facilities are presented net in the Condensed Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows (unaudited). 
  Dividends to TransCanada  . During the three months ended September 30, 2016, CPG distributed   $55.5 million   to TransCanada for the dividend of   $0.13875   per share declared on   May 10, 2016  . 
  Transactions with NiSource 
  Prior to the Separation, CPG engaged in transactions with subsidiaries of NiSource, which at that time were deemed to be affiliates of CPG. The Separation occurred on July 1, 2015 and for periods after this date CPG and the subsidiaries of NiSource are no longer affiliates. Transactions with affiliates prior to the Separation are summarized below:

  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) (continued) 

Transportation, Storage and Other Revenues  . CPG provided natural gas transportation, storage and other services to subsidiaries of NiSource, former affiliates. For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , CPG recognized transportation revenues of   $47.5 million  , storage revenues of   $26.2 million   and other revenues of   $0.2 million  . 
  Operation and Maintenance Expense  . CPG received executive, financial, legal, information technology and other administrative and general services from a former affiliate, NiSource Corporate Services. Expenses incurred as a result of these services consisted of employee compensation and benefits, outside services and other expenses. CPG was charged directly or allocated using various allocation methodologies based on a combination of gross fixed assets, total operating expense, number of employees and other measures. Management believes the allocation methodologies are reasonable. However, these allocations and estimates may not represent the amounts that would have been incurred had the services been provided by an outside entity. For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , operation and maintenance expense was   $52.9 million  .  
  Interest Expense and Income  . Prior to the private placement of senior notes on May 22, 2015, CPG paid NiSource interest for intercompany long-term debt outstanding. For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , CPG was charged interest for long-term debt of   $31.0 million  , offset by associated AFUDC of   $2.4 million  . 
  Columbia OpCo and its subsidiaries entered into an intercompany money pool agreement with NiSource Finance, which became effective on the closing date of CPPL's IPO. Following the Separation, the agreement is with CPG. The money pool is available for Columbia OpCo and its subsidiaries' general purposes, including capital expenditures and working capital. This intercompany money pool agreement is discussed in connection with Short-term Borrowings below. Prior to CPPL's IPO, the subsidiaries of CPG participated in a similar money pool agreement with NiSource Finance. Prior to the Separation, NiSource Corporate Services administered the money pools. Prior to the Separation, the cash accounts maintained by the subsidiaries of Columbia OpCo and CPG were swept into a NiSource corporate account on a daily basis, creating an affiliated receivable or decreasing an affiliated payable, as appropriate, between NiSource and the subsidiary. The amount of interest expense and income for short-term borrowings was determined by the net position of each subsidiary in the money pool. Subsequent to the Separation, the intercompany money pool balances and related interest expense and income are eliminated as intercompany activity. The money pool weighted-average interest rate at   September 30, 2015   was   1.21%  . For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , the interest expense for short-term borrowings charged was   $0.7 million  . For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , interest income for short-term borrowings was   $2.5 million  .  
  Dividends to NiSource  . During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , CPG distributed   $500.0 million   of the proceeds from CPPL's IPO to NiSource as a reimbursement of preformation capital expenditures with respect to the assets contributed to Columbia OpCo and   $1,450.0 million   of proceeds related to the issuance of senior notes in May 2015. There were no restrictions on the payment by CPG of dividends to NiSource. 
   
  5.    Short-Term Borrowings 
  CPG Revolving Credit Facility.   As of   December 31, 2015  , CPG had   no   outstanding borrowings and had   $18.1 million   in letters of credit under the revolving credit facility. On July 1, 2016, in connection with the Merger, all existing letters of credit were migrated to a TransCanada credit facility and the CPG revolving credit facility was terminated. As a result, CPG accelerated the amortization of   $4.3 million   of deferred costs associated with the revolving credit facility, which are included in interest expense for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . 
  CPPL Revolving Credit Facility.   As of   December 31, 2015  , CPPL had   $15.0 million   in outstanding borrowings, with a weighted average interest rate of   1.28%  , and issued   no   letters of credit under the revolving credit facility. On June 29, 2016, in anticipation of the Merger, all outstanding borrowings, facility fees and interest were paid in full and the revolving credit facility was terminated. As a result, CPPL accelerated the amortization of   $1.4 million   of deferred costs associated with the revolving credit facility, which are included in interest expense for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  .  
  CPG Commercial Paper Program.   CPG's commercial paper program (the "Program") had a Program limit of up to   $1,000.0 million  . CEG, OpCo GP and Columbia OpCo each agreed, jointly and severally, unconditionally and irrevocably to guarantee payment in full of the principal of and interest (if any) on the promissory notes. As of   December 31, 2015  , CPG had   no   promissory notes outstanding under the Program. On June 30, 2016, in anticipation of the Merger, the Program was terminated. CPG had   no   promissory notes outstanding under the Program at the time of termination. 
  Given their maturity and turnover is three months or less, cash flows related to the borrowings and repayments of the CPG and CPPL revolving credit facilities and the Program are presented net in the Condensed Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows (unaudited).

6.    Long-Term Debt 
  Senior notes issuance.   On   May 22, 2015  , CPG issued a private placement of   $2,750.0 million   in aggregate principal amount of senior notes, comprised of   $500.0 million   of   2.45%   senior notes due 2018 (the "2018 Notes"),   $750.0 million   of   3.30%   senior notes due 2020 (the "2020 Notes"),   $1,000.0 million   of   4.50%   senior notes due 2025 (the "2025 Notes") and   $500.0 million   of   5.80%   senior notes due 2045 (the "2045 Notes" and, together with the 2018 Notes, 2020 Notes and 2025 Notes, the "Notes"). 
  The initial guarantors are three subsidiaries of CPG, CEG, Columbia OpCo and OpCo GP (the "Guarantors"). The Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis by all of the Guarantors. Each guarantee of CPG's obligations under the Notes is a direct, unsecured and unsubordinated obligation of the applicable Guarantor and has the same ranking with respect to indebtedness of that Guarantor as the Notes have with respect to CPG's indebtedness. The guarantees of any Guarantor may be released under certain circumstances.  
  The Notes and the guarantees are (a) unsecured, (b) effectively junior in right of payment to any future secured indebtedness of CPG and the Guarantors, (c) equal in right of payment with any existing and future unsubordinated indebtedness of CPG and the Guarantors and (d) senior in right of payment to any future subordinated indebtedness of CPG and the Guarantors. 
  The 2018 Notes will mature on   June 1, 2018  , the 2020 Notes will mature on   June 1, 2020  , the 2025 Notes will mature on   June 1, 2025   and the 2045 Notes will mature on   June 1, 2045  . Interest on the Notes of each series will be payable semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1. 
  On February 23, 2016, CPG filed an exchange offer registration statement with the SEC. The registration statement was declared effective as of April 14, 2016. 
   
  7.    Gain on Sale of Assets 
  CPG recognizes gains on conveyances of mineral rights positions into earnings as any obligation associated with conveyance is satisfied. For the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , gains on conveyances amounted to   $9.7 million   and   $36.0 million  , respectively, and are included in "Gain on sale of assets" on the Condensed Statements of Consolidated Operations (unaudited). For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , gains on conveyances amounted to   $15.7 million   and   $49.6 million  , respectively, and are included in "Gain on sale of assets" on the Condensed Statements of Consolidated Operations (unaudited). Included in the gains on conveyances is a cash bonus payment of   $9.0 million   and   $35.8 million   received by CEVCO from CNX Gas Company LLC during the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, for the lease of Utica Shale and Upper Devonian gas rights in Greene and Washington Counties in Pennsylvania and Marshall and Ohio Counties in West Virginia. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , deferred gains of approximately   $1.3 million   and   $8.1 million  , respectively, were deferred pending performance of future obligations and recorded within "Deferred revenue," on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets (unaudited). 
   
  8.        Goodwill 
  CPG tests its goodwill for impairment annually as of May 1 unless indicators, events or circumstances would require an immediate review. Goodwill is tested for impairment using financial information at the reporting unit level, referred to as the Columbia Gas Transmission Operations reporting unit, which is consistent with the level of discrete financial information reviewed by management. The Columbia Gas Transmission Operations reporting unit includes the following entities: Columbia Gas Transmission (including its equity method investment in the Millennium Pipeline joint venture), Columbia Gulf and the equity method investment in Hardy Storage. All of CPG's goodwill relates to NiSource's acquisition of CEG in 2000, which was contributed to CPG prior to the Separation. CPG s goodwill assets at   September 30, 2016   were   $1,975.5 million  .  
  CPG's predecessor completed a quantitative ( step 1 ) fair value measurement of the reporting unit during the   May 1, 2012   goodwill test. The test indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit substantially exceeded the carrying value, indicating that no impairment existed. 
  GAAP allows entities testing goodwill for impairment the option of performing a qualitative ( step 0 ) assessment before calculating the fair value of a reporting unit for the goodwill impairment test. If a step 0 assessment is performed, an entity is no longer required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines that, based on that assessment, it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. 
  
   16 

     Table of Contents  
  ITEM 1. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) 
  Columbia Pipeline Group, Inc. 
  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) (continued) 

CPG applied the qualitative step 0 analysis to its reporting unit for the annual impairment test performed as of   May 1, 2016  . For the current year test, CPG assessed various assumptions, events and circumstances that would have affected the estimated fair value of the reporting unit as compared to its base line   May 1, 2012   step 1 fair value measurement. The recent Merger Agreement and acquisition price were incorporated into the current year testing. The results of this assessment indicated that it is not more likely than not that its reporting unit fair value is less than the reporting unit carrying value. 
  CPG considered whether there were any events or changes in circumstances subsequent to the annual test that would reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount and necessitate another goodwill impairment test. In consideration of all relevant factors, there were no indicators that would require a subsequent goodwill impairment test during the   third   quarter of   2016  . 
   
  9.    Asset Retirement Obligations 
  Changes in CPG's liability for asset retirement obligations for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   are presented in the table below: 

CPG's asset retirement obligations above relate to the modernization program of pipelines and transmission facilities, the retiring of offshore facilities, polychlorinated biphenyl ("PCB") remediation and asbestos removal at several compressor and measuring stations. CPG recognizes that certain assets, which include gas pipelines and natural gas storage wells, will operate for an indeterminate future period when properly maintained. A liability for these asset retirement obligations will be recorded only if and when a future retirement obligation with a determinable life is identified. 
   
  10.    Regulatory Matters 
  Columbia Gas Transmission Modernization Program.   In November 2015, Columbia Gas Transmission commenced the fourth year of the Columbia Gas Transmission long-term system modernization program. Columbia Gas Transmission expects to place approximately   $300 million   in modernization investments into service during the year. Recovery of the revenue requirement on approximately   $320 million   of investments made in 2015 began on February 1, 2016.  
  In December 2015, Columbia Gas Transmission filed an extension of this settlement and received the FERC's approval of the customer agreement in March 2016. This extension will allow Columbia Gas Transmission to invest an additional   $1.1 billion   over an additional three-year period through 2020. This agreement also expands the scope of facility investments covered by the program. 
  Columbia Gulf.     On January 21, 2016, the FERC issued an Order (the "January 21 Order") initiating an investigation pursuant to Section 5 of the NGA to determine whether Columbia Gulf's existing rates for jurisdictional services are unjust and unreasonable. Columbia Gulf filed a cost and revenue study with the FERC on April 5, 2016, as required by the January 21 Order. The January 21 Order directed that a hearing be conducted pursuant to an accelerated timeline and that an initial decision be issued by February 28, 2017. On June 13, 2016, the FERC trial staff, Columbia Gulf, and all of the active parties filed a Joint Motion to Suspend the Procedural Schedule and Waive Answer Period (the "Motion"). The Motion represents that the parties unanimously support the Motion and requested waiver of the answer period, which was granted. The parties reached an agreement in principle during a June 2, 2016 settlement conference that would fully resolve all matters set for hearing by the FERC. The Motion represents that the parties expect to file an offer of settlement memorializing the agreement in principle no later than July 29, 2016, and suspension of the procedural schedule will promote an efficient and speedy resolution of this matter by allowing the participants to focus their efforts on drafting the necessary settlement documents. Columbia Gulf filed the offer of settlement with the FERC in accordance with the agreement noted above.

     Table of Contents  
  ITEM 1. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) 
  Columbia Pipeline Group, Inc. 
  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) (continued) 

On August 15, 2016, the administrative law judge issued a Certification of Uncontested Settlement, which noted that no parties objected to the provisions in the offer of settlement. On September 22, 2016, the FERC issued an order approving the uncontested settlement, which requires a reduction in Columbia Gulf s daily maximum recourse rate and addresses Columbia Gulf s treatment of postretirement benefits other than pensions, pension expenses, and regulatory expenses. The order also requires Columbia Gulf to file a general rate case under section 4 of the NGA by January 31, 2020, for rates to take effect by August 1, 2020. Other terms of the settlement are included in FERC Docket No. RP16-302-000. 
  Cost Recovery Trackers and other similar mechanisms.     A significant portion of the transmission and storage regulated companies' revenue is related to the recovery of their operating costs, the review and recovery of which occurs via standard regulatory proceedings with the FERC under Section 4 of the NGA. However, certain operating costs of the Columbia OpCo regulated transmission and storage companies are significant and recurring in nature, such as fuel for compression and lost and unaccounted for gas. The FERC allows for the recovery of such costs via cost tracking mechanisms. These tracking mechanisms allow the transmission and storage companies' rates to fluctuate in response to changes in certain operating costs or conditions as they occur to facilitate the timely recovery of its costs incurred. The tracking mechanisms involve a rate adjustment that is filed at a predetermined frequency, typically annually, with the FERC and is subject to regulatory review before new rates go into effect. Other such costs under regulatory tracking mechanisms include upstream pipeline transmission, electric compression, operational purchases and sales of natural gas, and the revenue requirement for capital investments made under Columbia Gas Transmission's long-term plan to modernize its interstate transmission system as discussed above. 
   
  11.    Equity Method Investments 
  Certain investments of CPG are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. These investments are recorded within "Unconsolidated affiliates" on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets (unaudited) and CPG's portion of the results is reflected in "Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates" on the Condensed Statements of Consolidated Operations (unaudited). These investments are integral to CPG's business. Contributions are made to these equity investees to fund CPG's share of capital projects. 
  The following table contains contribution and distribution data representing CPG's portion based on CPG's ownership percentage of each investment: 

During the third quarter of 2015, an additional member joined the Pennant joint venture. The member's initial ownership investment in Pennant is   5.00%  , and by funding specified, disproportionate investment amounts for future growth projects, the member can invest directly in the growth of Pennant. Such funding will potentially increase the member's ownership in Pennant up to   33.33%   over a defined investment period. As a result of the buy-in, Columbia Midstream received   $12.7 million   in cash and recorded a gain of   $2.9 million  , and its ownership interest in Pennant decreased from   50.00%   to   47.50%  . 
   
  12.    Income Taxes 
  CPG's interim effective tax rates reflect the estimated annual effective tax rates for   2016   and   2015  , adjusted for tax expense associated with certain discrete items. The effective tax rates for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were   30.3%   and   33.8%  , respectively. The annual effective tax rate was adjusted in the third quarter of 2016 to reflect the impact of the Merger.  
  
   18 

     Table of Contents  
  ITEM 1. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) 
  Columbia Pipeline Group, Inc. 
  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) (continued) 

Refer to Note 1, "Basis of Accounting Presentation" for additional information on the Merger. The effective tax rates for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   were   33.5%   and   33.9%  , respectively. The effective tax rates for   2016   and   2015   differ from the Federal tax rate of   35%   primarily due to the effects of tax credits, state income taxes, utility rate-making, other permanent book-to-tax differences and income received following CPPL's IPO that is not subject to income tax at the partnership level. The effective tax rate is impacted by CPPL's IPO, which modified the ownership structure and now reflects CPPL earnings for which the noncontrolling public limited partners are directly responsible for the related income taxes. CPG consolidates the pre-tax income related to the noncontrolling public limited partners  share of partnership earnings but excludes the related tax provision. 
  Subsequent to the Merger, CPG is party to a Federal tax allocation agreement with US Parent and as a result will be included in the consolidated Federal income tax return filed by US Parent. The tax allocation arrangement allocates to CPG an amount of Federal income tax liabilities and benefits similar to that which would be if CPG had filed a separate return. For states that require consolidated or combined returns, CPG will be included with certain TransCanada affiliates and will settle its state income tax liabilities and benefits with US Parent.  
   
  13.    Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits 
  CPG provides defined contribution plans and noncontributory defined benefit retirement plans that cover its employees. Benefits under the defined benefit retirement plans reflect the employees' compensation, years of service and age at retirement. Additionally, CPG provides health care and life insurance benefits for certain retired employees. The majority of employees may become eligible for these benefits if they reach retirement age while working for CPG. The expected cost of such benefits is accrued during the employees' years of service. Current rates charged to customers of CPG include postretirement benefit costs. Cash contributions are remitted to trusts, including a grantor trust used to fund benefits of the CPG non-qualified defined benefit plan. 
  Prior to the Separation, CPG was a participant in the consolidated NiSource defined benefit retirement plans and was allocated a ratable portion of NiSource's trusts for the plans in which its employees and retirees participated. As a result, CPG followed multiple employer accounting under the provisions of GAAP. CPG continues to follow multiple employer accounting following the Separation. 
  For the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , CPG has made   no   contributions to its pension plans and contributed   $1.6 million   to its other postretirement benefit plans.

As of July 1, 2016, the CPG pension and other postretirement benefit plans were remeasured as a result of the acquisition by TransCanada. The remeasurement resulted in a decrease to the pension benefit obligation, net of plan assets, of   $4.9 million  , and a decrease to regulatory assets and accumulated other comprehensive loss of   $1.2 million   and   $0.3 million  , respectively. Net periodic pension cost for the remainder of 2016 increased by   $0.9 million   as a result of the remeasurement. A settlement charge of   $2.6 million   was recorded as a result of the non-qualified pension plan being terminated in connection with the Merger. 
  The other postretirement benefits obligation, net of plan assets, decreased by   $11.2 million   as a result of the remeasurement. Additionally, the remeasurement resulted in an increase to regulatory assets of   $8.6 million  , a decrease to regulatory liabilities of   $1.8 million   and a decrease to accumulated other comprehensive loss of   $0.5 million  . Net periodic other postretirement benefit cost for the remainder of 2016 increased by   $1.1 million   as a result of the remeasurement.  
  The following table provides the key assumptions that were used to calculate the pension and other postretirement benefit obligation and the net periodic benefit cost at the measurement dates of July 1, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

14.    Fair Value 
  CPG has certain financial instruments that are not measured at fair value on a recurring basis but nevertheless are recorded at amounts that approximate fair value due to their liquid or short-term nature, including cash and cash equivalents, customer deposits and short-term borrowings. CPG's long-term debt is recorded at historical amounts. 
  The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate fair value. 
  Long-term debt.   The fair value of these securities is estimated based on the quoted market prices for similar issues or on the rates offered for securities of the same remaining maturities. These fair value measurements are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , there were no changes in the method or significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the financial instruments. 
  The carrying amount and estimated fair values of financial instruments were as follows:    
   
  (1)   The carrying amount of the Notes differs from the Long-term debt balance on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets (unaudited) due to the related unamortized discount and unamortized debt issuance costs, both of which are being amortized over the weighted average life of the Notes.

    Share-Based Compensation 
     Merger.   On July 1, 2016, at the effective time of the Merger, each outstanding restricted stock unit, performance share and phantom unit, whether or not vested, was deemed to be fully vested (in the case of performance shares, based on performance deemed satisfied at the greater of actual performance for the relevant period and the target level of 100%), canceled and converted into the

right of the holder to receive   $25.50   in cash, without interest, in respect of each share of CPG common stock underlying such award. 
  CPG recognized stock-based employee compensation expense of   $56.3 million   and   $0.1 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, as well as related tax benefits of   $18.8 million   and   zero  , respectively. For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , CPG recognized stock-based employee compensation expense of   $63.9 million   and   $3.2 million  , respectively, as well as related tax benefits of   $21.5 million   and   $1.2 million  , respectively. 
  Restricted Stock Units and Restricted Stock  . During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , CPG granted   12,144   restricted stock units and shares of restricted stock, subject to service conditions. The total grant date fair-value of the shares of restricted stock units and shares of restricted stock was   $0.2 million  . There are   no   restricted stock units or shares of restricted stock outstanding following the effective time of the Merger. 
  Performance Shares  . During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , CPG granted   955,848   performance shares, subject to performance and service conditions. The grant date fair-value of the awards was   $17.0 million  . There are   no   performance shares outstanding following the effective time of the Merger.  
  Non-employee Director Awards  . Restricted stock units were granted annually to non-employee directors, subject to a non-employee director's election to defer receipt of such restricted stock unit award. The non-employee director's restricted stock units would vest on the first anniversary of the grant thereof subject to special pro-rata vesting rules in the event of Retirement or Disability (as defined in the award agreement), or death. The vested restricted stock units were payable as soon as practicable following vesting except as otherwise provided pursuant to the non-employee director's election to defer. There are   no   units outstanding to non-employee directors following the effective time of the Merger. 
  Fully vested restricted stock units that remained outstanding under the NiSource Plan and NiSource Director Plan as of the Separation date were converted into CPG awards. All such awards were distributed to the directors upon their separation from CPG's board of directors. There are   no   restricted stock units outstanding following the effective time of the Merger. 
  401(k) Match, Profit Sharing and Company Contribution.   CPG has a voluntary 401(k) savings plan covering eligible employees that allows for periodic discretionary matches as a percentage of each participant's contributions. CPG also has a retirement savings plan that provides for discretionary profit sharing contributions to eligible employees based on earnings results; and eligible exempt employees hired after January 1, 2013, receive a non-elective company contribution of three percent of eligible pay. For the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , CPG recognized 401(k) match, profit sharing and non-elective contribution expense of   $3.0 million   and   $2.2 million  , respectively. For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , CPG recognized 401(k) match, profit sharing and non-elective contribution expense of   $9.2 million   and   $6.6 million  , respectively. 
   
  16.    Other Commitments and Contingencies 
  A.    Guarantees and Indemnities.   In the normal course of its business, CPG and certain subsidiaries enter into various agreements providing financial or performance assurance to third parties on behalf of certain subsidiaries. Such agreements include guarantees and stand-by letters of credit. These agreements are entered into primarily to support or enhance the creditworthiness otherwise attributed to a parent or subsidiary on a stand-alone basis, thereby facilitating the extension of sufficient credit to accomplish the parent or subsidiaries' intended commercial purposes. The total guarantees and indemnities in existence at   September 30, 2016   and the years in which they expire were: 

22 

     Table of Contents  
  ITEM 1. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) 
  Columbia Pipeline Group, Inc. 
  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) (continued) 

Guarantees of Debt.   Certain of CPG's subsidiaries, including OpCo GP, Columbia OpCo and CEG have guaranteed payment of   $2,750.0 million   in aggregated principal amount of CPG's senior notes. Each guarantor of CPG's obligations is required to comply with covenants under the debt indenture and in the event of default the guarantors would be obligated to pay the debt's principal and related interest. CPG does not anticipate its subsidiaries will have any difficulty maintaining compliance. 
  Lines and Letters of Credit.   CPG maintained a   $1,500.0 million   senior revolving credit facility, of which   $250.0 million   in letters of credit was available. On July 1, 2016, in connection with the Merger, all existing letters of credit were migrated to a TransCanada credit facility and the CPG revolving credit facility was terminated. CPPL maintained a   $500.0 million   senior revolving credit facility, of which   $50.0 million   was available for issuance of letters of credit. On June 29, 2016, in anticipation of the Merger, all outstanding borrowings, facility fees and interest were paid in full and the revolving credit facility was terminated. 
  CPG's commercial paper program had a Program limit of up to   $1,000.0 million  . CEG, OpCo GP and Columbia OpCo each agreed, jointly and severally, unconditionally and irrevocably to guarantee payment in full of the principal of and interest (if any) on the promissory notes. On June 30, 2016, in anticipation of the Merger, the Program was terminated. CPG had   no   promissory notes outstanding under the Program at the time of termination. 
  Other Guarantees or Obligations.   CPG has purchase and sale agreement guarantees totaling   $45.3 million  , which guarantee purchaser performance or seller performance under covenants, obligations, liabilities, representations or warranties under the agreements. No amounts related to the purchase and sale agreement guarantees are reflected in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets (unaudited). Management believes that the likelihood CPG would be required to perform or otherwise incur any significant losses associated with any of the aforementioned guarantees is remote. 
  B.    Other Legal Proceedings.   In the normal course of its business, CPG has been named as a defendant in various legal proceedings. In the opinion of CPG, the ultimate disposition of these currently asserted claims will not have a material impact on CPG's condensed consolidated financial statements. Please see Item 1 of Part II, Legal Proceedings, for more information. 
  Litigation Relating to the Merger.     On March 30, 2016, two purported stockholders of CPG filed an action challenging the Merger on behalf of a putative class of CPG stockholders in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, captioned   Vann   v.   Columbia Pipeline Group, Inc.  ,   et al  . The action names as defendants CPG, the members of the Board, Parent, US Parent, Merger Sub and TransCanada. On April 7, 2016, a second, substantially identical action was filed in the same court on behalf of the same putative class, captioned   Baldino   v.   Skaggs, Jr., et al.  , and naming as defendants only the members of the Board. On May 25, 2016, the Delaware Court of Chancery entered an order that, among other things, consolidated the actions into a single action, captioned as   In re Columbia Pipeline Group, Inc. Stockholder Litigation  , and appointed the   Vann   plaintiffs as lead plaintiffs and the   Vann   plaintiffs  counsel as lead counsel. The   Vann   plaintiffs  amended complaint, filed May 12, 2016, alleges that members of the CPG Board breached their fiduciary duties by, among other things, agreeing to the Merger following an inadequate sale process and at an unfair price, and because the sale process purportedly was affected by conflicts of interest on the part of the Board, the management of CPG and/or CPG s largest stockholder as a result of their substantial stockholdings in CPG, and on the part of one of CPG s financial advisors as a result of its alleged holdings in TransCanada stock. The amended complaint also alleges that the preliminary proxy filed in respect of the Merger omits or misstates various facts concerning, among other things, the sale process and the financial analyses performed by CPG s financial advisors. The amended complaint purports to seek injunctive and other equitable relief regarding the Merger. On July 5, 2016, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the action and a motion to stay discovery pending resolution of the motion to dismiss. Both motions remain pending. On July 18, 2016, Vice Chancellor Laster entered the briefing schedule deferring briefing on the motion to dismiss until the motion to stay is resolved. On September 6, 2016, Vice Chancellor Laster granted TransCanada and CPG s motion to stay discovery while the motion to dismiss was pending.  On October 6, 2016, the   Vann   plaintiffs filed an amended claim which removed all TransCanada parties, limiting the action to the CPG Board and CFO. Its revised claim alleges that the Board and officers entered into a secret scheme to benefit directors and insiders via change in control benefits and payments originating when NiSource first spun off the Columbia assets. They continue their allegations that conflict of interest tainted the acquisition, the acquisition undervalued CPG and that the proxy statement was materially deficient. The new claim seeks rescissory damages in an amount to be proven at trial and disgorgement of profits from the sale. At this early stage of the litigation, no outcome or possible loss or range of losses, if any, arising from the litigation is able to be estimated. 
  C.    Environmental Matters.   CPG's operations are subject to environmental statutes and regulations related to air quality, water quality, hazardous waste and solid waste. CPG believes that it is in substantial compliance with those environmental regulations currently applicable to its operations and believes that it has all necessary material permits to conduct its operations. 
  
   23 

     Table of Contents  
  ITEM 1. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued) 
  Columbia Pipeline Group, Inc. 
  Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) (continued) 

It is CPG's continued intent to address environmental issues in cooperation with regulatory authorities in such a manner as to achieve mutually acceptable compliance plans. However, there can be no assurance that CPG will not incur fines and penalties.  
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , CPG had liabilities recorded of approximately   $8.0 million   and   $8.3 million  , respectively, to cover environmental remediation at various sites. The current portion of these liabilities is included in "Other accruals" in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets (unaudited). The noncurrent portion is included in "Other noncurrent liabilities" in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets (unaudited). CPG accrues for costs associated with environmental remediation obligations when the incurrence of such costs is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated. The original estimates for cleanup can differ materially from the amount ultimately expended. The actual future expenditures depend on many factors, including currently enacted laws and regulations, the nature and extent of contamination, the method of cleanup, and the availability of cost recovery from customers. As of the date of these financial statements, these expenditures are not estimable at some sites. CPG periodically adjusts its accrual as information is collected and estimates become more refined. 
  Air 
  The CAA and comparable state laws regulate emissions of air pollutants from various industrial sources, including compressor stations, and also impose various monitoring and reporting requirements. Such laws and regulations may require pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce air emissions or result in an increase of existing air emissions; application for, and strict compliance with, air permits containing various emissions and operational limitations; or the utilization of specific emission control technologies to limit emissions. The actions listed below could require further reductions in emissions from various emission sources. CPG will continue to closely monitor developments in these matters. 
  National Ambient Air Quality Standards  .     The federal CAA requires the EPA to set NAAQS for particulate matter and five other pollutants considered harmful to public health and the environment. Periodically, the EPA imposes new or modifies existing NAAQS. States that contain areas that do not meet the new or revised standards must take steps to maintain or achieve compliance with the standards. These steps could include additional pollution controls on boilers, engines, turbines, and other facilities owned by gas transmission operations. 
  The following NAAQS were recently added or modified: 
  Ozone  : On October 1, 2015, the EPA issued a final rule lowering the NAAQS for ground-level ozone to   70 ppb   under both the primary and secondary standards to provide requisite protection of public health and welfare, respectively. The EPA is required to include an adequate margin of safety in establishing the primary ozone standard for protection of public health, whereas the secondary ozone standard is intended to improve protection for trees, plants and ecosystems. The final rule becomes effective sixty days after the rule is published in the Federal Register. The EPA is required to make attainment and non-attainment designations for specific geographic locations under the revised standards by October 1, 2017 and, depending on the severity of the ozone present, non-attainment areas will have until between 2020 and 2037 to meet the health standard. With the EPA lowering the ground-level ozone standard, states may be required to implement more stringent regulations. Based on the current version of the rule, CPG does not expect a material impact on its operations. 
  Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2)  : The EPA revised the NO2 NAAQS by adding a one-hour standard while retaining the annual standard. The new standard could impact some CPG combustion sources. The EPA designated all areas of the country as unclassifiable/attainment in January 2012. After the establishment of a new monitoring network and possible modeling implementation, areas will potentially be re-designated sometime in 2016. States with areas that do not meet the standard will be required to develop rules to bring areas into compliance within five years of designation. Additionally, under certain permitting circumstances, emissions from some existing CPG combustion sources may need to be assessed and mitigated. CPG will continue to monitor this matter and cannot estimate the impact of these rules at this time. 
  Climate Change.   Future legislative and regulatory programs could significantly restrict emissions of greenhouse gases including methane. 
  New Source Performance Standards  : On May 12, 2016, the EPA finalized the rule to regulate fugitive methane emissions for compressor stations in the natural gas transmission and storage sector. The final rule was subsequently published in the Federal Register on June 3, 2016. CPG is working with industry groups to litigate and clarify ambiguities within the rule. CPG does not have any existing sites that will be impacted by this rule. However, the EPA has announced that it intends to propose additional regulations related to the emission of methane from existing sources in the oil and natural gas sector.

Pipeline Safety 
  On March 17, 2016, the federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration ("PHMSA") announced a proposed rulemaking that would, if adopted, impose more stringent requirements for certain gas lines and gathering lines under varying circumstances. Among other things, the proposed rulemaking would extend certain of PHMSA's current regulatory safety programs for gas pipelines beyond "high consequence areas" to cover gas pipelines found in newly defined "moderate consequence areas" that contain as few as   5   dwellings within the potential impact area; require gas pipelines installed before 1970 that are currently exempted from certain pressure testing obligations to be tested to determine their maximum allowable operating pressures ("MAOP"); and require gathering lines in Class I areas, both onshore and offshore, to comply with standards regarding damage prevention, corrosion control (for metallic pipe), public education, MAOP limits, line markers and emergency planning if such gathering lines' nominal design is   8   inches or more. In order to provide clarity and greater certainty on what may constitute a "gathering line," PHMSA is proposing a new definition of that term under the rulemaking, which term would now encompass "a pipeline, or a connected series of pipelines, and equipment used to collect gas from the endpoint of a production facility/operation and transport it to the furthermost point downstream of the following endpoints" including the "inlet of 1   st    gas processing plant;" the "outlet of" a gas treatment facility (not associated with a processing plant or compressor station); the "[o]utlet of the furthermost downstream compressor" leading to a pipeline, or the "point where separate production fields are commingled." Other new requirements proposed by PHMSA under the rulemaking would require pipeline operators to: report to PHMSA in the event of certain MAOP exceedances; strengthen PHMSA integrity management requirements; consider seismicity in evaluating threats to a pipeline; conduct hydrostatic testing for all pipeline segments manufactured using longitudinal seam welds; and use more detailed guidance from PHMSA in the selection of assessment methods to inspect pipelines. CPG will continue to monitor this matter and cannot estimate the impact of these rules at this time. 
  On June 22, 2016, President Obama signed new pipeline safety legislation, the  Protecting our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety Act of 2016" (the  PIPES Act ). Extending PHMSA s statutory mandate through 2019, the PIPES Act establishes or continues the development of stringent requirements affecting pipeline safety including: (i) providing PHMSA with additional authority to address imminent hazards by imposing emergency restrictions, prohibitions and safety measures on owners and operators of gas or hazardous liquid pipeline facilities without prior notice or an opportunity for a hearing; (ii) having pipeline operators that experience a spill from a liquids pipeline provide safety data sheets for the spilled liquid to the on-scene coordinator predesignated by the EPA and state and local officials within six hours of a telephonic notice; (iii) obligating PHMSA to develop safety standards for natural gas storage facilities by June 22, 2018; (iv) obligating PHMSA to provide feedback to pipeline operators after an inspection, including a briefing within thirty days and a written report with written preliminary findings within ninety days to the extent practicable; (v) requiring annual internal inspection of certain underwater hazardous liquid pipeline facilities in high consequence areas located at depths greater than   150   feet under the surface of the water; and (vi) requiring PHMSA to complete certain of the outstanding mandates under existing legislation and to report to Congress on the status of overdue rulemakings. CPG will continue to monitor this matter and cannot estimate the impact of these rules at this time. 
  On October 3, 2016, PHMSA announced a temporary rule authorizing the agency to issue Emergency Orders to address what it deems imminent safety hazards for both liquid and gas pipes. The new rule allows PHMSA to impose restrictions, prohibitions, and require safety measures without giving operators prior notice or an opportunity for a hearing. In contrast to PHMSA s past practice of issuing Corrective Action Orders to an individual owner, operator, or facility, under the new rule PHMSA can issue an Emergency Order for numerous entities. PHMSA has until March 19, 2017 to issue a permanent final rule, when this temporary rule expires. CPG will continue to monitor this matter and cannot estimate the impact of these rules at this time. 
  Waste 
  CPG has liabilities associated with the cleanup of various former operations. Four sites are associated with its former propane operations and ten sites associated with former petroleum operations. The total liability related to these sites was   $6.3 million   and   $6.5 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The liability represents CPG's best estimate of the cost to remediate the facilities. 
  CPG has liabilities associated with the remaining PCB remediation of its existing facilities. The total liability related to these sites was   $1.7 million   and   $1.8 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The liability represents CPG's best estimate of the cost to remediate the facilities.

   (2)   Includes amounts allocated to noncontrolling interest. 
  Equity Investment 
  Millennium Pipeline is an equity method investment, and, therefore, CPG is required to recognize a proportional share of Millennium Pipeline s OCI. The remaining unrecognized loss at   September 30, 2016   of   $13.4 million  , after tax, related to terminated interest rate swaps is being amortized over a   15   year period ending   June 2025   into earnings using the effective interest method through interest expense as interest payments are made by Millennium Pipeline. The unrecognized loss of   $13.4 million   and   $14.3 million  , after tax, at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, is included in gains and losses on cash flow hedges above.

20.    Concentration of Credit Risk 
  Columbia Gas of Ohio, an affiliated party prior to the Separation, accounted for greater than   10% of total operating revenues   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  . The following tables provide this customer's operating revenues and percentage of total operating revenues for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 
   
  (1)   Represents the gross amount of revenue contracted for with Columbia Gas of Ohio and, therefore, subject to risk at the loss of this customer. Columbia Gas of Ohio has entered into certain capacity release arrangements with third parties which ultimately can decrease the net revenue amount CPG receives from Columbia Gas of Ohio in any given period. 
  The loss of a significant portion of operating revenues from this customer could have a material adverse effect on the business of CPG.

22.     Subsequent Event 
  Proposed Acquisition.   On   November 1, 2016  , CPPL announced that it had entered into an agreement and plan of merger with CPG, Pony Merger Sub LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of CPG ( Pony Merger Sub ) and MLP GP. 
  The conflicts committee of the board of directors of MLP GP (the  GP Conflicts Committee ) and the board of directors of the MLP GP (the "GP Board") approved the merger agreement and transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and determined that the merger agreement and the merger transactions are fair and reasonable to and in the best interests of CPPL and to the holders of CPPL common units unaffiliated with CPG, CEG and MLP GP (collectively, the  CPPL unaffiliated unitholders ). The GP Conflicts Committee recommended the GP Board approve the merger agreement and the merger transactions. The GP Board resolved that the merger agreement and the merger transactions be submitted to the unitholders of CPPL at a special meeting of the unitholders for approval. The GP Board recommended that the unitholders of CPPL vote in favor of the proposal to approve the merger agreement and the merger transactions at the special meeting of the unitholders. 
  CPG indirectly owns, through its ownership of CEG,   100.0%   of the membership interests in MLP GP. CEG owns all of the subordinated units ( CPPL subordinated units ) representing a   46.5%   limited partner interest in CPPL. Pursuant to the merger agreement, Pony Merger Sub will merge with and into CPPL at the effective time of the merger, with CPPL surviving, such that following the merger, MLP GP will remain a wholly owned subsidiary of CPG and the sole general partner of CPPL, and CPG and CEG will be the only limited partners of CPPL. Each CPPL common unit issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to  the effective time of the merger will be converted into the right to receive (i) $  17.00   per CPPL common unit in cash without any interest thereon plus (ii) an additional amount of cash per CPPL common unit without any interest thereon equal to the product of (x) the number of days from and including the first day of the quarter in which the closing occurs through and including the closing date multiplied by (y) $  0.00217   per CPPL common Unit (a daily distribution rate equal to the quotient of $  0.1975   divided by ninety-one (  91  )), plus (iii) an amount equal to $  0.1975   per CPPL common unit in cash without any interest thereon if the record date for the CPPL s quarterly cash distribution with respect to the quarter immediately preceding the quarter in which the closing occurs shall not have occurred prior to the effective time of the merger (the "Merger Consideration"). Incentive distribution rights of CPPL, which are owned by CEG, will be unchanged and remain outstanding as incentive distribution rights of the surviving entity, and no consideration will be delivered in respect thereof. CPPL subordinated units, which are owned by CEG, will also be unchanged and remain outstanding as CPPL subordinated units of the surviving entity, and no consideration will be delivered in respect thereof. CPG will be issued CPPL common units at the effective time of the merger equal to the number of public common units being converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. The parties anticipate that the merger will close in the first quarter of 2017 and that CPPL will pay the regular quarterly cash distributions to unitholders at the quarterly per unit distribution rate of   $0.1975  , with the declaration date and record date for each quarterly distribution to occur no later than 30 days and 42 days, respectively, after the end of each fiscal quarter. 
  Completion of the merger is conditioned upon, among other things: (1) approval of the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger, by the affirmative vote or consent of holders, as of the record date of the special meeting of CPPL s unitholders (including CEG), of (a) a majority of the outstanding CPPL common units, voting as a class, (b) a majority of the CPPL common units held by the CPPL unaffiliated unitholders, and (c) a majority of the outstanding CPPL subordinated units, voting as a class; (2) all required filings, consents, approvals, permits and authorizations in connection with the merger having been made or obtained; and (3) the absence of legal injunctions or impediments prohibiting the merger transactions. 
  Pursuant to the merger agreement, CEG delivered a consent to voting the CPPL subordinated units owned beneficially or of record by it or any of its subsidiaries in favor of the merger proposal, including the   46,811,398   CPPL subordinated units currently held by CEG, which units represent   100.0%   of the outstanding CPPL subordinated units. 
  The merger agreement contains provisions granting both CPPL and CPG the right to terminate the merger Agreement for certain reasons, including, among others, if: (1) the merger is not completed on or before August 1, 2017; (2) any governmental authority has issued a final and nonappealable statute, rule, order, decree or regulation enjoining or prohibiting consummation of the merger; (3) under certain conditions, there has been a material breach of any of the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in the merger agreement by a party to the merger agreement which is not cured within 30 days following receipt by the breaching party of written notice from the non-breaching party (a  terminable breach  (4) CPPL does not obtain the requisite unitholder approval of the merger agreement and the merger transactions at a special meeting of unitholders; or (5) either the GP Board, in accordance with the merger agreement, withdraws, modifies or qualifies, or proposes to publicly withdraw, modify or

  All costs and expenses incurred in connection with the merger agreement and the merger transactions will be paid by the party incurring such costs and expenses, except that (1) CPG and CPPL shall each bear and pay one half of the expenses incurred in connection with the proxy statement and Schedule 13E-3 filings, (2) if (a) CPG terminates the merger agreement due to a CPPL Change in Recommendation, (b) either party terminates the merger agreement due to the failure to obtain the requisite unitholder approval of the merger agreement and the merger transactions at a special meeting of unitholders of CPPL and prior to such special meeting, a CPPL Change in Recommendation has occurred, or if CPG terminates the merger agreement due to a terminable breach by CPPL, CPPL will pay the expenses incurred by CPG up to a maximum of   $10.0 million  , and (3) if CPPL terminates the merger agreement due to a terminable breach by CPG, CPG will pay the expenses incurred by CPPL.

  Separation 
  On June 2, 2015, NiSource announced that its board of directors approved the separation of CPG from NiSource (the  Separation ) through the distribution of CPG common stock to holders of NiSource common stock as of June 19, 2015 (the  Record Date ). On July 1, 2015, NiSource distributed, pursuant to an effective registration statement on Form 10, 317.6 million shares, one share of CPG common stock for every one share of NiSource common stock held by NiSource stockholders on the Record Date. As of July 1, 2015, CPG was an independent, publicly traded company, and NiSource did not retain any ownership interest in CPG. CPG's common stock began trading "regular-way" under the ticker symbol "CPGX" on the NYSE on July 2, 2015. 
  Merger 
  On March 17, 2016, CPG entered into a Merger Agreement, among CPG, Parent, US Parent, Merger Sub, and, solely for purposes of Section 3.02, Section 5.02, Section 5.09 and Article VIII of the Merger Agreement, TransCanada. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, effective July 1, 2016, Merger Sub was merged with and into CPG (the  Merger ) with CPG surviving the Merger as an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of TransCanada. 
  On   July 1, 2016  , TransCanada closed the acquisition of CPG valued at   $13.0 billion  , comprised of a purchase price of approximately   $10.3 billion   and CPG debt of approximately   $2.7 billion  . CPG became an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of TransCanada as a result of the Merger. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger, each issued and outstanding share of CPG common stock, par value   $0.01   per share, was canceled and converted into the right to receive   $25.50   per share in cash, without interest. Upon completion of the transaction, TransCanada owns the general partner of CPPL, all of CPPL s incentive distribution rights and all of CPPL s subordinated units, which represent a   46.5%   limited partnership interest in CPPL. As a result, CPPL is now effectively managed by TransCanada. 
  CPG has suspended its obligation to file periodic reports with the SEC based on its common stock as a result of the Merger. CPG will continue to have reporting obligations with respect to its senior notes. Refer to Note 6, "Long-Term Debt" for additional information. 
  Proposed Acquisition 
  On November 1, 2016, CPPL announced that it had entered into an agreement and plan of merger with CPG, Pony Merger Sub LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of CPG ( Pony Merger Sub ) and MLP GP. 
  The conflicts committee of the board of directors of MLP GP (the  GP Conflicts Committee ) and the board of directors of the MLP GP (the "GP Board") approved the merger agreement and transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and determined that the merger agreement and the merger transactions are fair and reasonable to and in the best interests of CPPL and to the holders  
  
   44

of CPPL common units unaffiliated with CPG, CEG and MLP GP (collectively, the  CPPL unaffiliated unitholders ). The GP Conflicts Committee recommended the GP Board approve the merger agreement and the merger transactions. The GP Board resolved that the merger agreement and the merger transactions be submitted to the unitholders of CPPL at a special meeting of the unitholders for approval. The GP Board recommended that the unitholders of CPPL vote in favor of the proposal to approve the merger agreement and the merger transactions at the special meeting of the unitholders. 
  CPG indirectly owns, through its ownership of CEG, 100% of the membership interests in MLP GP. CEG owns all of the subordinated units ( CPPL subordinated units ) representing a 46.5% limited partner interest in CPPL. Pursuant to the merger agreement, Pony Merger Sub will merge with and into CPPL at the effective time of the merger, with CPPL surviving, such that following the merger, MLP GP will remain a wholly owned subsidiary of CPG and the sole general partner of CPPL, and CPG and CEG will be the only limited partners of CPPL. Each CPPL common unit issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to at the effective time of the merger will be converted into the right to receive (i) $17.00 per CPPL common unit in cash without any interest thereon plus (ii) an additional amount of cash per CPPL common unit without any interest thereon equal to the product of (x) the number of days from and including the first day of the quarter in which the closing occurs through and including the closing date multiplied by (y) $0.00217 per CPPL common Unit (a daily distribution rate equal to the quotient of $0.1975 divided by ninety-one (91)), plus (iii) an amount equal to $0.1975 per CPPL common unit in cash without any interest thereon if the record date for the CPPL s quarterly cash distribution with respect to the quarter immediately preceding the quarter in which the closing occurs shall not have occurred prior to the effective time of the merger (the "Merger Consideration"). Incentive distribution rights of CPPL, which are owned by CEG, will be unchanged and remain outstanding as incentive distribution rights of the surviving entity, and no consideration will be delivered in respect thereof. CPPL subordinated units, which are owned by CEG, will also be unchanged and remain outstanding as CPPL subordinated units of the surviving entity, and no consideration will be delivered in respect thereof. CPG will be issued CPPL common units at the effective time of the merger equal to the number of public common units being converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. The parties anticipate that the merger will close in the first quarter of 2017 and that CPPL will pay the regular quarterly cash distributions to unitholders at the quarterly per unit distribution rate of $0.1975, with the declaration date and record date for each quarterly distribution to occur no later than 30 days and 42 days, respectively, after the end of each fiscal quarter. 
  Completion of the merger is conditioned upon, among other things: (1) approval of the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger, by the affirmative vote or consent of holders, as of the record date of the special meeting of CPPL s unitholders (including CEG), of (a) a majority of the outstanding CPPL common units, voting as a class, (b) a majority of the CPPL common units held by the CPPL unaffiliated unitholders, and (c) a majority of the outstanding CPPL subordinated units, voting as a class; (2) all required filings, consents, approvals, permits and authorizations in connection with the merger having been made or obtained; and (3) the absence of legal injunctions or impediments prohibiting the merger transactions. 
  Pursuant to the merger agreement, CEG delivered a consent to voting the CPPL subordinated units owned beneficially or of record by it or any of its subsidiaries in favor of the merger proposal, including the 46,811,398 CPPL subordinated units currently held by CEG, which units represent 100% of the outstanding CPPL subordinated units. 
  The merger agreement contains provisions granting both CPPL and CPG the right to terminate the merger Agreement for certain reasons, including, among others, if: (1) the merger is not completed on or before August 1, 2017; (2) any governmental authority has issued a final and nonappealable statute, rule, order, decree or regulation enjoining or prohibiting consummation of the merger; (3) under certain conditions, there has been a material breach of any of the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in the merger agreement by a party to the merger agreement which is not cured within 30 days following receipt by the breaching party of written notice from the non-breaching party (a  terminable breach  (4) CPPL does not obtain the requisite unitholder approval of the merger agreement and the merger transactions at a special meeting of unitholders; or (5) either the GP Board, in accordance with the merger agreement, withdraws, modifies or qualifies, or proposes to publicly withdraw, modify or qualify, in a manner adverse to CPG its recommendation to the unitholders of CPPL (the  CPPL Board Recommendation ) or fails to include the CPPL Board Recommendation in the proxy statement to be filed by CPPL in connection with the merger (that taking of any such action being referred to as a  CPPL Change in Recommendation ).

meeting, a CPPL Change in Recommendation has occurred, or if CPG terminates the merger agreement due to a terminable breach by CPPL, CPPL will pay the expenses incurred by CPG up to a maximum of $10 million, and (3) if CPPL terminates the merger agreement due to a terminable breach by CPG, CPG will pay the expenses incurred by CPPL. 
  Executive Overview 
  We are a growth-oriented Delaware corporation formed to own, operate and develop a portfolio of pipelines, storage and related midstream assets. 
  We own approximately 15,000 miles of strategically located interstate gas pipelines extending from New York to the Gulf of Mexico and one of the nation s largest underground natural gas storage systems, with approximately 300 MMDth of working gas capacity, as well as related gathering and processing assets. For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , 95% of our revenue, excluding revenues generated from cost recovery under certain regulatory tracker mechanisms, which we refer to as  tracker-related revenues,  was generated under firm revenue contracts. As of   September 30, 2016  , these contracts had a weighted average remaining contract life of 4.7 years. We own these assets through Columbia OpCo, a partnership between our wholly owned subsidiary CEG and CPPL. 
  We expect the revenues generated from our businesses will increase as we execute on our significant portfolio of organic growth opportunities. We believe that future internal growth projects will be funded primarily through borrowings under our credit facility, long-term intercompany debt or through issuances of CPPL equity securities. 
   
  Commercial Growth and Expansion 
  We believe that we are well-positioned to attract volumes to our systems through cost-effective capacity expansions. For example, we have recently completed or we are currently undertaking the following expansions (all amounts listed are inclusive of AFUDC, as applicable): 
             
    Washington County Gathering  . A producer has contracted with us to build an approximately 20 mile gas gathering system in southwestern Pennsylvania. The initial project went into service during the third quarter of 2015 and we expect to invest approximately $120 million through 2021. 
                
    Gibraltar Pipeline Project  . We expect to invest approximately $260 million to construct an approximately 1 MMDth/d dry gas header pipeline in southwest Pennsylvania. We expect this to be the first of multiple phases with an initial in-service date in the fourth quarter of 2016, and a final in-service date in the fourth quarter of 2017. 
                
    Utica Access Project  . We invested approximately $50 million to construct 4.7 miles of 24-inch pipeline to provide 205,000 Dth/d of new firm transportation to provide Appalachian production access to liquid trading points on Columbia Gas Transmission's system. This project was placed into service in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
                
    Leach XPress  . This project will provide approximately 1.5 MMDth/d of capacity from the Marcellus and Utica production regions to the Leach compressor station located on the Columbia Gulf system, TCO Pool, and other markets on the Columbia Gas Transmission system. We expect the project, which involves an estimated investment of $1.4 billion, to be placed into service in the fourth quarter of 2017. 
                
    Millennium Lateral.   We intend to invest approximately $20 million through our ownership stake in Millennium Pipeline to construct approximately 8 miles of 16-inch pipeline to a new power plant situated near Wawayanda, New York. This project will provide up to 127,000 Dth/d of new firm capacity and will be placed into service in the second quarter of 2017. 
                
    Rayne XPress  . This project will transport approximately 1 MMDth/d of southwest Marcellus and Utica production on the Columbia Gulf system from the Leach, Kentucky interconnect with Columbia Gas Transmission towards the Rayne compressor station in southern Louisiana to reach various Gulf Coast markets. We expect the project, which involves an estimated investment of $420 million, to be placed into service in the fourth quarter of 2017. 
                
    Cameron Access Project  . This project, which involves an investment of approximately $300 million, will provide 800,000 Dth/d of transportation capacity on the Columbia Gulf system to the Cameron LNG export terminal in Louisiana. We expect the project to be placed into service in the first quarter of 2018. 
     
   46

  ITEM 2.     MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued) 
  Columbia Pipeline Group, Inc. 

WB XPress  . This project, which involves an investment of approximately $0.9 billion, will expand Columbia Gas Transmission's WB system in order to transport approximately 1.3 MMDth/d of Marcellus production to pipeline interconnects and East Coast markets, including access to the Cove Point LNG terminal. We expect this project to be placed into service in the fourth quarter of 2018. 
                
    Mountaineer XPress  . This approximately $2.0 billion project will provide new takeaway capacity for Marcellus and Utica production. The project will provide up to 2.7 MMDth/d of firm transportation capacity on the Columbia Gas Transmission system. We expect this project to be placed into service in the fourth quarter of 2018.  
                
    Gulf XPress  . Gulf XPress will provide 860,000 Dth/d of firm transportation capacity for Marcellus and Utica production on the Columbia Gulf system. This project involves an investment of approximately $0.7 billion and is expected to be placed into service in the fourth quarter of 2018. 
                
    Central Virginia Connector.   This project will provide 45,000 Dth/d of firm transportation capacity on the Columbia Gas Transmission system to a new point of delivery in Virginia. This approximately $13 million project is expected to be placed into service in the fourth quarter of 2018. 
                
    Millennium Eastern System Upgrade  . We intend to invest approximately $135 million through our ownership stake in Millennium Pipeline to expand eastward flow capacity by 223,000 Dth/d to Ramapo and other nearby points on the system. We expect this project to be placed into service in the fourth quarter of 2018. 
     In 2013, the FERC approved the modernization settlement entered into by Columbia Gas Transmission and its customers that provides recovery and return on an investment of up to $1.5 billion over a five-year period to modernize its system to improve system integrity and enhance service reliability and flexibility. The modernization program includes, among other things, replacement of aging pipeline and compressor facilities, enhancements to system inspection capabilities and improvements in control systems. Columbia Gas Transmission placed approximately $320 million in modernization investments into service during 2015. In January 2016, the FERC approved Columbia Gas Transmission's third annual filing for recovery of the revenue requirement under this program. In December 2015, Columbia Gas Transmission filed an extension of this settlement and received the FERC s approval of the customer agreement in March 2016. This extension will allow Columbia Gas Transmission to invest an additional $1.1 billion over an additional three-year period through 2020. This agreement also expands the scope of facility investments covered by the program. 
   
  Items Affecting Comparability of our Financial Results 
  The historical financial results discussed below may not be comparable to our future financial results for the following reasons: 
             
    Following the Separation, we incur incremental general and administrative expenses as a result of being a public company. 
                
    Following the Separation, transactions between CPG and NiSource and its subsidiaries reflected in our historical consolidated financial statements as affiliated are reflected as unaffiliated. 
                
    In addition, prior to the Separation, we sold $2,750.0 million of senior unsecured notes. The net proceeds of $2,722.3 million from that offering were used to repay $1,087.3 million of intercompany debt and pay a $1,450.0 million special dividend to NiSource. As a result, interest expense incurred on intercompany debt will be eliminated and replaced with interest expense on our credit facilities and our notes. 
                
    We entered into a   $1,500.0 million   revolving credit facility, which became effective at the time of the Separation. As of On July 1, 2016, in connection with the Merger, all existing letters of credit were migrated to a TransCanada credit facility and the CPG revolving credit facility was terminated. As a result, CPG accelerated the amortization of   $4.3 million   of deferred costs associated with the revolving credit facility, which are included in interest expense for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . 
                
    Subsequent to the completion of the Merger, we entered into a   $2,000.0 million   revolving credit facility with US Parent. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $250.0 million   in outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility. As a result, CPG will incur affiliated interest expense on outstanding borrowings under the credit facility.

CPG incurred additional costs as a result of the Merger. CPG incurred Merger transaction costs of   $43.1 million   and   $66.3 million   for the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , respectively, including legal, advisory and other related fees. Additionally CPG incurred employee related expenses of   $101.5 million   and an impairment charge of   $19.1 million  . These costs are included in "Operation and maintenance" and "Impairment of long-lived assets" on the Condensed Statements of Consolidated Operations (unaudited).

  Operating Revenues.   Operating revenues were   $327.1 million   for the   third   quarter of   2016  , an   increase   of   $6.2 million   from the same period in   2015  . The   increase   in operating revenues was primarily due to increased demand revenue of $29.0 million largely from the East Side Expansion, Broad Run Connector and Rayne XPress growth projects, and the CCRM. Additionally, there was higher mineral rights royalty revenue of $3.9 million and increased shorter term transportation services of $1.5 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $29.3 million attributable to the recovery of operating costs under certain regulatory tracker mechanisms, which are offset in expense.

Operating Expenses.   Operating expenses were   $396.1 million   for the   third   quarter of   2016  , an   increase   of   $195.7 million   from the same period in   2015  . The   increase   in operating expenses was primarily due to higher costs related to the Merger of $144.6 million, decreased gains on the sale of assets of $29.7 million, primarily due to conveyances of mineral interests, increased impairment charges of $18.5 million due to the cancellation of IT system upgrades and increased costs related to the Separation of $16.4 million. Additionally, there was increased depreciation and amortization of $8.6 million and higher property and other taxes of $2.5 million, both primarily due to higher levels of in-service assets, and higher employee and administrative costs of $3.6 million. These variances were partially offset by $29.3 million of decreased operating costs under certain regulatory tracker mechanisms, recoveries of which are offset in operating revenues. 
  Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates.   Equity earnings in unconsolidated affiliates were   $16.0 million   for the   third   quarter of   2016  , an   increase   of   $0.6 million   from the same period in   2015  . Equity earnings increased primarily due to earnings generated by Millennium Pipeline.  
  Other Income (Deductions).   Other income (deductions) for the   third   quarter of   2016     reduced   income by   $18.2 million   compared to a   reduction   in income of   $22.7 million   in the same period in   2015  . The variance was primarily due to an increase in other income of $7.3 million for the equity portion of AFUDC. This increase in other income was partially offset by $4.3 million of accelerated amortization of deferred costs associated with the CPG revolving credit facility which was terminated in connection with the Merger. 
  Income Taxes.   The effective income tax rates were   30.3%   and   33.8%   for the   third   quarter of   2016   and   2015  , respectively. The annual effective tax rate was adjusted in the third quarter of 2016 to reflect the impact of the Merger. Refer to Note 1,  Basis of Accounting Presentation  for additional information on the Merger. The change in the overall effective tax rates between   2016   and   2015   was primarily due to the effects of utility rate-making and other permanent book-to-tax differences. 
  Throughput.   Throughput totaled   520.5   MMDth for the   third   quarter of   2016  , compared to   424.9   MMDth for the same period in   2015  . The   increase   of   95.6   MMDth was primarily due to increased transportation of Marcellus and Utica natural gas production. 
  Nine Months Ended September 30,     2016   Compared to   Nine Months Ended September 30,     2015    
  Operating Revenues.   Operating revenues were   $1,005.5 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , an   increase   of   $28.5 million   from the same period in   2015  . The   increase   in operating revenues was primarily due to increased demand revenue of $100.9 million largely from the East Side Expansion, Broad Run Connector and Rayne XPress growth projects, and the CCRM. Additionally, there were increased shorter term transportation services of $6.1 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $71.1 million attributable to the recovery of operating costs under certain regulatory tracker mechanisms, which are offset in expense, and lower mineral rights royalty revenue of $6.6 million.  
  Operating Expenses.   Operating expenses were   $863.5 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , an   increase   of   $247.9 million   from the same period in   2015  . The   increase   in operating expenses was primarily due to higher costs related to the Merger of $167.8 million, increased costs related to the Separation of $58.4 million, decreased gains on the sale of assets of $37.3 million, primarily due to conveyances of mineral interests, higher depreciation and amortization of $23.8 million and increased property and other taxes of $7.1 million, both primarily due to higher levels of in-service assets. Additionally, there were higher impairment charges of $16.7 million due to the cancellation of IT system upgrades and increased employee and administrative costs of $12.4 million. These variances were partially offset by $71.1 million of decreased operating costs under certain regulatory tracker mechanisms, recoveries of which are offset in operating revenues. 
  Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates.   Equity earnings in unconsolidated affiliates were   $48.2 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , an   increase   of   $3.7 million   from the same period in   2015  . Equity earnings increased primarily due to earnings generated by Pennant and Millennium Pipeline. 
  Other Income (Deductions).   Other income (deductions) for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016     reduced   income by   $61.4 million   compared to a   reduction   in income of   $55.0 million   in the same period in   2015  . The variance was primarily due to an increase in interest expense of $12.2 million and higher amortization of debt related costs of $2.9 million, both resulting from the issuance of long-term debt in May 2015, as well as $4.3 million of accelerated amortization of deferred costs associated with the CPG revolving credit facility which was terminated in connection with the Merger. These increased deductions were partially offset by an increase in other income of $14.7 million for the equity portion of AFUDC.

Income Taxes.   The effective income tax rates were comparable at   33.5%   and   33.9%   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  Throughput.   Throughput totaled   1,718.0   MMDth for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to   1,528.9   MMDth for the same period in   2015  . The   increase   of   189.1   MMDth was primarily due to increased transportation of Marcellus and Utica natural gas production. 
   
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Our principal liquidity requirements are to finance our operations, fund capital expenditures, and satisfy our indebtedness obligations, as deemed appropriate. Our ability to meet these liquidity requirements will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future. 
  Our sources of liquidity may include:  
             
    cash on hand; 
                
    cash generated from our operations; 
                
    our   $2,000.0 million   revolving credit facility with US Parent; 
                
    long-term intercompany debt offering with US Parent; and 
                
    CPPL equity offerings. 
     We believe that cash on hand, cash generated from operations and availability under our credit facility will be adequate to meet our operating needs, our debt service requirements, repayment of principal on our long-term debt and anticipated dividends to our parent. We believe that future internal growth projects will be funded primarily through borrowings under our credit facility, long-term intercompany debt or through issuances of CPPL equity securities. 
  Cash Flow  . Net cash from operating activities, net cash used for investing activities and net cash (used for) from financing activities for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , were as follows: 

Operating Activities 
  Net cash from operating activities for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was   $253.0 million  , a decrease of $161.2 million compared to the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The decrease in net cash from operating activities was primarily attributable to the difference in the timing of collection of receivables and the payment of payables and costs associated with the Merger. 
  Investing Activities 
  Net cash used for investing activities for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was   $1,086.7 million  , an increase of   $444.1 million   compared to the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . Capital expenditures for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   were   $1,095.8 million  , compared to   $833.0 million   for the comparable period in   2015  . This increase is mainly due to higher spending on various growth projects primarily in the Marcellus and Utica Shale areas and for expenditures under the modernization program. We project   2016   capital expenditures to be approximately   $1.5 billion  . 
  There were   no   short-term lendings-affiliated for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to an inflow of   $145.5 million   for the comparable period in   2015  . This change is due to the settlement of the NiSource money pool in connection with the Separation.

  Columbia Pipeline Group, Inc. 

Contributions to equity investees   increased     $4.8 million   compared to the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and 2015, we contributed $6.2 million and $1.4 million, respectively, to Millennium Pipeline to fund capital projects.  
  Proceeds from disposition of assets decreased $43.4 million primarily due to decreased proceeds received on conveyances of mineral rights positions. 
  Financing Activities 
  Net cash from financing activities for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was   $35.4 million  , a decrease of   $256.3 million   compared to   $291.7 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The decrease in net cash from financing activities was primarily due to the prior year long-term debt issuance of $2,745.9 million and net proceeds of the CPPL IPO of $1,168.4 million offset by the repayment of approximately $1,087.3 million of intercompany debt and short-term borrowings, including, net amounts due from the money pool between CPG and NiSource Finance in May 2015, the special dividend of $1,450.0 million to NiSource, the $500.0 million return of pre-formation capital expenditures to NiSource. Additionally, we paid $105.1 million in common stock dividends prior to the Merger and $55.5 million to TransCanada subsequent to the Merger. Refer to Note 2,  CPPL Initial Public Offering  in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements (unaudited) for more information. 
  Dividends.   We paid a quarterly cash dividend of $55.5 million to TransCanada on August 19, 2016. On the date of record 10,000,100 common shares were outstanding. 
  Description of Senior Unsecured Notes.   On May 22, 2015, we sold $2,750.0 million of senior unsecured notes. The $2,750.0 million of senior unsecured notes are comprised of $500.0 million of 2.45% senior notes due 2018 (the  2018 Notes ), $750.0 million of 3.30% senior notes due 2020 (the  2020 Notes ), $1,000.0 million of 4.50% senior notes due 2025 (the  2025 Notes ) and $500.0 million of 5.80% senior notes due 2045 (the  2045 Notes  and, together with the 2018 Notes, 2020 Notes and 2025 Notes, the  Notes ). 
  The initial guarantors are three subsidiaries of CPG, CEG, Columbia OpCo and OpCo GP (the "Guarantors"). The Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, on a senior unsecured basis by all of the Guarantors. Each guarantee of CPG s obligations under the Notes is a direct, unsecured and unsubordinated obligation of the Guarantor and has the same ranking with respect to indebtedness of that Guarantor as the Notes have with respect to CPG s indebtedness. The guarantees of any Guarantor may be released under certain circumstances. 
  The Notes and the guarantees are (a) unsecured, (b) effectively junior in right of payment to any future secured indebtedness of CPG and the Guarantors, (c) equal in right of payment with any existing and future unsubordinated indebtedness of CPG and the Guarantors and (d) senior in right of payment to any future subordinated indebtedness of CPG and the Guarantors. 
  The 2018 Notes will mature on June 1, 2018, the 2020 Notes will mature on June 1, 2020, the 2025 Notes will mature on June 1, 2025 and the 2045 Notes will mature on June 1, 2045. Interest on the Notes of each series will be payable semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing December 1, 2015. 
  On February 23, 2016, we filed an exchange offer registration statement with the SEC. The registration statement was declared effective as of April 14, 2016. 
  Description of Revolving Credit Agreements.   Prior to the completion of the Merger on July 1, 2016, we were party to two credit agreements: the CPG revolving credit facility and CPPL revolving credit facility. As a result of the Merger, the CPG and CPPL revolving credit facilities were terminated and a new revolving credit facility between CPG and US Parent was initiated. 
  CPG-TransCanada PipeLine USA Ltd. Revolving Credit Facility.   Subsequent to the completion of the Merger, we entered into a   $2,000.0 million   revolving credit facility with US Parent. The revolving credit facility became effective as of July 1, 2016, with no termination date. The revolving credit facility will be available for general corporate purposes, including capital expenditures. 
  Loans under the revolving credit facility will bear interest at our option at either (i) the greatest of (a) the federal funds effective rate plus   0.500 percent  , (b) the reference prime rate as defined by Bloomberg Professional Service or (c) the Eurodollar rate which is based on the one month LIBOR, plus   1.000 percent  , each of which is subject to a margin of   0.250 percent   per annum, or (ii) the Eurodollar rate plus a margin of   1.250 percent   per annum.

As of   September 30, 2016  , CPG had   $250.0 million   in outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility, with a weighted average interest rate of   1.9%  .  
  CPG Revolving Credit Facility.   On July 1, 2016, in connection with the Merger, all existing letters of credit were migrated to a TransCanada credit facility and the CPG revolving credit facility was terminated. As a result, CPG accelerated the amortization of   $4.3 million   of deferred costs associated with the revolving credit facility, which are included in interest expense for the three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . 
  CPPL Revolving Credit Facility.   On June 29, 2016, in anticipation of the Merger, all outstanding borrowings, facility fees and interest were paid in full and the revolving credit facility was terminated. As a result, CPPL accelerated the amortization of   $1.4 million   of deferred costs associated with the revolving credit facility, which are included in interest expense for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . 
  CPG Commercial Paper Program.     Our commercial paper program had a Program limit of up to   $1,000.0 million  . CEG, OpCo GP and Columbia OpCo each agreed, jointly and severally, unconditionally and irrevocably to guarantee payment in full of the principal of and interest (if any) on the promissory notes. On June 30, 2016, in anticipation of the Merger, the Program was terminated. We had   no   promissory notes outstanding under the Program at the time of termination. 
  Credit ratings.   On July 6, 2016, Standard   Poor's raised the CPG credit rating to A- with a negative outlook due to the group support from parent TransCanada. The negative outlook reflects their outlook of TransCanada. On July 15, 2016, Fitch upgraded the CPG credit rating to BBB+ with a stable outlook due to the Merger with TransCanada, which has a stronger credit profile. On July 26, 2016, Moody's reaffirmed CPG's credit rating of Baa2 and stable outlook. The rating reflects the credit positive attributes of being owned by a creditworthy parent company like TransCanada. 
  CPG and its subsidiaries are not party to agreements that contain "ratings triggers" that require increased collateral if the credit ratings of CPG or certain of its subsidiaries are rated below a certain level. However, there are agreements that contain "adequate assurance" or "material adverse change" provisions that could necessitate additional credit support, such as letters of credit and cash collateral to transact business. 
  Contractual Obligations.   There were no material changes recorded during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   to our contractual obligations as of   December 31, 2015  . 
   
  Off Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  We do not have any off balance sheet arrangements.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
  Columbia Pipeline Group, Inc. 
  Litigation Relating to the Merger 
  On March 30, 2016, two purported stockholders of CPG filed an action challenging the Merger on behalf of a putative class of CPG stockholders in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, captioned   Vann   v.   Columbia Pipeline Group, Inc.  ,   et al  . The action names as defendants CPG, the members of the Board, Parent, US Parent, Merger Sub and TransCanada. On April 7, 2016, a second, substantially identical action was filed in the same court on behalf of the same putative class, captioned   Baldino   v.   Skaggs, Jr., et al.  , and naming as defendants only the members of the Board. On May 25, 2016, the Delaware Court of Chancery entered an order that, among other things, consolidated the actions into a single action, captioned as   In re Columbia Pipeline Group, Inc. Stockholder Litigation  , and appointed the   Vann   plaintiffs as lead plaintiffs and the   Vann   plaintiffs  counsel as lead counsel. The   Vann   plaintiffs  amended complaint, filed May 12, 2016, alleges that members of the CPG Board breached their fiduciary duties by, among other things, agreeing to the Merger following an inadequate sale process and at an unfair price, and because the sale process purportedly was affected by conflicts of interest on the part of the Board, the management of CPG and/or CPG s largest stockholder as a result of their substantial stockholdings in CPG, and on the part of one of CPG s financial advisors as a result of its alleged holdings in TransCanada stock. The amended complaint also alleges that the preliminary proxy filed in respect of the Merger omits or misstates various facts concerning, among other things, the sale process and the financial analyses performed by CPG s financial advisors. The amended complaint purports to seek injunctive and other equitable relief regarding the Merger. On July 5, 2016, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the action and a motion to stay discovery pending resolution of the motion to dismiss. On July 18, 2016, Vice Chancellor Laster entered the briefing schedule deferring briefing on the motion to dismiss until the motion to stay is resolved. On September 6, 2016, Vice Chancellor Laster granted TransCanada and CPG s motion to stay discovery while the motion to dismiss was pending.  On October 6, 2016, the   Vann   plaintiffs filed an amended claim which removed all TransCanada parties, limiting the action to the CPG Board and CFO.  Its revised claim alleges that the Board and officers entered into a secret scheme to benefit directors and insiders via change in control benefits and payments originating when NiSource first spun off the Columbia assets.  They continue their allegations that conflict of interest tainted the acquisition, the acquisition undervalued CPG and that the proxy statement was materially deficient.  The new claim seeks rescissory damages in an amount to be proven at trial and disgorgement of profits from the sale. At this early stage of the litigation, no outcome or possible loss or range of losses, if any, arising from the litigation is able to be estimated. 
  Appraisal Litigation 
  Following the consummation of the Merger, on September 9, 2016, multiple stakeholders, who, combined, allege ownership of approximately 7 million shares of CPG s common stock, filed a petition for appraisal pursuant to 8 Del. C.   262 in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, captioned   Dunham Monthly Distribution Fund et al v. Columbia Pipeline Group Inc  . On September 15, 2016, another group of former CPG stockholders, who allege ownership of approximately 900,000 shares of CPG s common stock, filed a second petition for appraisal, captioned   Brookdale International Partners, L.P. et al  .   v. Columbia Pipeline Group Inc.   Petitioners in the above-noted actions seek a judgment awarding them, among other things, the fair value of their CPG shares plus interest.  Collectively, these matters will be referred to as the  Appraisal Actions . 
  On October 3, 2016, CPG filed its answer to the petition in the Dunham action and a verified list pursuant to 8 Del. C.   262(f) naming, as of that filing, the persons that purported to demand appraisal of shares of CPG common stock. CPG filed its answer and verified lists in response to the Brookdale action on October 6, 2016. At this point, the total number of shares of CPG s common stock for which appraisal has been demanded and not requested to be withdrawn is approximately 8.9 million, inclusive of the shares allegedly held by petitioners in the Appraisal Actions. The parties in the Appraisal Actions are currently engaged in discovery. The Court of Chancery has not yet set a trial date for the Appraisal Actions. 
  At this early stage of the litigation, no outcome or possible loss or range of losses, if any, arising from the litigation is able to be estimated.

Environmental Litigation 
  On September 8, 2016, Keith Stutes, in his capacity as District Attorney for the 15   th    Judicial District of the State of Louisiana, and the State of Louisiana (together,  Plaintiffs ) filed an action against certain oil and gas exploration and transportation companies, including Columbia Gulf Transmission, LLC (collectively, the  Defendants ),   associated with the development of the Tigre Lagoon Oil   Gas Field in Vermillion Parish in the 15   th    Judicial District  Court for the Parish of Vermillion, captioned   Keith Stutes, et al v. Gulfport Energy Corp, et al  . The complaint alleges the Defendants  operations were conducted in violation of the State and Local  Coastal Resources Management Act of 1978, as amended (the  CZM Act of 1978 ) and that these activities caused substantial damage to the land and waterbodies located in the Coastal Zone, as defined in the CZM Act of 1978, within Vermillion Parish. It is possible that Columbia Gulf could incur substantial remediation and other costs and expenses in connection with this matter.  The amount of any potential judgment, assessments, penalties, fines, costs or expenses that may be incurred in connection with this litigation cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. 
  Please see Note 16 ( Other Commitments and Contingencies ) to Part I, Item I of this Form 10-Q, which is incorporated by reference into this Part II, Item 1, for more information regarding legal proceedings. 
   
  ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 
  Except as set forth below, there have been no material changes to the risk factors previously disclosed in our 2015 Form 10-K. 
  The Merger with CPPL may not be consummated even if CPPL Unitholders approve the Merger proposal. 
  On November 1, 2016, CPPL, CPG, MLP GP and Pony Merger Sub, entered into an agreement and plan of merger (the  Merger Agreement ), pursuant to which CPG has agreed to acquire, for cash, all of the outstanding publicly held common units representing limited partner interests in CPPL (the  Merger ). Upon closing, CPPL will become an indirect wholly owned entity of TransCanada and will cease to be a publicly held partnership. 
  The Merger Agreement contains conditions, some of which are beyond the parties  control, that, if not satisfied or waived, may prevent, delay or otherwise result in the Merger not occurring, even though CPPL's unitholders may have voted to approve the Merger proposal. We cannot predict with certainty whether and when any of the conditions to the completion of the Merger will be satisfied. Any delay in completing the Merger could cause us not to realize, or delay the realization of, some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve from the Merger. In addition, we can agree with CPPL not to consummate the Merger even if CPPL's unitholders approve the Merger proposal and the conditions to the closing of the Merger are otherwise satisfied.  
  If the Merger with CPPL does not occur, we will not benefit from the expenses we have incurred in the pursuit of the Merger. 
  The Merger with CPPL may not be completed. If the Merger is not completed, we will have incurred substantial expenses for which no ultimate benefit will have been received by us. We currently expect to incur Merger-related expenses consisting of independent advisory, legal and accounting fees, and financial printing and other related charges, much of which may be incurred even if the Merger is not completed. In addition, if the Merger Agreement is terminated under specified circumstances, we will be required to pay certain Merger-related expenses of CPPL. 
  We may be subject to class action lawsuits relating to the Merger, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. 
  Our directors and officers may be subject to class action lawsuits relating to the Merger and other additional lawsuits that may be filed. Such litigation is very common in connection with acquisitions of public companies, regardless of any merits related to the underlying acquisition. While we will evaluate and defend against any actions vigorously, the costs of the defense of such lawsuits and other effects of such litigation could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. 
  One of the conditions to consummating the Merger is that no injunction or other order prohibiting or otherwise preventing the consummation of the Merger Transactions shall have been issued by any court or governmental entity of competent jurisdiction in the United States. Consequently, if any lawsuit is filed challenging the Merger and is successful in obtaining an injunction preventing the parties to the Merger Agreement from consummating the Merger, such injunction may prevent the Merger from being completed in the expected timeframe, or at all.

Exhibit 31.1 
  Certification Pursuant to 
  Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 
  I, Stanley G. Chapman, III, certify that: 
           1. 
    I have reviewed this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   of Columbia Pipeline Group, Inc. (the "registrant"); 
              2. 
    Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report; 
              3. 
    Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report; 
       
           4. 
    The registrant s other certifying officer(s) and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have: 
       
           a) 
    Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared; 
       
           b) 
    Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; 
       
           c) 
    Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and 
       
           d) 
    Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant s most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant s fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant s internal control over financial reporting; and 
       
           5. 
    The registrant s other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant s auditors and the audit committee of the registrant s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions): 
       
           a) 
    All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and 
       
           b) 
    Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting.
