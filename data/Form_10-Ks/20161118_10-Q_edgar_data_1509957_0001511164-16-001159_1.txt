WRAPmail, Inc. and Subsidiary  
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  
  Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  
  (Unaudited)  
   
  NOTE 1   Organization and Description of Business  
   
 WrapMail, Inc. ( WRAP ) was incorporated in Florida on October 11, 2005.  Effective January 5, 2015 (see Note 5), we acquired 100% ownership of Prosperity Systems, Inc. ( Prosperity ), a New York corporation incorporated on April 2, 2008.  WRAP and its wholly owned subsidiary Prosperity (collectively, the  Company ) provide document, project, marketing and sales management systems to business clients through its website and proprietary software. After the acquisition of Prosperity, the Company transferred Prosperity s operations to WRAP and is presently in the process of dissolving Prosperity. 
   
  NOTE 2   Going Concern Uncertainty  
   
 The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a  going concern  basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in a normal course of business. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $1,475 and negative working capital of $284,024. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company had net losses of $342,142 and $3,429,458, respectively. These factors raise substantial doubt as to the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.  The Company plans to improve its financial condition by raising capital through sales of shares of its common stock.  Also, the Company plans to pursue new customers to attain profitable operations. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. 
   
  NOTE 3   Interim Financial Statements  
   
 The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the Company pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Accordingly, they may not include all of the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for complete financial statements. The interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s latest annual financial statement. In the opinion of management, the unaudited financial statements reflect all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation. Operating results for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 may not necessarily be indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016.  
   
  NOTE 4   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  
   
 (a)  Principles of Consolidation 
   
 The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of WRAP and its wholly owned subsidiary Prosperity from the date of its acquisition on January 5, 2015. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 
   
 (b)  Use of Estimates 
   
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.  Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
   
 (c)  Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
   
 The Company s financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, note receivable, notes and loans payable, accounts payable, and accrued expenses payable. Except for the note receivable, the fair value of these financial instruments approximate their carrying amounts reported in the balance sheets due to the short term maturity of these instruments. Based on comparable instruments with similar terms, the fair value of the note receivable approximates its carrying value. 
   
 Pursuant to ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, an entity is required to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the level of independent, objective evidence surrounding the inputs used to measure fair value. A financial instrument s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. ASC 820 prioritizes the inputs into three levels that may be used to measure fair value: 

6 

Level 1 Level-1 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
   
 Level 2- Level-2 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets    quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets)    or model derived valuations in which significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data. 
   
 Level 3 -Level 3 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the Valuation  methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities. 
   
 (d)  Cash and Cash Equivalents 
   
 The Company considers all liquid investments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. 
   
 (e)  Property and Equipment, Net 
   
 Property and equipment, net, is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.  Depreciation is calculated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets.  Maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. 
   
 (f)  Intangible Assets, Net 
   
 Intangible assets, net, are stated at cost less accumulated amortization.  Amortization is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated economic lives of the respective assets. 
   
 (g)  Goodwill and Intangible Assets with Indefinite Lives 
   
 The Company does not amortize goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, but instead tests for impairment at least annually.  When conducting the annual impairment test for goodwill, the Company compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit containing goodwill to its carrying value.  If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is determined to be less than its carrying value, goodwill is reduced and an impairment loss is recorded. 
   
  (h)  Long-lived Assets 
   
 The Company reviews long-lived assets held and used, intangible assets with finite useful lives and assets held for sale for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.  If an evaluation of  recoverability is required, the estimated undiscounted future cash flows associated with the asset is compared to the asset s carrying amount to determine if a write-down is required.  If the undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the fair value. 
   
 (i)  Revenue Recognition 
   
 The Company recognizes revenue over agreed periods of services delivered to customers, provided there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; the sales price is fixed or determinable; and collectability is deemed probable. 
        
 (j) Stock-Based Compensation 
   
 Stock-based compensation is accounted for at fair value in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 718,  Compensation   Stock Compensation  ( ASC718 ) and ASC 505-50, Equity   Based Payments to Non-employees. 
   
 In addition to requiring supplemental disclosures, ASC 718 addresses the accounting for share-based payment transactions in which a company receives goods or services in exchange for (a) equity instruments of the company or (b) liabilities that are based on the fair value of the company s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments.  ASC 718 focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which a company obtains employee services in share-based payment transactions. 
   
 In accordance with ASC 505-50 the Company determines the fair value of the stock based payment as either the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. If the fair value of the equity instruments issued is used, it is measured using the stock price and other measurement assumptions as of the earlier of either (1) the date at which a commitment for performance by the counterparty to earn the equity instrument is reached, or (2) the date at which the counterparty s performance is complete. 

7 

Options and warrants 
   
 The fair value of stock options and warrants is estimated on the measurement date using the Black-Scholes model with the following assumptions, which are determined at the beginning of each year and utilized in all calculations for that year: 
   
 Risk-Free Interest Rate.  
   
 We utilized the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant with a term consistent with the expected term of  
 our awards.   
   
 Expected Volatility.  
   
 We calculate the expected volatility based on a volatility index of peer companies as we did not have sufficient  
 historical market information to estimate the volatility of our own stock.  
   
 Dividend Yield.  
   
 We have not declared a dividend on its common stock since its inception and have no intentions of declaring a dividend   in the foreseeable future and therefore used a dividend yield of zero. 
   
 Expected Term.  
   
 The expected term of options granted represents the period of time that options are expected to be outstanding.  We  
 estimated the expected term of stock options by using the simplified method.  For warrants, the expected term   represents the actual term of the warrant. 
   
 Forfeitures.  
   
 Estimates of option forfeitures are based on our experience. We will adjust our estimate of forfeitures over the requisite   service period based on the extent to which actual forfeitures differ, or are expected to differ, from such estimates.   Changes in estimated forfeitures will be recognized through a cumulative catch-up adjustment in the period of change   and will also impact the amount of compensation expense to be recognized in future periods. 
   
 (k)  Advertising 
   
 Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and amounted to $10,301 and $26,852 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.       
   
 (l) Research and Development 
   
 Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. 
   
 (m)  Income Taxes 
   
 Income taxes are accounted for under the assets and liability method.  Current income taxes are provided in accordance with the laws of the respective taxing authorities.  Deferred income taxes are provided for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.  Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is not more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. 
   
 The Company has adopted the provisions required by the Income Taxes topic of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification.  The Codification Topic requires the recognition of potential liabilities as a result of management s acceptance of potentially uncertain positions for income tax treatment on a  more-likely-than-not  probability of an assessment upon examination by a respective taxing authority.  The Company believes that it has not taken any uncertain tax positions and thus has not recorded any liability.  

8 

(n)  Net Income (Loss) per Common Share 
   
 Basic net income (loss) per common share is computed on the basis of the weighted average   number of common shares outstanding during the period. 
   
 Diluted net income (loss) per common share is computed on the basis of the weighted average number of common shares and dilutive securities (such as stock options and convertible securities) outstanding.  Dilutive securities having an anti-dilutive effect on diluted net income (loss) per share are excluded from the calculation. For the periods presented, the diluted net loss per share calculation excluded the effect of Series A preferred stock and stock options outstanding (see Note 9 and Note 11). 
   
 (o)  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
   
 Certain accounting pronouncements have been issued by the FASB and other standard setting organizations which are not yet effective and therefore have not yet been adopted by the Company.  These include: 
   
 In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15  Disclosure about an Entities Ability to Continue as a Going Concern . The update establishes management s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entities ability to continue as a going concern including related disclosures.  
   
 In 2016 the FASB issued ASU 2016-2(topic 842) which establishes a new lease accounting model for lessees. Under the, new guidance lessees will be required to recognize right of use assets and liabilities for most leases having terms of 12 months or more. 
   
 The impact on the Company s financial statements has not yet been determined. 
   
  NOTE 5   Acquisition of Prosperity Systems, Inc.  
   
 Effective January 5, 2015, WRAP acquired 100% ownership of Prosperity Systems, Inc. ( Prosperity )  in exchange for 36,354,077 newly issued shares of WRAP common stock (see Note 10).  The acquisition has been accounted for in the accompanying consolidated financial statements as a purchase transaction.  Accordingly, the financial position and results of operations of Prosperity prior to the date of the acquisition have been excluded from the accompanying consolidated financial statements.   
   
 The estimated fair values of the identifiable net assets of Prosperity at January 5, 2015 (effective date of acquisition) consisted of: 

Goodwill of $1,994,641 (excess of the $1,999,474 fair value of the 36,354,077 shares of WRAP common stock issued to Prosperity's stockholders over the $4,833 identifiable net assets of Prosperity at January 5, 2015) was considered fully impaired at the acquisition date and an impairment expense of $1,994,641 was recorded in the three months ended March 31, 2015. 

9 

The following pro forma information summarizes the results of operations for the Nine Months ended September 30, 2015 as if the acquisition occurred at December 31, 2014.  The pro forma information is not necessarily indicative of the results that would have been reported had the transaction actually occurred on December 31, 2014, nor is it intended to project results of operations for any future period.

NOTE 12   Income Taxes  
   
 No provisions for income taxes were recorded for the periods presented since the Company incurred net losses in those periods. 
   
 The provisions for (benefits from) income taxes differ from the amounts determined by applying the U.S. Federal income tax rate of 35% to pretax income (loss) as follows: 

13 

Deferred income tax assets consist of: 

Based on management's present assessment, the Company has not yet determined it to be more likely than not that a deferred income tax asset of $1,194,524 attributable to the future utilization of the $3,412,925 net operating loss carryforward as of September 30, 2016 will be realized. Accordingly, the Company has maintained a 100% allowance against the deferred income tax asset in the financial statements at September 30, 2016. The Company will continue to review this valuation allowance and make adjustments as appropriate. The net operating loss carryforward expires in years 2025, 2026, 2027, 2028, 2029, 2030, 2031, 2032, 2033, 2034, 2035, and 2036 in the amount of $1,369, $518,390, $594,905, $686,775, $159,141, $151,874, $135,096, $166,911, $311,890, $28,511, $345,921, and $312,142, respectively. 
   
 Current tax laws limit the amount of loss available to be offset against future taxable income when a substantial change in ownership occurs.  Therefore, the amount available to offset future taxable income may be limited. 
   
 The Company's U.S. Federal and state income tax returns prior to 2012 are closed and management continually evaluates expiring statutes of limitations, audits, proposed settlements, changes in tax law and new authoritative rulings. The statute of limitations on the 2012 tax year returns expired in March 2016. 
   
 The Company recognizes interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as part of the income tax provision and would include accrued interest and penalties with the related tax liability in the consolidated balance sheets. There were no interest or penalties paid during 2016 and 2015.
