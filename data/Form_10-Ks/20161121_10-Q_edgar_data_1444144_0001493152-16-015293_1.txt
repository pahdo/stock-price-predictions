NOTE
1   ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION   

Accelera
Innovations, Inc., formerly Accelerated Acquisitions IV, Inc. ( Accelera  or the  Company ) was incorporated
in the State of Delaware on April 29, 2008 for the purpose of raising capital intended to be used in connection with its business
plan which may include a possible merger, acquisition or other business combination with an operating business.  

On
June 13, 2011, Synergistic Holdings, LLC ( Purchaser ) agreed to acquire 17,000,000 shares of the Company s
common stock par value $0.0001 per share. At the same time, Accelerated Venture Partners, LLC agreed to tender 3,750,000 of their
5,000,000 shares of the Company s common stock par value $0.0001 for cancellation. Following these transactions, Synergistic
Holdings, LLC owned 93.15% of the Company s 18,250,000 issued and outstanding shares of common stock par value $0.0001 and
the interest of Accelerated Venture Partners, LLC was reduced to approximately 6.85% of the total issued and outstanding shares.
Simultaneously with the share purchase, Timothy Neher resigned from the Company s Board of Directors and John Wallin was
simultaneously appointed to the Company s Board of Directors. Such action represented a change of control of the Company.  

On
October 18, 2011, the Company filed a Certificate of Amendment to its Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State
of Delaware and changed its name from Accelerated Acquisition IV, Inc. to Accelera Innovations, Inc.  

Accelera
is a healthcare service company which is focused on acquiring companies primarily in the post-acute care patient services and
information technology services industries. The Company has acquired Behavioral Health Care Associates, Ltd. ( BHCA )
(On March 31, 2016, the Company and BHCA entered into a Termination Agreement - See Note 5) and SCI Home Health, Inc. (d/b/a
Advance Lifecare Home Health) ( SCI ) which offers personal care to patients in the Chicago, Illinois area.  

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements and have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America.  

The
condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Accelera and its 100% owned subsidiaries, Behavioral Health
(through December 31, 2015   See Note 5) and SCI Home Health. Significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation.  

The
unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared by us pursuant to the rules and regulations of
the Securities and Exchange Commission. The information furnished herein reflects all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring
accruals and adjustments) which are, in the opinion of management, necessary to fairly present the operating results for the respective
periods. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally present in the annual consolidated financial statements prepared
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have been omitted pursuant to such
rules and regulations. These unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with
the audited consolidated financial statements and notes for the year ended December 31, 2015. The results of the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2016.  

NOTE
2   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

USE
OF ESTIMATES   The preparation of unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
from those estimates.  

Significant
estimates in these financial statements include allowance for doubtful accounts, the valuation of intangibles, valuation allowance
for deferred taxes, estimated useful life of property and equipment and the fair value of stock and options issues for services
and interest.  

CASH
- All cash is maintained with a major financial institution in the United States. Deposits with this bank may exceed the amount
of insurance provided on such deposits. Temporary cash investments with an original maturity of three months or less are considered
to be cash equivalents. The Company had no cash equivalents as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The
Company has not suffered any credit issues when deposits have exceeded the amount of insurance provided for such deposits.  

ACCOUNTS
RECEIVABLE   Accounts receivable are recorded at estimated value, net of allowance for doubtful accounts. Accounts receivable
are not interest bearing. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon management s best estimate and past collection
experience. For accounts greater than 180 days, the Company carries a 100% allowance. Uncollectible accounts are charged
off when all reasonable efforts to collect the accounts have been exhausted.  

PROPERTY
AND EQUIPMENT  Property and equipment is stated at cost. Depreciation is provided on a straight line basis over the estimated
useful lives of the assets. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred; major renewals and betterments are capitalized.
When items of property and equipment are sold or retired, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts,
and any gain or loss is included in income.  

DERIVATIVE
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS   The Company evaluates all of its agreements to determine if such instruments
have derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives. For derivative financial instruments that are accounted
for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value and is then re-valued at each reporting
date, with changes in the fair value reported in the statements of operations. For stock-based derivative financial instruments,
the Company uses the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model to value the derivative instruments at inception and on subsequent
valuation dates. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded as liabilities
or as equity, is evaluated at the end of each reporting period. Derivative instrument liabilities are classified in the balance
sheet as current or non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement of the derivative instrument could be required within
12 months of the balance sheet date. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company s only derivative financial
instrument was an embedded conversion feature associated with convertible notes due to the conversion price being a percentage
of the market price of the Company s common stock.  

PREFERRED
STOCK SUBSCRIPTION PAYABLE   During the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, an affiliate of the Company entered into
subscription agreements with 13 investors. Pursuant to the terms of the subscription agreements, the affiliate agreed to issue
shares of the Company s 8% Convertible Preferred Stock that it was authorized to issue as of May 7, 2015. In exchange, the
Company received aggregate proceeds from the investors of $652,462. Accordingly, the Company is obligated to issue an aggregate
of 198,473 shares of 8% Convertible Preferred Stock to the investors with a stated value of $4.00 per share or an aggregate of
$793,892. The net proceeds of $652,462 have been received by or on behalf of the Company and recorded as preferred stock subscription
payable net of $141,430 of original issue discount related to such offering which amount was expensed. Upon obtaining the Certificate
of Designation for the 8% Convertible Preferred Stock on May 7, 2015, the Company has included the aggregate amount of $793,892
of preferred stock as part of stockholders  equity. Prior to May 7, 2015, the preferred stock subscription payable was included
as a current liability.  

COMMON
STOCK - The Company records common stock issuances when all of the legal requirements for the issuance of such common stock have
been satisfied.  

REVENUE
RECOGNITION - Revenue related to services and administrative support services is recognized ratably at the time services have
been performed and pre-approved by payer. Gross service revenue is recorded in the accounting records on an accrual basis at the
provider s established rates, regardless of whether the health care entity expects to collect that amount. The Company will
reserve a provision for contractual adjustment and discounts and deduct from gross service revenue. The Company believes that
recognizing revenue at the time the services have been performed because the Company s revenue policies meet the following
four criteria in accordance with ASC 605-10-S25,  Revenue Recognition : Overall, (i) persuasive evidence that arrangement
exists, (ii) services has occurred, (iii) the price is fixed and determinable and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured. The
Company reports revenues net of any sales, use and value added taxes.  

COST
OF REVENUES - Costs of revenues are comprised of fees paid to members of the Company s medical staff, other direct costs
including transcription, film and medical record obtainment and transportation; and other indirect costs including labor and overhead
related to the generation of revenues.  

ADVERTISING
COSTS - The Company s policy regarding advertising is to expense advertising when incurred.  

INCOME
TAXES - The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740,  Income Taxes . ASC 740 requires a company
to use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes, whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible
temporary differences, and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are
the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets are reduced by
a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion, or all of, the deferred
tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates
on the date of enactment.  

Under
ASC 740, a tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is  more likely than not  that the tax position would
be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The amount recognized is the largest amount
of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized on examination. For tax positions not meeting the  more
likely than not  test, no tax benefit is recorded. The adoption had no effect on the Company s consolidated financial
statements.  

STOCK
BASED COMPENSATION - The Company has share-based compensation plans under which employees, consultants, suppliers and directors
may be granted restricted stock, as well as options and warrants to purchase shares of Company common stock at the fair market
value at the time of grant. Stock-based compensation cost to employees is measured by the Company at the grant date, based on
the fair value of the award, over the requisite service period under ASC 718. For options issued to employees, the Company recognizes
stock compensation costs utilizing the fair value methodology over the related period of benefit. Grants of stock to non-employees
and other parties are accounted for in accordance with the ASC 505 at measurement date. For awards with service or performance
conditions, the Company generally recognize expense over the service period or when the performance condition is met.  

LOSS
PER SHARE - Basic loss per share is computed by dividing net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average
common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted loss per share is computed giving effect to all potentially dilutive common
shares. Potentially dilutive common shares may consist of incremental shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options and warrants
and the conversion of notes payable to common stock. In periods in which a net loss has been incurred, all potentially dilutive
common shares are considered anti-dilutive and thus are excluded from the calculation.  

FINANCIAL
INSTRUMENTS - FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 820  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures  (ASC 820) defines
fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal
or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement
date.. ASC 820 also establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between (1) market participant assumptions developed
based on market data obtained from independent sources (observable inputs) and (2) an entity s own assumptions about market
participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances (unobservable inputs). The fair
value hierarchy consists of three broad levels, which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets
for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). The three levels of the
fair value hierarchy are described below:  

Level
    1 - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets
    or liabilities.   

Level
    2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly
    or indirectly, including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or
    similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the
    asset or liability (e.g., interest rates); and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market
    data by correlation or other means.   

Level
    3 - Inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable.   

Fair
value estimates discussed herein are based upon certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to management as
of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  

The
Company uses Level 2 inputs for its valuation methodology for its derivative liability as its fair value was determined by using
the Black-Scholes-Merton pricing model based on various assumptions. The Company s derivative liability is adjusted to reflect
fair value at each period end, with any increase or decrease in the fair value being recorded in results of operations as adjustments
to fair value of derivatives.  

At
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company identified the following liability that is required to be presented on the
balance sheet at fair value (see Note 8):  

RECENT
ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  

In
January 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2015-01 (Subtopic 225-20) -  Income Statement - Extraordinary
and Unusual Items . ASU 2015-01 eliminates the concept of an extraordinary item from GAAP. As a result, an entity will no longer
be required to segregate extraordinary items from the results of ordinary operations, to separately present an extraordinary item
on its income statement, net of tax, after income from continuing operations or to disclose income taxes and earnings-per-share
data applicable to an extraordinary item. However, ASU 2015-01 will still retain the presentation and disclosure guidance for
items that are unusual in nature and occur infrequently. ASU 2015-01 is effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2015.
The adoption of ASU 2015-01 is not expected to have a material effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements.
Early adoption is permitted.  

In
February, 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2015-02,  Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the
Consolidation Analysis.  ASU 2015-02 provides guidance on the consolidation evaluation for reporting organizations that are
required to evaluate whether they should consolidate certain legal entities such as limited partnerships, limited liability corporations,
and securitization structures (collateralized debt obligations, collateralized loan obligations, and mortgage-backed security
transactions). ASU 2015-02 is effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2015. The adoption of ASU 2015-02 is not expected
to have a material effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements. Early adoption is permitted.  

In
September, 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16,  Business Combinations (Topic 805).  Topic 805 requires that an acquirer
retrospectively adjust provisional amounts recognized in a business combination, during the measurement period. To simplify the
accounting for adjustments made to provisional amounts, the amendments in the Update require that the acquirer recognize adjustments
to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amount
is determined. The acquirer is required to also record, in the same period s financial statements, the effect on earnings
of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result of the change to the provisional amounts,
calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. In addition an entity is required to present separately
on the face of the income statement or disclose in the notes to the financial statements the portion of the amount recorded in
current-period earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional
amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date. ASU 2015-16 is effective for fiscal years beginning December 15, 2015.
The adoption of ASU 2015-016 is not expected to have a material effect on the Company s consolidated financial statements.  

In
November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17,  Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes . The new guidance requires
that all deferred tax assets and liabilities, along with any related valuation allowance, be classified as noncurrent on the balance
sheet. This update is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those annual periods.
The Company does not anticipate the adoption of this ASU will have a significant impact on its consolidated financial position,
results of operations, or cash flows.  

In
February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842) . The guidance in ASU No. 2016-02 supersedes the lease
recognition requirements in ASC Topic 840,  Leases (FAS 13) . ASU 2016-02 requires an entity to recognize assets and liabilities
arising from a lease for both financing and operating leases, along with additional qualitative and quantitative disclosures.
ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently
evaluating the effect this standard will have on its consolidated financial statements.  

In
March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,  Improvements to Employee Share Based Payment Accounting , to simplify several aspects
of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either
equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. The guidance will be effective for annual periods beginning
after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an
interim period. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this newly issued guidance to its consolidated
financial statements.  

Other
recent accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB (including its Emerging Issues Task Force), the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants, and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission did not or are not believed by management to have
a material impact on the Company s present or future consolidated financial statements.  

RECLASSIFICATIONS
- Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. These reclassifications had
no impact on net earnings, financial position or cash flows.

3 - BALANCE SHEET INFORMATION   

PROPERTY
AND EQUIPMENT, NET  

Property
and equipment, net at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 consist of the following:  

Depreciation

NOTE
4 - GOING CONCERN   

The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue
as a going concern. The Company has had minimal revenue since inception and had an accumulated deficit of $61,188,771 as of September
30, 2016. In view of these matters, the Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company s
ability to add profitable operating companies and to achieve a level of profitability. The Company intends on financing its future
development activities and its working capital needs largely from the sale of public equity securities with some additional funding
from other traditional financing sources, including term notes until such time that funds provided by operations are sufficient
to fund working capital requirements.  

As a result of the Termination Agreement with BHCA (See Note 5) the Company s only operating
facility is SCI. Revenues from SCI have significantly decreased primarily due to the sudden departure of the administrator of
SCI. The Company has transitioned this position to a new administrator and filed these changes with IDPH (Illinois Department
of Public Health). There are claims to be processed and invoiced when IDPH approves, through the uniform process, the new administrator,
the Company expects this to be resolved in the near future.  

The
unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements of the Company do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability
and classification of recorded assets, or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company
be unable to continue as a going concern.  

NOTE
5 - DISCONTINUED OPERATION   

On
November 20, 2013, Accelera executed a Stock Purchase Agreement (the  SPA ) and its wholly owned subsidiary, Accelera
Healthcare Management Service Organization LLC ( Accelera HMSO ), executed an Operating Agreement with Blaise J. Wolfrum,
M.D. and Behavioral Health Care Associates, Ltd. ( BHCA ). Accelera acquired 100% of the 100,000 issued and outstanding
shares of BHCA from Dr. Wolfrum. Accelera HMSO as a wholly owned subsidiary of Accelera will operate BHCA in accordance with the
Operating Agreement.  

Pursuant
the SPA, the Company agreed to pay to Dr. Wolfrum a purchase price of $4,550,000 for his shares of BHCA, of which $1,000,000 was
payable on September 30, 2015, $750,000 is payable on November 30, 2015, and $2,800,000 is payable on December 31, 2015. The payment
due on September 30, 2015, November 30, 2015 and December 31, 2015 were not paid.  

On
September 30, 2016, the Company, Blaise J. Wolfrum, M.D., and BHCA executed a Termination Agreement by which the SPA was terminated
effect as of January 1, 2016. BHCA is accounted for as a discontinued operation as of January 1, 2016. The historical financial
results of BHCA are reflected in the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements and footnotes
as discontinued operations for all periods presented.  

The
following table displays summarized activity in the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations
for discontinued operations during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015.  

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, there was no activity in the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated statement
of operations as a result of the Termination Agreement.  

As
a result of the Termination Agreement, the Company recognized a gain from the disposal of BHCA of $4,239,585, principally a result
of the cancelation of the $4,550,000 subordinated unsecured note payable which is the consideration the Company received for entering
into the Termination Agreement.  

NOTE
6 - SHORT-TERM NOTES PAYABLES   

Short-term
notes payable at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 consisted of the following:  

(1)
The Company entered into a $344,507 promissory note (the  Trust Note ) with the Rose. M Gallagher Revocable Trust
( Trust ) in conjunction with the Settlement Agreement (see Note 7). The Trust Note bears interest at 11.0% per annum.
The first payment of $25,000 is due on March 1, 2015. The final principal and interest payment is due on June 1, 2015. The entire
outstanding principal balance of Trust Note may be prepaid at any time, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty, and the
interest accrued on the remaining principal balance shall be adjusted accordingly. The Company is in default of the Trust Note
and has a 90 day cure period. The Company paid $5,000 on April 8, 2015.  

If
an event of default under the Trust Note occurs the Trust may accelerate the Trust Note s maturity date so that the unpaid
principal amount, together with accrued interest, is immediately due in its entirety. In addition, the Company promises to pay
one thousand dollars as consideration for costs of collection of the Trust Note, including but not limited to attorneys 
fees, paid or incurred on account of such collection, whether or not suit is filed with respect thereto and whether such cost
or expense is paid or incurred, or to be paid or incurred, prior to or after the entry of judgment. Pursuant to the terms of the
Trust Note, an event of default occurs if (i) the Company fails to make any payment required by the Trust Note when due, (ii)
the Company fails to observe or perform any covenant, condition or agreement under the Trust Note, (iii) a proceeding with respect
to the Company is commenced for the benefit of creditors, including but not limited to any bankruptcy or insolvency law; or (iv)
the Company becomes insolvent.  

(2)
On October 1, 2014, AOK Property Investments LLC ( AOK ), a third party lender, lent the Company and its subsidiary,
SCI, an aggregate of $500,000. In consideration of AOK s delivery of an aggregate of $500,000 to the Company and ALM, the
Company and ALM executed and delivered a promissory note (the  AOK Note ) in favor of AOK in the aggregate principal
amount of $500,000. The AOK Note is due on January 15, 2015 and bears interest in the amount of 500,000 shares of the Company s
common stock, which interest is due and payable on or before January 15, 2015. If the Company and ALM fail to pay any portion
of principal or interest when due, interest will continue to accrue and be payable to AOK at the rate of 1,667 shares of Company
common stock per day until all principal and accrued interest is fully paid. On July 10, 2015, the Company and AOK entered in
an amended note agreement whereby AOK loaned the Company an additional $25,000 and extended the due date of the note to December
31, 2015, and the Company agreed to issue an additional 500,000 shares of common stock for failing to pay the principal and interest
on the loan when originally due. The Company recorded the issuance of 500,000 shares of common stock to AOK at a value of $1,360,907.
The loan was not repaid on its extended due date and is currently in default.  

If
an event of default under the AOK Note occurs AOK may accelerate the AOK Note s maturity date so that the unpaid principal
amount, together with accrued interest, is immediately due in its entirety. Pursuant to the terms of the AOK Note, an event of
default occurs if (i) the Company or ALM fails to make any payment required by the AOK Note when due, (ii) the Company or SCI
voluntarily dissolves or ceases to exist, or any final and non-appealable order or judgment is entered against the Company or
SCI ordering its dissolution, (iii) the Company or ALM fails to pay, becomes insolvent or unable to pay, or admits in writing
an inability to pay its debts as they become due, or makes a general assignment for the benefit of creditors; or (iv) a proceeding
with respect to the Company or ALM is commenced for the benefit of creditors, including but not limited to any bankruptcy or insolvency
law.  

NOTE
7 - CONVERTIBLE NOTES   

Convertible
notes at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 consist of the following:  

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company issued two convertible notes totaling $110,250 (includes $5,250 of original
issue discounts) to one investor for which the Company received $52,500 in cash and a note receivable from the same investor totaling
$52,500. Since the note receivable was issued to the Company as payment for a convertible note, the Company has not presented
this note receivable as an asset, but as an offset to the convertible note balance. In addition to the above two convertible note,
during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company issued one additional convertible note to another investors for gross
proceeds of $25,000 ($27,778 less $2,778 of original issue discount).  

Due
to the variable conversion price associated with these convertible notes, the Company has determined that the conversion feature
is considered derivative liabilities. The embedded conversion feature at inception is recorded as a derivative liability as of
the date of issuance. The derivative liability was recorded as a debt discount up to the face amount of the convertible notes
with the remaining amount being charge as a financing cost. The debt discount is being amortized over the term of the convertible
notes. The Company recognized additional interest expense of $203,231 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 related
to the amortization of the debt discount.  

A
rollfoward of the convertible note from December 31, 2015 to September 30, 2016 is below:  

NOTE
8 - DERIVATIVE LIABILITY   

The
convertible note discussed in Note 7 has a variable conversion price which results in the conversion feature being recorded as
a derivative liability.  

The
fair value of the derivative liability is recorded and shown separately under current liabilities. Changes in the fair value of
the derivative liability is recorded in the statement of operations under other income (expense).  

The
Company uses the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model with the following assumptions to measure the fair value of derivative
liability at September 30, 2016:  

The
following table represents the Company s derivative liability activity for the period ended September 30, 2016:  

NOTE
9 - STOCKHOLDERS  DEFICIT   

The
Company has two classes of stock, preferred stock and common stock. There are 10,000,000 shares of $.0001 par value preferred
shares authorized, 500,000 of which have been designated as 8% Convertible Preferred Stock as of May 7, 2015.  

The
500,000 shares of 8% Convertible Preferred Stock have the following the designations, rights, and preferences:  

The
    stated value of each share is $4.00,   

Holders
    of shares of 8% Convertible Preferred Stock do not have any voting rights,   

The
    shares pay quarterly dividends in arrears at the rate of 8% per annum and on each conversion date. Subject to certain conditions,
    the dividends are payable at our option in cash or such dividends shall be accreted to, and increase, the outstanding Stated
    Value,   

Each
    share is convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of $4.00 per share, subject to adjustment discussed
    below, and   

The
    conversion price of the 8% Convertible Preferred is subject to proportional adjustment in the event of stock splits, stock
    dividends and similar corporate events.   

There
were 198,473 shares of 8% Convertible Preferred Stock issued and outstanding as of September 30, 2016.  

There
are 100,000,000 shares of $.0001 par value common shares authorized. The Company has 48,261,216 and 45,011,216 issued and
outstanding shares as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  

During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company issued 3,250,000 shares for the conversion of $41,244 of convertible notes
payable.  

NOTE
10 - STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION   

The
Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense in its statement of operations based on the fair value of employee stock options
and stock grant awards as measured on the grant date. For stock options, the Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model
to determine the value of the awards granted. The Company amortizes the estimated value of the options as of the grant date over
the stock options  vesting period, which is generally four years.  

The
Company has estimated the value of common stock into which the options are exercisable at $4 per share for financial reporting
purposes. This amount was determined based on the price our stock was sold for in past private placements, the minimum stock price
required for listing on any Nasdaq market, and the amount also approximates a $85 million valuation for the entire Company, which
is considered  micro-cap  by most equity analysts. The stock based compensation expense is an estimate and significant
judgment was involved in attempting to determine the value of common stock. When a majority of the stock options were issued,
the Company s common stock has not traded publicly, and no stock was traded in private markets either, except for privately
negotiated sales to the founder and other private investors of the company and the founder of the technology from which the company
subsequently licensed rights. The Company does not have any offers for purchase of its common stock in any stage, and no stock
is registered for resale with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  

The
Company believes the only material estimate used in estimating the value stock options was the estimated fair value of the common
stock, and that assumed volatility, term, interest rate and dividend yield changes would not result in material differences in
stock option valuations. The Company recognized stock-based compensation expense of $921,144 and $3,038,649 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, which were included in general and administrative expenses. As of September 30,
2016, there was $747,500 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock-based compensation awards, which is
expected to be recognized over the weighted average remaining vested period of approximately 1.0 years.  

The
following is a summary of the outstanding options, as of September 30, 2016:  

NOTE
11 - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND
ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

Plan of Operation  

Accelera Innovations, Inc.
( we,   us,  the  Company,  or  Accelera ), a Delaware corporation, is a healthcare
service company which is focused on acquiring companies primarily in the post-acute care patient services and information technology
services industries. The Company acquired Behavioral Health Care Associates, Ltd. ( BHCA ) in November 2013 which offers
full treatment services for mental health conditions and addictions and SCI Home Health, Inc. (d/b/a Advance Lifecare Home Health)
( SCI ) in October 2014 which offers home health services to patients in the Chicago, Illinois area. In addition, the
Company has entered into agreements to acquire home health care service providers Grace Home Health Care, Inc. ( Grace ),
the assets of Watson Health Care, Inc. and Affordable Nursing, Inc. and Traditions Home Care, Inc., each of which is subject to
completion of financing. 

As a result of our plans
to focus our business efforts on the acquisition of health care services companies and utilize the Synergistic Technology we license
from an affiliate, we agreed to amend the Synergistic Licensing Agreement to eliminate the $29,414,819 funding requirements we
were obligated to make and replace it with a requirement to pay a license fee in the amount of 10,000 upon completion and acceptance
of each installation of the software at a location for each affiliate or subsidiary of the Company and the sum of $10,000.00 on
each anniversary after each such installation during the period of time in which the Software is used at such location (the  License
Fee ). In addition, the Company will be responsible for the reasonable installation costs incurred by Synergistic in connection
with the installation and setup of the software as required by the Company. The license fee may be paid in cash or the Company s
common stock. In addition, the Synergistic Licensing Agreement was amended to delete the Company s exclusive rights under
such agreement. In addition, the Synergistic Licensing Agreement was amended to delete the Company s exclusive rights under
such agreement. We believe that use of any future working capital we raise will be better utilized by us to acquire additional
health care services companies. 

Management s Discussion, Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  

The Company s ability
to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to generate future profitable operations and/or to obtain the necessary
financing to meet its obligations, which include several new acquisitions. Management s plan includes obtaining additional
funds by equity financing and/or debt using the acquisitions cash flow and/or assets as collateral, however there is no assurance
of additional funding being available. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as
a going concern. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might arise as a result of this uncertainty. 

In order to meet our need
for cash we are attempting to raise money from the various investor groups which include institutions and high net worth individuals.
In January of 2014, the Company was listed on the OTCQB tier of the OTC Markets. If we do not raise all of the money we need from
the public exchange, we will have to find alternative sources, such as a second public offering, a private placement of securities,
or loans from third party sources. 

Our current plans, predicated
on raising $10,000,000 from the sale of shares of common stock will allow the Company to meet the milestones and requirements of
its proposed acquisitions. The use of proceeds from the planned capital raise will be to fund future acquisitions. In addition,
the Company will use excess funds to cover general corporate expenses, as well as the implementation of its technology into the
operations of the acquired companies. . As a result of the Termination Agreement with BHCA (See Note 5) our only operating facility
is SCI. Revenues from SCI have significantly decreased primarily due to the sudden departure of the administrator of SCI. We have
transitioned this position to a new administrator and filed these changes with IDPH (Illinois Department of Public Health). There
are claims to be processed and invoiced when IDPH approves, through the uniform process, the new administrator, we expect this
to be resolved in the near future. 

The Company has contacted
several debt providers for both asset backed lending and cash flow lending. These include commercial banks as well as Hedge Funds
which specialize in lower middle market lending. There is no assurance that the Company will be successful in raising debt and/or
the cost of debt may be detrimental to the operations of the acquisitions and/or the Company. 

Going Concern  

Because we had a cash overdraft
of $6,104 at September 30, 2016, which is insufficient to fund our operations and an accumulated deficit $61,188,771 there is substantial
doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The report of our independent registered public accounting firm on our
financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 contains an explanatory paragraph regarding their substantial doubt about
our ability to continue as a going concern. Our auditors  opinion is based upon our operating losses and our need to obtain
additional financing to sustain operations. Our ability to continue as a going concern will be dependent upon our ability to obtain
the necessary financing to meet our obligations and repay our liabilities when they become due, and to generate sufficient revenues
from our operations to pay our operating expenses. 

Results of Operations   

The following comparative
analysis on results of operations was based primarily on the comparative financial statements, footnotes and related information
for the periods identified below and should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes to those statements
that are included elsewhere in this report. The results related to the operation of Behavioral Health Care Associates, Ltd. a discontinued
operation (see Note 5 to our financial statements included in this report), are excluded from the following discussion. The following
is a summary of the Company s operational results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

Three months ended September 30, 2016 compared
to three months ended September 30, 2015  

Revenue   

Total revenue decreased
by $394,510 to $1,500 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $396,010 in the same period in 2015. This decrease
in total revenue is primarily due to the sudden departure of the Administrator of SCI Home Health, Inc. (d/b/a Advance Lifecare
Home Health). We have transitioned this position to a new Administrator and filed these changes with IDPH (Illinois Department
of Public Health). There are claims to be processed and invoiced when IDPH approves, through the uniform process, the new Administrator,
we expect this to be resolved in the near future. 

Gross Profit   

Gross profit decreased
by $386,983 to $1,500 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $388,483 in the same period in 2015. This decrease
in gross profit is primarily due to the sudden departure of the Administrator of SCI Home Health, Inc. (d/b/a Advance Lifecare
Home Health). As described above. 

Operating Expenses   

Total operating expenses
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased by $2,982,270 to $359,061, compared to $3,341,331 during the same period
in 2015. The decrease is principally a result of lower stock option expense and common stock issued for services, and lower operating
cost for SCI Home Health, Inc. (d/b/a Advance Lifecare Home Health). 

Other Income (Expenses)   

Total other income for
the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased by $879,943 to $170,793, compared to other expenses of $709,150 during the
same period in 2015. The increase is due to lower interest expense and financing costs for the three months ended September 30,
2016 as a result of penalty interest incurred in the same period in 2015 and by a gain related to the change in the value of our
derivative liability all in connection with the issuance of convertible notes payable during the 2016 period. 

Discontinued Operations   

On March 31, 2016, we, Blaise J. Wolfrum, M.D.,
and Behavioral Health Care Associates, Ltd. ( BHCA ) executed a Termination Agreement by which the SPA was terminated

Agreement. 

Net Loss   

The net loss for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 was $186,768, a decrease of $3,477,542 compared to $3,664,310 during the same period in 2015, as
a result of factors described above.

Revenue   

Total revenue decreased
by $1,149,198 to $1,500 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $1,150,698 in the same period in 2015. This decrease
in total revenue is primarily due to the sudden departure of the Administrator of SCI Home Health, Inc. (d/b/a Advance Lifecare
Home Health). We have transitioned this position to a new Administrator and filed these changes with IDPH (Illinois Department
of Public Health). There are claims to be processed and invoiced when IDPH approves, through the uniform process, the new Administrator,
we expect this to be resolved in the near future.

Gross profit decreased
by $1,075,912 to $1,500 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $1,077,412 in the same period in 2015. This decrease
in gross profit is primarily due to the sudden departure of the Administrator of SCI Home Health, Inc. (d/b/a Advance Lifecare
Home Health). As described above. 

Operating Expenses   

Total operating expenses
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased by $11,603,020 to $1,480,280, compared to $13,083,300 during the same period
in 2015. The decrease is principally a result of lower stock option expense and common stock issued for services, and lower operating

Total other expenses for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 decreased by $1,469,710 to $22,455, compared to $1,492,165 during the same period in 2015.
The decrease is due to lower interest expense and financing costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as a result of penalty
interest incurred in the same period in 2015 offset by a gain related to the change in the value of our derivative liability all
in connection with the issuance of convertible notes payable during the 2016 period. 

Discontinued Operations   

On March 31, 2016, we, Blaise J. Wolfrum, M.D.,
and Behavioral Health Care Associates, Ltd. ( BHCA ) executed a Termination Agreement by which the SPA was terminated
effect as of January 1, 2016. BHCA is accounted for as a discontinued operation as of January 1, 2016. 

The following table displays summarized activity
in the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated statements of operations for discontinued operations during the nine months
ended September 30, 2015. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
there was no activity in the Company s unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations as a result of the Termination
Agreement. 

As a result of the Termination Agreement, the
Company recognized a gain from the disposal of BHCA of $4,239,585, principally a result of the cancelation of the $4,550,000 subordinated
unsecured note payable 

Net Income (Loss)   

The net income for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $2,738,350, an increase of $15,862,816 compared to a net loss of $13,124,466 during the
same period in 2015, as a result of factors described above, principally the gain on the disposition of BHCA. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

Liquidity is the ability
of an enterprise to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet its needs for cash requirements. As of September 30, 2016, our working
capital deficit amounted to $2,401,513, a decrease of $3,994,304 as compared to working capital deficit of $6,395,817 as of December
31, 2015. This decrease is primarily a result of the cancelation of the $4,550,000 subordinated unsecured note payable as a result
of the Termination Agreement with BHCA. Working capital deficit at September 30, 2016 included current assets of $31,143 offset
by current liabilities of $2,432,656. 

Net cash used in operating
activities was $217,673 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to net cash provided by operating activities of
$10,210 in the same period in 2015. The increase in cash used in operating activities is primarily attributable the lack of revenue
generated from operations in 2016. 

Net cash used in investing
activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $481,188 compared to $3,767 in the same period in 2015. The increase
was a result of the cash retained by BHCA as a result of the Termination Agreement. 

Net cash provided by financing
activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $224,297 compared to $219,502 in the same period in 2015. The increase
is primarily a result of the proceeds from convertible notes payable and advances from related parties. 

Cash Requirements  

Our future capital requirements
will depend on numerous factors, including the extent we continue to make acquisitions and our ability to control costs. It s
estimated the minimum amount of capital the company needs to raise over the next twelve months is $10,000,000 to pay debts incurred,
fund future acquisitions and continue operations. We will be reliant upon shareholder loans, private placements or public offerings
of debt and equity to fund our planned acquisitions and systems roll-out. There can be no assurance that additional capital will
be available to us. Other than the Standby Equity Purchase Agreement we entered into with Lambert Private Equity, LLC to sell,
subject to certain restrictions and conditions, up to $100,000,000 (which can be extended to $200,000,000 under the same terms)
of our common stock, we currently have no agreements, arrangements or understandings with any person to obtain funds through bank
loans, lines of credit or any other sources. We are not currently eligible to sell all of the securities under the Standby Equity
Purchase Agreement and cannot determine when we will meet all the requirements necessary in order to begin selling securities under
this agreement. Consequently, we have no arrangements or plans currently in effect that would allow us to immediately raise capital
and our inability to raise funds for the above purposes will have a severe negative impact on our ability to carry out our plans
to complete acquisitions and fund our operations. 

We do not currently have
any contractual restrictions on our ability to incur debt and, accordingly we could incur significant amounts of indebtedness to
finance operations. Any such indebtedness could contain covenants which would restrict our operations. 

Going Concern  

As reflected in the unaudited
consolidated financial statements of the Company included in this report, we reported a net loss from continuing operations of
$1,501,235 and at September 30, 2016, a working capital deficit, stockholders  deficit and accumulated deficit of $2,401,513,
$2,392,319 and $61,188,771, respectively. These matters raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.
The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on our ability to further implement our business plan, raise
additional capital, and generate positive cash flow. The unaudited consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments
that might be necessary if we are unable to continue as a going concern. 

Critical Accounting Policies  

We have identified the
following policies below as critical to our business and results of operations. Our reported results are impacted by the application
of the following accounting policies, certain of which require management to make subjective or complex judgments. These judgments
involve making estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may significantly impact quarterly or annual
results of operations. For all of these policies, management cautions that future events rarely develop exactly as expected, and
the best estimates routinely require adjustment. Specific risks associated with these critical accounting policies are described
in the following paragraphs. 

Use of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial
Statements  

The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those
estimates. 

Derivative Financial Instruments  

We evaluate all of our
agreements to determine if such instruments have derivatives or contain features that qualify as embedded derivatives. For derivative
financial instruments that are accounted for as liabilities, the derivative instrument is initially recorded at its fair value
and is then re-valued at each reporting date, with changes in the fair value reported in the statements of operations. For stock-based
derivative financial instruments, we use the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model to value the derivative instruments at inception
and on subsequent valuation dates. The classification of derivative instruments, including whether such instruments should be recorded
as liabilities or as equity, is evaluated at the end of each reporting period. Derivative instrument liabilities are classified
in the balance sheet as current or non-current based on whether or not net-cash settlement of the derivative instrument could be
required within 12 months of the balance sheet date. Our only derivative financial instrument was an embedded conversion feature
associated with convertible notes due to the conversion price being a percentage of the market price of our common stock. 

Stock-based Compensation  

ASC 718,  Compensation-Stock
Compensation  requires recognition in the financial statements of the cost of employee services received in exchange for
an award of equity instruments over the period the employee is required to perform the services in exchange for the award (presumptively
the vesting period). We measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award based on the grant-date fair value
of the award. We account for non-employee share-based awards based upon ASC 505-50,  Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees. 
ASC 505-50 requires the costs of goods and services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments to be recognized using
the fair value of the goods and services or the fair value of the equity award, whichever is more reliably measurable. The fair
value of the equity award is determined on the measurement date, which is the earlier of the date that a performance commitment
is reached or the date that performance is complete. Generally, our awards do not entail performance commitments. When an award
vests over time such that performance occurs over multiple reporting periods, we estimate the fair value of the award as of the
end of each reporting period and recognize an appropriate portion of the cost based on the fair value on that date. When the award
vests, we adjust the cost previously recognized so that the cost ultimately recognized is equivalent to the fair value on the vesting
date, which is presumed to be the date performance is complete. 

Inflation  

In the opinion of management,
inflation has not and will not have a material effect on our operations in the immediate future. Management will continue to monitor
inflation and evaluate the possible future effects of inflation on our business and operations. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements   

Under SEC regulations,
we are required to disclose our off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect
on our financial condition, such as changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital
expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors. As of September 30, 2016 we have no off-balance sheet arrangements. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND
QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.  

Because we are a Smaller
Reporting Company, we are not required to provide the information required by this item. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.  

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  

Under the supervision and
with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial and accounting officer,
we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined
in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by this report (the  Evaluation
Date ). Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal accounting officer concluded as of the Evaluation
Date that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective such that the material information required to be included
in our SEC reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms relating
to us, and was made known to them by others within those entities, particularly during the period when this report was being prepared. 

The specific material weaknesses
identified by our management relate to limited resources and our inadequate number of personnel to allow for proper segregation
of duties and the requisite internal controls and application of GAAP. John F. Wallin functions as our Chief Executive Officer
and Chief Financial Officer and as such, has not established adequate processes and channels of communication to provide the timely
and accurate flow of information to others. This weakness in internal controls has prevented the timely recording of company transactions
and execution of reliable financial closing procedures. Management has determined that our internal audit function is also significantly
deficient due to insufficient resources to perform internal audit functions. Finally, management determined that the lack of an
Audit Committee of our Board of Directors also contributes to insufficient oversight of our accounting and audit functions. Also,
certain aspects of the financial reporting process were materially deficient because it lacked a sufficient complement of personnel
with a level of accounting expertise and an adequate supervisory review structure that is commensurate with the Company s
financial reporting requirements. 

We expect to be materially
dependent upon a third party to provide us with accounting consulting services for the foreseeable future. Until such time as we
have a chief financial officer with the requisite expertise in U.S. GAAP, there are no assurances that the material weaknesses
in our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting will not result in errors in our financial
statements which could lead to a restatement of those financial statements. 

Our management, including
our principal executive officer and our principal financial officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures
or our internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can
provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control
system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their
costs. Due to the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all
control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our Company have been detected. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting  

There were no changes identified
in connection with our internal control over financial reporting during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
