NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) 

Note 1.  Description     of   the Business and Significant Accounting Policies 

Description of the Business 

Steel Dynamics, Inc. (SDI), together with its subsidiaries (the company), is one of the largest domestic steel producers and metals recyclers. The company has   three   reportable segments, consistent w  ith how it manages the business  : steel operations, metals recycling operations, and steel fabrication operations.  

Steel Operations Segment.    Steel operations include the company s Butler Flat Roll Division, Columbus Flat Roll Division, The Techs galvanizing lines, Structural and Rail Division, Engineered Bar Products Division, Vulcan Threaded Products (since its acquisition on August 1, 2016), Roanoke Bar Division, Steel of West Virginia, and Iron Dynamics (IDI), a liquid pig iron (scrap substitute) production facility that supplies solely the Butler Flat Roll Division. These operations include electric arc furnace steel mills, producing steel from ferrous scrap and scrap substitutes, utilizing continuous casting, automated rolling mills, and   ten   downstream coating lines, and one downstream SBQ processing facility. Steel operations accounted for   74%   and   69%   of the company s consolidated external net sales during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and   72%   and   69%   of the company s consolidated external net sales during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Metals Recycling Operations Segment.   Metals recycling operations include the company s metals recycling processing locations, and ferrous scrap procurement operations, of OmniSource Corporation.   Metals recycling operations accounted for   15%   and   18%   of the company s consolidated external net sales during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and   15%   and   19%   of the company s consolidated external net sales during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Steel Fabrication Operations Segment.    Steel fabrication operations include the company s   eight   New Millennium Building Systems  joist and deck plants located throughout the United States, and in Northern Mexico. Revenues from these plants are generated from the fabrication of trusses, girders, steel joists and steel deck used within the non-residential construction industry. Steel fabrication operations accounted for approximately   8%   and   9%   of the company s consolidated external net sales during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and   9%   and   8%   of the company s consolidated external net sales during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Other.   The       Other  category consists of   subsidiary operations that are below the quantitative thresholds required for reportable segments and primarily consist of our Minnesota ironmaking operations that were indefinitely idled in May 2015, and several smaller joint ventures. Also included in  Other  are certain unallocated corporate accounts, such as the company s senior secured credit facility, senior notes, certain other investments and certain profit sharing expenses. 

Significant Accounting Policies 

Principles of Consolidation  .    The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of SDI, together with its wholly and majority-owned or controlled subsidiaries, after elimination of intercompany accounts and transactions. Noncontrolling interests represent the noncontrolling owner s proportionate share in the equity, income, or losses of the company s majority-owned or controlled consolidated subsidiaries.   

Use of Estimates.      These financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, and accordingly, include amounts that require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and in the notes thereto. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the carrying value of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, and goodwill; valuation allowances for trade receivables, inventories and deferred income tax assets; unrecognized tax benefits; potential environmental liabilities; and litigation claims and settlements. Actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions.   

In the opinion of management, these financial statements reflect all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the interim period results. These financial statements and notes should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto included in the company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.

Note 1.  Description of the Business and Significant Accounting Policies (Continued)  

Goodwill  .  The company s goodwill is allocated to the following reporting units at September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, (in thousands): 

OmniSource goodwill decreased   $4.8   million from December 31, 2015 to September 30, 2016, in recognition of the 2016 tax benefit related to the normal amortization of the component of OmniSource tax-deductible goodwill in excess of book goodwill. 

Recently Issued Accounting Standards 

In May 2014, the FASB issued guidance codified in ASC 606, Revenue Recognition   Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which amends the guidance in former ASC 605, Revenue Recognition.  The core principle of ASC 606 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Because the guidance in ASC 606 is principles-based, it can be applied to all contracts with customers regardless of industry-specific or transaction-specific fact patterns. Additionally, ASC 606 requires additional disclosures to help users of financial statements better understand the nature, amount, timing, and potential uncertainty of revenue that is recognized. This guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017, but can be early adopted for annual and interim periods ending after December 15, 2016. The company is currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of ASC 606, including the timing and method of adoption. 

In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory, which requires an entity to measure inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value, rather than at the lower of cost or market.  This new guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016, but can be early adopted. The company is currently evaluating the impact of this ASU s adoption. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842): which establishes a new lease accounting model that requires lessees to recognize a right of use asset and related lease liability for most leases having lease terms of more than 12 months.  Leases with a term of 12 months or less will be accounted for similar to existing guidance for operating leases.  This new guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018, but can be early adopted.  The company is currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of ASU 2016-02, including the timing of adoption.   

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Improvement to Employee Share-based Payment Accounting, which simplifies several aspects of accounting for share-based payment transactions, including recognizing excess tax benefits and deficiencies as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement and as operating activities within the statement of cash flows, and an option to recognize gross stock compensation expense with actual forfeitures recognized as incurred. This new guidance is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016, but can be early adopted.  The company is currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of ASU 2016-09, including the timing of adoption.   

Note 2.  Acquisitions 

Vulcan Threaded Products, Inc.       

On August 1, 2016, the company completed its acquisition of   100%   of Vulcan Threaded Products, Inc. (Vulcan) for   $113.0   million, inclusive of   $  29.2   million in working capital, which is subject to typical post-closing adjustments. The purchase price was paid in cash from available funds. Post-closing operating results of Vulcan are reflected in the steel operations reporting segment.   Unaudited proforma operating results as if the acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2015, have not been presented as the effect to 2015 and 2016 consolidated operating results is not significant.   Vulcan is the nation s largest manufacturer and supplier of threaded rod products, and also cold drawn and heat treated steel bar. The acquisition of Vulcan is consistent with one of our target growth objectives   higher-margin downstream business opportunities that utilize our steel products in their manufacturing processes. Vulcan utilizes special-bar-quality products produced at our Engineered Bar Products Division.

Note 2.  Acquisitions   (Continued) 

The aggregate purchase price was allocated on a preliminarily basis to the opening balance sheet of V  ulcan as of the August 1, 2016,   acquisition date. The following initial allocation of the purchase price (in thousands) is preliminary. The accounting for the acquisition has not yet been finalized    based on the company s   valuation of the acquired assets, assumed liabilities and identifiable intangible assets, including goodwill, if any.   The preliminary fair values were determined using various valuation techniques that in each case used Level 3 inputs as provided for under ASC 820. 

The preliminary assessment allocates   $32.9 million of the purchase price to   the following intangible assets, including   customer relationships, trade n  ame, and noncompete agreements  . The company plans to utilize an accelerated amortization methodology to follow the pattern in which the economic benefits of the customer relationship intangible asset is anticipated to be consumed. The company plans to amortize the   intangible assets related to the   trade name and noncompete agreements using a straight line methodology. However, the expected lives and specific amortization methods are subject to finalization of the company s valuation process.   

Consolidated Systems, Inc.       

On September 14, 2015, the company purchased from CSi certain of its steel deck facilities (including associated assets) and net working capital of approximately   $30.0   million, for a purchase price of   $45.0   million in cash. Operating results of these facilities have been reflected in the company s financial statements under the steel fabrication operations since the September 14, 2015, purchase date. The purchased assets include two deck facilities located in Memphis, Tennessee, and Phoenix, Arizona. Producing both standard and premium specialty deck profiles, the new locations will allow for enhanced geographic reach into the southwestern and western markets, and further diversify New Millennium Building Systems  product offerings.  

Note 3.  Earnings Per Share  

Basic earnings per share is based on the weighted average shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share assumes the weighted average dilutive effect of common share equivalents outstanding during the period applied to the company s basic earnings per share. Common share equivalents represent potentially dilutive stock options, restricted stock units and deferred stock units; and are excluded from the computation in periods in which they have an anti-dilutive effect. There were   no   anti-dilutive common share equivalents at or for the three- and nine- month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. 

The following table presents a reconciliation of the numerators and the denominators of the company s basic and diluted earnings per share computations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands, except per share data):

Note 4.  Inventories 

Inventories are stated at lower of cost or market. Cost is determined using a weighted average cost method for scrap, and on a first-in, first-out, basis for other inventory. Inventory consisted of the following (in thousands): 

Note 5.  Debt 

On March 16, 2015, the company called and repaid all   $350.0   million of its outstanding   7   5/8% Senior Notes due 2020 (the  Notes ) at a redemption price of   103.813%   of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the date of redemption. Associated premiums and the write off of deferred financing costs of approximately   $16.7   million were recorded in other expense in conjunction with the redemption. 

Note 6.  Changes in Equity 

The following table provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending carrying amounts of total equity, equity attributable to stockholders of Steel Dynamics, Inc. and equity and redeemable amounts attributable to the noncontrolling interests (in thousands): 

Note 7.  Derivative Financial Instruments 

The company is exposed to certain risks relating to its ongoing business operations. The company utilizes derivative instruments to mitigate commodity margin risk, interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk. The company routinely enters into forward exchange traded futures and option contracts to manage the price risk associated with nonferrous metals inventory as well as purchases and sales of nonferrous metals (primarily aluminum and copper).  The company offsets fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty under master netting agreements.

Note 7.  Derivative Financial Instruments (Continued) 

Commodity Futures Contracts  .  If the company is  long  on futures contracts, it means the company has more futures contracts purchased than futures contracts sold for the underlying commodity. If the company is  short  on a futures contract, it means the company has more futures contracts sold than futures contracts purchased for the underlying commodity. The following summarizes the company s futures contract commitments as of September 30, 2016 (MT represents metric tons): 

The following summarizes the location and amounts of the fair values reported on the company s balance sheets as of September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, and gains and losses related to derivatives included in the company s statement of income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands): 

The fair value of the above derivative instruments along with required margin deposit amounts with the same counterparty under master netting arrangements totaled $1  .7 million   at September 30, 2016, and $3.4 million at December 31, 2015, are reflected in other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets.

Note 7.  Derivative Financial Instruments (Continued) 

Derivatives accounted for as fair value hedges had ineffectiveness resulting in losses of $84,000 and $191,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively; and losses of $175,000 and $64,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Losses excluded from hedge effectiveness testing of $60,000 and $1.2 million increased cost of goods sold during the three months ended September 30, 2016, and September 30, 2015.  Losses excluded from hedge effectiveness testing of $125,000 and $1.2 million increased costs of goods sold during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.   

Note 8.  Fair Value Measurements 

FASB accounting standards provide a comprehensive framework for measuring fair value and sets forth a definition of fair value and establishes a hierarchy prioritizing the inputs to valuation techniques, giving the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable value inputs.  Levels within the hierarchy are defined as follows:   

Level 1 Unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets;     

Level 2 Quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets (other than those included in Level 1) which are observable for         

the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; and 

Level 3 Valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are             

unobservable. 

The following table sets forth financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis in the consolidated balance sheet and the respective   levels   to which the fair value measurements are classified within the fair value hierarchy as of September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015 (in thousands):      

The carrying amounts of financial instruments including cash and equivalents approximate fair value. The fair values of commodity futures contracts are estimated by the use of quoted market prices, estimates obtained from brokers, and other appropriate valuation techniques based on references available. The fair value of long-term debt, including current maturities, as determined by quoted market prices (Level 2), was approximately $2.7 billion at September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, respectively, (with a corresponding carrying amount in the consolidated balance sheet of $2.6 billion at September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015).

Note 9.  Commitments and Contingencies 

Although, as noted below, a tentative settlement has been reached in the case, the company has to date been involved, along with two other remaining non-settling defendant steel manufacturing companies, from an original group of eight, in a direct purchaser class action antitrust suit in federal court in Chicago, Illinois, under the caption of   Standard Iron Works v Arcelor Mittal, et al  .  Two other complaints, not yet settled, were brought on behalf of a purported class of indirect purchasers of steel products within the same time period. The company has a pending motion to dismiss in that case. The complaints allege a conspiracy to limit output on the part of the defendants, in order to fix, raise, maintain and stabilize the price at which steel products were sold in the United States during a specified period between 2005 and 2007. The complaints seek treble damages and costs, including reasonable attorney fees, pre- and post-judgment interest and injunctive relief. In September 2015, the Court denied class certification on the issue of antitrust impact and damages, but granted class certification on the limited issue of the alleged conspiracy.  

In October 2016, the company announced that it had entered into an agreement to settle the direct purchaser case for a payment of $4.6 million. Preliminary approval was granted by the court on November 3, 2016, and final approval by the Court is also expected to be forthcoming. During the approval process, members of the class will be given an opportunity to opt-out of the class and retain their own individual rights.  

Due to the uncertain nature of litigation, the company cannot presently predict either the final outcome of the proposed settlement process, including whether there may be opt-outs from the settlement, or the outcome of the remaining indirect purchaser case.  Based on the information available at this time, however, the company has determined that, apart from the proposed settlement amount in the direct case, there is not presently a  reasonable possibility  (as that term is defined in ASC 450-20-20), that the outcome of the remaining unresolved matters will have a material impact on the Company s financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. Although not presently necessary or appropriate to make a dollar estimate of exposure to loss, if any, in connection with these remaining matters, the company may in the future determine that a further loss accrual may be necessary. Further, although the company may make loss accruals, if and as warranted, any amounts that it may accrue from time to time could vary significantly from the amounts it actually pays, due to inherent uncertainties and the inherent shortcomings of the estimation process, the uncertainties involved in litigation and other factors. Additionally, an adverse result could have a material effect on the company s financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. 

The company is additionally involved in various routine litigation matters, including administrative proceedings, regulatory proceedings, governmental investigations, environmental matters, and commercial and construction contract disputes, none of which are expected to have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity  .

Description of the Business 

We are a domestic manufacturer of steel products and metals recycler. We have three reportable segments: steel operations, metals recycling operations, and steel fabrication operations. Steel operations include our Butler Flat Roll Division, Columbus Flat Roll Division, The Techs galvanizing lines, Structural and Rail Division, Engineered Bar Products Division,   Vulcan Threaded Products   acquired August 1, 2016 (Vulcan),   Roanoke Bar Division, Steel of West Virginia, and  Iron Dynamics, a liquid pig iron (scrap substitute) production facility that supplies solely the Butler Flat Roll Division. These   operations   include electric arc furnace steel mills, producing steel from ferrous scrap and scrap substitutes, utilizing continuous casting, automated rolling mills, and ten downstream coating facilities  , and one downstream SBQ processing facility  .    Metals recycling operations include our metals recycling processing locations, and ferrous scrap procurement operations, of OmniSource Corporation  . Steel fabrication operations include our eight New Millennium Building Systems  joist and deck plants located throughout the United States  ,   and   in   Northern Mexico. Revenues from these plants are generated from the fabrication of trusses, girders, steel joists and steel deck used within the non-residential construction industry.   The       Other  category consists of   subsidiary operations that are below the quantitative thresholds required for reportable segments and primarily consist of our Minnesota ironmaking operations that were indefinitely idled in May 2015, and several smaller joint ventures. Also included in  Other  are certain unallocated corporate accounts, such as our senior secured credit facility, senior notes, certain other investments and certain profit sharing expenses. 

Operating Statement Classifications 

Net Sales  .  Net sales from our operations are a factor of volumes shipped, product mix and related pricing. We charge premium prices for certain grades of steel, product dimensions, certain smaller volumes, and for value-added processing or coating of the steel products.  Except for our steel fabrication operations, we recognize revenue from sales and the allowance for estimated costs associated with returns from these sales at the time the title of the product is   transferred   to the customer. Provision is made for estimated product returns and customer claims based on estimates and actual historical experience. Net sales from steel fabrication operations are recognized from construction contracts utilizing a percentage of completion methodology based on steel tons used on completed units to date as a percentage of estimated total steel tons required for each contract.  

Costs of Goods Sold  .  Our costs of goods sold represent all direct and indirect costs associated with the manufacture of our products. The principal elements of these costs are scrap and scrap substitutes (which represent the most significant single component of our consolidated costs of goods sold), steel, direct and indirect labor and related benefits, alloys, zinc, transportation and freight, repairs and maintenance, utilities (most notably electricity and natural gas), and depreciation. 

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  .  Selling, general and administrative expenses consist of all costs associated with our sales, finance and accounting, and administrative departments. These costs include, among other items, labor and related benefits, professional services, insurance premiums, property taxes, company-wide profit sharing, and amortization of intangible and other assets. 

Interest Expense, net of Capitalized Interest  .  Interest expense consists of interest associated with our senior credit facilities and other debt net of interest costs that are required to be capitalized during the construction period of certain capital investment projects.   

19   

Other (Income) Expense  ,   net  .  Other income consists of interest income earned on our temporary cash deposits and investments; any other non-operating income activity, including income from non-consolidated investments accounted for under the equity method. Other expense consists of any non-operating costs, such as certain acquisition and financing expenses. 

Results Overview       

Consolidated operating income increased $152.8 million, or 117%, to $283.9 million for the third quarter 2016, compared to $131.0 million for the third quarter 2015. Third quarter 2016 net income increased $  96.8   million, or   160  %, to $  157.4   million, from $  60  .6 million for the   third   quarter 2015.  

Consolidated operating income increased $  363.6   million, or   118  %, to $  671.9   million for the first   nine months   of 2016, compared to $  308.4   million for the first   nine months   of 2015. First   nine months   2016 net income increased $  239.2   million, or   195  %, to $  362.1   million, from $  122.9   million for the first   nine months   of 2015. 

Our consolidated results for the third quarter and first nine months of 2016 benefited from continued positive momentum in the sheet steel supply environment, driving improved sheet steel metal   spreads  , as well as increased metal   spread   and operating cost reductions in our metals recycling operations. Underlying domestic steel consumption remains relatively   consistent  , with the heavy equipment, agriculture and energy markets remaining weak, while automotive and non-residential construction markets remain steady. Sheet steel import levels declined approximately 20% during the first nine months of 2016 as compared to the first nine months of 2015, amidst the duties levied pursuant to the trade cases filed with the US International Trade Commission, and customer inventory levels remained low compared to historical averages. While domestic steel mill utilization rates have flattened in the first nine months of 2016 compared to the first nine months of 2015,   resulting in lower ferrous volumes in our metals recycling operations,   our   metal spreads have   improved, particularly in nonferrous materials  , and we have benefi  ted from continued   operational   cost cutting efforts. The non-residential construction market for our steel fabrication operations remains   strong  , resulting in increased   shipments; however, average selling   prices   have contracted and rising steel input costs   have   resulted in   compressed metal   spread   during 2016.    

Segment Operating Results 2016 vs. 2015 (  dollars in thousands  ) 

20   

Steel Operations Segment  

Steel Operations Segment  .    Steel operations consist of our six electric arc furnace steel mills, producing steel from ferrous scrap and scrap substitutes, utilizing continuous casting, automated rolling mills, and ten downstream coating lines  , one downstream SBQ processing facility  , and IDI, our liquid pig production facility that supplies solely our Butler Flat Roll Division mill. Our steel operations sell directly to end users and service centers. These products are used in numerous industry sectors, including the automotive, construction, manufacturing, transportation, heavy and agriculture equipment, and pipe and tube markets  . Steel operations accounted for 74% and 69% of our consolidated external net sales during the third quarter of 2016 and 2015, and 72% and 69% of our consolidated external net sales during the first nine months of 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Sheet Products.    Our sheet products operations consist of Butler and Columbus Flat Roll Divisions, and our downstream coating lines, including The Techs. These operations sell a broad range of sheet steel products, such as hot roll, cold roll and coated steel products, including a wide variety of specialty products, such as light gauge hot roll  ,   galvanized   and Ga  lvalume     . Butler Flat Roll Division currently sells   painted   products, while Columbus Flat Roll Division is in the   final   construction phase of a $100 million expansion to add painted capacity. The   Techs is comprised of three galvanizing lines which sell specialized galvanized sheet steels used in non-automotive applications  .

Segment Results 2016 vs. 2015 

Overall   steel operations performance in the third quarter and first nine months of 2016 benefited from continued positive momentum in the sheet steel supply environment. Sheet steel import levels have declined approximately 20% during the first nine months of 2016 compared to the first nine months of 2015, amidst the duties levied pursuant to the trade case rulings from the US International Trade Commission, and customer inventory levels remained low compared to historical levels, supporting higher domestic shipments  ,   and thus higher   company   steel mill utilization.   Our sheet   steel   mill utilization rate   averaged 97% for the third quarter 2016, as compared to 89% in the   third quarter 2015.   The domestic steel demand outlook remained relatively unchanged and steady, with the heavy equipment, agricultural and energy markets remaining weak, while automotive continues to be strong and construction continues to improve. Sheet steel selling prices dropped throughout 2015, before rebounding during the   first nine months   of 2016. Net sales   for   the steel operations increased 16  % in the   third   quarter 2016, when compared to the same period in 2015, as a   3  % increase in steel operations shipments   combined with an increase   of $  78 per ton, or 12  %, in average selling prices. Net s  ales for the steel operations in  creased 3% in the first   nine months   of 2016, when compared to the same period in 2015, as a   10  % increase in steel operations shipments was more than offset by a decrease of $  41   per   ton, or 6  %, in average selling prices. 

Metallic raw materials used in our electric arc furnaces represent our single most significant steel manufacturing cost. During the   third   quarter 2016 and 2015, our metallic raw material   costs represented 57% of our steel operations    manufacturing costs, excluding the operations of The Techs   and Vulcan  , which purchase, rather than produce, the steel   they   further process. Our metallic raw material cost per net ton consumed in our steel operations decreased $  2, or   1%, in the   third   quarter 2016, c  ompared to the same period in 2015  .    In the first   nine months   of 2016, our metallic raw material cost per net ton consumed decreased $  50  , or   19  %, compared to the same period in 2015. 

Operating income for the steel operations increased   147  %, to $  307.6   million, in the   third   quarter 2016, compared to the same period in 2015, due to increased steel shipments and overall steel operations metal spread (which we define as the difference between average selling prices and the cost of ferrous scrap consumed) expansion. Sheet steel metal spread expanded   37  %, while long products metal spread contracted   7  %.    First   nine months   2016 operating income increased   110  %, to $  712.9   million, compared to the first   nine months   of 2015, due to a   10  % increase   in steel shipments coupled with a 2% increase in overall steel operations metal spread  .   Sheet steel metal spread expanded   11  %, while long products metal spread contracted   10  %. 

Metals Recycling Operations Segment  

Metals Recycling Operations Segment.    Metals recycling operations include our metals recycling processing locations, and ferrous scrap procurement operations of OmniSource. OmniSource sells ferrous metals to steel mills and foundries, and nonferrous metals, such as copper, brass, aluminum and stainless steel to, among others, ingot manufacturers, copper refineries and mills, smelters, and specialty mills  . Our metals recycling operations   accounted for   15  % and   18  % of our consolidated external net sales during the third quarter of 2016 and 2015, and   15  % and   19  % of our consolidated external net sales during the first nine months of 2016 and 2015, respectively  . 

Metals Recycling Operations Shipments: 

Segment Results 2016 vs. 2015 

Metals recycling operations operating income in the third quarter 2016 of $6.2 million was 273% higher than the third quarter 2015 operating loss of $3.6 million, due to significant improvements in metal spread (which we define as the difference between average selling prices and the cost of purchased scrap) that more than offset shipment declines in both ferrous and nonferrous metals. Net sales decreased 8% in the third quarter 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015  , due primarily to decreased shipments  . Ferrous metal spread increased 16%, more than offsetting an 8% decrease in ferrous shipments. Overall domestic steel mill utilization was slightly lower in the third quarter 2016 compared to the third quarter 2015, even as our own steel mill utilization improved. Ferrous shipments to our own steel mills increased to 62% of total ferrous shipments in the third quarter 2016, compared to 59% during the same period in 2015. Nonferrous scrap costs declined more than the 8% decline in average selling prices during the third quarter 2016 compared to the same period in 2015, resulting in    a   27% improvement in metal spread as nonferrous shipments declined slightly. 

22   

Operating income for the metals recycling operations in the first nine months of 2016 of $20.0 million was $19.8 million higher than the first nine months of 2015, due to our continued focus on reduction of operating costs, along with improved nonferrous metal spread. Net sales decreased 14% in the first nine months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015, with ferrous and nonferrous pricing decreasing 13% and 15%, respectively. While ferrous and nonferrous shipments were comparable during the first nine months of 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015, metal spreads for ferrous metal were flat year over year, while nonferrous materials metal spread improved 14%  . 

Steel Fabrication Operations Segment  

Steel fabrication operations include our eight New Millennium Building Systems  joist and deck plants located throughout the United States  ,   and   in   Northern   Mexico  . Revenues from these plants are generated from the fabrication of trusses, girders, steel joists and steel deck used within the non-residential construction industry. Steel fabrication operations   accounted for   8  % and   9  % of our consolidated external net sales during the third quarter of 2016 and 2015, and   9  % and   8  % of our consolidated external net sales during the first nine months of 2016 and 2015, respectively  .   

Segment Results 2016 vs. 2015 

The overall non-residential construction market has continued to remain strong; however, declines in selling prices coupled with increased steel input costs during the third quarter 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 resulted in metal spread   (which we define as the difference between average selling prices and the cost of purchased steel) compression  . Net sales for the steel fabrication operations increased $3.7 million, or 2%, during the third quarter 2016,   compared   to the same period in 2015,   as   shipments increased 11%, while average selling prices decreased $106 per ton, or 8%.  Net sales for the segment increased $39.9 million, or 8%, in the first nine months of 2016, compared to the first nine months of 2015, as shipments increased 23%, offsetting a 12% decrease in average selling prices. Our steel fabrication operations continue to leverage our national operating footprint to sustain market share, and market demand continues to be steady. 

The purchase of various steel products is the largest single cost of production for our steel fabrication operations, generally representing approximately two-thirds of the total cost of manufacturing. The average cost of steel consumed increased by 5% in the third quarter 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015. In addition, selling prices declined 8% causing metal spread to decline   19%  , resulting in a 52% decrease in operating income to $17.8 million in the third quarter 2016, as compared to $36.7 million in the same period in 2015. Segment operating income of $73.3 million in the first nine months of 2016 decreased 15%, from $85.8 million in the first nine months of 2015, as increased shipments of 23% were more than offset by   an 11%   decrease   in   metal spreads  . 

23   

Other Operations  

Other operations consists of subsidiary operations that are below the quantitative thresholds required for reportable segments and primarily consist of our Minnesota ironmaking operations that were indefinitely idled in May 2015, and several smaller joint ventures. Also included in  Other  are certain unallocated corporate accounts, such as the company s senior secured credit facility, senior notes, certain other investments and certain profit sharing expenses  . Prior to being indefinitely idled, our Minnesota ironmaking operations experienced operating losses, which have been significantly curtailed post-idling. The second quarter 2015 Minnesota ironmaking operations operating losses included $21.0 million of inventory lower-of-cost or market charges associated with the idle decision. 

Third   Quarter Consolidated Results 2016 vs. 2015  

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses.   Selling, general and administrative expenses (including profit sharing and amortization of intangible assets) of $124.  6   million during the   third   quarter 2016 increased   28  % from $  97.7   million during the   third   quarter 2015,   representing approximately   5.9  % and   5.0  % of net sales, respectively  . The increase in the   third   quarter 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 is due most notably to increased performance-based incentive compensation, including profit sharing, associated with our increased profitability. 

Interest Expense, net of Capitalized Interest.    During the   third   quarter 2016, interest expense of $36.  2   million was comparable to $37  .1   million during the same period in 2015, on comparable debt levels. 

Other Expense, net.    During the   third quarter   of 2016, net other   expense   was $  4.4   million compared to   $239,000   in the same period in 2015  .     The increase in 2016 was due to $4.6 million of estimated litigation settlement charges  . 

Income Tax Expense  .    During the   third   quarter 2016, our income tax expense was $  88.  9 million at an effective income tax rate of 36.5%, as compared to $  34.8   million at   a comparable   effective income tax rate of   37.2  %, during the   third quarter 2015  . 

First   Nine     Months   Consolidated Results 2016 vs. 2015  

Selling, General and Administrative Expenses.   Selling, general and administrative expenses (including profit sharing and amortization of intangible assets) of $  353.0   million during the first   nine months   of 2016 increased 26% from $  279.2   million during the first   nine months   of 2015,   representing approximately 6.0% and 4.6  % of net   sales  , respectively  . The increase in the first   nine months   2016 compared to the same period in 2015 is due most notably to increased performance-based incentive compensation, including profit sharing, associated with our increased profitability. 

Interest Expense, net of Capitalized Interest.    During the first   nine months   of 2016, interest expense decreased $  7.4   million to $  109.9   million, when compared to the same period in 2015. The decrease in interest expense is due primarily to the call and prepayment of our $350.0 million 7   5  /  8  % Senior Notes due 2020, in March 2015. 

Other Expense, net.    During the first   nine months   of 2016, net other   expense   was $  741,000   compared to $15.  2   million in the same period in 2015, which included $16.7 million of call premium and other finance expenses associated with the March 2015 senior note call and prepayment. 

Income Tax Expense  .    During the first   nine months   of 2016, our income tax expense was $  205.1   million at an e  ffective income tax rate of 36.5  %, as compared to $  64.7   million at   comparable   effective incom  e tax rate of 36.8  %, during the first   nine months   of 2015. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

Capital Resources and Long   term Debt.   Our business is capital intensive and requires substantial expenditures for, among other things, the purchase and maintenance of equipment   used   in our steel, metals recycling, and steel fabrication operations, and to remain in compliance with environmental laws. Our short-term and long-term liquidity needs arise primarily from working capital requirements, capital expenditures, principal and interest payments related to our outstanding indebtedness, dividends to our shareholders, and acquisitions. We have met these liquidity requirements primarily with cash provided by operations and long-term borrowings, and we also have availability under our Revolver  . Our liquidity at   September   30, 2016, is as follows (in thousands): 

Our total outstanding debt remained relatively unchanged during the first   nine months   of 2016 at $2.6 billion. Our total long-term debt to capitalization ratio (representing our long-term debt, including current maturities, divided by the sum of our long-term debt, redeemable noncontrolling interests, and our total stockholders  equity) was   46.7  % at   September   30, 2016, compared to 49.3% at December 31, 2015. 

24   

We have a senior secured credit facility (Facility) that matures in November 2019 which provides for a $1.2 billion Revolver along with a term loan facility. Subject to certain conditions, we also have the ability to increase the combined facility size by a minimum of $750 million. The Facility contains financial and other covenants pertaining to our ability (which may under certain circumstances be limited) to make capital expenditures; incur indebtedness; permit liens on property; enter into transactions with affiliates; make restricted payments or investments; enter into mergers, acquisitions or consolidations; conduct asset sales; pay dividends or distributions and enter into other specified transactions and activities. Our ability to borrow funds within the terms of the Revolver is dependent upon our continued compliance with the financial and other covenants. At   September   30, 2016, we had $1.2 billion of availability on the Revolver, $12.  1   million of outstanding letters of credit and other obligations which reduce availability, and there were no borrowings outstanding. 

The financial covenants under our Facility state that we must maintain an interest coverage ratio of not less than 2.50:1.00. Our interest coverage ratio is calculated by dividing our last-twelve trailing months (LTM) consolidated adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and certain other non-cash transactions as allowed in our Facility) by our LTM gross interest expense, less amortization of financing fees. In addition, a net debt (as defined in the Facility) to consolidated LTM adjusted EBITDA (net debt leverage ratio) of not more than 5.00:1.00 must be maintained. If the net debt leverage ratio exceeds 3.50:1:00 at any time, our ability to make certain payments as defined in the Facility (which includes cash dividends to stockholders and share purchases, among other things), is limited. At   September   30, 2016, our interest coverage ratio and net debt leverage ratio were   7.36  :1.00 and 2.  01  :1.00, respectively. We were, therefore, in compliance with these covenants at   September   30, 2016, and we anticipate we will continue to be in compliance during the   next twelve months  .   

Working Capital.     We generated cash flow from operations of $  643.2   million in the first   nine months   of 2016. Operational working capital (representing amounts invested in trade receivables and inventories, less current liabilities other than income taxes payable and debt) of $1.3 billion at   September   30, 2016  ,   was   comparable to   that at December 31, 2015. Increases in volumes, pricing and profitability have resulted in increased accounts receivable and inventory, which have been offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses  .   

Capital Investments.        During the first   nine months   of 2016, we invested $  123.2   million in property, plant and equipment, primarily within our steel operations segment, compared with $  86.5   million invested during the same period in 2015.   The increase in 2016 is primarily due to our   Columbus Flat Roll Division s $100 million expansion to add painted and Galvalume      capacity. 

Cash Dividends.        As a reflection of continued confidence in our current and future cash flow generation ability and financial position, we increased our quarterly cash dividend by 2% to $0.1400 per share in the first quarter 2016 (from $0.1375 per share in 2015), resulting in declared cash dividends of $  102.3   million during the first   nine months   of 2016, compared to $  99.8   million during the same period in 2015. We paid cash dividends of $  101.6   million and $  94.3   million during the first   nine months   of 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our board of directors, along with executive management, approves the payment of dividends on a quarterly basis. The determination to pay cash dividends in the future is at the discretion of our board of directors, after taking into account various factors, including our financial condition, results of operations, outstanding indebtedness, current and anticipated cash needs and growth plans. In addition, the terms of our senior secured credit facility and the indenture relating to our senior notes may restrict the amount of cash dividends we can pay  . 

Other.    Our ability to meet our debt service obligations and reduce our total debt will depend upon our future performance which, in turn, will depend upon general economic, financial and business conditions, along with competition, legislation and regulatory factors that are largely beyond our control. In addition, we cannot assure that our operating results, cash flows, access to credit markets and capital resources will be sufficient for repayment of our indebtedness in the   future  . We believe that based upon current levels of operations and anticipated growth, cash flows from operations, together with other available sources of funds, including additional borrowings under our Revolver through its term, will be adequate for the next twelve months for making required payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness, funding working capital requirements, and anticipated capital expenditures.    

In October 2016, the board of directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to $450 million of our common stock. Under the share repurchase program, purchases will take place as and when we determine in open market or private transactions made based upon the market price of our common stock, the nature of other investment opportunities or growth projects, our cash flows from operations, and general economic conditions.  The share repurchase program does not require us to acquire any specific number of shares, and may be modified, suspended, extended or terminated by us at any time  . 

ITEM 3.    QUAN    TI  TATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Interest Rate Risk 

In the normal course of business, we are exposed to interest rate changes. Our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of these rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, we occasionally use interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to our portfolio of borrowings. We did not have any interest rate swaps during the three- and   nine  -month periods ended   September   30, 2016 or 2015. 

Commodity Risk 

In the normal course of business we are exposed to the market risk and price fluctuations related to the sale of our products and to the purchase of raw materials used   in   our operations, such as metallic raw materials, electricity, natural gas and its transportation services, fuel, air products, and zinc. Our risk strategy associated with product sales has generally been to obtain competitive prices for our products and to allow operating results to reflect market price movements dictated by supply and demand  . 

25   

Our risk strategy associated with the purchase of raw materials utilized within our operations has generally been to make some commitments with suppliers relating to future expected requirements for some commodities such as electricity, natural gas and its transportation services, fuel, air products, and zinc. Certain of these commitments contain provisions which require us to  take or pay  for specified quantities without regard to actual usage generally for periods of up to 24 months for physical commodity requirements (in certain cases up to 60 months), for up to 4 years for commodity transportation requirements, and for up to 12 years for air products. We utilized such  take or pay  requirements during the past three years under these contracts, except for certain air products at our Minnesota ironmaking operations which were idled in May 2015. We believe that production requirements will be such that consumption of the products or services purchased under these commitments will occur in the normal production process, other than certain air products related to our Minnesota ironmaking operations during the idle period. We also purchase electricity consumed at our Butler Flat Roll Division pursuant to a contract which extends through December 2017. The contract designates 160 hours annually as  interruptible service  and establishes an agreed fixed-rate energy charge per Mill/kWh consumed for each year through the expiration of the agreement. 

In our metals recycling operations we have certain fixed price contracts with various customers and suppliers for future delivery of nonferrous metals. Our risk strategy has been to enter into base metal financial contracts with the goal to protect the profit margin, within certain parameters, that was contemplated   when we entered into the transaction with the customer or vendor. At September 30, 2016, we had a cumulative unrealized loss associated with these financial contracts of $1  .6   million, substantially   all of which have a settlement date within the next twelve months. We believe the customer contracts associated with the financial contracts will be fully consummated.  

ITEM 4.    CONTR    OL  S AND PROCEDURES 

(a)    Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  .    Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2016. The term  disclosure controls and procedures,  as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure   that   information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of   September 30, 2016  , our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective  . 

(b)    Changes in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting  .    No change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) occurred during the fiscal quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting  .   

26   

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1.    LEG    A  L PROCEEDINGS  

Although, as noted below, a tentative settlement has been reached in the case,   we have   to date been involved, along with two other remaining non-settling defendant steel manufacturing companies, from an original group of eight, in a direct purchaser class action antitrust suit in federal court in Chicago, Illinois, under the caption of   Standard Iron Works v Arcelor Mittal, et al  .  Two other complaints, not yet settled, were brought on behalf of a purported class of indirect purchasers of steel products within the same time period.   We have   a pending motion to dismiss in that case. The complaints allege a conspiracy to limit output on the part of the defendants, in order to fix, raise, maintain and stabilize the price at which steel products were sold in the United States during a specified period between 2005 and 2007. The complaints seek treble damages and costs, including reasonable attorney fees, pre- and post-judgment interest and injunctive relief. In September 2015, the Court denied class certification on the issue of antitrust impact and damages, but granted class certification on the limited issue of the alleged conspiracy.  

In October 2016,   we   announced that   we have   entered into an agreement to settle the direct purchaser case for a payment of $4.6 million. Preliminary approval was granted by the court on November 3, 2016, and final approval by the Court is also expected to be forthcoming. During the approval process, members of the class will be given an opportunity to opt-out of the class and retain their own individual rights.  

Due to the uncertain nature of litigation,   we   cannot presently predict either the final outcome of the proposed settlement process, including whether there may be opt-outs from the settlement, or the outcome of the remaining indirect purchaser case.  Based on the information available at this time, however,   we have   determined that, apart from the proposed settlement amount in the direct case, there is not presently a  reasonable possibility  (as that term is defined in ASC 450-20-20), that the outcome of the remaining unresolved matters will have a material impact on   our   financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. Although not presently necessary or appropriate to make a dollar estimate of exposure to loss, if any, in connection with these remaining matters,   we   may in the future determine that a further loss accrual may be necessary. Further, although   we   may make loss accruals, if and as warranted, any amounts that   we   may accrue from time to time could vary significantly from the amounts   we   actually pay, due to inherent uncertainties and the inherent shortcomings of the estimation process, the uncertainties involved in litigation and other factors. Additionally, an adverse result could have a material effect on   our   financial condition, results of operations and liquidity  . 

We are   additionally involved in various routine litigation matters, including administrative proceedings, regulatory proceedings, governmental investigations, environmental matters, and commercial and construction contract disputes, none of which are expected to have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity.
