EXPLANATORY NOTE 
  This report combines the quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   of Hudson Pacific Properties, Inc., a Maryland corporation, and Hudson Pacific Properties, L.P., a Maryland limited partnership. Unless otherwise indicated or unless the context requires otherwise, all references in this report to  we,   us,   our,  or  our Company  refer to Hudson Pacific Properties, Inc. together with its consolidated subsidiaries, including Hudson Pacific Properties, L.P. Unless otherwise indicated or unless the context requires otherwise, all references to  our operating partnership  or  the operating partnership  refer to Hudson Pacific Properties, L.P. together with its consolidated subsidiaries. 
  Hudson Pacific Properties, Inc. is a real estate investment trust, or REIT, and the sole general partner of our operating partnership. At   September 30, 2016  , Hudson Pacific Properties, Inc. owned approximately   81.6%   of the outstanding common units of partnership interest (including unvested restricted units) in our operating partnership, or common units. The remaining approximately   18.4%   of outstanding common units at   September 30, 2016   were owned by certain of our executive officers and directors, certain of their affiliates, and other outside investors, including funds affiliated with The Blackstone Group L.P. ( Blackstone ) and Farallon Capital Management, LLC. As the sole general partner of our operating partnership, Hudson Pacific Properties, Inc. has the full, exclusive and complete responsibility for our operating partnership s day-to-day management and control. 
  We believe combining the quarterly reports on Form 10-Q of Hudson Pacific Properties, Inc. and the operating partnership into this single report results in the following benefits: 
             
    enhancing investors  understanding of our Company and our operating partnership by enabling investors to view the business as a whole in the same manner as management views and operates the business; 
                
    eliminating duplicative disclosure and providing a more streamlined and readable presentation because a substantial portion of the disclosure applies to both our Company and our operating partnership; and 
                
    creating time and cost efficiencies through the preparation of one combined report instead of two separate reports. 
       
  There are a few differences between our Company and our operating partnership, which are reflected in the disclosures in this report. We believe it is important to understand the differences between our Company and our operating partnership in the context of how we operate as an interrelated, consolidated company. Hudson Pacific Properties, Inc. is a REIT, the only material assets of which are the units of partnership interest in our operating partnership. As a result, Hudson Pacific Properties, Inc. does not conduct business itself, other than acting as the sole general partner of our operating partnership, issuing equity from time to time and guaranteeing certain debt of our operating partnership. Hudson Pacific Properties, Inc. itself does not issue any indebtedness but guarantees some of the debt of our operating partnership. Our operating partnership, which is structured as a partnership with no publicly traded equity, holds substantially all of the assets of our Company and conducts substantially all of our business. Except for net proceeds from equity issuances by Hudson Pacific Properties, Inc., which are generally contributed to our operating partnership in exchange for units of partnership interest in our operating partnership, our operating partnership generates the capital required by our Company s business through its operations, its incurrence of indebtedness or through the issuance of units of partnership interest in our operating partnership. 
  The presentation of non-controlling interest, stockholders  equity and partners  capital are the main areas of difference between the consolidated financial statements of our Company and those of our operating partnership. The common units in our operating partnership are accounted for as partners  capital in our operating partnership s consolidated financial statements and, to the extent not held by our Company, as non-controlling interest in our Company s consolidated financial statements. The differences between stockholders  equity, partners  capital and non-controlling interest result from the differences in the equity issued by our Company and our operating partnership. 
  To help investors understand the significant differences between our Company and our operating partnership, this report presents the consolidated financial statements separately for our Company and our operating partnership. All other sections of this report, including  Selected Financial Data,   Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  and  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,  are presented together for our Company and our operating partnership.  
  In order to establish that the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of each entity have made the requisite certifications and that Hudson Pacific Properties, Inc. and our operating partnership are compliant with Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act and 18 U.S.C.  1350, this report also includes separate  Item 4.  

Controls and Procedures  sections and separate Exhibit 31 and 32 certifications for each of Hudson Pacific Properties, Inc. and our operating partnership.

1. Organization 
    
  Hudson Pacific Properties, Inc. is a Maryland corporation formed on November 9, 2009 that did not have any meaningful operating activity until the consummation of its initial public offering and the related acquisition of its predecessor and certain other entities on June 29, 2010 ( IPO ). Since the completion of the IPO, the concurrent private placement, and the related formation transactions, Hudson Pacific Properties, Inc. has been a fully integrated, self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust ( REIT ). Through its controlling interest in the operating partnership and its subsidiaries, Hudson Pacific Properties, Inc. owns, manages, leases, acquires and develops real estate, consisting primarily of office and media and entertainment properties. Unless otherwise indicated or unless the context requires otherwise, all references in these financial statements to the  Company  refer to Hudson Pacific Properties, Inc. together with its consolidated subsidiaries, including Hudson Pacific Properties, L.P. Unless otherwise indicated or unless the context requires otherwise, all references to the  our operating partnership  or  the operating partnership  refer to Hudson Pacific Properties, L.P. together with its consolidated subsidiaries.  
    
  On April 1, 2015, the Company completed the acquisition of the EOP Northern California Portfolio ( EOP Acquisition ) from Blackstone Real Estate Partners V and VI ( Blackstone ). The EOP Acquisition consisted of   26   high-quality office assets totaling approximately   8.2 million   square feet and   two   development parcels located throughout the San Francisco Peninsula, Redwood Shores, Palo Alto, Silicon Valley and North San Jose submarkets. The total consideration paid for the EOP Acquisition before certain credits, prorations, and closing costs included a cash payment of   $1.75 billion   and an aggregate of   63,474,791   shares of common stock of Hudson Pacific Properties, Inc. and common units in the operating partnership.   
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company owned a portfolio of   52   office properties and   two   media and entertainment properties. These properties are located throughout Northern and Southern California and the Pacific Northwest.  

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
    
  Basis of Presentation 
    
    The accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company and the operating partnership are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( GAAP ) applicable to interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X. Certain information and footnote disclosures required for annual financial statements have been condensed or excluded pursuant to SEC rules and regulations. Accordingly, the interim financial statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, the accompanying interim financial statements reflect all adjustments of a normal and recurring nature that are considered necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented.  
    
  The results of operations for the interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ended December 31, 2016. The interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements in the Annual Report on Form 10-K of Hudson Pacific Properties, Inc. and Hudson Pacific Properties, L.P. for the year ended December 31, 2015 and the notes thereto.  
    
  Certain amounts in the consolidated financial statements for prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. Specifically in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for the prior period, certain amounts have been reclassified to held for sale. These amounts are related to Patrick Henry Drive and One Bay Plaza, which were sold in 2016, and to 12655 Jefferson, which was determined to be held for sale as of   September 30, 2016  .    
    
  Principles of Consolidation 
    
    The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of Hudson Pacific Properties, Inc. include the accounts of Hudson Pacific Properties, Inc., the operating partnership and all wholly owned subsidiaries and variable interest entities ( VIEs ), of which Hudson Pacific Properties, Inc. is the primary beneficiary. The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements of the operating partnership include the accounts of the operating partnership, and all wholly owned subsidiaries and

    Hudson Pacific Properties, Inc. and Hudson Pacific Properties, L.P. 
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 
  (Unaudited, tabular amounts in thousands, except square footage and share amounts) 

VIEs of which the operating partnership is the primary beneficiary. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. 
    
  During the first quarter of 2016, the Company adopted ASU 2015-02,   Consolidation ( Topic 810 ): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis  , to amend the accounting guidance for consolidation. The standard simplifies the current guidance for consolidation and reduces the number of consolidation models through the elimination of the indefinite deferral of Statement 167. Additionally, the standard places more emphasis on risk of loss when determining a controlling financial interest. The Company consolidates all entities that the Company controls through either majority ownership or voting rights. In addition, the Company consolidates all VIEs of which the Company is considered the primary beneficiary. VIEs are defined as entities in which equity investors (i) do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest and/or (ii) do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties. The entity that consolidates a VIE is known as its primary beneficiary and is generally the entity with (i) the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect the VIE s economic performance and (ii) the right to receive benefits from the VIE or the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could be significant to the VIE. As a result of the adoption, the Company concluded that   two   of the Company s joint ventures and its operating partnership met the definition of a VIE and the Company is the primary beneficiary of these VIEs. Substantially all of the assets and liabilities of the Company are related to these VIEs.  
    
  During the second quarter of 2016, the Company entered into a joint venture to co-originate a loan secured by land in Santa Clara, California. This joint venture met the definition of a VIE, however the Company is not the primary beneficiary and is not consolidating the joint venture. 
    
  Use of Estimates 
    
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of commitments and contingencies at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to acquiring, developing and assessing the carrying values of its real estate properties, its accrued liabilities, and its performance-based equity compensation awards. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience, current market conditions, and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could materially differ from these estimates. 
    
  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  Changes to GAAP are established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the  FASB ) in the form of ASUs. The Company considers the applicability and impact of all ASUs. Recently issued ASUs not listed below are not expected to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements, because either the ASU is not applicable or the impact is expected to be immaterial.  
         
  On October 27, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-17,   Consolidation (Topic 810): Interests Held through Related Parties That Are under Common Control.   This guidance outlines how a single decision maker of a VIE should treat indirect interests held through other related parties that are under common control with the reporting entity when determining whether it is the primary beneficiary of that VIE. This update is effective for annual reporting periods (including interim periods) beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this update on its consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements.     
    
  On August 26, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,   Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.   This guidance addresses eight cash flow classification issues to reduce diversity in practice, including debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs, settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments, contingent consideration payments made after a business combination, proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims, proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies, distributions received from equity method investees, beneficial interests in securitization transactions and separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance principle. This update is effective for annual reporting periods (including interim periods) beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The Company does not currently anticipate a material impact of this update on its consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements.

  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 
  (Unaudited, tabular amounts in thousands, except square footage and share amounts) 

On June 16, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,   Financial Instruments   Credit Losses  . This guidance sets forth a new impairment model for financial instruments, the current expected credit loss ( CECL ) model, which is based on expected losses rather than incurred losses. Under the CECL model, an entity recognizes as an allowance its estimate of expected credit losses. This update is effective for annual reporting periods (including interim periods) beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this update on its consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements. 
       
  On May 10, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients.   This guidance clarifies certain narrow aspects of Topic 606, including assessing collectibility, presentation of sales taxes, noncash consideration, and completed contracts and contract modifications at transition. On April 14, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing.   This guidance clarifies two aspects of Topic 606: identifying performance obligations and the licensing implementation guidance. On March 17, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net).   This guidance clarifies certain aspects of the principal-versus-agent guidance in its new revenue recognition standard related to the determination of whether an entity is a principal-versus-agent and the determination of the nature of each specified good or service. Both updates affect the guidance in ASU 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)   and ASU 2015-14,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date  , and defer the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one year. These updates are effective for annual reporting periods (including interim periods) beginning after December 15, 2017 with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact of these updates on its consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements. 
    
  On March 30, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  . This guidance simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including the accounting for income taxes, classification of excess tax benefits on the statement of cash flows, and forfeitures. This update is effective for annual reporting periods (including interim periods) beginning after December 15, 2016 with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this update on its consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements. 
    
  On January 5, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,   Financial Instruments   Overall (Subtopic 825-10), Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  . This guidance provides a new measurement alternative for equity investments that don t have readily determinable fair values and don t qualify for the net asset value practical expedient. Under this alternative, these investments can be measured at cost, less any impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. This update is effective for annual reporting periods (including interim periods) beginning after December 15, 2018 with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this update on its consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements. 

3. Investment in Real Estate 
    
  Acquisitions 
    
  The Company s acquisitions are accounted for using the acquisition method. The results of operations for each of these acquisitions are included in the Company s Consolidated Statements of Operations from the date of acquisition.  
    
  When we acquire properties that are considered business combinations, assets acquired and liabilities assumed are fair valued. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed include, but are not limited to, land, building and improvements, intangible assets related to above-and below-market leases, intangible assets related to in-place leases, debt and other assumed assets and liabilities. The initial assignment of the purchase price is based on management s preliminary assessment, which may differ when final information becomes available. Subsequent adjustments made to the initial purchase price assignment are made within the measurement period, which typically does not exceed one year, within the Consolidated Balance Sheet.  
    
  We assess fair value based on level 2 and level 3 inputs within the fair value hierarchy, which includes estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount and/or capitalization rates and available market information. Estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including historical operating results, known and anticipated trends, and market and economic conditions.

  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 
  (Unaudited, tabular amounts in thousands, except square footage and share amounts) 

The fair value of tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property as if it was vacant. The fair value of acquired  above- and below-  market leases are based on the estimated cash flow projections utilizing discount rates that reflect the risks associated with the leases acquired. The amount recorded is based on the present value of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in-place lease and (ii) management s estimate of fair market lease rates for each in-place lease, measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above-market leases and the initial term plus the extended term for any leases with below-market renewal options. Other intangible assets acquired include amounts for in-place lease values that are based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant s lease. Factors considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease-up periods, market conditions and costs to execute similar leases. In estimating carrying costs, we include estimates of lost rents at market rates during the hypothetical expected lease-up periods, which are dependent on local market conditions. In estimating costs to execute similar leases, we consider leasing commissions, legal and other related costs. Acquisition-related expenses associated with business combinations are expensed in the period incurred. 
       
  On July 1, 2016, the Company completed the acquisition of a   500,475  -square-foot Class A tower located at 11601 Wilshire Boulevard in West Los Angeles, California for cash consideration of   $311.0   million (before credits, prorations, and closing costs).

  5-Year Term Loan due April 2020 and 7-year Term Loan due April 2022 
    
    On April 1, 2015, the Company entered into a derivative contract with respect to   $300.0 million   of the   5  -Year Term Loan due April 2020 which, effective as of May 1, 2015, swapped one-month LIBOR to a fixed rate of   1.36%   through the loan s maturity. Therefore the interest rate is effectively fixed at   2.66%   to   3.56%  . The unhedged portion bears interest at a rate equal to one-month LIBOR plus   1.30%   to   2.20%  , depending on the Company s leverage ratio. In July 2016, the Company amended this interest rate swap to add a   0.00  % floor to one-month LIBOR, and then de-designated the original swap and designated the amended swap as a hedge in order to minimize the ineffective portion of the original derivative related to this loan. Therefore, the effective interest rate with respect to   $300.0   million of the term loan increased to a range of   2.75%   to   3.65%   per annum based on the Company s operating partnership s leverage ratio.  
    
  On April 1, 2015, the Company also entered into a derivative contract with respect to the   $350.0 million     7  -year Term Loan due April 2022, which, effective as of May 1, 2015, swapped one-month LIBOR to a fixed rate of   1.61%   through the loan s maturity. Therefore the interest rate is effectively fixed at   3.21%   to   4.16%  . In July 2016, the Company amended this interest rate swap to add a   0.00  % floor to one-month LIBOR, and then de-designated the original swap and designated the amended swap as a hedge in order to minimize the ineffective portion of the original derivative related to this loan. Therefore, the effective interest rate with respect to    $350.0 million     7  -year Term Loan due April 2022 increased to a range of   3.36%   to   4.31%   per annum based on the Company s operating partnership s leverage ratio. 
    
  During the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company recognized an unrealized gain of   $0.9 million   and an unrealized loss of   $1.6 million  , respectively, on the Consolidated Statement of Operations, related to the ineffective portion of these derivative contracts. There was no recognized unrealized loss or gain during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . In July 2016, the Company amended the derivative contracts to add a   0.00  % floor to one-month LIBOR as described above, minimizing the ineffective portion of the original derivatives related to these loans.

  On February 11, 2011, the Company closed a   five  -year term loan totaling   $92.0 million   with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., secured by the Sunset Gower and Sunset Bronson properties. The loan initially bore interest at a rate equal to   one  -month LIBOR plus   3.50%  . On March 16, 2011, the Company purchased an interest rate cap in order to cap   one  -month LIBOR at   3.715%   on   $50.0 million   of the loan through February 11, 2016. On January 11, 2012, the Company purchased an interest rate cap in order to cap   one  -month LIBOR at   2.00%   with respect to   $42.0 million   of the loan.   
    
  Effective August 22, 2013, the terms of this loan were amended to, among other changes, increase the outstanding balance from   $92.0 million   to   $97.0 million  , reduce the interest to a rate equal to   one  -month LIBOR plus   2.25%  , and extend the maturity date from February 11, 2016 to February 11, 2018.

14. Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
       
  The GAAP fair value framework uses a three-tiered approach. Fair value measurements are classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories: 

Level 1: unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical assets or liabilities; 

Level 2: quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-derived valuations in which significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets; and 

Level 3: prices or valuation techniques where little or no market data is available that requires inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable. 
       
  The Company measures fair value of financial instruments using level 2 inputs categorized within the fair value hierarchy. The Company s financial assets and liabilities measured and reported at fair value on a recurring basis include the following:   

Other Financial Instruments       
    
  The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities are reasonable estimates of fair value because of the short-term nature of these instruments. Fair values for notes payable and notes receivable are estimates based on rates currently prevailing for similar instruments of similar maturities using Level 2 inputs. The table below represents the carrying value and fair value of assets and liabilities at:

15. Stock-Based Compensation 
    
  The Company has various stock compensation arrangements, which are more fully described in Part IV, Item 15(a)  Financial Statement and Schedules Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements Equity  in its 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Under the 2010 Incentive Award Plan, as amended ( 2010 Plan ), the board of directors of Hudson Pacific Properties, Inc., or its compensation committee, has the ability to grant, among other things, restricted stock, restricted stock units and performance units. 
    
  The board of directors of Hudson Pacific Properties, Inc. awards restricted shares to non-employee board members, other than directors designated by The Blackstone Group L.P. or its affiliates, on an annual basis as part of such board members  annual compensation and to newly elected non-employee board members, other than directors designated by The Blackstone Group L.P. or its affiliates, in accordance with the Company s Non-Employee Director Compensation Program. The share-based awards are generally issued in the second quarter, and the awards vest in equal annual installments over the applicable service vesting period, which is   three years  .  
    
  In addition, the board of directors of Hudson Pacific Properties, Inc., or its compensation committee, awards time-based restricted shares to certain employees on an annual basis as part of the employees  annual compensation. The share-based awards are generally issued in the fourth quarter, and the awards vest in equal annual installments over the applicable service vesting period, which is   three years  . Additionally, these awards are subject to a   two  -year hold upon vesting if the employee is a named executive officer at the time of grant. 
    
  Starting in January 2012, during the first quarter, the compensation committee of the board of directors of Hudson Pacific Properties, Inc. annually adopts an Outperformance Plan ( OPP ) under the 2010 Plan. Each OPP is a multi-year outperformance program covering certain senior executives, and authorizes grants of incentive awards linked to absolute and relative total shareholder return ( TSR ) over the applicable   three  -year performance period. During March 2016, the Compensation Committee adopted the 2016 OPP Plan under the Company s 2010 Plan. The 2016 OPP is substantially similar to the previous OPPs except that (i) the performance period will run from January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2018, (ii) the maximum bonus pool under the 2016 OPP is   $17.5 million  , (iii) the 2016 OPP provides for a target bonus pool equal to   $3.7 million   and (iv) the bonus pool will be equal to   3%   of the amount by which TSR during the performance period exceeds the applicable goal. For certain participants, the 2016 OPP awards will be settled in performance units of the operating partnership (rather than in common stock of Hudson Pacific Properties, Inc.).  
    
  In December 2015, the board of directors of Hudson Pacific Properties, Inc. awarded special one-time retention grants to certain employees, which include time-vesting restricted stock and performance-based RSUs. These awards vest over   four years   (subject to continued employment and, with respect to the RSUs, the achievement of performance goals). Additionally, these awards are subject to a   two  -year hold upon vesting. 
    
  The following table presents the classification and amount recognized for stock compensation related to the Company s OPP plans and restricted stock awards:     

16. Earnings Per Share

of common shares and dilutive instruments outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method or the if-converted method. Unvested time-based RSUs and unvested OPP awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends are participating securities and are included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two-class method. The following table reconciles the numerator and denominator in computing the Company s basic and diluted per share computations for net income available to common stockholders: 

________________ 
           (1) 
    The Company includes unvested awards as contingently issuable shares in the computation of diluted EPS once the market criteria are met, assuming that the end of the reporting period is the end of the contingency period.  Any anti-dilutive securities are excluded from the diluted EPS calculation.

Common units and shares of common stock of Hudson Pacific Properties, Inc. have essentially the same economic characteristics, as they share equally in the total net income or loss distributions of the operating partnership. Investors who own common units have the right to cause the operating partnership to redeem any or all of their common units for cash equal to the then-current market value of   one   share of common stock or, at the Company s election, issue shares of common stock of Hudson Pacific Properties, Inc. in exchange for common units on a   one  -for-one basis.

The Company funded the redemption using the proceeds from a registered underwritten public offering of common stock.  
    
  Performance units are partnership interests in the operating partnership. Each performance unit awarded will be deemed equivalent to an award of one unit of common stock under the 2010 Plan, reducing the availability for other equity awards on a one-for-one basis. Under the terms of the performance units, the operating partnership will revalue its assets for tax purposes upon the occurrence of certain specified events, and any increase in valuation from the time of grant until such event will be allocated first to the holders of performance units to equalize the capital accounts of such holders with the capital accounts of common unitholders. Subject to any agreed upon exceptions, once vested and having achieved parity with common unitholders, performance units are convertible into common units in the operating partnership on a   one  -for-one basis.  
    
  The operating partnership meets the criteria of a VIE and the Company is the primary beneficiary of the operating partnership.

  The Stockholders Agreement 
    
  On April 1, 2015, in connection with the closing of the EOP Acquisition as described above, the Company entered into the Stockholders Agreement (the  Stockholders Agreement ) by and among the Company, the operating partnership, Blackstone Real Estate Advisors L.P. ( BREA ) and Blackstone. The Stockholders Agreement sets forth various arrangements and restrictions with respect to the governance of the Company and certain rights of Blackstone with respect to the shares of common stock of Hudson Pacific Properties, Inc. and common units of the operating partnership received by Blackstone in connection with the EOP Acquisition (the  Equity Consideration ). 
    
  Pursuant to the terms of the Stockholders Agreement, in April 2015 the board of directors of Hudson Pacific Properties, Inc. (the  Board ) was expanded from   eight   to   eleven   directors, and   three   director nominees designated by Blackstone to the Board were elected.   On January 13, 2016,   one   of Blackstone s nominees resigned from the Board, and Blackstone indicated that it would not designate an individual to replace him. Subsequently, the Board voted to decrease its size to   ten   directors. Subject to certain exceptions, the Board will continue to include Blackstone  designees in its slate of nominees, and will continue to recommend such nominees, and will otherwise use its reasonable best efforts to solicit the vote of the stockholders of Hudson Pacific Properties, Inc. to elect to the Board the slate of nominees which includes those designated by Blackstone. Blackstone will have the right to designate   three   nominees for so long as it continues to beneficially own, in the aggregate, greater than   50%   of the Equity Consideration. If Blackstone  beneficial ownership of the Equity Consideration decreases, then the number of director nominees that Blackstone will have the right to designate will be reduced (i) to   two  , if Blackstone beneficially owns greater than or equal to   30%   but less than or equal to   50%   of the Equity Consideration and (ii) to  
  
   37 

    Hudson Pacific Properties, Inc. and Hudson Pacific Properties, L.P. 
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 
  (Unaudited, tabular amounts in thousands, except square footage and share amounts) 

one  , if Blackstone beneficially owns greater than or equal to   15%   but less than   30%   of the Equity Consideration. The Board nomination rights of Blackstone will terminate at such time as Blackstone beneficially owns less than   15%   of the Equity Consideration or upon written notice of waiver or termination of such rights by Blackstone. So long as Blackstone retains the right to designate at least   one   nominee to the Board, Hudson Pacific Properties, Inc. will not be permitted to increase the total number of directors comprising the Board to more than   12   persons without the prior written consent of Blackstone. 
    
  For so long as Blackstone has the right to designate at least   two   director nominees, subject to the satisfaction of applicable NYSE independence requirements, Blackstone will also be entitled to appoint   one   such nominee then serving on the Board to serve on each committee of the Board (other than certain specified committees). 
    
  The Stockholders Agreement also includes standstill provisions, which require that, until such time as Blackstone beneficially owns shares of common stock representing less than   10%   of the total number of issued and outstanding shares of common stock on a fully-diluted basis, Blackstone and BREA are restricted from, among other things, acquiring additional equity or debt securities (other than non-recourse debt and certain other debt) of the Company without the Company s prior written consent. 
    
  In addition, pursuant to the Stockholders Agreement, until April 1, 2017, the Company is required to obtain the prior written consent of Blackstone prior to the issuance of common equity securities by it or any of its subsidiaries other than up to an aggregate of   16,843,028   shares of common stock (and certain other exceptions). 
    
  Further, until such time as Blackstone beneficially owns, in the aggregate, less than   15%   of the Equity Consideration, Blackstone will cause all common stock held by it to be voted by proxy (i) in favor of all persons nominated to serve as directors by the Board (or the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee thereof) in any slate of nominees which includes Blackstone  nominees and (ii) otherwise in accordance with the recommendation of the Board (to the extent the recommendation is not inconsistent with the rights of Blackstone under the Stockholders Agreement) with respect to any other action, proposal or other matter to be voted upon by the stockholders of Hudson Pacific Properties, Inc., other than in connection with (A) any proposed transaction relating to a change of control of Hudson Pacific Properties, Inc., (B) any amendments to the charter or bylaws of Hudson Pacific Properties, Inc., (C) any other transaction that Hudson Pacific Properties, Inc. submits to a vote of its stockholders pursuant to Section 312.03 of the NYSE Listed Company Manual or (D) any other transaction that Hudson Pacific Properties, Inc. submits to a vote of its stockholders for approval. 
    
  As required by the Stockholders Agreement, the Company has agreed that Blackstone and certain of its affiliates may engage in investments, strategic relationships or other business relationships with entities engaged in other business, including those that compete with the Company, and will have no obligation to present any particular investment or business opportunity to the Company, even if the opportunity is of a character that, if presented to the Company, could be undertaken by the Company. As required by the Stockholders Agreement, to the maximum extent permitted under Maryland law, the Company has renounced any interest or expectancy in, or in being offered an opportunity to participate in, any such investment, opportunity or activity presented to or developed by Blackstone, its nominees for election as directors and certain of its affiliates, other than any opportunity expressly offered to a director nominated at the direction of Blackstone in his or her capacity as a director of Hudson Pacific Properties, Inc. 
    
  Further, without the prior written consent of Blackstone, Hudson Pacific Properties, Inc. may not amend certain provisions of its bylaws relating to the ability of its directors and officers to engage in other business or to adopt qualification for directors other than those in effect as of the date of the Stockholders Agreement or as are generally applicable to all directors, respectively. 
    
  The Stockholders Agreement also includes certain provisions that, together, are intended to enhance the liquidity of common units to be held by Blackstone. 
    
  Redemption Rights of Blackstone 
    
  Under the terms of the Stockholders Agreement, the Company (in its capacity as the general partner of the operating partnership) has waived the   14  -month holding period set forth in the Fourth Amended and Restated Limited Partnership Agreement before Blackstone may require the operating partnership to redeem the common units and grants certain additional rights to Blackstone in connection with such redemptions. Among other things, the Company generally must give Blackstone notice before 9:30 a.m. Eastern time on the business day after the business day on which Blackstone gives the Company notice

of redemption of any common units of the Company s election, in its sole and absolute discretion, to either (a) cause the operating partnership to redeem all of the tendered common units in exchange for a cash amount per common units equal to the value of   one   share of common stock on the date that Blackstone provided its notice of redemption, calculated in accordance with and subject to adjustment as provided in the Fourth Amended and Restated Limited Partnership Agreement and the Stockholders Agreement, or (b) subject to the restrictions on ownership and transfer of the Company s stock set forth in its charter, acquire all of the tendered common units from Blackstone in exchange for shares of common stock, based on an exchange ratio of   one   share of common stock for each common unit, subject to adjustment as provided in the Fourth Amended and Restated Limited Partnership Agreement. If the Company fails to timely provide such notice, the Company will be deemed to have elected to cause the operating partnership to redeem all such tendered common units in exchange for shares of common stock. In May 2016, Blackstone redeemed   10,000,000   common units in the operating partnership in exchange for cash. On July 21, 2016, Blackstone redeemed an additional   19,000,000   common units.  
    
  The Company may also elect to cause the operating partnership to redeem all common units tendered by Blackstone with the proceeds of a public or private offering of common stock under certain circumstances as discussed more fully below.  
    
  Restrictions on Transfer of Common Units by Blackstone 
    
  Under the terms of the Stockholders Agreement, the Company (in its capacity as the general partner of the operating partnership) has waived the   14  -month holding period set forth in the Fourth Amended and Restated Limited Partnership Agreement before Blackstone may transfer any common units, and has agreed to admit any permitted transferee of Blackstone as a substituted limited partner of the operating partnership upon the satisfaction of certain conditions described in the Fourth Amended and Restated Limited Partnership Agreement and the Stockholders Agreement. Nevertheless, the Covered Securities are subject to the transfer restrictions described above. 
    
  Ownership Limit Waiver 
    
  In connection with the issuance of the Equity Consideration, the Board granted to Blackstone and certain of its affiliates a limited exception to the restrictions on ownership and transfer of common stock set forth in the charter of Hudson Pacific Properties, Inc. (the  Charter ) that allows Blackstone and certain of its affiliates to own, directly or indirectly, in the aggregate, up to   17,707,056   shares of common stock of Hudson Pacific Properties, Inc. (the  Excepted Holder Limit ). This exception is conditioned upon the continued accuracy of various representations and covenants set forth in Blackstone s waiver request delivered on April 1, 2015, confirming, among other things, that neither Blackstone nor certain of its affiliates may own, directly or indirectly, (i) more than   9.9%   of the interests in a tenant of the Company (other than a tenant of the 1455 Market Street office property) or (ii) more than   5.45%   of the interests in a tenant of the 1455 Market Street office property, in each case subject to certain exceptions that may reduce such ownership percentage, but not below   2%    and representations intended to confirm that Blackstone s and certain of its affiliates  ownership of common stock of Hudson Pacific Properties, Inc. will not cause Hudson Pacific Properties, Inc. to otherwise fail to qualify as a REIT. 
    
  The exception for Blackstone and certain of its affiliates will apply until (i) Blackstone or any such affiliate violates any of the representations or covenants in Blackstone s waiver request or (ii) (a) Blackstone or any such affiliate owns, directly or indirectly, more than the applicable ownership percentage (as described above) of the interests in any tenant(s) and (b) the maximum rental income expected to be produced by such tenant(s) exceeds (x)   0.5%   of the Company s gross income (in the case of tenants other than tenants of the 1455 Market Street office property) or (y)   0.5%   of the 1455 Market Street Joint Venture s gross income (in the case of tenants of the 1455 Market Street office property) for any taxable year (the  Rent Threshold ), at which time the number of shares of common stock that Blackstone and certain of its affiliates may directly or indirectly own will be reduced to the number of shares of common stock which would result in the amount of rent from such tenant(s) (that would be treated as related party rents under certain tax rules) representing no more than the Rent Threshold. 
    
    The Registration Rights Agreement 
    
  On April 1, 2015, in connection with the closing of the EOP Acquisition, the Company entered into a Registration Rights Agreement, dated April 1, 2015 (the  Registration Rights Agreement ), by and among the Company and Blackstone. The Registration Rights Agreement provides for customary registration rights with respect to the Equity Consideration, including the following: 

39 

    Hudson Pacific Properties, Inc. and Hudson Pacific Properties, L.P. 
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued) 
  (Unaudited, tabular amounts in thousands, except square footage and share amounts) 

Shelf Registration  . On October 27, 2015, the Company filed a prospectus covering Blackstone s shares of common stock received as part of the Equity Consideration as well as shares issuable upon redemption of common units received as part of the Equity Consideration, which was replaced by a subsequent prospectus filed by the Company on July 21, 2016. The Company is required to use its reasonable best efforts to keep such resale shelf registration statement effective for as long as Blackstone continues to hold such shares of common stock. 

Demand Registrations  . Beginning November 1, 2015 (or earlier if transfer restrictions under the Stockholders Agreement are terminated earlier), Blackstone may cause the Company to register their shares if the foregoing resale shelf registration statement is not effective or if the Company is not eligible to file a shelf registration statement. 

Qualified Offerings  . Any registered offerings requested by Blackstone that are to an underwriter on a firm commitment basis for reoffering and resale to the public, in an offering that is a  bought deal  with one or more investment banks or in a block trade with a broker-dealer will be (subject to certain specified exceptions): (i) no more frequent than once in any   120  -day period, (ii) subject to underwriter lock-ups from prior offerings then in effect, and (iii) subject to a minimum offering size of   $50.0   million. 

Piggy-Back Rights.   Beginning November 1, 2015 (or earlier if transfer restrictions under the Stockholders Agreement are terminated earlier), Blackstone is permitted to, among other things, participate in offerings for the Company s account or the account of any other security holder of the Company (other than in certain specified cases). If underwriters advise that the success of a proposed offering would be significantly and adversely affected by the inclusion of all securities in an offering initiated by the Company for the Company s own account, then the securities proposed to be included by Blackstone together with other stockholders exercising similar piggy-back rights are cut back first. 
       
    Limited Partnership Agreement 
    
  On April 1, 2015, in connection with the closing of the EOP Acquisition, the Company, as the general partner of the operating partnership, entered into the Third Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of the operating partnership dated April 1, 2015 along with Blackstone and the other limited partners of the operating partnership. The principal changes to the Second Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of the operating partnership, as amended and as in effect immediately prior to the closing of the EOP Acquisition, made by the Third Amended and Restated Limited Partnership Agreement were to add the provisions described below. The Third Amended and Restated Limited Partnership Agreement was subsequently amended and restated on December 17, 2015 by the Fourth Amended and Restated Limited Partnership Agreement of the operating partnership. 
    
  The Stockholders Agreement prohibits the Company, without the prior written consent of Blackstone, from amending certain provisions of the Fourth Amended and Restated Limited Partnership Agreement in a manner adverse in any respect to Blackstone (in its capacity as limited partners of the operating partnership), or to add any new provision to the Fourth Amended and Restated Limited Partnership Agreement that would have a substantially identical effect or from taking any action that is intended to or otherwise would have a substantially identical effect. 
    
  Restrictions on Mergers, Sales, Transfers and Other Significant Transactions of the Company 
    
  Prior to the date on which Blackstone and any of its affiliates own less than   9.8%   of the Equity Consideration, the Company may not consummate any of (a) a merger, consolidation or other combination of the Company s or the operating partnership s assets with another person, (b) a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the operating partnership, (c) sale of all or substantially all of the Company s assets not in the ordinary course of the operating partnership s business or (d) a reclassification, recapitalization or change in the Company s outstanding equity securities (other than in connection with a stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, change in par value, increase in authorized shares, designation or issuance of new classes of equity securities or any event that does not require the approval of the Company s stockholders), in each case, which is submitted to the holders of the common stock of Hudson Pacific Properties, Inc. for approval, unless such transaction is also approved by the partners of the operating partnership holding common units on a  pass through  basis, which, in effect, affords the limited partners of the operating partnership that hold common units the right to vote on such transaction as though such limited partners held the number of shares of common stock into which their common units were then exchangeable and voted together with the holders of the outstanding common stock of Hudson Pacific Properties, Inc. with respect to such transaction.

Stock Offering Funding of Redemption 
    
  If Blackstone or any of its affiliates who become limited partners of the operating partnership ( Specified Limited Partners ) delivers a notice of redemption with respect to common units that, if exchanged for common stock, would result in a violation of the Excepted Holder Limit (as defined below) or otherwise violate the restrictions on ownership and transfer of the Company s stock set forth in its charter and that have an aggregate value in excess of   $50.0   million as calculated pursuant to the terms of the Fourth Amended and Restated Limited Partnership Agreement, then, if the Company is then eligible to register the offering of its securities on Form S-3 (or any successor form similar thereto), the Company may elect to cause the operating partnership to redeem such common units with the net proceeds from a public or private offering of the number of shares of common stock that would be deliverable in exchange for such common units but for the application of the Excepted Holder Limit and other restrictions on ownership and transfer of the Company s stock. If the Company elects to fund the redemption of any common units with such an offering, it will allow all Specified Limited Partners the opportunity to include additional common units held by such Specified Limited Partners in such redemption. 
       
  Blackstone Margin Loan  
    
  HPP BREP V Holdco A LLC ( Borrower ), an affiliate of Blackstone, has entered into (i) a Margin Loan Agreement (the  Loan Agreement ) dated as of December 29, 2015 with the lenders party thereto (each, a  Lender  and, collectively, the  Lenders ) and the administrative agent party thereto and (ii) Pledge and Security Agreements dated as of December 31, 2015, in each case, between one of the Lenders, as secured party, and Borrower, as pledgor (the  Borrower Pledge Agreements ), and certain of Borrower s affiliates (each, a  Holdco A Guarantor  and collectively, the  Holdco A Guarantors ) each entered into (i) with each Lender, a Pledge and Security Agreement dated as of December 31, 2015 (each, a  Holdco A Guarantor Pledge Agreement  and, collectively with the Borrower Pledge Agreements, the  Pledge Agreements ) and (ii) with the administrative agent and the Lenders, a Guarantee dated as of December 31, 2015 of the Borrower s obligations under the Loan Agreement (each, a  Holdco A Guarantee  and collectively the  Holdco A Guarantees ). In addition, certain of Borrower s other affiliates (each, a  Holdco B Guarantor  and collectively, the  Holdco B Guarantors  and, together with the Holdco A Guarantors, the  Guarantors ) each entered into, with the administrative agent and the Lenders, a Guarantee dated as of December 31, 2015 of the Borrower s obligations under the Loan Agreement (each, a  Holdco B Guarantee  and, collectively with the Holdco A Guarantees, the Loan Agreement, the Pledge Agreements and substantially similar pledge and security agreements entered into since December 31, 2015, the  Loan Documents ). Each of the Borrower, the Holdco A Guarantors and the Holdco B Guarantors is affiliated with Blackstone. 
    
  As of December 31, 2015, the Borrower has borrowed an aggregate of   $350.0   million under the Loan Agreement. Subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, the Borrower may borrow up to an additional   $150.0   million on or after March 1, 2016. The scheduled maturity date of the loans under the Loan Agreement is December 31, 2017, which may be extended at the election of the Borrower until December 31, 2018. To secure borrowings under the Loan Agreement, the Borrower and the Guarantors have collectively pledged   8,276,945   shares of common stock and   24,801,618   common units in the operating partnership, as well as their respective rights under the Registration Rights Agreement. 
    
  Upon the occurrence of certain events that are customary for this type of loan, the Lenders may exercise their rights to require the Borrower to pre-pay the loan proceeds, post additional collateral, or foreclose on, and dispose of, the pledged shares of common stock of Hudson Pacific Properties, Inc. and pledged common units in the operating partnership in accordance with the Loan Documents. 
  The Company did not independently verify the foregoing disclosure regarding the margin loan. In addition, the Company is not a party to the Loan Documents and has no obligations thereunder, but has delivered an Issuer Agreement to each of the Lenders in which it has, among other things, agreed to certain obligations relating to the pledged shares of the common stock of Hudson Pacific Properties, Inc. and pledged common units in the operating partnership and, subject to applicable law and stock exchange rules, agreed not to take any actions that are intended to materially hinder or delay the exercise of any remedies with respect to the pledged shares of the common stock of Hudson Pacific Properties, Inc. and pledged common units in the operating partnership.

19. Commitments and Contingencies 
    
  Legal 
    
  From time to time, the Company is party to various lawsuits, claims and other legal proceedings arising out of, or incident to, the ordinary course of business. Management believes, based in part upon consultation with legal counsel, that the ultimate resolution of all such claims will not have a material adverse effect on the Company s results of operations, financial position or cash flows. As of   September 30, 2016  , the risk of material loss from such legal actions impacting the Company s financial condition or results from operations has been assessed as remote. 
    
  Concentrations 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the majority of the Company s properties were located in California, which exposes the Company to greater economic risks than if it owned a more geographically dispersed portfolio.  
    
  A significant portion of the Company s rental revenue is derived from tenants in the media and entertainment and technology industries. As of   September 30, 2016  , approximately   13.4%   and   28.1%   of rentable square feet were related to the media and entertainment and technology industries, respectively.  
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company s   15   largest tenants represented approximately   22.4%   of its rentable square feet and no single tenant accounted for more than   10%  . 
    
  Letters of Credit 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company has outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately   $2.6 million   under the unsecured revolving credit facility. The letters of credit are primarily related to utility company security deposit requirements.  

20. Subsequent Events 
    
    On October 7, 2016, the Company purchased, through a joint venture with Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board, the   285,680  -square-foot Hill7 office property located in Seattle, Washington for   $179.8   million (before customary, prorations and closing costs). In conjunction with the acquisition, the joint venture closed a secured non-recourse loan in the amount of $  101.0 million   bearing an interest rate of   3.38%   per annum, interest only. This loan has a   10  -year maturity with an option to extend an additional   two   years at a higher interest rate. The Company is currently in the process of determining the purchase price accounting.

Comparison of the three months ended   September 30, 2016   to the three months ended   September 30, 2015 
       
  Consolidated Net Operating Income 
    
  We evaluate performance based upon property net operating income ( NOI ) from continuing operations. NOI is not a measure of operating results or cash flows from operating activities as measured by GAAP and should not be considered an alternative to income from continuing operations or cash flows, as an indication of our performance or of our ability to make distributions, or as a measure of our liquidity. Companies may not calculate NOI in the same manner. We consider NOI to be a useful performance measure to investors and management because, when compared across periods, NOI reflects the revenues and expenses directly associated with owning and operating our properties, and the impact to operations from trends on occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs, thus providing a perspective not immediately apparent from income from continuing operations. We define NOI as operating revenues (including rental revenues, other property-related revenue, tenant recoveries and other operating revenues), less property-level operating expenses (which includes external management fees, if any, and property-level general and administrative expenses). NOI excludes corporate general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, impairments, gain/loss on sale of real estate, interest expense, acquisition-related expenses and other non-operating items. We believe that NOI on a cash basis (which we define as NOI on a GAAP basis, adjusted to exclude the effect of straight-line rent and other non-cash adjustments required by GAAP) is helpful to investors as an additional measure of operating performance. Management further evaluates NOI by evaluating the performance from the following property groups: 

Same-store properties, which include all of the properties owned and included in our stabilized portfolio as of July 1, 2015 and still owned and included in the stabilized portfolio as of   September 30, 2016  . For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , same-store properties include the activity from the EOP Acquisition. 

Non-same-store properties, development projects, redevelopment properties and lease-up properties as of   September 30, 2016   and other properties not owned or not in operation from July 1, 2015 through   September 30, 2016  .  
       
  The following table presents our NOI for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015 and a reconciliation of NOI to net income (loss):

The following table summarizes our NOI for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

50 

The following table summarizes our change to NOI for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

Total NOI increased   $10.4 million  , or   11.1%  , for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , primarily due to: 

A   $5.7 million  , or   9.5%  , increase in NOI from our same-store office properties resulting primarily from the rental income related to new leases signed at our 1455 Market (Uber and Vevo) and Skyport Plaza (Qualcomm) properties at higher rents than expiring rents. Additionally, tenant recoveries increased due to higher overall recoverable operating expenses.  

A   $2.6 million  , or   8.9%  , increase in NOI from our non-same-store office store properties resulting primarily from the 11601 Wilshire Boulevard acquisition, increased rental income relating to new leases signed at our Page Mill (Toyota Research Institute) and Metro Center Tower (BrightEdge) properties at higher rents than expiring rents and new leases at our completed re-development at 12655 Jefferson (WeWork and Aegis), partially offset by the sale of our Bay Park Plaza (sold in September 2015), Bayhill Office Center (sold in January 2016) and One Bay Plaza (sold in June 2016) properties. 

A   $2.0 million  , or   51.7%  , increase in NOI from our same-store media and entertainment properties resulting primarily from lease-up of Sunset Bronson and Sunset Gower. In the first quarter of 2015, the Company decided to take certain buildings and stages off line to facilitate our ICON development and other longer-term plans for the Sunset Bronson property. Other property-related revenues increased primarily due to completed parking structures at Sunset Bronson and Sunset Gower in the fourth quarter of 2015. 

51 

Office NOI 
       
    Same-Store 
    
  Office rental revenue increased   $5.2 million  , or   7.2%  , to   $77.2 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $72.0 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase is primarily due to rental income relating to new leases signed at our 1455 Market (Uber and Vevo) and Skyport Plaza (Qualcomm) properties at higher rents than expiring rents.  
    
  Office tenant recoveries increased   $1.9 million  , or   13.2%  , to   $16.0 million   for three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $14.2 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase is primarily related to higher overall recoverable operating expenses. 
    
  Office parking and other revenue decreased by   $1.0 million  , or   18.7%  , to   $4.3 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $5.2 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The decrease is primarily due to lower non-tenant parking revenue in one of our Seattle properties. 
    
  Office operating expenses were   $31.7 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , relatively flat as compared to   $31.3 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  .  
    
    Non-Same-Store 
    
  Office rental revenue increased by   $4.0 million  , or   9.5%  , to   $46.7 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $42.7 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase is primarily due the 11601 Wilshire Boulevard acquisition, rental income relating to new leases signed at our Page Mill (Toyota Research Institute) and Metro Center Tower (BrightEdge) properties at higher rents than expiring rents and new leases at our completed re-development at 12655 Jefferson (WeWork and Aegis), partially offset due to the sales of our Bay Park Plaza (sold in September 2015), Bayhill Office Center (sold in January 2016) and One Bay Plaza (sold in June 2016) properties. 
    
  Office tenant recoveries were   $6.6 million   for three months ended   September 30, 2016  , relatively flat as compared to   $5.9 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  Office parking and other revenue was   $1.3 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , relatively flat as compared to   $1.4 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  .  
    
  Office operating expenses increased by   $2.0 million  , or   10.1%  , to   $22.3 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $20.2 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase is primarily due to the 11601 Wilshire Boulevard acquisition and general increases in occupancy, partially offset by the sale of our Bay Park Plaza (sold in September 2015), Bayhill Office Center (sold in January 2016) and One Bay Plaza (sold in June 2016) properties. 
    
  Same-Store Media   Entertainment NOI 
    
    Media and entertainment, rental revenue, tenant recoveries and other property-related revenue increased by   $2.3 million  , or   22.1%  , to   $12.5 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $10.2 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase is primarily related to a   $1.1 million   increase in rental revenue to   $7.1 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   primarily due to higher occupancy at both Sunset Gower and Sunset Bronson. In addition, property-related revenues increased by   $1.1 million   to   $5.0 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   primarily due to the completion of parking structures at Sunset Bronson and Sunset Gower in the fourth quarter of 2015. 
    
  Media and entertainment operating expenses were $  6.5 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , relatively flat as compared to   $6.3 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  .

Other Expenses (Income) 
    
  General and Administrative Expenses 
    
    General and administrative expenses include wages and salaries for corporate-level employees, accounting, legal and other professional services, office supplies, entertainment, travel and automobile expenses, telecommunications and computer-related expenses, and other miscellaneous items. General and administrative expenses increased   $3.6 million  , or   38.1%  , to $  13.0 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to $  9.4 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to the adoption of the 2016 OPP, granting of the special one-time retention awards to certain of our executives, office expenses, general corporate travel expenses, and shareholder relations costs. 
    
  Depreciation and Amortization 
    
    Depreciation and amortization expense decreased   $12.8 million  , or   15.9%  , to   $67.4 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $80.2 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The decrease was primarily related to depreciation expenses associated with properties sold in September 2015 and during 2016, partially offset by increased depreciation related to the 11601 Wilshire Boulevard acquisition. 
    
  Interest Expense 
    
    Interest expense increased   $5.4 million  , or   37.7%  , to   $19.9 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $14.5 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . At   September 30, 2016  , we had   $2.4 billion   of notes payable, compared to   $2.1 billion   at   September 30, 2015  , excluding net deferred financing costs and net unamortized loan premium. The increase was primarily attributable to $925.0 million of term loans and private placement borrowings and additional borrowings related to a refinance of our Element LA loan, partially offset by interest savings related to our repayment of our two-year term loan, paydown of our five-year term loan due April 2020, repayment of our indebtedness associated with our 901 Market property, and paydown on our indebtedness associated with our Sunset Gower/Sunset Bronson property. Additionally, we had higher effective interest rates during the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 and increased capitalized interest primarily due to the ICON Building I Tower, ICON Building II, 4th and Traction, and 405 Mateo developments during the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. 
    
  Unrealized Gain on Ineffective Portion of Derivative Instruments 
    
    During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , we recognized an unrealized gain of   $0.9 million   related to a portion of our derivative instruments that was evaluated to be ineffective in 2016. In July 2016, we amended the interest rate swaps to add a   0.00  % floor to one-month LIBOR, and then de-designated the original swap and designated the amended swaps as a hedge in order to minimize the ineffective portion of the original derivatives.  
    
  Acquisition-related Expenses (Expense Reimbursements) 
    
  Acquisition-related expenses (expense reimbursements) increased by   $0.4 million  , or   479.5%  , to an expense of   $0.3 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to an expense reimbursement of   $0.1 million   for three months ended   September 30, 2015  . We incurred   $0.1 million   of acquisition-related expense reimbursements associated with the EOP Acquisition and   $0.3 million   of acquisition-related expenses associated with the acquisition of our 11601 Wilshire Boulevard property purchased on July 1, 2016. 
    
  Gains on Sale of Real Estate 
    
  We generated   no   gains on sale of real estate for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to a   $8.4 million   gain on sale of real estate for the three months ended   September 30, 2015   resulting from the sale of Bay Park Plaza.

Comparison of the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   to the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015 
       
  Consolidated Net Operating Income 
    
    Management evaluates NOI by evaluating the performance from the following property groups for the comparison of the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   to the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   results of operations: 

Same-store properties, which include all of the properties owned and included in our stabilized portfolio as of January 1, 2015 and still owned and included in the stabilized portfolio as of   September 30, 2016  .  

Non-same-store properties, development projects, redevelopment properties and lease-up properties as of   September 30, 2016   and other properties not owned or not in operation from January 1, 2015 through   September 30, 2016  . For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , non-same-store properties include the activity from the EOP Acquisition. 
       
  The following table presents our NOI for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and 2015 and a reconciliation of NOI to net income (loss): 

The following table summarizes certain statistics of our same-store office and media and entertainment properties for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:

The following table summarizes our change to NOI for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 
  
   55 

Total NOI increased   $69.4 million  , or   29.7%  , for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   as compared to the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , primarily due to: 

A   $8.8 million  , or   9.5%  , increase in NOI from our same-store office properties resulting primarily from higher rents, resulting primarily from rental income related to new leases signed at our 1455 Market (Uber and Vevo) and 625 Second Street (Anaplan, Metamarkets and Github) properties at higher rents than expiring leases, and increased tenant recoveries due to property tax recoveries resulting from the reassessment of the Technicolor. The increase was partially offset by straight-line rent write-off related to our Howard Street property (Heald College) recognized in the second quarter of 2015. 

A   $56.7 million  , or   43.9%  , increase in NOI from our non-same-store office store properties resulting primarily from the 11601 Wilshire Boulevard acquisition, higher rents and occupancy due to the lease-up of our Element LA (Riot Games), 901 Market (Saks), Page Mill (Toyota Research Institute), Skyport Plaza (Qualcomm), Lockheed, and Metro Center Tower (BrightEdge) properties and new leases at our completed re-development at 12655 Jefferson (WeWork and Aegis). This increase was partially offset by the sale of our First Financial (sold in March 2015), Bay Park Plaza (sold in September 2015), Bayhill Office Center (sold in January 2016), and One Bay Plaza (sold in June 2016) properties. 

A   $3.9 million  , or   35.2%  , increase in NOI from our same-store media and entertainment properties resulting primarily from higher occupancy at Sunset Bronson and Sunset Gower. In the first quarter of 2015, we decided to take certain buildings and stages off line to facilitate our ICON development and other longer-term plans for the Sunset Bronson property. In addition, other property-related revenues increased primarily due to the completion of parking structures at Sunset Bronson and Sunset Gower in the fourth quarter of 2015. The increase in other property-related revenue largely resulted from higher production activity and revenues associated with lighting and grip at Sunset Bronson. 

56 

Office NOI 
       
    Same-Store 
    
  Office rental revenue increased   $8.0 million  , or   7.1%  , to   $120.4 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to   $112.3 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The increase is primarily due to rental income relating to new leases signed at our 1455 Market (Uber and Vevo) and 625 Second Street (Anaplan, Metamarkets and Github) properties at higher rents than expiring leases. The increase was partially offset by a straight-line rent write-off related to the Howard Street property (Heald College) recognized in the second quarter of 2015. 
    
  Office tenant recoveries increased   $4.1 million  , or   21.3%  , to   $23.3 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to   $19.2 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The increase is primarily related to a property tax recovery resulting from the reassessment of the Technicolor and Element LA properties.  
    
  Office parking and other revenue was   $12.5 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , relatively flat as compared to   $13.8 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .  
    
  Office operating expenses were   $54.1 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , relatively flat as compared to   $52.1 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .  
    
    Non-Same-Store 
    
  Office rental revenue increased   $73.8 million  , or   45.0%  , to   $237.8 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to   $164.0 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   driven primarily by the EOP Acquisition and11601 Wilshire Boulevard acquisition. The increase was also related to higher rents and occupancy due to lease-up of our Element LA (Riot Games), 901 Market (Saks), Page Mill (Toyota Research Institute), Skyport Plaza (Qualcomm), Lockheed, and Metro Center Tower (BrightEdge) properties and new leases at our completed re-development at 12655 Jefferson (WeWork and Aegis). The increase was partially offset by the sale of our First Financial (sold in March 2015), Bay Park Plaza (sold in September 2015), Bayhill Office Center (sold in January 2016), and One Bay Plaza (sold in June 2016) properties. 
    
  Office tenant recoveries increased   $16.5 million  , or   66.9%  , to   $41.2 million   for   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to   $24.7 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The increase is primarily due to the EOP Acquisition, 11601 Wilshire Boulevard acquisition, and 100% occupancy at our Element LA property, partially offset by the sale of our First Financial (sold in March 2015), Bay Park Plaza (sold in September 2015), Bayhill Office Center (sold in January 2016), and One Bay Plaza (sold in June 2016) properties. 
    
  Office parking and other revenue was   $3.6 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , relatively flat as compared to   $3.8 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . 
    
  Office operating expenses increased by   $33.5 million  , or   52.9%  , to   $96.7 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to   $63.2 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The increase is primarily due to the EOP Acquisition, 11601 Wilshire Boulevard acquisition, and 100% occupancy at our Element LA property, partially offset by the sale of our First Financial (sold in March 2015), Bay Park Plaza (sold in September 2015), Bayhill Office Center (sold in January 2016), and One Bay Plaza (sold in June 2016) properties. 
    
  Same-Store Media   Entertainment NOI 
    
    Media and entertainment rental revenue, tenant recoveries and other property-related revenue increased by   $5.3 million  , or   18.6%  , to   $33.7 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to   $28.4 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The increase is primarily due to a   $3.1 million   increase in rental revenues to   $20.0 million   and a   $2.3 million   increase in other property-related revenue to   $12.8 million  . The increase in rental revenue is primarily due to higher occupancy at Sunset Gower and Sunset Bronson. The increase in other property-related revenue largely resulted from higher production activity and revenues associated with lighting and grip at Sunset Bronson during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   as compared to the same period in 2015.  

57 

Media and entertainment operating expenses were   $18.7 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , relatively flat as compared to   $17.4 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .  
    
  Other Expenses (Income) 
    
  General and Administrative Expenses 
    
    General and administrative expense include wages and salaries for corporate-level employees, accounting, legal and other professional services, office supplies, entertainment, travel and automobile expenses, telecommunications and computer-related expenses, and other miscellaneous items. General and administrative expenses increased   $9.5 million  , or   32.9%  , to   $38.5 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to   $29.0 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to the adoption of the 2016 OPP, granting of the special one-time retention awards to certain of our executives, office expenses, general corporate travel expenses, shareholder relations costs and increased staffing to meet operational needs arising from growth related to the EOP Acquisition. 
    
  Depreciation and Amortization 
    
    Depreciation and amortization expense increased   $30.9 million  , or   18.1%  , to   $201.9 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to   $170.9 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The increase was primarily related to depreciation expenses associated with properties in the EOP Acquisition and 11601 Wilshire Boulevard acquisition. The remaining increase is related to tenant improvement depreciation expense associated with the lease-up of our Element LA and 1455 Market properties, lease termination at our Rincon property, and increase in depreciation expense at Sunset Gower related to the recently completed parking garage, partially offset by the reduction of depreciation expense as a result of the sale of our 2015 and 2016 disposed properties, and increased depreciation expense related to our Howard Street property (Heald College) due to an early termination in the second quarter of 2015. 
    
  Interest Expense 
    
    Interest expense increased   $20.7 million  , or   60.8%  , to   $54.8 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to   $34.1 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . At   September 30, 2016  , we had   $2.4 billion   of notes payable, compared to   $2.1 billion   at   September 30, 2015  , excluding net deferred financing costs and net unamortized loan premium. The increase was primarily attributable to $925.0 million of term loans and private placement borrowings and additional borrowings related to a refinance of our Element LA loan, partially offset by interest savings related to our repayment of our two-year term loan, paydown of our five-year term loan due April 2020, repayment of our indebtedness associated with our 901 Market property, and paydown on our indebtedness associated with our Sunset Gower/Sunset Bronson property. Additionally, we had higher effective interest rates during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015, and increased capitalized interest primarily due to the ICON Building I Tower, ICON Building II, 4th   Traction, and 405 Mateo developments, partially offset by lower capitalized interest primarily due to Element LA re-development during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. 
       
  Unrealized loss on ineffective portion of derivative instruments 
    
  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we recognized an unrealized loss of   $1.6 million   related to a portion of our derivative instruments that were evaluated and deemed to be ineffective in 2016. In July 2016, we amended the interest rate swaps to add a   0.00  % floor to one-month LIBOR, and then de-designated the original swaps and designated the amended swaps as a hedge in order to minimize the ineffective portion of the original derivatives.  
    
  Acquisition-related expenses 
    
  Acquisition-related expenses decreased by   $43.1 million  , or   99.1%  , to   $0.4 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $43.4 million   for   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . We incurred   $43.4 million   of acquisition-related expenses associated with the EOP Acquisition and incurred   $0.4 million   of acquisition-related expenses associated with the acquisition of our 11601 Wilshire Boulevard property purchased on July 1, 2016. 
  
   58 

Gains on sale of real estate 
    
  During 2016 we completed the sale of our Bayhill Office Center, Patrick Henry Drive and One Bay Plaza properties, which generated gains of   $8.5 million   on sale of real estate for   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to a   $30.5 million   gain on sale of real estate for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   resulting from the sale of our First Financial and Bay Park Plaza properties. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  We had   $89.4 million   of cash and cash equivalents at   September 30, 2016  .  
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had total borrowing capacity of   $400.0 million   under our unsecured revolving credit facility, $  120.0 million   of which had been drawn.    
    
  We have an at-the-market equity offering program, or ATM program, that allows us to sell up to   $125.0   million of common stock. A cumulative total of   $20.1 million   has been sold through   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  On January 20, 2016, our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program to buy up to   $100.0 million   of our outstanding common stock. No share repurchases were made during the   three and nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . 
    
  We intend to use the unsecured revolving credit facility and ATM program, among other things, to finance the acquisition of other properties, to provide funds for tenant improvements and capital expenditures, and to provide for working capital and other corporate purposes.  
    
  Based on the closing price of our common stock of   $32.87   on   September 30, 2016  , our ratio of debt to total market capitalization was approximately   33.4%   (counting series A preferred units as debt). Our total market capitalization is defined as the sum of the market value of our outstanding common stock (which may decrease, thereby increasing our debt to total capitalization ratio), including restricted stock that we may issue to certain of our directors and executive officers, plus the aggregate value of common units not owned by us, plus the liquidation preference of outstanding series A preferred units, plus the book value of our total consolidated indebtedness.  
    
  Our short-term liquidity requirements primarily consist of operating expenses and other expenditures associated with our properties, distributions to our limited partners and dividend payments to our stockholders required to maintain our REIT status, capital expenditures and, potentially, acquisitions. We expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements through cash on hand, net cash provided by operations, reserves established from existing cash and, if necessary, by drawing upon our unsecured revolving credit facility. 
    
  Our long-term liquidity needs consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for the repayment of debt at maturity, property acquisitions and non-recurring capital improvements. We expect to meet our long-term liquidity requirements with net cash from operations, long-term secured and unsecured indebtedness and the issuance of equity and debt securities. We also may fund property acquisitions and non-recurring capital improvements using our unsecured revolving credit facility pending permanent financing. 
    
  We believe we have access to multiple sources of capital to fund our long-term liquidity requirements, including the incurrence of additional debt and the issuance of additional equity. However, our ability to incur additional debt will be dependent on a number of factors, including our degree of leverage, the value of our unencumbered assets and borrowing restrictions that may be imposed by lenders. Our ability to access the equity capital markets will be dependent on a number of factors as well, including general market conditions for REITs and market perceptions about us. 
  
   59 

Outstanding Indebtedness 
    
  Our indebtedness creates the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay the principal of, interest on or other amounts in respect of our indebtedness and other obligations. In addition, we may incur additional debt from time to time to finance strategic acquisitions, investments, joint ventures or for other purposes, subject to the restrictions contained in the documents governing our indebtedness. If we incur additional debt, the risks associated with our leverage, including our ability to service our debt, would increase. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had outstanding notes payable of   $2.43 billion   (before   $19.5 million   of net deferred financing costs), of which   $1.29 billion  , or   53.1%  , was variable rate debt.   $839.5 million   of the variable rate debt is subject to the interest rate contracts described in Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements Derivative Instruments.    
  
   60 

The following table sets forth information as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   with respect to our outstanding indebtedness, excluding net deferred financing costs related to as of   September 30, 2016  , and unsecured revolving credit facility and undrawn term loans as of   December 31, 2015  : 

_________________ 
           (1) 
    Interest rate with respect to indebtedness is calculated on the basis of a   360  -day year for the actual days elapsed. Interest rates are as of   September 30, 2016  , which may be different than the interest rates as of   December 31, 2015   for corresponding indebtedness. 
              (2) 
    The Company has the option to make an irrevocable election to change the interest rate depending on the Company s credit rating. As of   September 30, 2016  , no such election had been made.  
              (3) 
    The maturity date may be extended once for an additional   one  -year term. 
              (4) 
    Effective May 1, 2015,   $300.0   million of the term loan has been effectively fixed at   2.66%   to   3.56%   per annum through the use of an interest rate swap. In July 2016, the Company amended this interest rate swap to add a   0.00%   floor to one-month LIBOR, and then de-designated the original swap and designated the amended swap as a hedge in order to minimize the ineffective portion of the original derivative related to this loan. Therefore, the effective interest rate with respect to   $300.0   million of the term loan increased to a range of    2.75%   to   3.65%   per annum. See Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements Derivative Instruments for details.  
              (5) 
    Effective May 1, 2015, the outstanding balance of the term loan has been effectively fixed at   3.21%   to   4.16%   per annum through the use of an interest rate swap. In July 2016, the Company amended this interest rate swap to add a   0.00%   floor to one-month LIBOR, and then de-designated the original swap and designated the amended swap as a hedge in order to minimize the ineffective portion of the original derivative related to this loan. Therefore, the  
     
   61 

effective interest rate increased to a range of   3.36%   to   4.31%   per annum. See Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements Derivative Instruments for details. 
           (6) 
    Effective June 1, 2016, the outstanding balance of the term loan has been effectively fixed at   3.03%   to   3.98%   per annum through the use of an interest rate swap. See Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements Derivative Instruments for details. 
              (7) 
    Monthly debt service includes annual debt amortization payments based on a   30  -year amortization schedule with a balloon payment at maturity. 
              (8) 
    Through February 11, 2016, interest on   $92.0 million   of the outstanding loan balance was effectively capped at   5.97%   and   4.25%   on   $50.0 million   and   $42.0 million  , respectively, of the loan through the use of   two   interest rate caps. These interest rate caps were not renewed after maturity. 
              (9) 
    This loan bears interest only. Interest on the full loan amount has been effectively fixed at   3.71%   per annum through use of an interest rate swap. See Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements Derivative Instruments for details. 
              (10) 
    This loan bears interest only for the first   five   years. Beginning with the payment due December 6, 2017, monthly debt service will include annual debt amortization payments based on a   30  -year amortization schedule with a balloon payment at maturity. 
              (11) 
    The Company owns approximately   65%   of the ownership interests in the joint venture that owns the Pinnacle I and II properties. 
              (12) 
    Represents unamortized premium amount of the non-cash mark-to-market adjustment. 
              (13) 
    Total mortgage loans do not include the balance related to the loan entered on October 7, 2016 for   $101.0 million   with a fixed interest rate of   3.38%   per annum. This loan was entered into in conjunction with the acquisition of Hill7 office property through a joint venture with Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board. The Company owns   55%   of the ownership interest in the joint venture. See Note 20 to our Consolidated Financial Statements Subsequent Events for details. 
       
    The operating partnership was in compliance with its financial covenants at   September 30, 2016  .   
    
  Cash Flows 
    
    Comparison of the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   is as follows: 

Cash and cash equivalents were   $89.4 million   and   $53.6 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
    
  Operating Activities 
    
  Net cash provided by operating activities increased by   $75.6 million   to   $196.8 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $121.1 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in cash NOI, as defined, from our office properties, arising primarily from the EOP Acquisition and 11601 Wilshire Boulevard property acquisition, increased occupancy and higher rental revenue across our portfolio. In addition, in 2016 we had lower acquisition-related costs. 
    
  Investing Activities 
    
  Net cash used for investing activities decreased by   $1.52 billion   to   $220.0 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $1.74 billion   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The decrease was primarily attributable to less cash used for acquisitions, increased proceeds from sale of real estate in the current year, and cash proceeds from the repayment of notes receivable, partially offset by increased cash used for additions to investment in real estate,  contributions to our unconsolidated entity and payment of the deposit for the Hill7 office property acquisition.  
    
  Financing Activities 
    
  Net cash provided by financing activities decreased   $1.59 billion   to   $59.0 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $1.65 billion   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The change was primarily due to repurchases of common units in our operating partnership in 2016, increase in payments of notes payables, decrease in proceeds from notes payables, decrease in contributions to non-controlling consolidated entities, and increase in dividends paid to common stockholders and unitholders, partially offset by an increase in proceeds from sale of common stock. 
  
   62 

Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
    
  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , there were no material changes outside the ordinary course of business in the information regarding specified contractual obligations contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . See Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements Notes Payable for information regarding our minimum future principal payments due on our senior unsecured loans and mortgage loans. See Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements Future Minimum Base Rents and Lease Payments Future Minimum Rents for information regarding our future minimum base rents and future minimum ground lease payments. 
    
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
    
  We currently do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements. 
    
  Critical Accounting Policies  
    
  Our discussion and analysis of our historical financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates of certain items and judgments as to certain future events, for example with respect to the allocation of the purchase price of acquired property among land, buildings, improvements, equipment, and any related intangible assets and liabilities, or the effect of a property tax reassessment of our properties. These determinations, even though inherently subjective and prone to change, affect the reported amounts of our assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. While we believe that our estimates are based on reasonable assumptions and judgments at the time they are made, some of our assumptions, estimates and judgments will inevitably prove to be incorrect. As a result, actual outcomes will likely differ from our accruals, and those differences positive or negative could be material. Some of our accruals are subject to adjustment, as we believe appropriate based on revised estimates and reconciliation to the actual results when available.  
    
  In addition, we identified certain critical accounting policies that affect certain of our more significant estimates and assumptions used in preparing our consolidated financial statements in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have not made any material changes to these policies during the periods covered by this Report.  

63 

Non-GAAP Supplemental Financial Measure: Funds From Operations 
    
  We calculate FFO in accordance with the White Paper on FFO approved by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts. The White Paper defines FFO as net income or loss calculated in accordance with GAAP, excluding extraordinary items, as defined by GAAP, gains and losses from sales of depreciable real estate and impairment write-downs associated with depreciable real estate, plus real estate-related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs and depreciation of non-real estate assets) and after adjustment for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. The calculation of FFO includes the amortization of deferred revenue related to tenant-funded tenant improvements and excludes the depreciation of the related tenant improvement assets. We believe that FFO is a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance. The exclusion from FFO of gains and losses from the sale of operating real estate assets allows investors and analysts to readily identify the operating results of the assets that form the core of our activity and assists in comparing those operating results between periods. Also, because FFO is generally recognized as the industry standard for reporting the operations of REITs, it facilitates comparisons of operating performance to other REITs. However, other REITs may use different methodologies to calculate FFO, and accordingly, our FFO may not be comparable to all other REITs.  
       
  Implicit in historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP is the assumption that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies using historical cost accounting alone to be insufficient. Because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, we believe that FFO along with the required GAAP presentations provides a more complete measurement of our performance relative to our competitors and a more appropriate basis on which to make decisions involving operating, financing and investing activities than the required GAAP presentations alone would provide. The Company uses FFO per share to calculate annual cash bonuses for certain employees. 
       
  However, FFO should not be viewed as an alternative measure of our operating performance because it does not reflect either depreciation and amortization costs or the level of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, which are significant economic costs and could materially impact our results from operations.  
    
  The following table presents our FFO for the   three and nine months ended   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015 and a reconciliation of net income (loss) to FFO:
