Cautionary Language Regarding Forward-Looking Statements  
  This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q ("Form 10-Q") contains forward-looking statements that are based on our management's expectations as of the filing date of this report with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC").  Statements that are not historical facts are hereby identified as forward-looking statements. In addition, words such as "estimate," "anticipate," "project," "plan," "intend," "believe," "expect," "likely," "predicted," any variations of these words and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. Such statements include plans, projections and estimates contained in   "Part I Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"   ("MD A")     and   "Part I Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk"   herein.  Such forward-looking statements include (1) expectations regarding anticipated growth in the wireless industry, carriers' investments in their networks, tenant additions, customer consolidation or ownership changes, or demand for our wireless infrastructure, (2) expectations regarding non-renewals of tenant leases (including the impact of our customers' decommissioning of the former Leap Wireless, MetroPCS  and Clearwire networks (collectively, the "Acquired Networks")), (3) availability and adequacy of cash flows and liquidity for, or plans regarding, future discretionary investments including capital expenditures, (4) potential benefits of our discretionary investments, (5) anticipated growth in our financial results, including future revenues, margins, Adjusted EBITDA, segment site rental gross margin, segment network services and other gross margin, segment operating profit, and operating cash flows, (6) expectations regarding our capital structure and the credit markets, our availability and cost of capital, or our ability to service our debt and comply with debt covenants and the benefits of any future refinancings, (7) expectations related to remaining qualified as a real estate investment trust ("REIT") and the advantages, benefits or impact of, or opportunities created by, our REIT status, (8) the realization and utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards ("NOLs"), (9) our dividend policy and the timing, amount, growth or tax characterization of any dividends and (10) the anticipated closing of the Proposed FiberNet Acquisition (as defined in note 13).  
  Such forward-looking statements should, therefore, be considered in light of various risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including prevailing market conditions, risk factors described in   "Item 1A. Risk Factors"   of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015   ("  2015   Form 10-K") and other factors.  Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those expected.  As used herein, the term "including," and any variation thereof, means "including without limitation." The use of the word "or" herein is not exclusive.

CROWN CASTLE INTERNATIONAL CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-Unaudited 
  (Tabular dollars in thousands, except per share amounts) 

The information contained in the following notes to the consolidated financial statements is condensed from that which would appear in the annual consolidated financial statements; accordingly, the consolidated financial statements included herein should be reviewed in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015  , and related notes thereto, included in the   2015   Form 10-K filed by Crown Castle International Corp. ("CCIC") with the SEC.  References to the "Company" include CCIC and its predecessor, as applicable, and their subsidiaries, unless otherwise indicated or the context indicates otherwise.  As used herein, the term "including," and any variation thereof means "including without limitation."  The use of the word "or" herein is not exclusive. 
  The Company owns, operates and leases shared wireless infrastructure, including: (1) towers and other structures, such as rooftops (collectively, "towers"), and (2) small cell networks supported by fiber (collectively, "small cells" and, together with towers, "wireless infrastructure").  The Company's wireless infrastructure is geographically dispersed throughout the United States, including Puerto Rico ("U.S.").  See note   3   for a discussion of the May 2015 sale of the Company's formerly   77.6%   owned subsidiary that operated towers in Australia (referred to as "CCAL").   
  The Company's core business is providing access, including space or capacity, to its shared wireless infrastructure via long-term contracts in various forms, including licenses, subleases and lease agreements.  
  During the first quarter of 2016, the Company changed its operating segments to consist of (1) towers and (2) small cells.    The Company has recast its prior period presentation to conform to its current reporting presentation.  See note   11  . 
  As part of the Company's effort to provide comprehensive wireless infrastructure solutions, it offers certain network services relating to its wireless infrastructure, consisting of (1) the following site development services relating to existing or new tenant equipment installations on its wireless infrastructure: site acquisition, architectural and engineering, or zoning and permitting and (2) tenant equipment installation or subsequent augmentations.  
  The Company operates as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes.  In addition, the Company has certain taxable REIT subsidiaries ("TRSs").  See note   7  . 
  Approximately   54%   of the Company's towers are leased or subleased or operated and managed under master leases, subleases, and other agreements with AT T, Sprint, and T-Mobile.  The Company has the option to purchase these towers at the end of their respective lease terms.  The Company has no obligation to exercise such purchase options.   
  Basis of Presentation  
  The condensed consolidated financial statements included herein are unaudited; however, they include all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) which, in the opinion of management, are necessary to state fairly the consolidated financial position of the Company at   September 30, 2016  , and the consolidated results of operations and the consolidated cash flows for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  The year-end condensed consolidated balance sheet data was derived from audited financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by GAAP.  The results of operations for the interim periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year.   
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.  

2. 
    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies    
     The significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements are disclosed in the   2015   Form 10-K, other than certain recent accounting pronouncements described below.   
  Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements  
  In April 2015, the FASB issued new guidance on the presentation of debt issuance costs. The guidance requires debt issuance costs be presented on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability, consistent with debt discounts and premiums.  The Company adopted the guidance as of January 1, 2016, and has applied the guidance

    CROWN CASTLE INTERNATIONAL CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-Unaudited (Continued) 
  (Tabular dollars in thousands, except per share amounts) 

retrospectively.  As a result, the Company reclassified   $99.3 million   of deferred financing costs as of   December 31, 2015   from "long-term prepaid rent and other assets, net" as a direct reduction of "debt and other long-term obligations." 
  In September 2015, the FASB issued new guidance which requires an acquirer to recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. The Company adopted the guidance as of January 1, 2016 on a prospective basis.  This standard did not have a material impact on the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements upon adoption. 
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued new guidance on the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases.  The new guidance requires lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability, initially measured at the present value of the lease payments for all leases with a term greater than 12 months.  The accounting for lessors remains largely unchanged from existing guidance.  This guidance is effective for the Company as of January 1, 2019 and is required to be applied using a modified retrospective approach for all leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented.  Early adoption is permitted.  The Company expects this guidance to have a material impact on its condensed consolidated financial statements and is currently evaluating the impact. 
  In June 2016, the FASB issued new guidance on the recognition and measurement of expected credit losses for certain types of financial instruments, including accounts receivable.  The new guidance requires entities to estimate the expected credit loss over the life of certain financial instruments at initial recognition of the financial instrument. The guidance is effective for the Company as of January 1, 2020.  Early adoption is permitted.  The Company does not expect this guidance to have a material impact on its condensed consolidated financial statements. 

3. 
    Discontinued Operations 
     On May 14, 2015, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell CCAL to a consortium of investors led by Macquarie Infrastructure and Real Assets (collectively,  Buyer ).  On May 28, 2015, the Company completed the sale.  At closing, the Company received net proceeds of approximately $  1.1 billion   after accounting for the Company's   77.6%   ownership interest, repayment of intercompany debt owed to the Company by CCAL and estimated transaction fees and expenses, exclusive of the impact of foreign currency swaps related to the CCAL sale.  
  As part of the sale of CCAL, in January 2016, the Company received an installment payment from the Buyer totaling approximately $  124 million  , inclusive of the impact of the related foreign currency swap. 
  CCAL was historically a separate operating segment of the Company.  The sale of the Company's CCAL operating segment is treated as discontinued operations for all periods presented pursuant to ASU 2014-8,   Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity  , which the Company adopted on January 1, 2015.  The gain from disposal of CCAL is included in discontinued operations on the condensed consolidated statement of operations.  The table below sets forth the results of operations related to discontinued operations for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . 

(a) 
    Exclusive of depreciation, amortization, and accretion shown separately. 
              (b) 
    No interest expense has been allocated to discontinued operations. 
              (c) 
    CCAL results are through May 28, 2015, which was the closing date of the Company's sale of CCAL. 
              (d) 
    Exclusive of the gain (loss) from disposal of discontinued operations, net of tax, as presented on the condensed consolidated financial statement of operations.

4. 
    Acquisitions 
     In April 2016, the Company acquired Tower Development Corporation ("TDC"), a portfolio of approximately   330   towers, for approximately   $461 million   in cash ("TDC Acquisition").  The Company funded the acquisition with cash on hand, cash from borrowings under the 2016 Revolver, and cash from equity issuances under the ATM Program (see note   10  ).  As of September 30, 2016, the preliminary purchase price allocation was primarily composed of other intangible assets of approximately   $155 million  , property and equipment of approximately   $106 million  , and  goodwill of approximately   $200 million  .  The preliminary purchase price allocation, including the valuation of fixed assets and intangible assets, is based upon a preliminary valuation, which is subject to change as the Company obtains additional information.

    In February 2016, the Company issued   $1.5 billion   aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes ("2016 Senior Notes"), which consist of (1)   $600.0 million   aggregate principal amount of   3.40%   senior notes with a final maturity date of February 2021 and (2)   $900.0 million   aggregate principal amount of   4.45%   senior notes with a final maturity date of February 2026.  The Company used net proceeds from the 2016 Senior Notes offering, together with cash on hand, to (1) repay in full all outstanding borrowings under the previously outstanding 364-Day Facility and (2) repay   $500.0 million   of outstanding borrowings under the 2016 Revolver. 
               (f) 
    In September 2016, the Company issued   $700.0 million   aggregate principal amount of   2.25%   senior unsecured notes ("September 2016 Senior Notes").  The Company used net proceeds from the September 2016 Senior Notes offering (1) to repay in full the 2.381% Secured Notes issued by certain of its subsidiaries and (2) to repay a portion of the outstanding borrowings under the 2016 Revolver. 
              (g) 
    Balances reflect debt issuance costs as a direct reduction from the respective carrying amounts of debt, with the exception of debt issuance costs associated with the Company's revolving credit facilities.  See note 2. 
     Contractual Maturities 
  The following are the scheduled contractual maturities of the total debt and other long-term obligations of the Company outstanding as of   September 30, 2016  .

    Amounts reclassified from "accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)." 

6. 
    Fair Value Disclosures 

The fair value of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash approximate the carrying value.  The Company determines the fair value of its debt securities based on indicative, non-binding quotes from brokers.  Quotes from brokers require judgment and are based on the brokers' interpretation of market information, including implied credit spreads for similar borrowings on recent trades or bid/ask prices or quotes from active markets if available.  Foreign currency swaps are valued at settlement amounts using observable exchange rates and, if material, reflect an adjustment for the Company's and contract counterparty's credit risk.  There were no changes since   December 31, 2015   in the Company's valuation techniques used to measure fair values.

7. 
    Income Taxes 
     The Company operates as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes.  As a REIT, the Company is generally entitled to a deduction for dividends that it pays and therefore is not subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax on its net taxable income that is currently distributed to its stockholders.  The Company also may be subject to certain federal, state, local, and foreign taxes on its income and assets, including (1) alternative minimum taxes, (2) taxes on any undistributed income, (3) taxes related to the TRSs, (4) certain state, local, or foreign income taxes, (5) franchise taxes, (6) property taxes, and (7) transfer taxes.  In addition, the Company could in certain circumstances be required to pay an excise or penalty tax, which could be significant in amount, in order to utilize one or more relief provisions under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended ("Code") to maintain qualification for taxation as a REIT.   
  During the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company completed the necessary steps to include small cells that were previously included in one or more TRSs in the REIT.  As a result, during the fourth quarter 2015, the Company de-recognized the net deferred tax liabilities in conjunction with the inclusion of small cells in the REIT.  Effective January 4, 2016 the Company's small cells that were previously included in one or more TRSs are included in the REIT.   
  The Company's TRS assets and operations will continue to be subject, as applicable, to federal and state corporate income taxes or to foreign taxes in the jurisdictions in which such assets and operations are located.  The Company's foreign assets and operations (including its tower operations in Puerto Rico) most likely will be subject to foreign income taxes in the jurisdictions in which such assets and operations are located, regardless of whether they are included in a TRS or not. 
  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company's effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate predominately due to the Company's REIT status, including the dividends paid deduction.  

8. 
    Per Share Information 
     Basic net income (loss) attributable to CCIC common stockholders, per common share, excludes dilution and is computed by dividing net income (loss) attributable to CCIC common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period.  Diluted net income (loss) attributable to CCIC common stockholders, per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) attributable to CCIC common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period plus any potential dilutive common share equivalents, including shares issuable (1) upon the vesting of restricted stock awards and restricted stock units as determined under the treasury stock method and (2) upon conversion of the Company's Convertible Preferred Stock, as determined under the if-converted method.

  (Tabular dollars in thousands, except per share amounts) 

During the first quarter of 2016, the Company changed its operating segments to consist of (1) towers and (2) small cells.  This change was as a result of growth in small cells from a combination of organic growth, capital expenditures, and acquisitions, as well as the continued progression of the integration of Quanta Fiber Networks, Inc. ("Sunesys"), which led to changes in how the Company's chief operating decision maker ("CODM") reviews financial information. 
  The Company's operating segment change aligns with how the CODM views and evaluates the Company's operations, including how the CODM allocates capital and assesses segment performance.  The Company has recast its prior period presentation to conform to its current reporting presentation.   
  The towers segment provides access, including space or capacity, to the Company's approximately   40,000   towers geographically dispersed throughout the United States. The tower segment also reflects certain network services relating to the Company's towers, consisting of site development services and installation services.  The small cells segment provides access, including space or capacity, to the Company's small cell networks designed to facilitate wireless connectivity and supported by   17,000   miles of fiber.  To a lesser extent, the small cells segment offers other fiber based solutions, including dark fiber (dedicated fiber strands lit by the customer) and lit fiber (bandwidth provided to the customer using the Company's own optronics).

The measurement of profit or loss used by the CODM to evaluate the results of operations of its operating segments are (1) segment site rental gross margin, (2) segment network services and other gross margin, and (3) segment operating profit.  The Company defines segment site rental gross margin as segment site rental revenues less segment site rental cost of operations, which excludes stock-based compensation expense and prepaid lease purchase price adjustments recorded in consolidated cost of operations.  The Company defines segment network services and other gross margin as segment network services and other revenues less segment network services and other cost of operations, which excludes stock-based compensation expense recorded in consolidated cost of operations.  The Company defines segment operating profit as segment site rental gross margin plus segment network services and other gross margin, less general and administrative expenses attributable to the respective segment.   
  Costs that are directly attributable to towers and small cells are assigned to those respective segments.  The "Other" column (1) represents amounts excluded from specific segments, such as restructuring charges (credits), asset write-down charges, acquisition and integration costs, depreciation, amortization and accretion, amortization of prepaid lease purchase price adjustments, interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs, gains (losses) on retirement of long-term obligations, net gain (loss) on interest rate swaps, gains (losses) on foreign currency swaps, impairment of available-for-sale securities, interest income, other income (expense), cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, income (loss) from discontinued operations, and stock-based compensation expense, and (2) reconciles segment operating profit to income (loss) before income taxes, as the amounts are not utilized in assessing each segment s performance. The "Other" total assets balance includes corporate assets such as cash and cash equivalents which have not been allocated to specific segments.  There are no significant revenues resulting from transactions between the Company's operating segments.

General Overview  
  Overview  
  We own, operate and lease shared wireless infrastructure that is geographically dispersed throughout the U.S., and which consists of approximately (1) 40,000 towers and (2) small cells supported by 17,000 miles of fiber.  Our towers have a significant presence in the top 100 BTAs, and the majority of our fiber is located in major metropolitan areas.  Site rental revenues represented   82%   of our   third   quarter   2016   consolidated net revenues.  Our towers operating segment and small cells operating segment accounted for   87%   and   13%   of our   third   quarter 2016 site rental revenues, respectively.  See note   11   to our condensed consolidated financial statements and   "Item 2. MD A General Overview Change in Operating Segments."    The vast majority of our site rental revenues is of a recurring nature and was contracted for in a prior year.  
  Strategy 
  Our strategy is to create long-term stockholder value via a combination of (1) growing cash flows generated from our portfolio of wireless infrastructure, (2) returning a meaningful portion of our cash provided by operating activities to our stockholders in the form of dividends and (3) investing capital efficiently to grow cash flows and long-term dividends per share.  We measure our efforts to create "long-term stockholder value" by the combined payment of dividends to stockholders and growth in our per share results.  The key elements of our strategy are to: 
             
    Grow cash flows from our wireless infrastructure.   We seek to maximize the site rental cash flows derived from our wireless infrastructure by adding tenants on our wireless infrastructure through long-term leases. We believe that the rapid growth in wireless connectivity will result in considerable future demand for our existing wireless infrastructure.  We seek to maximize additional tenancy on our wireless infrastructure by working with wireless customers to quickly provide them access to our wireless infrastructure via tenant additions or modifications of existing tenant equipment installations to enable them to expand coverage and capacity in order to meet increasing demand for wireless connectivity. We expect increases in our site rental cash flows from tenant additions and the related subsequent impact from contracted escalations to result in growth in our operating cash flows as our wireless infrastructure has relatively fixed operating costs (which tend to increase at the rate of inflation). We believe there is considerable additional future demand for our existing wireless infrastructure based on their location and the anticipated growth in the wireless communication services industry.  Substantially all of our wireless infrastructure can accommodate additional tenancy, either as currently constructed or with appropriate modifications to the structure (which may include extensions or structural reinforcement), from which we expect to generate high incremental returns.   
                
    Return cash provided by operating activities to stockholders in the form of dividends  .  We believe that distributing a meaningful portion of our cash provided by operating activities appropriately provides stockholders with increased certainty for a portion of expected long-term stockholder value while still retaining sufficient flexibility to invest in our business and deliver growth.  We believe this decision reflects the translation of the high-quality, long-term contractual cash flows of our business into stable capital returns to stockholders.  
                
    Invest capital efficiently to grow cash flows and long-term dividends per share.   We seek to invest our available capital, including the net cash provided by our operating activities and external financing sources, in a manner that will increase long-term stockholder value on a risk-adjusted basis.  Our historical investments have included the following (in no particular order): 
                
    purchases of shares of our common stock from time to time; 
                
    acquisitions or construction of wireless infrastructure; 
                
    acquisitions of land interests under towers; 
                
    improvements and structural enhancements to our existing wireless infrastructure; or 
     
    20 

purchases, repayments or redemptions of our debt. 
     Our strategy to create long-term stockholder value is based on our belief that additional demand for our wireless infrastructure will be created by the expected continued growth in the demand for wireless connectivity.  We believe that such demand for our wireless infrastructure will continue, will result in growth of our cash flows due to tenant additions on our existing wireless infrastructure, and will create other growth opportunities for us, such as demand for new wireless infrastructure. 
  Business Fundamentals and Results 
  The following are certain highlights of our business fundamentals and results as of and for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  
             
    We operate as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes.   
                
    As a REIT, we are generally entitled to a deduction for dividends that we pay and therefore are not subject to U.S. federal corporate income tax on our taxable income that is distributed to our stockholders.   
                
    To qualify and be taxed as a REIT, we will generally be required to distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, after the utilization of our NOLs (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gain), each year to our stockholders.   
                
    See note   7   to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our REIT status. 
                
    Potential growth resulting from wireless network expansion and new entrants 
                
    We expect wireless carriers will continue their focus on improving network quality and expanding capacity by utilizing a combination of towers and small cells solutions.  We believe our product offerings of towers and small cells provide a comprehensive wireless solution to our customers' growing wireless infrastructure needs. 
                
    We expect existing and potential new customer demand for our wireless infrastructure will result from (1) new technologies, (2) increased usage of wireless applications (including mobile entertainment, mobile internet usage, and machine-to-machine applications), (3) adoption of other emerging and embedded wireless devices (including smartphones, laptops, tablets, and other devices), (4) increasing smartphone penetration, (5) wireless carrier focus on expanding both network quality and capacity, including through the use of both towers and small cells, or (6) the availability of additional spectrum. 
                
    Substantially all of our wireless infrastructure can accommodate additional tenancy, either as currently constructed or with appropriate modifications to the structure. 
                
    U.S. wireless carriers continue to invest in their networks. 
                
    Site rental revenues under long-term tenant leases with contractual escalations 
                
    Initial terms of five to 15 years with multiple renewal periods at the option of the tenant of five to ten years each. 
                
    Weighted-average remaining term of approximately six years, exclusive of renewals at the tenant's option, currently representing approximately $19 billion of expected future cash inflows. 
                
    Revenues predominately from large wireless carriers 
                
    Approximately   88%   of our site rental revenues were derived from AT T, Sprint, T-Mobile, and Verizon Wireless.  See also   "Item 2. MD A General Overview Outlook Highlights"   presented below.  
                
    Majority of land interests under our towers under long-term control 
                
    Approximately 90% of our tower site rental gross margin and more than 75% of our tower site rental gross margin is derived from towers that reside on land that we own or control for greater than ten and 20 years, respectively.  The aforementioned amounts include towers that reside on land interests that are owned, including fee interests and perpetual easements, which represent over one-third of our tower site rental gross margin. 
                
    Controlled cost structure on our wireless infrastructure leading to high incremental margins 
                
    At current leasing activity levels, operating costs tend to increase at approximately the rate of inflation.  
                
    As leasing volume increases, our operating costs tend to increase commensurate with this growth, delivering meaningful incremental margins. 
                
    Minimal sustaining capital expenditure requirements 
                
    Sustaining capital expenditures represented less than   2%   of net revenues. 
                
    Debt portfolio with long-dated maturities extended over multiple years, with the majority of such debt having a fixed rate (see   "Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk"   for a further discussion of our debt)  
                
    81%   of our debt is fixed rate.  
                
    Our debt service coverage and leverage ratios were comfortably within their respective financial maintenance covenants.  
                
    During 2016, we completed several debt transactions resulting in lowering our average cost of debt, refinancing certain of our debt, and extending certain of our debt maturities.  See note   5   to our condensed consolidated financial statements and   "Item 2. Liquidity and Capital Resources". 
     
    21 

In January 2016, we completed a new senior unsecured credit facility and utilized the proceeds to repay the previously outstanding 2012 Credit Facility.   
                   
    Significant cash flows from operations 
                
    Net cash provided by operating activities was   $1.3 billion  . 
                
    We expect to grow our core business of providing access to our wireless infrastructure as a result of contractual escalators and future anticipated additional demand for our wireless infrastructure. 
                
    Returning cash flows provided by operations to stockholders in the form of dividends 
                
    During the first three quarters of 2016, we paid a common stock cash dividend of $0.885 per share, totaling approximately   $896.6 million  .  In October 2016, we increased our quarterly common stock cash dividend, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016, from an annualized amount of $3.54 per share to an annualized amount of $3.80 per share.  As such, we declared a quarterly common stock cash dividend of $0.95 per share in October 2016, which represents an increase of 7% from the quarterly common stock cash dividend declared during each of the first three quarters of 2016.  We currently expect our anticipated quarterly dividends to result in aggregate annualized cash payments of at least   $1.3 billion   during the next 12 months, or an annualized amount of $3.80 per share.  Over time, we expect to increase our dividend per share generally commensurate with our realized growth in cash flows. Future dividends are subject to the approval of our board of directors. 
                
    Investing capital efficiently to grow long-term dividends per share  
                
    Discretionary capital expenditures were   $566.4 million  , including wireless infrastructure improvements in order to support additional site rentals, construction of wireless infrastructure and land purchases. 
                
    See note 13 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our Proposed FiberNet Acquisition. 
     Change in Operating Segments 
  During the first quarter of 2016, we changed our operating segments to consist of (1) towers and (2) small cells.  This change was as a result of growth in small cells from a combination of organic growth, capital expenditures, and acquisitions, as well as the continued progression of the integration of Sunesys, which led to changes in how our CODM reviews financial information. 
  Our operating segment change aligns with how the CODM views and evaluates our operations, including how the CODM allocates capital and assesses performance.  We have recast our prior period presentation to conform to our current reporting presentation.  
  Towers.    Our towers segment, which represented   88%   of our revenues during the first   nine   months of 2016, provides access, including space or capacity, to our approximately 40,000 towers geographically dispersed throughout the United States.  Our towers have a significant presence in the top 100 BTAs.  The towers segment also reflects certain network services relating to our towers, consisting of site development services and installation services.  
  We acquired ownership interests or exclusive rights to the majority of our towers from the four largest wireless carriers (or their predecessors) through transactions consummated since 1999, including transactions with (1) AT T in 2013, (2) T-Mobile in 2012, (3) Global Signal Inc. in 2007, which had originally acquired the majority of its towers from Sprint, (4) companies now part of Verizon Wireless during 1999 and 2000, and (5) companies now part of AT T during 1999 and 2000.  
  Small cells.    Our small cells segment, which represented   12%   of our revenues during the first   nine   months of 2016, provides access, including space or capacity, to our small cell networks designed to facilitate wireless connectivity and supported by 17,000 miles of fiber.  To a lesser extent, the small cells segment offers other fiber based solutions, including dark fiber (dedicated fiber strands lit by the customer) and lit fiber (bandwidth provided to the customer using our own optronics). 
  Our small cell assets include those acquired from NextG Networks, Inc. in 2012 and from Sunesys in 2015 ("Sunesys Acquisition").  Our customers in small cells generally are large wireless carriers, and, to a lesser extent, non-wireless carriers, such as bandwidth-intensive verticals including education, enterprise, and government.  See also "  Item 1. Business"   to our 2015 Form 10-K. 
  
    22 

Outlook Highlights 
  The following are certain highlights of our full year 2016 and 2017 outlook that impact our business fundamentals described above. 
             
    We expect that our full year 2016 and 2017 site rental revenue growth will benefit from a healthy environment for tenant additions, as large wireless carriers upgrade and enhance their networks to meet the increasing need for wireless connectivity, partially offset by anticipated non-renewals of tenant leases primarily resulting from our customers' decommissioning of the Acquired Networks. 
                
    We expect capital expenditures for 2016 and 2017 to equal or exceed levels from the respective preceding year. We also expect sustaining capital expenditures to be approximately 2% of net revenues for both full year 2016 and full year 2017. 

Results of Operations  
  The following discussion of our results of operations should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and our   2015   Form 10-K.   
  The following discussion of our results of operations is based on our condensed consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts (see   "Item 2. MD A Accounting and Reporting Matters Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates"   and note   2   to our consolidated financial statements on our   2015   Form 10-K).  
  Our operating segments for the   third   quarter of 2016 consist of (1) towers and (2) small cells.  See note   11   to our condensed consolidated financial statements and "  Item 2. MD A General Overview Change in Operating Segments"        for further discussion of our operating segments. 
  See   "Item 2. MD A Accounting and Reporting Matters Non-GAAP Financial Measures"   for a discussion of our use of (1) segment site rental gross margin, (2) segment network services and other gross margin, (3) segment operating profit, including their respective definitions, and (4) Adjusted EBITDA, including its definition, and a reconciliation to net income (loss). 
  Highlights of the Company's results of operations for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016 and 2015   are depicted below.   

(a) 
    See reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA in "Item 2. MD A Accounting and Reporting Matters Non-GAAP Financial Measures." 
              (b) 
    See note 11 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our definitions of segment site rental gross margin, segment network services and other gross margin and segment operating profit.     
     
    23 

Site rental revenues grew   $47.4 million  , or   6%  , from the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015   to the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  This growth was predominately comprised of the factors depicted in the chart below: 

(a) 
    Includes (1) amortization of up front payments received from long-term tenant contracts and other deferred credits (commonly referred to as prepaid rent) and (2) the construction of small cells. 
              (b) 
    Represents initial contribution of acquisitions and tower builds until the one-year anniversary of the acquisition or build. 
     Towers site rental revenues for the   third   quarter of   2016   were   $709.6 million   and   increased   by   $22.7 million  , or   3%  , from   $686.9 million   during the same period in the prior year.  The increase in towers site rental revenues was impacted by the following items, inclusive of straight-line accounting, in no particular order: tenant additions across our entire portfolio, renewals or extensions of tenant leases, escalations, acquisitions (including the TDC Acquisition in April 2016), and non-renewals of tenant leases predominately arising from our customers' decommissioning of the Acquired Networks.  Tenant additions were influenced by our customers' ongoing efforts to improve network quality and capacity. 
  Small cells site rental revenues for the   third   quarter of   2016   were   $102.4 million   and   increased   by   $24.7 million  , or   32%  , from   $77.7 million   during the same period in the prior year.  The   increase   in small cells site rental revenues was predominately  (1) impacted by the Sunesys Acquisition and (2) due to the leasing of newly constructed small cells.  Demand for small cells was influenced by our customers' growing adoption of small cells as an important component of their network strategy to provide capacity and relieve network congestion. 
  The   increase   in towers site rental gross margins was related to the previously mentioned   3%     increase   in towers site rental revenues and relatively fixed costs to operate our towers.  The   increase   in small cells site rental gross margins was predominately related to the previously mentioned   32%     increase   in small cells site rental revenues. 
  Towers network services and other gross margin was   $69.6 million   for the   third   quarter of   2016   and   increased   by   $6.3 million  , or   10%  , from   $63.3 million   during the same period in the prior year, which is a reflection of (1) the volume of activity from carrier network enhancements and (2) the volume and mix of network services and other work.  Our network services and other offerings are of a variable nature as these revenues are not under long-term contracts.General and administrative expenses for the   third   quarter of   2016   were   $89.9 million   and   increased   by   $13.2 million  , or approximately   17%  , from   $76.7 million   during the same period in the prior year.   
  General and administrative expenses are inclusive of stock-based compensation charges, which increased $4.9 million from the   third   quarter of 2015 to the   third   quarter of 2016.  The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily related to the growth in our small cell business as a result of activities such as (1) the Sunesys Acquisition and (2) the continued expansion in size of our small cell portfolio. 
  Towers operating profit for the   third   quarter of   2016     increased   by   $28.5 million  , or   5%  , from the same period in the prior year.  Towers operating profit was primarily impacted by the growth in our towers site rental revenues and relatively fixed costs to operate our towers. 
  
    24 

Small cells operating profit for the   third   quarter of   2016     increased   by   $11.3 million  , or   27%  , from the same period in the prior year.  Small cells operating profit was positively impacted by the previously mentioned Sunesys Acquisition and due to the leasing of newly constructed small cells. 
  Adjusted EBITDA   increased     $35.0 million  , or   7%  , from the   third   quarter of   2015   to the   third   quarter of   2016  .  Adjusted EBITDA was primarily impacted by the growth in our site rental activities in both towers and small cells, including the Sunesys Acquisition as discussed above.  
  Depreciation, amortization and accretion was   $280.8 million   for the   third   quarter of   2016   and   increased   by   $19.1 million  , or   7%  , from   $261.7 million   during the same period in the prior year.  This increase predominately resulted from a corresponding increase in our gross property and equipment due to capital expenditures and acquisitions, including the Sunesys Acquisition.  
  Interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs were   $129.9 million   for the   third   quarter of   2016   and remained consistent with the   third   quarter of   2015  . As a result of repaying certain of our debt, in conjunction with our refinancing activities, we incurred losses of   $10.3 million   for the   third   quarter of 2016.  See note   5   to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  For the   third   quarter of   2016   and   2015  , the effective tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate predominately due to our REIT status, including the dividends paid deduction.  See note   7   to our condensed consolidated financial statements and also note 11 to our consolidated financial statements in our   2015   Form 10-K.  
  Net income (loss) attributable to CCIC stockholders was income of   $87.4 million   during the third quarter of 2016 compared to income of   $92.8 million   during the   third   quarter of 2015. 
  Highlights of the Company's results of operations for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016 and 2015   are depicted below.

Site rental revenues grew   $182.8 million  , or   8%  , from the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  This growth was predominately comprised of the factors depicted in the chart below: 

(a) 
    Includes (1) amortization of up front payments received from long-term tenant contracts and other deferred credits (commonly referred to as prepaid rent) and (2) the construction of small cells. 
              (b) 
    Represents initial contribution of acquisitions and tower builds until the one-year anniversary of the acquisition or build. 
     Towers site rental revenues for the first   nine   months of   2016   were   $2.1 billion   and   increased   by   $78.0 million  , or   4%  , from   $2.0 billion   during the same period in the prior year.  The increase in towers site rental revenues was impacted by the following items, inclusive of straight-line accounting, in no particular order: tenant additions across our entire portfolio, renewals or extensions of tenant leases, escalations, acquisitions (including the TDC Acquisition in April 2016), and non-renewals of tenant leases predominately arising from our customers' decommissioning of the Acquired Networks.  Tenant additions were influenced by our customers' ongoing efforts to improve network quality and capacity. 
  Small cells site rental revenues for the first   nine   months of   2016   were   $297.8 million   and   increased   by   $104.9 million  , or   54%  , from   $192.9 million   during the same period in the prior year.  The increase in small cells site rental revenue was predominately (1) impacted by the Sunesys Acquisition and (2) due to the leasing of newly constructed small cells.  Demand for small cells was influenced by our customers' growing adoption of small cells as an important component of their network strategy to provide capacity and relieve network congestion.  
  The   increase   in towers site rental gross margins was related to the previously mentioned   4%     increase   in towers site rental revenues and relatively fixed costs to operate our towers. The   increase   in small cells site rental gross margins was predominately related to the previously mentioned   54%     increase   in small cells site rental revenues. 
  Towers network services and other gross margin was   $184.7 million   for the first   nine   months of   2016   and   decreased   by   $31.8 million  , or   15%  , from   $216.5 million   during the same period in the prior year, which is a reflection of (1) the volume of activity from carrier network enhancements and (2) the volume and mix of network services and other work.  Our network services and other offerings are of a variable nature as these revenues are not under long-term contracts.General and administrative expenses for the first   nine   months of   2016   were   $278.9 million   and   increased   by   $55.0 million  , or approximately   25%  , from   $223.9 million   during the same period in the prior year.  General and administrative expenses are inclusive of stock-based compensation charges, which increased $18.7 million from the first   nine   months of 2015 to the first   nine   months of 2016.  The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily related to the growth in our small cell business as a result of activities such as (1) the Sunesys Acquisition and (2) the continued expansion in size of our small cell portfolio. 
  Towers operating profit for the first   nine   months of   2016     increased   by   $41.5 million  , or   3%  , from the same period in the prior year.  Towers operating profit was positively impacted by the growth in our site rental activities, and partially offset by the aforementioned decrease in towers network services and other gross margin.  
  Small cells operating profit for the first   nine   months of   2016     increased   by   $48.2 million  , or   47%  , from the same period in the prior year.  Small cells operating profit was positively impacted by the previously mentioned Sunesys Acquisition and due to the leasing of newly constructed small cells. 
  
    26 

Adjusted EBITDA   increased     $73.5 million  , or   5%  , from the first   nine   months of   2015   to the first   nine   months of   2016  .  Adjusted EBITDA was (1) positively impacted by the growth in our site rental activities in both towers and small cells, including the Sunesys Acquisition as discussed above and (2) negatively impacted by a decrease in our network services and other activities. 
  Depreciation, amortization and accretion was   $834.7 million   for the first   nine   months of   2016   and   increased   by   $68.1 million  , or   9%  , from   $766.6 million   during the same period in the prior year.  This increase predominately resulted from a corresponding increase in our gross property and equipment due to capital expenditures and acquisitions, including the Sunesys Acquisition.  
  Interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs were   $385.7 million   for the first   nine   months of   2016   and   decreased     $13.1 million  , or   3%  , from   $398.8 million   during the first   nine   months of   2015  , predominately as a result of a   $18.7 million   decrease in the amortization of interest rate swaps.  As a result of repaying certain of our debt, in conjunction with our refinancing activities, we incurred losses of   $52.3 million   for the first   nine   months of 2016.  See note   5   to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  For the first   nine   months of   2016   and   2015  , the effective tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate predominately due to our REIT status, including the dividends paid deduction.  See note   7   to our condensed consolidated financial statements and also note 11 to our consolidated financial statements in our   2015   Form 10-K.  
  During the first   nine   months of 2015, we recorded gains on our sale of CCAL, net of tax, of $1.0 billion.  See our 2015 Form 10-K for further discussion surrounding our sale of CCAL, which occurred in May 2015 and was treated as discontinued operations. 
  Net income (loss) attributable to CCIC stockholders was income of   $232.3 million   compared to income of   $1.4 billion   during the first   nine   months of 2015.  The decrease in net income was predominately due to the aforementioned gains recorded on the sale of CCAL during 2015. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  
  Overview  
  General.    Our core business generates revenues under long-term leases (see   "Item 2. MD A General Overview Overview"  ) predominately from the largest U.S. wireless carriers.  Our strategy is to create long-term stockholder value via a combination of (1) growing cash flows generated from our portfolio of wireless infrastructure, (2) returning a meaningful portion of our cash provided by operating activities to our stockholders in the form of dividends, and (3) investing capital efficiently to grow cash flows and long-term dividends per share.   We measure our efforts to create "long-term stockholder value" by the combined payment of dividends to stockholders and growth in our per share results.  
  We have engaged, and expect to continue to engage, in discretionary investments that we believe will maximize long-term stockholder value.  Our historical discretionary investments include (in no particular order): purchasing our common stock, acquiring or constructing wireless infrastructure, acquiring land interests under towers, improving and structurally enhancing our existing wireless infrastructure, and purchasing, repaying, or redeeming our debt. Based on the growth in small cell activity, we expect to increase our capital spending on the construction of small cell networks.  We seek to fund our discretionary investments with both net cash provided by operating activities and cash available from financing capacity, such as the use of our undrawn availability from the 2016 Revolver, debt financings and issuances of equity or equity related securities.    
  We seek to maintain a capital structure that we believe drives long-term stockholder value and optimizes our weighted-average cost of capital.  We target a leverage ratio of approximately four to five times Adjusted EBITDA and interest coverage of approximately three times Adjusted EBITDA, subject to various factors, such as the availability and cost of capital and the potential long-term return on our discretionary investments.  We may choose to increase or decrease our leverage or coverage from these targets for various periods of time.         
  We operate as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes.  We expect to continue to pay minimal cash income taxes as a result of our REIT status and our NOLs. See note   7   to our condensed consolidated financial statements and our   2015   Form 10-K. 
  
    27 

Liquidity Position.    The following is a summary of our capitalization and liquidity position as of   September 30, 2016  .  See   "Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk"   and note   5   to our condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our debt.  

(a) 
    Exclusive of restricted cash. 
              (b) 
    Availability at any point in time is subject to certain restrictions based on the maintenance of financial covenants contained in the 2016 Credit Facility.  See   our     2015   Form 10-K. 
     Over the next 12 months:  
             
    Our liquidity sources may include (1) cash on hand, (2) net cash provided by operating activities, (3) undrawn availability from our 2016 Revolver, and (4) issuances of equity pursuant to our ATM Program.  Our liquidity uses over the next 12 months are expected to include (1) debt service obligations of   $101.4 million   (principal payments), (2) common stock dividend payments expected to be at least $3.80 per share, or an aggregate of at least   $1.3 billion  , subject to future approval by our board of directors (see   "Item 2. MD A Business Fundamentals and Results"  ), and (3) sustaining and discretionary capital expenditures (expected to be equal to or greater than current levels).   During the next 12 months, we expect that our liquidity sources should be sufficient to cover our expected uses. As CCIC is a holding company, our cash flow from operations is generated by our operating subsidiaries. 
                
    We have no scheduled contractual debt maturities other than principal payments on amortizing debt.  See   "Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk"   for a tabular presentation as of   September 30, 2016   of our scheduled contractual debt maturities and a discussion of anticipated repayment dates.  
     Summary Cash Flow Information  

Operating Activities  
  Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations for the first   nine   months of   2016   increased 1% compared to the first   nine   months of   2015  , as net growth in our business was partially offset by changes in working capital.  We expect to grow our net cash provided by operating activities in the future (exclusive of movements in working capital) if we realize expected growth in our core business.  
  
    28 

Investing Activities  
  Capital Expenditures 
  Our capital expenditures are categorized as discretionary or sustaining, as described below. 
             
    Discretionary capital expenditures are made with respect to activities which we believe exhibit sufficient potential to enhance long-term stockholder value.  They consist of improvements to existing wireless infrastructure, construction of new wireless infrastructure, and, to a lesser extent, purchases of land assets under towers as we seek to manage our interests in the land beneath our towers.  Improvements to existing wireless infrastructure to accommodate new leasing typically vary based on, among other factors: (1) the type of wireless infrastructure, (2) the scope, volume, and mix of work performed on the wireless infrastructure, (3) existing capacity prior to installation, or (4) changes in structural engineering regulations and standards.  Our decisions regarding capital expenditures are influenced by the availability and cost of capital and expected returns on alternative uses of cash, such as payments of dividends and investments.  
                
    Sustaining capital expenditures consist of (1) corporate-related capital improvements and (2) maintenance on our wireless infrastructure assets that enable our customers' ongoing quiet enjoyment of the wireless infrastructure.   
     Capital expenditures for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were as follows: 
  
  Discretionary capital expenditures were impacted by the construction of small cell networks and lower amounts of improvements to existing towers.  We expect to invest in discretionary capital expenditures over the next 12 months at levels equal to or greater than current levels, and we expect increases in the construction of small cell networks.   
  Sale of CCAL.    See note   3   to our condensed consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our May 2015 sale of CCAL, our previously 77.6% owned Australian subsidiary, including a discussion of the January 2016 receipt of the installment payment from the Buyer, which was classified within discontinued operations on the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows. 
  
    29 

Acquisitions.    See note   4   to our condensed consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our TDC Acquisition, which closed in April 2016.  See note 13 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our Proposed FiberNet Acquisition. 
  Financing Activities  
  We seek to allocate cash generated by our operations in a manner that will enhance long-term stockholder value, which may include various financing activities such as (in no particular order) paying dividends on our common stock (currently expected to total an aggregate of at least   $1.3 billion   during the next 12 months), purchasing our common stock, or purchasing, repaying, or redeeming our debt.  
  Credit Facility.    In January 2016, we completed a new senior unsecured credit facility, comprised of a $2.5 billion Senior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility maturing in January 2021, a $2.0 billion Senior Unsecured Term Loan A Facility maturing in January 2021, and a previously outstanding $1.0 billion Senior Unsecured 364-Day Revolving Credit Facility maturing in January 2017.  We utilized the proceeds together with cash on hand, to repay all outstanding borrowings under the previously outstanding 2012 Credit Facility.   
  In February 2016, we used a portion of the net proceeds from the 2016 Senior Notes offering to repay in full all outstanding borrowings under the previously outstanding 364-Day Facility. 
  The proceeds of our 2016 Revolver may be used for general corporate purposes, which may include the financing of capital expenditures, acquisitions and purchases of our common stock.  As of   October 28, 2016  , there was   $365 million   outstanding and   $2.1 billion   in undrawn availability under our 2016 Revolver.  See also note   5   to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  Incurrence, Purchases, and Repayments of Debt.  
  In January 2016, we utilized the proceeds from the 2016 Credit Facility, together with cash on hand, to repay all outstanding borrowings under the previously outstanding 2012 Credit Facility.   
  In February 2016, we issued $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes, which consist of (1) $600.0 million aggregated principal amount of 3.40% senior notes with a final maturity date of February 2021 and (2) $900.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.45% senior notes with a final maturity date of February 2026.  We utilized the proceeds, along with cash on hand, to (1) repay in full all outstanding borrowings under the previously outstanding $1.0 billion Senior Unsecured 364-Day Facility and (2) to repay $500.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the 2016 Revolver.  See note   5   to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  In May 2016, we issued (1) $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.40% senior notes that were issued pursuant to the same indenture as the 3.40% senior notes issued in February 2016 with a final maturity date of February 2021 and (2) $750.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.70% senior notes with a final maturity date of June 2026.  We utilized the proceeds (1) to repay in full the Tower Revenue Notes, Series 2010-2 and Series 2010-5 each issued by certain of our subsidiaries and (2) to repay a portion of outstanding borrowings under the 2016 Revolver.  See note   5   to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  In September 2016, we issued $700.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2.25% senior notes with a final maturity date of September 2021.  We utilized the proceeds (1) to repay in full the 2.381% Secured Notes issued by certain of our subsidiaries and (2) to repay a portion of outstanding borrowings under the 2016 Revolver.  
  Common Stock Activity.    As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had   337.6 million   and   333.8 million   common shares outstanding, respectively.  See note   10   to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the common stock dividends.  See below for a discussion of the conversion of Convertible Preferred Stock into common stock during October and November 2016. 
  ATM Program.    In August 2015, we established an ATM stock offering program through which we may, from time to time, issue and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate cumulative gross sales price of up to $500.0 million to or through sales agents.  Sales, if any, under the ATM Program may be made by means of ordinary brokers' transactions on the New York Stock Exchange or otherwise at market prices prevailing at the time of sale, at prices related to prevailing market prices or, subject to our specific instructions, at negotiated prices.  We intend to use the net proceeds from any sales under the ATM Program for general corporate purposes, which may include the funding of future acquisitions or investments and the repayment or repurchase of any outstanding indebtedness.  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  ,   3.8 million   shares of common stock were sold under the ATM Program generating net proceeds of   $323.8 million  .  See note   10   to our condensed consolidated financial  
  
    30 

statements.  The net proceeds from the sales under the ATM Program were used, in part, to fund the TDC Acquisition.  See note 4 to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  Convertible Preferred Stock Activity  .  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had approximately 9.8 million shares of preferred stock outstanding.  During October and November 2016, our approximately 9.8 million shares of Convertible Preferred Stock converted to approximately 11.6 million shares of our common stock at a conversion rate (based on the applicable market value of the common stock and subject to certain anti-dilutive adjustments) of 1.188 common shares for each share previously outstanding of Convertible Preferred Stock.  See note   10   and 13 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the Convertible Preferred Stock dividends declared and paid during 2016 and the October and November 2016 conversion of the Convertible Preferred Stock to common stock. 
  Debt Covenants  
  The credit agreement governing the 2016 Credit Facility contains financial maintenance covenants.  We are currently in compliance with these financial maintenance covenants, and based upon our current expectations, we believe we will continue to comply with our financial maintenance covenants.  In addition, certain of our debt agreements also contain restrictive covenants that place restrictions on us and may limit our ability to, among other things, incur additional debt and liens, purchase our securities, make capital expenditures, dispose of assets, undertake transactions with affiliates, make other investments, pay dividends or distribute excess cash flow.  See our   2015   Form 10-K for a further discussion of our debt covenants, certain restrictive covenants and factors that are likely to determine our subsidiaries' ability to comply with current and future debt covenants.   

Accounting and Reporting Matters  
  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  
  Our critical accounting policies and estimates are those that we believe (1) are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations or (2) require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.  The critical accounting policies and estimates for   2016   are not intended to be a comprehensive list of our accounting policies and estimates.  In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP, with no need for management's judgment.  In other cases, management is required to exercise judgment in the application of accounting principles with respect to particular transactions.  Our critical accounting policies and estimates as of   December 31, 2015   are described in   "Item 7. MD A Accounting and Reporting Matters"   and in note 2 of our consolidated financial statements in our   2015   Form 10-K.  The critical accounting policies and estimates for the first   three   months of   2016   have not changed from the critical accounting policies for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .

  Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted.    See note   2   to our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  Non-GAAP and Segment Financial Measures  
  In addition to the non-GAAP measures used herein and as discussed in note   11   to our condensed consolidated financial statements, we also provide (1) segment site rental gross margin, (2) segment network services and other gross margin, and (3) segment operating profit, which are key measures used by management to evaluate our operating segments for purposes of making decisions about allocating capital and assessing performance.  These segment measures are provided pursuant to GAAP requirements related to segment reporting.  
  We define segment site rental gross margin as segment site rental revenues less segment site rental cost of operations, which excludes stock-based compensation expense and prepaid lease purchase price adjustments recorded in consolidated cost of operations.  We define segment network services and other gross margin as segment network services and other revenues less segment network services and other cost of operations, which excludes stock-based compensation expense recorded in consolidated cost of operations.  We define segment operating profit as segment site rental gross margin plus segment network services and other gross margin, less general and administrative expenses attributable to the respective segment.    
  In addition, we use earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and accretion, as adjusted ("Adjusted EBITDA"), which is a non-GAAP measure, as an indicator of consolidated financial performance. Our measure of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, including companies in the wireless infrastructure  
  
    31 

sector or other REITs, and is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP.  Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for operating income or loss, net income or loss, net cash provided by (used for) operating, investing and financing activities or other income statement or cash flow statement data prepared in accordance with GAAP and should be considered only as a supplement to net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance.  There are material limitations to using a measure such as Adjusted EBITDA, including the difficulty associated with comparing results among more than one company, including our competitors, and the inability to analyze certain significant items, including depreciation and interest expense, that directly affect our net income or loss.  Management compensates for these limitations by considering the economic effect of the excluded expense items independently as well as in connection with their analysis of net income (loss). 
  We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus restructuring charges (credits), asset write-down charges, acquisition and integration costs, depreciation, amortization and accretion, amortization of prepaid lease purchase price adjustments, interest expense and amortization of deferred financing costs, gains (losses) on retirement of long-term obligations, net gain (loss) on interest rate swaps, gains (losses) on foreign currency swaps, impairment of available-for-sale securities, interest income, other income (expense), benefit (provision) for income taxes, cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle, income (loss) from discontinued operations and stock-based compensation expense. The reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to our net income (loss) is set forth below and excludes items in the Company's Adjusted EBITDA definition which are not applicable to the periods shown.  

32 

We believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful to an investor or other interested parties in evaluating our financial performance because:  
             
    it is the primary measure used by our management to evaluate the (1) economic productivity of our operations and (2) for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources to, and assessing the performance of our operations; 
                
    although specific definitions may vary, it is widely used by investors or other interested parties in evaluation of  the wireless infrastructure sector and other REITs to measure financial performance without regard to items such as depreciation, amortization and accretion which can vary depending upon accounting methods and the book value of assets; 
                
    we believe it helps investors and other interested parties meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our operations (1) from period to period and (2) to our competitors by excluding the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest charges from our outstanding debt) and asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization and accretion) from our financial results; and 
                
    it is similar to the measure of current financial performance generally used in our debt covenant calculations. 
     Our management uses Adjusted EBITDA:  
             
    as a performance goal in employee annual incentive compensation; 
                
    as a measurement of financial performance because it assists us in comparing our financial performance on a consistent basis as it removes the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest charges from our outstanding debt) and asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization and accretion) from our operating results; 
                
    in presentations to our board of directors to enable it to have the same measurement of financial performance used by management; 
                
    for planning purposes, including preparation of our annual operating budget; 
                
    as a valuation measure in strategic analyses in connection with the purchase and sale of assets; 
                
    in determining self-imposed limits on our debt levels, including the evaluation of our leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio; and  
                
    with respect to compliance with our debt covenants, which require us to maintain certain financial ratios including, or similar to, Adjusted EBITDA.

ITEM 3. 
    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
     The following section updates   "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk"   in our   2015   Form 10-K and should be read in conjunction with that report as well as our condensed consolidated financial statements included in Part 1, Item 1 of this report.    
  Interest Rate Risk  
  Our interest rate risk relates primarily to the impact of interest rate movements on the following:  
               
    potential future borrowings of incremental debt, including borrowings on our 2016 Credit Facility. 
     Over the next 12 months, we have no debt maturities other than principal payments on amortizing debt. We currently have no interest rate swaps.  
  Sensitivity Analysis 
  We manage our exposure to market interest rates on our existing debt by controlling the mix of fixed and floating rate debt.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $2.4 billion   of floating rate debt.  As a result, a hypothetical unfavorable fluctuation in market interest rates on our existing debt of 1/8 of a percent point over a 12 month period would increase our interest expense by approximately   $3 million  . 
  Tabular Information 
  The following table provides information about our market risk related to changes in interest rates.  The future principal payments and weighted-average interest rates are presented as of   September 30, 2016  .  These debt maturities reflect contractual maturity dates and do not consider the impact of the principal payments that commence if the applicable debt is not repaid or refinanced on or prior to the anticipated repayment dates on the Tower Revenue Notes (see footnote (c)). The information presented below regarding the variable rate debt is supplementary to our sensitivity analysis regarding the impact of changes in the interest rates. See notes   5   and   6   to our condensed consolidated financial statements and our   2015   Form 10-K for additional information regarding our debt.  

(a) 
    The fair value of our debt is based on indicative quotes (that is, non-binding quotes) from brokers that require judgment to interpret market information, including implied credit spreads for similar borrowings on recent trades or bid/ask offers.  These fair values are not necessarily indicative of the amount which could be realized in a current market exchange. 
              (b) 
    The average interest rate represents the weighted-average stated coupon rate (see footnotes (c) and (d)). 
              (c) 
    The impact of principal payments that will   commence following   the anticipated repayment dates is not considered.   The January 2010 Tower Revenue Notes have a principal amount of $1.3 billion, having an anticipated repayment date in January 2020. The August 2010 Tower Revenue Notes have a principal amount of $1.0 billion, having an anticipated repayment date in August 2020.    The May 2015 Tower Revenue Notes consist of two series of notes with principal amounts of $300.0 million and $700.0 million, having anticipated repayment dates of May 2022 and May 2025, respectively.  
              (d) 
    If the Tower Revenue Notes are not repaid in full by the applicable anticipated repayment dates, the applicable interest rate increases by approximately 5% per annum and monthly principal payments commence using the Excess Cash Flow of the issuers of the Tower Revenue Notes.  The Tower Revenue Notes are presented based on their contractual maturity dates ranging from 2040 to 2045 and include the impact of an assumed 5% increase in interest rate that would occur following the anticipated repayment dates but exclude the impact of monthly principal payments that would commence using Excess Cash Flow of the issuers of the Tower Revenue Notes.  The full year   2015   Excess Cash Flow of the issuers of the Tower Revenue Notes was approximately $  495.4 million  .    We currently expect to refinance these notes on or prior to the respective anticipated repayment dates.  
              (e) 
    Predominantly consists of $2.0 billion 2016 Term Loan A maturing in 2021.  See note   5   to our condensed consolidated financial statements.

ITEM 4. 
    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
