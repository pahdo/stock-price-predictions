STATEMENTS 

NOTE 1 - NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION 

(A) Nature of Operations 

Ridgefield Acquisition Corp. (the  Company ) was incorporated
under the laws of the State of Colorado on October 13, 1983. Effective June 23, 2006, the Company was reincorporated under the
laws of the State of Nevada through the merger of the Company with a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Since July 2000, the
Company has suspended all operations, except for necessary administrative matters. 

The Company has no principal operations or revenue producing activities.
The Company is now pursuing an acquisition strategy whereby it is seeking to arrange for a merger, acquisition or other business
combination with a viable operating entity. 

Effective March 1, 2015, the Company relocated
its principal offices to 31248 Oak Crest Drive, Suite 110, Westlake Village, California 91361. The registrant's telephone number
is (805) 623-4184. The Company occupies a portion of the offices occupied by BKF Capital Group, Inc. on a month to month basis
for a monthly fee of $50 per month paid to BKF Capital Group, Inc. Steven N. Bronson, the Company's Chairman, CEO and controlling
shareholder, is also the Chairman, CEO and controlling shareholder of BKF Capital Group, Inc. 

(B) Basis of Presentation 

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial
statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and the
rules and regulations of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission for interim financial information. 

The financial information as of September 30, 2016 is derived from
the audited consolidated financial statements presented in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the years ended December
31, 2015 and 2014. The unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company's
Annual Report on Form 10-K, which contains the audited financial statements and notes thereto, together with the Plan of Operations
for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

Certain information or footnote disclosures normally included in
financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have
been omitted, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission for interim financial reporting.
Accordingly, they do not include all the information and footnotes necessary for a comprehensive presentation of financial position,
results of operations, or cash flows. It is management's opinion, however, that all material adjustments (consisting of normal
recurring adjustments) have been made which are necessary for a fair financial statement presentation. The interim results for
the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of results for the full fiscal year. 

GOING CONCERN 

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial
statements have been prepared on the basis of accounting principles applicable to a going concern which contemplates the realization
of assets and extinguishment of liabilities in the normal course of business. As shown in the accompanying condensed interim financial
statements, the Company has an accumulated deficit of approximately $1.63 million through  September 30, 2016. As of September
30, 2016, the Company has no principal operations or significant revenue producing activities, which raises substantial doubt about
its ability to continue as a going concern. The Company's unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements do not
include any adjustments related to the carrying value of assets or the amount and classification of liabilities that might be necessary
should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern. The Company's ability to establish itself as a going concern is dependent
on its ability to merge with another entity. The outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time. 

RIDGEFIELD ACQUISITION CORP. AND SUBSIDIARY 

 NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS 

The Company had cash on hand in the amount of $513 and $768 as of
September 30, 2016 and as of December 31, 2015, respectively. The Company has no cash equivalents as of September 30, 2016 and
as of December 31, 2015. 

INCOME PER COMMON SHARE 

Basic income (loss) per common share is calculated by dividing net
income (loss) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Diluted income per common share is calculated
by adjusting outstanding shares, assuming conversion of all potentially dilutive equity instruments. There is no difference in
the calculation of basic and diluted income per share for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

USE OF ESTIMATES 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

DUE TO RELATED PARTY 

Commencing in the year ended December 31, 2013, the Company's president
and principal executive officer has loaned the Company money to fund working capital needs to pay operating expenses. The loans
are repayable upon demand and accrue interest at the rate of 10% per annum. As of September 30, 2016, the aggregate principal loan
balance amounted to $89,450 and such loans have accrued interest of $15,859 through September 30, 2016. 

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS 

In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15 ( ASU 2014-15 ),
Presentation of Financial Statements-Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40) - Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to
Continue as a Going Concern. ASU 2014-15 requires a Company's management to evaluate, at each reporting period, whether there are
conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year after
the date the financial statements are issued and provide related disclosures. ASU 2014-15 is effective for the annual period ending
after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. The Company is currently evaluating the impact
of the adoption of ASU 2014-15 on its consolidated financial statements. 

Item 2. 
       Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  

Forward Looking Statements Disclosure  

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains
certain statements that are not historical facts, including, most importantly, information concerning possible or assumed future
results of operations of Ridgefield Acquisition Corp. (the  Company ) and statements preceded by, followed by or that
include the words  may,   believes,   expects,   anticipates,  or the negation thereof,
or similar expressions, which constitute  forward-looking statements  within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities
Act of 1933 (the  Reform Act ) and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act ).
For those statements, the Company claims the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Reform
Act. These forward-looking statements are based on the Company's current expectations and are susceptible to a number of risks,
uncertainties and other factors, including the risks specifically enumerated in Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2015, and the Company's actual results, performance and achievements may differ materially from any future results,
performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. The Company will not undertake and specifically
declines any obligation to publicly release the result of any revisions, which may be made to any forward-looking statements to
reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated
events. In addition, it is the Company's policy generally not to make any specific projections as to future earnings, and the Company
does not endorse any projections regarding future performance that may be made by third parties. 

The following discussion and analysis provides
information which the Company's management believes to be relevant to an assessment and understanding of the Company's results
of operations and financial condition. This discussion should be read together with the Company's financial statements and the
notes to financial statements, which are included in this report, as well as the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2015. 

Acquisition Strategy  

The Company's plan of operation is to arrange
for a merger, acquisition, business combination or other arrangement by and between the Company and a viable operating entity.
The Company has not identified a viable operating entity for a merger, acquisition, business combination or other arrangement,
and there can be no assurance that the Company will ever successfully arrange for a merger, acquisition, business combination or
other arrangement by and between the Company and a viable operating entity. 

The Company anticipates that the selection of
a business opportunity will be a complex process and will involve a number of risks, because potentially available business opportunities
may occur in many different industries and may be in various stages of development. Due in part to depressed economic conditions
in a number of geographic areas, rapid technological advances being made in some industries and shortages of available capital,
management believes that there are numerous firms seeking either the limited additional capital which the Company will have or
the benefits of a publicly traded corporation, or both. The perceived benefits of a publicly traded corporation may include facilitating
or improving the terms upon which additional equity financing may be sought, providing liquidity for principal shareholders, creating
a means for providing incentive stock options or similar benefits to key employees, providing liquidity for all shareholders and
other factors. 

In some cases, management of the Company will
have the authority to effect acquisitions without submitting the proposal to the shareholders for their consideration. In some
instances, however, the proposed participation in a business opportunity may be submitted to the shareholders for their consideration,
either voluntarily by the Board of Directors to seek the shareholders' advice and consent, or because of a requirement of state
law to do so. 

In seeking to arrange a merger, acquisition,
business combination or other arrangement by and between the Company and a viable operating entity, management's objective will
be to obtain long-term capital appreciation for the Company's shareholders. There can be no assurance that the Company will be
able to complete any merger, acquisition, business combination or other arrangement by and between the Company and a viable operating
entity. 

The Company may need additional funds in order
to effectuate a merger, acquisition or other arrangement by and between the Company and a viable operating entity, although there
is no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain such additional funds, if needed. Even if the Company is able to obtain
additional funds there is no assurance that the Company will be able to effectuate a merger, acquisition or other arrangement by
and between the Company and a viable operating entity. 

Results of Operations  

For the three months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015, the Company incurred General and administrative expenses of $3,006 and $7,362, resulting in a net loss equal to $5,254
and $9,185 respectively. General and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 consisted of costs associated
with maintaining the Company's status as a public company including (without limitation) filing reports with the Securities and
Exchange Commission. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the Company incurred interest expense of $2,248. 

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015, the Company incurred General and administrative expenses of $10,655 and $17,243, resulting in a net loss equal to $16,842
and $21,712 respectively. General and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 consisted of costs associated
with maintaining the Company's status as a public company including (without limitation) filing reports with the Securities and
Exchange Commission. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 , the Company incurred interest expense of $6,187. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

During the three months ended September 30,
2016, the Company satisfied its working capital needs from cash on hand and loans from the Company s Chairman and President.
As of September 30, 2016, the Company had cash on hand in the amount of $513. 

The Company's long term financial condition
will be subject to its ability to arrange for a merger, acquisition or a business combination with an operating business on favorable
terms that will result in profitability. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to do so or, if it is able to
do so, that the transaction will be on favorable terms not resulting in an unreasonable amount of dilution to the Company's existing
shareholders. 

The Company may need additional funds in order
to effectuate a merger, acquisition or other arrangement by and between the Company and a viable operating entity, although there
is no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain such additional funds, if needed. Even if the Company is able to obtain
additional funds there is no assurance that the Company will be able to effectuate a merger, acquisition or other arrangement by
and between the Company and a viable operating entity. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 

We maintain  disclosure controls and procedures, 
as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, that are designed to ensure that information required to be
disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our principal
executive officer to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Evaluation of disclosure and controls and procedures. 

As of the end of the period covered by this
report, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our Principal Executive Officer,
of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's Disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e)
and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act). Based on the evaluation, the Company's Principal Executive Officer has concluded that the
Company's disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed
by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms and that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are operating
in an effective manner to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports
that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified
in the SEC's rules and forms. 

Changes in internal controls over financial reporting. 

There have been no changes in the Company's
internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during
Company's most recent quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal
control over financial reporting. 

It should be noted that any system of controls,
however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system
are met. In addition, the design of any control system is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future
events. Because of these and other inherent limitations of control systems, there is only reasonable assurance that the Company's
controls will succeed in achieving their stated goals under all potential future conditions.

 Regarding Facts and Circumstances Relating
to Exchange Act Filings 

I, Steven N. Bronson, certify that: 

1.    I have reviewed this Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 of Ridgefield Acquisition Corp.; 

2.   Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the
circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report; 

3.   Based on my knowledge, the financial statements,
and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results
of operations and cash flows of the small business issuer as of, and for, the periods presented in this report; 

4.   I am responsible for establishing and maintaining
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial
reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the small business issuer and have: 

a.   Designed such disclosure
controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that
material information relating to the small business issuer, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others
within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared; 

b.   Designed such internal control
over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; 

c.   Evaluated the effectiveness
of the small business issuer's disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness
of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and 

d.   Disclosed in this report
any change in the small business issuer's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the small business issuer's
most recent fiscal quarter (the small business issuer's fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the small business issuer's internal control over financial reporting;
and 

5.   I have disclosed, based on my most recent evaluation
of internal control over financial reporting, to the small business issuer's auditors and the audit committee of the small business
issuer's board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions): 

a.   All significant deficiencies
and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to
adversely affect the small business issuer's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and 

b.   Any fraud, whether or not
material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the small business issuer's internal control
over financial reporting.
