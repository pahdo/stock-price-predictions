EXPLANATORY NOTE 
  The Company is restating its interim unaudited consolidated financial statements for the quarter ended June 30, 2015. See the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on October 19, 2016 for additional details. 
  When the Company disposes of real estate assets, if the real estate assets constitute a business, a portion of the Company s goodwill should be allocated to the carrying value of the business disposed of to determine the gain/loss on disposal. Further, when the Company classifies real estate assets that constitute a business as held for sale, the carrying amount used to determine an impairment loss, if any, should include an allocation of goodwill, in accordance with ASC 350  Intangibles - Goodwill and Other." Historically, the Company did not allocate goodwill resulting from the Cole II Merger to real estate assets disposed of or consider the amount of goodwill attributable to real estate assets held for sale in assessing impairment in the Company s consolidated financial statements as of and for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015. 
  As explained in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included within this Form 10-Q/A (as defined below), the restatement is a correction of an error in the application of the accounting treatment under ASC 350. For each real estate asset that constitutes a business that was disposed of or classified as held for sale, the restatement reflects an allocation of goodwill that has been derived based upon the proportionate fair value of the real estate asset to the fair value of the Company s reporting unit (i.e. the Company's equity). 
  The allocation of goodwill to real estate assets disposed of resulted in a decrease in gain on disposition of assets of $  11.5 million    and   $13.7 million   for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, respectively, and a decrease of $  19.5 million   to goodwill as of June 30, 2015. The allocation of goodwill to real estate assets held for sale resulted in an increase of $  0.01 million   and   $0.6 million   to impairments for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, respectively, and a decrease of $  1.2 million   to real estate assets held for sale, net as of June 30, 2015. Additionally, the correction of these errors resulted in an increase of   $20.7 million   to accumulated deficit as of June 30, 2015. 
  This Amendment No. 1 on Form 10-Q/A ( Form 10-Q/A ) to our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2015, initially filed with the SEC on August 7, 2015 (the  Original Filing ), is being filed to reflect the restatement of (i) the Company s consolidated balance sheet at June 30, 2015, (ii) the Company s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 and (iii) the Company's consolidated statements of stockholders  equity and cash flows for the six months ended June 30, 2015, and the notes related thereto. Additionally, although the effects were determined to be immaterial, the Company s consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2014, the Company s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 and the Company's consolidated statement of cash flows for the six months ended June 30, 2014  included in this Form 10-Q/A are being restated to reflect the correction of these errors. For the convenience of the reader, this Form 10-Q/A sets forth the Original Filing in its entirety and only amends and restates Items 1, 2, and 4 of Part I of the Original Filing to reflect the adjustments described above and in Note 2, and the related impact on disclosures. No other information in the Original Filing is amended. For a more detailed description of these matters, see Note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-Q/A. 
  Notably, these adjustments did not negatively impact the following metrics of the Company: 
             
    Revenues; 
                
    Cash position or its total cash flows from operating, investing or financing activities; 
                
    Liquidity; 
                
    Funds from operations ( FFO  
                
    Adjusted funds from operations ( AFFO  
                
    Reported capitalization rates on the sale of assets; and 
                
    Any metric utilized in the determination of executive compensation. 
     Additionally, the Company remains in compliance with all of its debt agreements and financial covenants.   
  Pursuant to the rules of the SEC, Item 6 of Part II of the Original Filing has been amended to contain the currently-dated certifications from our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as required by Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The certifications of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are attached to this Form 10-Q/A as Exhibits 31.1, 31.2 and 32.1, respectively.

  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
  June 30, 2015 
  (Unaudited) 

Note 1. Organization  
  Company Organization and Operations 
  The Company operates as a self-administered and self-managed REIT that seeks to generate and deliver sustainable and attractive returns for stockholders by investing primarily in and managing a portfolio of single-tenant, operationally essential real estate throughout the United States that is generally leased on a long-term, triple-net basis to tenants operating within predominantly retail, but also office and industrial property types. Single tenant, operationally essential real estate generally refers to free-standing, commercial real estate facilities where tenants conduct activities that are essential to the generation of their sales and profits. 
  The Company s operations are generally carried out through the Operating Partnership. OP Holdings, one of the Corporation's wholly-owned subsidiaries, is the sole general partner and owns   1.0%   of the Operating Partnership. The Corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary are the only limited partners and together own the remaining   99.0%   of the Operating Partnership. 
    
  As of   June 30, 2015  , our undepreciated investment in real estate and loans totaled approximately   $8.21 billion  , representing investments in   2,600   properties, including properties securing mortgage loans made by the Company. Of this amount,   98.7%   consisted of our   $8.10 billion   investment in real estate, representing ownership of   2,455   properties, and the remaining   1.3%   consisted of   $109.4 million   in commercial mortgage and other loans receivable, primarily secured by the remaining   145   properties or other related assets.  

Note 2. Restatement 
  The restatement of the Company's consolidated financial statements results from the Company's subsequent accounting for goodwill resulting from the Cole II Merger. Previously, the Company did not allocate goodwill to the disposal of real estate assets or held for sale real estate assets that met the definition of a business under GAAP, as required by ASC 350  Intangibles - Goodwill and Other  in order to determine gain on disposition of assets or impairments, if any, respectively.  
  For the disposal of real estate assets that constituted a business, goodwill and gain on disposition of assets both should have been reduced by the proportionate amount of goodwill allocated to each disposed of real estate asset. The amount of goodwill allocated is derived as the proportionate fair value of the real estate considered to be a business under GAAP at the time of sale to the fair value of the Company s reporting unit.  As a result, the restated consolidated balance sheet includes a reduction to goodwill of $  19.5 million   at June 30, 2015 and the restated consolidated statement of operations includes a reduction to gain on disposition of assets of $  11.5 million   and   $13.7 million   for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, respectively. The restated consolidated balance sheet includes a reduction to goodwill of $  5.6 million   at December 31, 2014. There was   no   reduction and a   $0.2 million   reduction to (loss) gain on disposition of assets for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014, respectively. 
  Further, in evaluating the impairment on held for sale real estate assets considered to be a business under GAAP, the proportionate amount of goodwill attributable to the real estate asset held for sale should be considered in determining the amount of impairment, if any. The amount of goodwill attributed is derived as the proportionate fair value of the real estate asset considered to be a business under GAAP held for sale at measurement date to the fair value of the Company s reporting unit. As a result, the restated consolidated balance sheet includes a reduction to real estate assets held for sale, net of $  1.2 million   at June 30, 2015 and the restated consolidated statement of operations includes an increase to impairments of $  0.01 million   and   $0.6 million   for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, respectively. The restated consolidated balance sheet includes a reduction to real estate assets held for sale, net of $  0.9 million   at December 31, 2014 and the restated consolidated statement of operations includes an increase to impairments of $  0.5 million   and   $0.7 million   for the three and six month ended June 30, 2014, respectively.

    SPIRIT REALTY CAPITAL, INC. 
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - (continued) 
  June 30, 2015 
  (Unaudited) 

The Company has historically presented share repurchases as treasury stock (thereby reducing stockholders  equity) in the consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of stockholders  equity. However, the Company is incorporated in Maryland and under Maryland law, there is no concept of treasury stock. Therefore, shares repurchased should be considered retired and constitute authorized but unissued shares rather than treasury stock as previously presented. As a result, during the six months ended June 31, 2015, the Company has corrected the classification error and the amount previously reported as treasury stock of   $4.9 million   at December 31, 2014 is presented as a reduction to common stock and an increase in accumulated deficit in the restated consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statement of stockholders' equity. In addition, the number of shares previously disclosed as issued have been reduced by the number of shares repurchased of   473,599   December 31, 2014. This change does not affect previously disclosed shares outstanding, total stockholders  equity or earnings per share computations. 
  The consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-Q/A have been restated as of June 30, 2015 and for the three and six months then ended to reflect the adjustments described above. The consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-Q/A have been restated as of December 31, 2014 and for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014 to reflect the adjustments described above. The following statements present the effect of the restatement on (i) the Company's consolidated balance sheets at June 30, 2015 and December 31, 2014, (ii) the Company's consolidated statements of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 and (iii) the Company's consolidated statements of cash flows for the six months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014. The Company did not present a summary of the effect of the restatement on the consolidated statement of stockholders' equity for any of the above referenced periods because the impact to stockholders' equity is reflected below in the restated consolidated balance sheets. The Company did not present a summary of the effect of the restatement on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) for any of the above referenced periods because the impact to net income (loss) is reflected below in the restated consolidated statements of operations and the restatement adjustments did not affect any other component of comprehensive income (loss).

Note 3. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  
  Basis of Accounting and Principles of Consolidation 
  The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC. In the opinion of management, the unaudited consolidated financial statements include the normal, recurring adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the information required to be set forth therein. The results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results for the entire year. Certain information and note disclosures, normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP, have been condensed or omitted from these statements pursuant to SEC rules and regulations and, accordingly, these financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s audited consolidated financial statements as filed with the SEC in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2014  .  
  The unaudited consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 
  The Company has formed numerous special purpose entities to acquire and hold real estate encumbered by indebtedness (see Note 5). As a result, the majority of the Company s consolidated assets are held in these wholly-owned special purpose entities. Each special purpose entity is a separate legal entity and is the sole owner of its assets and responsible for its liabilities. The assets of these special purpose entities are not available to pay, or otherwise satisfy obligations to, the creditors of any affiliate or owner of another entity unless the special purpose entities have expressly agreed and are permitted under their governing documents.  At   June 30, 2015   and   December 31, 2014  , net assets totaling   $4.88 billion   and   $5.68 billion  , respectively, were held, and net liabilities totaling   $3.42 billion   and   $3.77 billion  , respectively, were owed by these special purpose entities and are included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.  
  Use of Estimates 
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Although management believes its estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ from those estimates. 
  Reclassifications 
  Certain reclassifications have been made to prior period balances to conform to the current period presentation. During the quarter ended March 31, 2015, the Company elected to early adopt ASU 2015-03 described below. Under the ASU, capitalized deferred financing costs, previously recorded in deferred costs and other assets on the consolidated balance sheet, are presented as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the debt liability to which these costs relate, and this presentation is retrospectively applied to prior periods. For capitalized deferred financing costs that have been incurred relating to the 2013 Credit Facility and 2015 Credit Facility, the Company continues to present these costs in deferred costs and other assets, net on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as amounts can be drawn and repaid periodically. As of December 31, 2014, unamortized deferred financing costs of approximately   $46.3 million   were previously presented in deferred costs and other assets, net on the consolidated balance sheet and are now included as a reduction of debt (see Note 5). 
  Segment Reporting 
  The Company views its operations as   one   segment, which consists of net leasing operations. The Company has no other reportable segments. 
  Allowance for Doubtful Accounts 
    
  The Company provided for reserves for uncollectible amounts related to its rent and other tenant receivables totaling   $8.1 million   and   $8.4 million   at   June 30, 2015   and   December 31, 2014  , respectively, against accounts receivable balances of   $25.1 million   and   $20.5 million  , respectively; receivables are recorded within deferred costs and other assets, net in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.  
  
   21 

SPIRIT REALTY CAPITAL, INC. 
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - (continued) 
  June 30, 2015 
  (Unaudited) 

The Company established a provision for losses of   $9.4 million   and   $10.9 million   at   June 30, 2015   and   December 31, 2014  , respectively, against deferred rental revenue receivables of   $56.3 million   and   $48.3 million  , respectively; deferred rental revenue receivables are recorded within deferred costs and other assets, net in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.  
  Restricted Cash and Escrow Deposits 
    
  Restricted cash and deposits in escrow, classified within deferred costs and other assets, net in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets consisted of the following (in thousands): 

(1)      Funds held in reserve by lenders which can be applied by lenders to the repayment of debt (any funds remaining on deposit after the debt is paid in full are released to the borrower).  
   (2)      Deposits held on collateral properties by lenders that are reserved to fund tenant improvements, repairs and leasing commissions incurred to secure a new tenant.  
   (3)     Proceeds from the sale of assets pledged as collateral under the Spirit Master Funding Program, which are held on deposit until a qualifying substitution is made or the funds are applied as prepayment of principal.  
   (4)     Funds held in lender controlled accounts generally used to meet future debt service or certain property operating expenses. 
   (5)      Funds held in lender controlled accounts released after debt service requirements are met.  
    
  A significant amount of the lender reserves were established in connection with obtaining lender consents relating to our IPO during 2012 and the Cole II Merger during 2013. 
  Income Taxes 
  The Company has elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Code. As a REIT, the Company generally will not be subject to federal income tax provided it continues to satisfy certain tests concerning the Company s sources of income, the nature of its assets, the amounts distributed to its stockholders, and the ownership of Company stock. Management believes the Company has qualified and will continue to qualify as a REIT and therefore,   no   provision has been made for federal income taxes in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Even if the Company qualifies for taxation as a REIT, it may be subject to state and local income and franchise taxes, and to federal income tax and excise tax on its undistributed income.  
  Franchise taxes are included in general and administrative expenses on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Taxable income from non-REIT activities managed through the Company s taxable REIT subsidiary is subject to federal, state, and local taxes, which are not material. 
  New Accounting Pronouncements 
  From time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the FASB or the SEC that are adopted by the Company as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, these new accounting pronouncements entail technical corrections to existing guidance or affect guidance related to specialized industries or entities and therefore will have minimal, if any, impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations upon adoption. 
    
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03,   Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  , which requires that deferred financing costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction  
  
   22

from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts or premiums. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company early adopted the provisions of ASU 2015-03 beginning with the period ended March 31, 2015, and has applied the provisions retrospectively. 

Note 4. Investments 
  Real Estate Investments 
    
  As of   June 30, 2015  , the Company's investment in real estate and loans totaled approximately   $8.21 billion  , representing investments in   2,600   properties, including   145   properties securing mortgage loans. The investment is comprised of land, buildings, lease intangible assets and lease intangible liabilities, as adjusted for any impairment, and the carrying amount of loans receivable, real estate assets held under direct financing leases and real estate assets held for sale. The portfolio is geographically dispersed throughout   49   states with only   one   state, Texas, with a real estate investment of   12.0%  , accounting for more than   10.0%   of the total dollar amount of the Company s real estate investment portfolio. 
    
  The properties that the Company owns are leased to tenants under long-term operating leases that typically include one or more renewal options. The leases are generally triple-net, which provides that the lessee is responsible for the payment of all property operating expenses, including property taxes, maintenance and repairs, and insurance costs. Therefore, the Company is generally not responsible for repairs or other capital expenditures related to its properties, unless the property is not subject to a triple net lease agreement.  
    
  During the   six months ended     June 30, 2015  , the Company had the following real estate and loan activity, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization, as restated: 

(1)    Includes investments of   $2.6 million   in revenue producing capitalized expenditures, as well as   $0.6 million   of non-revenue producing capitalized maintenance expenditures. Capitalized maintenance expenditures are not included in the Company's investment in real estate disclosed elsewhere.  
   (2)    The total accumulated depreciation and amortization associated with these dispositions of real estate was   $73.7 million  .  
   (3)     During the   six months ended     June 30, 2015  , pursuant to 1031 Exchanges, the Company sold   23   properties for   $212.1 million   and used   $172.1 million   of this amount to partially fund   62   property acquisitions.  
   (4)    At   June 30, 2015   and   December 31, 2014  ,   33   and   37  , respectively, of the Company's properties were vacant and in the Company s possession; of these amounts,   11   and   8  , respectively, were held for sale.

Scheduled minimum future contractual rent to be received under the remaining non-cancelable term of the operating leases at   June 30, 2015   (in thousands):  

Because lease renewal periods are exercisable at the option of the lessee, the preceding table presents future minimum lease payments due during the initial lease term only. In addition, the future minimum rentals do not include any contingent rentals based on a percentage of the lessees' gross sales or lease escalations based on future changes in the CPI or other stipulated reference rate. 
  Certain of the Company s leases contain tenant purchase options. Most of these options are at or above fair market value at the time the option is exercisable, and none of these purchase options represent bargain purchase options. 
  Loans Receivable 
  The following table details loans receivable, net of premium (in thousands):    

  The mortgage loans are secured by single-tenant commercial properties and generally have fixed interest rates over the term of the loans. There are   two   other notes receivable, one   $4.0 million   note is secured by tenant assets and stock and the other is unsecured. 
  Allowance for Loan Losses 
  At   June 30, 2015   and   December 31, 2014  , there was   no   allowance for loan losses, and there were   no   mortgages or notes on nonaccrual status.

  The following table details lease intangible assets and liabilities, net of accumulated amortization (in thousands): 

The amounts amortized as a net increase to rental revenue for capitalized above- and below-market leases were   $2.8 million   and   $3.0 million   for the   six months ended     June 30, 2015   and   2014  , respectively, and   $1.4 million   and   $1.7 million   for the three months ended   June 30, 2015   and   2014  , respectively. The value of in-place leases amortized and included in depreciation and amortization expense was   $25.4 million   and   $26.9 million     for the   six months ended     June 30, 2015   and   2014  , respectively, and   $12.6 million   and   $13.5 million   for the three months ended   June 30, 2015   and   2014  , respectively.

Note 5. Debt 
  The Company's debt is summarized below: 

(1)    The effective interest rates include amortization of debt discount, amortization of deferred financing costs and non-utilization fees, where applicable, calculated for the three months ended   June 30, 2015   and based on the average principal balance outstanding during the period. The average outstanding principal balance of the Revolving Credit Facilities was not significant during the three months ended   June 30, 2015  , resulting in an effective interest rate that was not meaningful. 
   (2)    Represents the weighted average stated interest rate based on the outstanding principal balance as of   June 30, 2015  . 
   (3)    Represents the weighted average time to maturity based on the outstanding principal balance as of   June 30, 2015  . 
   (4)    Variable-rate notes are predominantly hedged with interest rate swaps (see Note 6). 
   (5)    The Company early adopted ASU 2015-03 requiring deferred financing costs to be presented as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the related indebtedness. The Company records deferred financing costs for its 2013 Credit Facility and 2015 Credit Facility in deferred costs and other assets, net on its consolidated balance sheets.  
  Revolving Credit Facilities 
  2015 Credit Facility  
  On March 31, 2015, the Operating Partnership entered into the Credit Agreement that established a new   $600.0 million   unsecured credit facility and terminated its secured   $400.0 million   2013 Credit Facility. The 2015 Credit Facility matures on March 31, 2019 (extendable at the Operating Partnership's option to March 31, 2020, subject to satisfaction of certain requirements). The 2015 Credit Facility includes an accordion feature to increase the committed facility size to up to   $1.0 billion  , subject to satisfying certain requirements and obtaining additional lender commitments. The 2015 Credit Facility includes a   $50.0 million   sublimit for swingline loans and up to   $60.0 million   available for issuances of letters of credit. Swingline loans and letters of credit reduce availability under the 2015 Credit Facility on a dollar-for-dollar basis. 
  During the quarter ended June 30, 2015, the 2015 Credit Facility bore interest at LIBOR plus   1.70%   based on the Company's leverage and incurred an unused fee of   0.25%  . If the Corporation obtains an investment grade rating of its senior unsecured long-term indebtedness of at least BBB- or Baa3 from S P or Moody's, respectively, the Operating Partnership may make an irrevocable election to change the grid pricing for the 2015 Credit Facility from leverage based to credit rating based pricing. Upon such an event, the 2015 Credit Facility will bear interest at a rate equal to LIBOR plus   0.875%   to   1.55%   per annum. In each case, the applicable borrowing margin depends on the credit rating for the Corporation. 
  If the Corporation obtains an investment grade credit rating from either S P or Moody s, the Operating Partnership will be required to pay a facility fee in an amount equal to the aggregate revolving credit commitments (whether or not utilized) multiplied by a rate equal to   0.125%   to   0.30%   per annum, depending on the credit rating for the Corporation. 
  
   27 

SPIRIT REALTY CAPITAL, INC. 
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - (continued) 
  June 30, 2015 
  (Unaudited) 

The Operating Partnership may voluntarily prepay the 2015 Credit Facility, in whole or in part, at any time, without premium or penalty, but subject to applicable LIBOR breakage fees, if any. Payment of the 2015 Credit Facility is unconditionally guaranteed by the Corporation and certain of its existing and future subsidiaries that are not currently securing or anticipated to secure other indebtedness. The 2015 Credit Facility is full recourse to the Operating Partnership and the aforementioned guarantors.  
    
  As a result of entering into the 2015 Credit Facility, the Company incurred origination costs of   $3.7 million  . These deferred financing costs are being amortized to interest expense over the remaining initial term of the 2015 Credit Facility. As of   June 30, 2015  , the unamortized deferred financing costs relating to the 2015 Credit Facility was   $3.5 million   and recorded in deferred costs and other assets, net on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.  
    
  As of   June 30, 2015  ,   $20.0 million   of borrowings were outstanding,   $18.0 million   of letters of credit were issued and   $562.0 million   of borrowing capacity was available under the 2015 Credit Facility. The Operating Partnership's ability to borrow under the 2015 Credit Facility is subject to ongoing compliance with a number of customary financial covenants and other customary affirmative and negative covenants. As of   June 30, 2015  , the Corporation and the Operating Partnership were in compliance with these financial covenants.  
  2013 Credit Facility  
  On March 31, 2015, the secured 2013 Credit Facility was terminated and its outstanding borrowings were repaid with proceeds from the 2015 Credit Facility. Properties securing this facility became unencumbered upon its termination. The 2013 Credit Facility's borrowing margin was LIBOR plus   2.50%   based on the Company's leverage, with an unused fee of   0.35%  . Upon terminating the 2013 Credit Facility, the Company recognized debt extinguishment costs of   $2.0 million  , resulting from the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs. 
  Line of Credit 
  A special purpose entity indirectly owned by the Corporation has access to a   $40.0 million   secured revolving line of credit. The initial term of the Line of Credit expires in March 2016, and each advance under the Line of Credit has a   24  -month term. As of   June 30, 2015  , the Line of Credit was undrawn and had   $40.0 million   of borrowing capacity available. The ability to borrow under the Line of Credit is subject to the Operating Partnership and special purpose entity's ongoing compliance with a number of customary financial covenants. As of   June 30, 2015  , the Operating Partnership and, if applicable, the special purpose entity were in compliance with these financial covenants.  
  Master Trust Notes  
    
  The Company has access to an asset-backed securitization platform, the Spirit Master Funding Program, to raise capital through the issuance of non-recourse net-lease mortgage notes collateralized by commercial real estate, net-leases and mortgage loans. The Spirit Master Funding Program consists of two separate securitization trusts, Master Trust 2013 and Master Trust 2014, each of which have one or multiple bankruptcy-remote, special purpose entities as issuers or co-issuers of the notes. Each issuer is an indirect wholly-owned special purpose entity subsidiary of the Corporation.  
  
   28 

SPIRIT REALTY CAPITAL, INC. 
  Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - (continued)

The Master Trust Notes are summarized below: 

(1)    The effective interest rates include amortization of debt discount and amortization of deferred financing costs calculated for the three months ended   June 30, 2015   based on the average principal balance outstanding during the period. 
   (2)    Represents the individual series stated interest rate as of   June 30, 2015   and the weighted average stated rate of the total Master Trust Notes, based on the collective series outstanding principal balances as of   June 30, 2015  . 
    
  As of   June 30, 2015  , the Master Trust 2014 notes were secured by   957   owned and financed properties issued by five indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Corporation. The notes issued under Master Trust 2014 are cross-collateralized by the assets of all issuers within this trust. As of   June 30, 2015  , the Master Trust 2013 notes were secured by   315   owned and financed properties issued by a single indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Corporation.  
    
  CMBS  
    
  As of   June 30, 2015  , indirect wholly-owned special purpose entity subsidiaries of the Corporation were borrowers under   153   fixed and   9   variable-rate non-recourse loans which have been securitized into CMBS and are secured by the borrowers' respective leased properties and related assets. The stated interest rates as of   June 30, 2015   for these fixed-rate notes, excluding the defaulted loans, ranged from   3.90%   to   8.39%  . The stated interest rates as of   June 30, 2015   for the variable-rate notes ranged from   3.18%   to   3.59%  . As of   June 30, 2015  , these fixed and variable-rate loans were secured by   475   and   86   properties, respectively. The Company entered into interest rate swaps that effectively fixed the interest rates at approximately   5.2%   on a significant portion of the variable-rate debt (see Note 6). As of   June 30, 2015   and   December 31, 2014  , the unamortized deferred financing costs relating to certain of the CMBS loans were   $5.8 million   and   $6.4 million  , respectively. The deferred financing costs are being amortized to expense over the term of the respective loans. 
    
  As of   June 30, 2015  , certain borrowers were in default under the loan agreements relating to   four   separate CMBS fixed-rate loans where the   10   properties securing the respective loans are no longer generating sufficient revenue to pay the scheduled debt service. The default interest rate on these loans was between   9.67%   and   10.88%  . Each defaulted borrower is a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity and the sole owner of the collateral securing the loan obligations. As of   June 30, 2015  , the aggregate principal balance under the defaulted CMBS loans was   $79.0 million  , which includes   $5.7 million   of interest added to principal. In addition, approximately   $12.1 million   of lender controlled reserves, within restricted cash, are being held in connection with these loans that may be applied to reduce amounts

owed. During the three months ended June 30, 2015, defaulted loan balances aggregating   $25.4 million  , which included   $0.4 million   of capitalized interest, were retired upon the disposition of   5   properties and the application of   $3.6 million   of lender reserves securing these defaulted loans.   One   of the properties disposed was surrendered to the lender pursuant to a consensual foreclosure and release of the debt. The remaining   four   properties were sold by the Company to third parties pursuant to an amendment to the loan agreement, which provided for a specified reduction in principal balance associated with the sale of those individual properties.  
    
  Convertible Notes 
    
  In May 2014, the Corporation issued   $402.5 million   aggregate principal amount of   2.875%   convertible notes due in 2019 and   $345.0 million   aggregate principal amount of   3.75%   convertible notes due in 2021. Interest on the Convertible Notes is payable semiannually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year. The 2019 Notes will mature on   May 15, 2019   and the 2021 Notes will mature on   May 15, 2021  . 
    
  The Convertible Notes are convertible only during certain periods and, subject to certain circumstances, into cash, shares of the Corporation's common stock, or a combination thereof. The initial conversion rate applicable to each series is   76.3636   per   $1,000   principal note (equivalent to an initial conversion price of   $13.10   per share of common stock, representing a   22.5%   premium above the public offering price of the common stock offered concurrently at the time the Convertible Notes were issued). Earlier conversion may be triggered if shares of the Corporation's common stock trades higher than the established thresholds, if the Convertible Notes trade below established thresholds, or certain corporate events occur. 
    
  In connection with the issuance of the Convertible Notes, the Company recorded a discount of   $56.7 million  , which represents the estimated value of the embedded conversion feature for each of the Convertible Notes. The discount is being amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of each of the 2019 Notes and 2021 Notes. As of   June 30, 2015   and   December 31, 2014  , the unamortized discount was   $47.2 million   and   $51.5 million  , respectively. The discount is shown net against the aggregate outstanding principal balance of the Convertible Notes on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The equity component of the conversion feature is recorded in capital in excess of par value in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet, net of financing transaction costs.  
    
  In connection with the offering, the Company also incurred   $19.6 million   in deferred financing costs. This amount has been allocated on a pro-rata basis to each of the Convertible Notes and is being amortized to interest expense over the term of each note. As of   June 30, 2015   and   December 31, 2014  , the unamortized deferred financing costs relating to the Convertible Notes was   $16.2 million   and   $17.8 million  , respectively. 
    
  Debt Extinguishment 
    
  During the   six months ended     June 30, 2015  , the Company extinguished a total of   $336.8 million   aggregate principal amount of senior mortgage indebtedness with a weighted average contractual interest rate of   5.64%   and terminated the 2013 Credit Facility. As a result of these transactions, the Company recognized a net gain on debt extinguishment of approximately   $2.1 million  . The gain was primarily attributable to the write-off of net debt premiums and the reduction of   $17.5 million   of debt using net sales proceeds of   $14.0 million   from the sale of   four   properties securing a portion of a defaulted CMBS note, partially offset by defeasance costs.  
    
  During the   six months ended     June 30, 2014  , the Company extinguished a total of   $509.8 million   aggregate principal amount of senior mortgage indebtedness with a weighted average contractual interest rate of   6.59%   and redeemed   $18.0 million   of net-lease mortgage notes that were not tendered in connection with the Exchange Offer. As a result of these transactions, the Company recognized a loss on debt extinguishment during the   six months ended     June 30, 2014   of approximately   $64.7 million   primarily from costs incurred related to the defeasance of the Shopko indebtedness.

Note 6. Derivative and Hedging Activities  
  The Company uses interest rate derivative contracts to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates on its variable rate debt. These derivatives are considered cash flow hedges and are recorded on a gross basis at fair value. Assessments of hedge effectiveness are performed quarterly using regression analysis and the measurement of hedge ineffectiveness is based on the hypothetical derivative method. The effective portion of changes in fair value are recorded in AOCL and subsequently reclassified to earnings when the hedged transactions affect earnings. The ineffective portion is recorded immediately in earnings in general and administrative expenses.  
  The Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of non-performance by its derivative counterparties. The Company evaluates counterparty credit risk through monitoring the creditworthiness of counterparties, which includes review of

debt ratings and financial performance. To mitigate its credit risk, the Company enters into agreements with counterparties it considers credit-worthy, such as large financial institutions with favorable credit ratings.  As of   June 30, 2015   and   December 31, 2014  , there were no termination events or events of default related to the interest rate swaps.

(1)       During June 2015, the Company terminated certain interest rate swap agreements upon the repayment of   two   CMBS variable-rate loans. The Company paid   $0.1 million   to terminate these swaps and recognized a loss of   $0.1 million  , which is included in general and administrative expenses. 
   (2)     Represents a tranche of   eight   individual interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts ranging from   $7.6 million   to   $7.9 million  . The swap agreements contain the same payment terms, stated interest rate, effective date, and maturity date. 
    
  The following tables provide information about the amounts recorded in AOCL, as well as the loss recorded in operations, when reclassified out of AOCL or recognized in earnings immediately, for the   six months ended     June 30, 2015   and   2014  , respectively (in thousands): 

(1)    Three months and   six months ended     June 30, 2015   includes a loss of   $76.0 thousand   that was reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss in the balance sheet resulting from hedged transactions that were no longer probable of occurring as the swaps were terminated prior to their respective maturity dates.

owed by   one   of its tenants and is indemnified by that tenant for any payments the Company may be required to make on such debt. 
  The Company estimates future costs for known environmental remediation requirements when it is probable that the Company has incurred a liability and the related costs can be reasonably estimated. The Company considers various factors when estimating its environmental liabilities, and adjustments are made when additional information becomes available that affects the estimated costs to study or remediate any environmental issues. When only a wide range of estimated amounts can be reasonably established and no other amount within the range is better than another, the low end of the range is recorded in the consolidated financial statements.  

Note 9. Fair Value Measurements  
  Recurring Fair Value Measurements 
  The Company s assets and liabilities that are required to be measured at fair value in the accompanying consolidated financial statements are summarized below. The following table sets forth the Company s financial liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis (in thousands): 

The interest rate swaps are measured using a market approach, using prices obtained from a nationally recognized pricing service and pricing models with market observable inputs such as interest rates and volatilities. These measurements are classified as Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements 
  Fair value measurement of an asset on a nonrecurring basis occurs when events or changes in circumstances related to an asset indicate that the carrying amount of the asset is no longer recoverable. The following table sets forth the Company s assets that were accounted for at fair value on a nonrecurring basis (in thousands):  

(1)      Impairment charges are presented for the   six months ended     June 30, 2015   and for the year ended   December 31, 2014  . 
  The fair values of impaired real estate and intangible assets were determined by using the following information, depending on availability, in order of preference: signed purchase and sale agreements or letters of intent; recently quoted bid or ask prices, or market prices for comparable properties; estimates of cash flow, which consider, among other things, contractual and forecasted rental revenues, leasing assumptions, and expenses based upon market conditions; and expectations for the use of the real estate. Based on these inputs, the Company determined that its valuation of the impaired real estate and intangible assets falls within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. 
  Estimated Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
  Financial assets and liabilities for which the carrying values approximate their fair values include cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and escrow deposits, and accounts receivable and payable. Generally, these assets and liabilities are short-term in duration and are recorded at cost, which approximates fair value, on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. 
  In addition to the disclosures for assets and liabilities required to be measured at fair value at the balance sheet date, companies are required to disclose the estimated fair values of all financial instruments, even if they are not carried at their fair values. The fair values of financial instruments are estimates based upon market conditions and perceived risks at   June 30, 2015   and   December 31, 2014  . These estimates require management s judgment and may not be indicative of the future fair values of the assets and liabilities.

The estimated fair values of the loans receivable, Revolving Credit Facilities, Convertible Notes and the fixed-rate mortgages and notes payable have been derived based on market quotes for comparable instruments or discounted cash flow analyses using estimates of the amount and timing of future cash flows, market rates and credit spreads. The loans receivable, Revolving Credit Facilities, Convertible Notes and mortgages and notes payable were measured using a market approach from nationally recognized financial institutions with market observable inputs such as interest rates and credit analytics. These measurements are classified as Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The following table discloses fair value information for these financial instruments (in thousands):    

(1)       As of December 31, 2014, only amounts under the Line of Credit were outstanding and net of unamortized deferred financing costs. As of June 30, 2015, only amounts under the 2015 Credit Facility were outstanding.   
   (2)     The carrying value of the debt instruments are net of unamortized deferred financing costs and certain debt discounts/premiums. 

Note 10. Significant Credit and Revenue Concentration

Shopko operates in the general merchandise industry and is the Company s largest tenant as a percentage of Normalized Revenue. Total rental revenues from properties leased to Shopko for the three months ended   June 30, 2015   and   2014  , contributed   10.4%   and   13.8%   of the Company's Normalized Revenue from continuing operations, respectively.   No   other tenant contributed   5%   or more of the Company s Normalized Revenue during any of the periods presented. As of   June 30, 2015   and   December 31, 2014  , the Company's net investment in Shopko properties represents approximately   8.1%   and   10.7%  , respectively, of the Company s total assets and the Company's real estate investment in Shopko represents approximately   10.4%   and   13.1%  , respectively, of the Company's total real estate investment portfolio.

Restricted Shares of Common Stock 
  During the   six months ended     June 30, 2015  , the Company granted   0.5 million   restricted shares under the Incentive Award Plan to certain officers and employees. The Company recorded   $5.5 million   in deferred compensation associated with these grants, which will be recognized in expense over the service period of the awards. As of   June 30, 2015  , there were approximately   1.3 million   unvested restricted shares outstanding. 
  Performance Share Awards 
  During the   six months ended     June 30, 2015  , the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors approved an initial target grant of   279,199   performance shares to certain executive officers of the Company. The performance period of this grant runs from January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2017. Pursuant to the performance share award agreement, each participant is eligible to vest in and receive shares of the Corporation's common stock based on the initial target number of shares granted multiplied by a percentage range between   0%   and   250%  . The percentage range is based on the attainment of TSR of the Corporation compared to certain specified peer groups of companies during the performance period. In addition, final shares issued under each performance share award entitle its holder to a cash payment equal to the aggregate dividends that were declared during the performance period as if the shares had been issued and outstanding on each dividend record date. Based on the grant date fair value, the Corporation expects to recognize   $4.1 million   in compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period associated with this market-based grant.  
  As of   June 30, 2015  , under each separate annual performance share award, the Corporation's TSR compared to the specified peer groups during the performance periods would have resulted in the release of   0.7 million   shares, in the aggregate. In addition, approximately   $0.9 million   in dividend rights have been accrued. The projected shares to be released are not considered issued under the Incentive Award Plan until the performance period has ended and the actual number of shares to be released is determined. The performance shares and dividend rights are subject to forfeiture in the event of a non-qualifying termination of a participant prior to the performance period end date.  
  Stock-based Compensation Expense 
  For the three months ended   June 30, 2015   and   2014  , the Company recognized   $3.5 million   and   $3.0 million  , respectively, in stock-based compensation expense, which is included in general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. For the   six months ended     June 30, 2015   and   2014  , the Company recognized   $7.3 million   and   $5.5 million  , respectively, in stock-based compensation expense. 
  As of   June 30, 2015  , the remaining unamortized stock-based compensation expense, including amounts relating to the performance share awards, totaled   $14.7 million  , which is recognized as the greater of the amount amortized on a straight-line basis over the service period of each applicable award or the amount vested over the vesting periods.

Note 14. Income (Loss) Per Share 
  Income (loss)   per share has been computed using the two-class method.   Income (loss)   per common share under the two-class method is computed by dividing the sum of distributed earnings to common stockholders and undistributed earnings allocated to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. In applying the two-class method, undistributed earnings are allocated to both shares of common stock and participating securities based on the weighted average shares outstanding during the period. Classification of the Company's unvested restricted stock, which contain rights to receive nonforfeitable dividends, are deemed participating securities under the two-class method. Under the two-class method, earnings attributable to unvested restricted shares are deducted from   income (loss)   from continuing operations in the computation of net income attributable to common stockholders. The table below is a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator used in the computation of basic and diluted   income (loss)   per share, as restated (dollars in thousands): 

(1)     Assumes the most dilutive issuance of potentially issuable shares between the two-class and treasury stock method unless the result would be anti-dilutive.

The Corporation intends to satisfy its exchange obligation for the principal amount of the Convertible Notes to the note holders entirely in cash, therefore, the "if-converted" method does not apply and the treasury stock method is being used. As the Corporation's stock price is below the conversion price, there are   no   potentially dilutive shares associated with the Convertible Notes.

Overview 
  Spirit Realty Capital, Inc. is a New York Stock Exchange listed Company under the ticker symbol "SRC". We are a self-administered and self-managed REIT with in-house capabilities including acquisition, portfolio management, asset management, credit research, real estate research, legal, finance and accounting and capital markets. We primarily invest in single-tenant, operationally essential real estate throughout the United States, which are generally acquired through strategic sale-leaseback transactions and subsequently leased on long-term, triple-net basis to high-quality tenants with business operations within predominantly retail, but also office and industrial property types. Single tenant, operationally essential real estate consists of properties that are generally free-standing, commercial real estate facilities where our tenants conduct activities that are essential to the generation of their sales and profits. In support of our primary business of owning and leasing real estate, we have also strategically originated or acquired long-term, commercial mortgage and other loans to provide a range of financing solutions to our tenants. 
    
  Our operations are primarily carried out through the Operating Partnership. OP Holdings, one of our wholly owned subsidiaries, is the sole general partner and owns   1.0%   of the Operating Partnership. We and one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries are the only limited partners, and together own the remaining   99.0%   of the Operating Partnership. Although the Operating Partnership is wholly-owned by us, in the future, we may issue partnership interests in the Operating Partnership to third parties in exchange for property owned by such third parties. In general, any partnership interests in the Operating Partnership issued to third parties would be exchangeable for cash or, at our election, shares of our common stock at specified ratios set when such partnership interests in the Operating Partnership are issued.  
  We have elected to be taxed as a REIT for federal income tax purposes commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2005. We believe that we have been organized and have operated in a manner that has allowed us to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes commencing with such taxable year, and we intend to continue operating in such a manner.  
  We generate our revenue primarily by leasing our properties to our tenants. As of   June 30, 2015  , our undepreciated investment in real estate and loans totaled approximately   $8.21 billion  , representing investments in   2,600   properties, including properties securing our mortgage loans. Of this amount,   98.7%   consisted of investment in real estate, representing ownership of   2,455   properties, and the remaining   1.3%   consisted of commercial mortgage and other loans receivable primarily secured by   145   real properties.  
  As of   June 30, 2015  , our owned properties were approximately   98.7%   occupied (based on number of properties), and our leases had a weighted average non-cancelable remaining lease term (based on total rental revenue) of approximately   10.8   years. Our leases are generally originated with long lease terms, typically non-cancelable initial terms of 15 to 20 years and tenant renewal options for additional years. As of   June 30, 2015  , approximately   89.1%   of our single-tenant properties (based on total rental revenue) provided for increases in future annual base contractual rent.

Factors that May Influence Our Operating Results  
    
  Acquisitions 
  Our principal line of business is acquiring commercial real estate properties and leasing these properties to our tenants. Our ability to grow revenue and produce superior risk adjusted returns will principally depend on our ability to acquire additional properties that meet our investment criteria at a yield sufficiently in excess of our cost of capital. We primarily focus on opportunities to acquire attractive commercial real estate by providing capital to small and middle-market companies that we conclude have stable and proven operating histories and attractive credit characteristics, but lack the access to capital that large companies often have. Small and middle-market companies are often willing to enter into leases with structures and terms that we consider appealing (such as master leases and leases that require ongoing tenant financial reporting) and that we believe increase the security of rental payments. 
    
  Operationally Essential Real Estate with Long-Term Leases 
    
  We seek to own properties that are operationally essential to our tenants, thereby reducing the risk that our tenant would choose not to renew an expiring lease or reject a lease in bankruptcy. In addition, we seek to enter into leases with relatively long terms, typically with initial terms of 15 to 20 years and tenant renewal options for additional terms with attractive rent escalation provisions. As of   June 30, 2015  , our leases had a weighted average remaining lease term (based on rental revenue) of approximately   10.8   years compared to approximately   10.1   years as of   June 30, 2014  .  
    
  Portfolio Diversification 
    
  Our strategy emphasizes a portfolio that (1) derives no more than 10% of its annual rent from any single tenant and no more than 1.0% of its annual rent from any single property, (2) is leased to tenants operating in various industries and (3) is located across the United States without significant geographic concentration.  
    
  As of June 30, 2015, Shopko represents our most significant tenant at 10.4% of Normalized Revenue. Following the 2014 restructuring of the Shopko master lease and defeasance of the related secured indebtedness, we have continued our objective to reduce the tenant concentration of Shopko. During the   six months ended     June 30, 2015  , we sold   21   Shopko properties having an investment value of $198.8 million. These sales, coupled with our increased rental revenue from real estate investments of   $1.16 billion   during the past 12 months, have reduced our current Shopko tenant concentration to   10.4%   compared to 14.0% as of   December 31, 2014  .  
    
  We believe that our experience, in-depth market knowledge and extensive network of long-standing relationships in the real estate industry will continue to provide us access to an ongoing pipeline of attractive acquisitions. However, because we primarily use external financing to fund acquisitions, periods of volatility in the credit and capital markets that may negatively affect the amounts, sources and cost of capital available to us could force us to limit our acquisition  
  
   43 

activity. Additionally, to the extent that we access capital at a higher cost (reflected in higher interest rates for debt financing or lower stock price for equity financing), our financial results could be adversely affected.    
    
  Our Leases 
    
  Rent Escalators    
    
  Generally, our single-tenant leases contain contractual provisions increasing the rental revenue over the term of the lease at specified dates by: (1) a fixed amount or (2) the lesser of (a) 1 to 1.25 times any increase in CPI over a specified period or (b) a fixed percentage, typically 1% to 2% per year. The percentage of our single-tenant properties (based on Normalized Rental Revenue) containing rent escalators increased to approximately   89%   as of   June 30, 2015   compared to approximately   87%   as of   June 30, 2014  . 
    
  Master Lease Structure  
    
  Where appropriate, we seek to enter into master leases, pursuant to which we lease multiple properties to a single tenant on an  all or none  basis. We seek to use the master lease structure to prevent a tenant from unilaterally giving up underperforming properties while retaining well-performing properties. Master lease revenue contributed approximately   46%   of our Normalized Rental Revenue during the month ended   June 30, 2015   compared to approximately   43%   for the same period in   2014  .  
    
  Triple-Net Leases  
    
  Our leases are predominantly triple-net which require the tenant to pay all property operating expenses such as real estate taxes, insurance premiums and repair and maintenance costs. As of   June 30, 2015  , approximately   86.4%   of our single-tenant properties (based on Normalized Rental Revenue) are subject to triple-net leases compared to approximately   85.1%   as of   June 30, 2014  .  
    
  Asset Management 
    
  The stability of the rental revenue generated by our properties depends principally on our tenants  ability to 1) pay rent and our ability to collect rent due, 2) renew expiring leases or re-lease space upon expiration or other termination, 3) lease currently vacant properties, and 4) maintain or increase rental rates. Each of these could be negatively impacted by adverse economic conditions, particularly those that affect the markets in which our properties are located, downturns in our tenants  industries, increased competition for our tenants at our property locations, or the bankruptcy of one or more of our tenants. We seek to manage these risks by using our developed underwriting and risk management processes to structure and manage our portfolio.  
    
  Active Management and Monitoring of Risks Related to Our Investments 
    
  We seek to measure tenant financial distress risk and lease renewal risk through various processes. Many of our tenants are required to provide corporate-level and or unit-level financial information, which includes balance sheet, income statement and cash flow statement data on a quarterly and/or annual basis. Our underwriting and risk management processes are designed to structure new investments and manage existing investments to mitigate tenant credit quality risks and preserve the long-term return on our invested capital. Since our inception, our occupancy has never been below 96.1% (based on number of properties). As of both   June 30, 2015   and   June 30, 2014  , the percentage of our properties that were occupied was   98.7%  .  
    
  Capital Recycling  
    
  We continuously evaluate opportunities for the potential disposition of properties in our portfolio when we believe such disposition is appropriate in view of our business objectives, considering criteria including, but not limited to, tenant concentration, tenant credit quality, unit financial performance, local market conditions and lease rates, associated indebtedness, asset location and tenant operation type (e.g., industry, sector, or concept/brand), as well as potential uses of proceeds and tax considerations. As part of this strategy, we attempt at times to enter into 1031 Exchanges, when possible, to defer some or all of the taxable built-in gains on the dispositions, if any, for federal and state income tax purposes. 

44 

The timing of any potential dispositions will depend on market conditions and other factors, including but not limited to our capital needs and ability to defer some or all of the taxable gains on the sales. We can provide no assurance that we will dispose of any additional properties or that future acquisitions and/or dispositions, if any, will qualify as 1031 Exchanges. Furthermore, we can provide no assurance that we will deploy the proceeds from future dispositions in a manner that produces comparable or better yields.  
    
  Capital Funding 
    
  Our principal demands for funds are for property acquisitions, payment of principal and interest on our outstanding indebtedness, operating and property maintenance expenses and distributions to our stockholders. Generally, cash needs for payments of principal and interest, operating and property maintenance expenses and distributions to stockholders will be generated from cash flows from operations, which are primarily driven by the rental income received from our leased properties, interest income earned on loans receivable and interest income on our cash balances. We generally temporarily fund the acquisition of real estate utilizing our Revolving Credit Facilities, followed by permanent financing through asset level financing or by issuing debt or equity securities. 
  Interest Costs 
    
  Our fixed-rate debt structure provides us with a stable and predictable cash requirement related to our debt service. Any changes to our debt structure, including borrowings under our 2015 Credit Facility or debt financing associated with property acquisitions, could materially influence our operating results depending on the terms of any such indebtedness. A significant amount of our debt provides for scheduled principal payments. As principal is repaid, our interest expense decreases. Changing interest rates will increase or decrease the interest expense we incur on unhedged variable interest rate debt and may impact our ability to refinance maturing debt.  

45 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires our management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. We base estimates on the best information available to us at the time, our experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions or other matters had been different, it is possible that different accounting would have been applied, resulting in a different presentation of our consolidated financial statements. From time to time, we re-evaluate our estimates and assumptions. In the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results, adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain. A summary of our critical accounting policies is included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2014   in the section entitled  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  We have not made any material changes to these policies during the periods covered by this quarterly report.

Results of Operations 
  Comparison of Three Months Ended   June 30, 2015   to Three Months Ended   June 30, 2014 
  The following discussion includes the results of our continuing operations as summarized in the table below:  

NM - Percentages over 100% are not displayed. 
  Revenues 
  For the three months ended   June 30, 2015  , approximately   95.0%   of our total revenue was attributable to long-term leases. The year-over-year increase of 10.6% in total revenue was due primarily to an increase in base rental revenue resulting from real estate acquisitions subsequent to June 30, 2014, and to a lesser extent, to contractual rent escalations within our existing real estate portfolio. 
    
  Rentals 
    
  The year-over-year increase in rental revenue was primarily attributable to the acquisition of   319   properties representing an investment in real estate of   $1.16 billion   during the twelve-month period ended   June 30, 2015  . This increase was partially offset by the sale of   88   properties during the same period having an investment value of   $447.9 million  . Non-cash rentals for the three months ended   June 30, 2015   and   2014   were   $6.4 million   and   $5.0 million  , respectively. These amounts represent approximately   4.0%   and   3.5%   of total rental revenue from continuing operations for each  
  
   47 

of the three months ended   June 30, 2015   and   2014  , respectively. Contractual rent escalations subsequent to   June 30, 2014   also contributed to the increase. 
    
  As of   June 30, 2015  ,   98.7%   of our owned properties were occupied (based on number of properties). The majority of our nonperforming properties were in the restaurant and manufacturing industries. As of   June 30, 2015   and 2014, respectively,   33   and 29 of our properties, representing approximately   1.3%   of our owned properties were vacant and not generating rent. Of the 33 vacant properties, 11 were held for sale as of   June 30, 2015  . 
    
  Tenant reimbursement income 
    
  We have a number of leases that require our tenants to reimburse us for certain property costs we incur. Tenant reimbursement income is driven by the tenant reimbursable property costs described below.  
  Expenses  
  General and administrative 
  The year-over-year increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily due to higher compensation and related benefits of $0.9 million, which includes $0.3 million related to non-cash stock compensation. The increase in compensation and related benefits is primarily attributable to an increase in employee headcount and salaries between the comparable periods. Higher professional fees for accounting, tax, audit and consulting of $0.2 million and $0.5 million in outside services and other expenses, including servicer fees and temporary employment services made up the majority of the balance.   
    
  Finance restructuring costs 
    
  In connection with the Exchange Offer, we incurred costs of approximately   $13.0 million   during the three months ended   June 30, 2014  , which include legal, accounting and financial advisory services, and other third-party expenses. No such costs were incurred during the corresponding period in 2015. 
  Property costs  
    
  For the three months ended   June 30, 2015  , property costs were $6.4 million (including $3.5 million of tenant reimbursables) as compared to $6.6 million (including $2.9 million in tenant reimbursables) for the same period in 2014. Although gross property costs remained consistent between periods, the Company was able to realize greater cost recovery in the current period, particularly related to property tax at our single site locations.   
  Interest  
  The year-over-year increase in interest expense is primarily attributable to a $1.3 million rise in non-cash interest resulting primarily from the amortization of capitalized deferred financing costs associated  with the Master Trust 2014 Notes offering as well as the debt discount associated with our Convertible Notes offering. The higher Convertible Notes interest during the current period was due to the timing of our $747.5 million May 2014 offering. In addition to the Convertible Notes offering, we borrowed $510.0 million related to our Master Trust 2014 notes in December 2014. Including these two offerings, we borrowed $1.26 billion of debt with a weighted average interest rate of 3.69%, while extinguishing  $920.6 million of mortgage and notes indebtedness with a weighted average interest rate of 6.13% during the comparable time period. Despite our net borrowings during the period, our interest expense was lower due to the lower weighted average interest rate on the debt we borrowed compared to the weighted average interest rate on the debt we retired. Scheduled amortization on our remaining debt outstanding also contributed to our interest expense reduction.  

48 

The following table summarizes our interest expense and related borrowings from continuing operations: 

(1)     Includes interest expense associated with non-utilization fees of approximately   $0.4 million   and   $0.3 million   for the three months ended   June 30, 2015   and   2014  , respectively. 
  Depreciation and amortization  
  Depreciation and amortization expense relates primarily to depreciation on the commercial buildings and improvements we own and amortization of our lease in place intangibles. The year-over-year increase is primarily due to the acquisition of   319   properties, representing an investment in real estate of   $1.16 billion  , during the twelve-month period ended   June 30, 2015  . The following table summarizes our depreciation and amortization expense from continuing operations: 

Impairments 
    
  Impairment charges for the three months ended   June 30, 2015  , included $27.5 million of impairment losses on 14 vacant or underperforming properties within the education, restaurant-casual dining and sporting goods industry. In addition, of the properties held for sale, seven had impairment losses totaling $6.3 million. For the same period in 2014, we recorded impairment losses of   28.2 million   including $7.7 million on the impairment of three properties that were held for sale, $2.5 million of lease intangible write-offs following lease terminations and $17.9 million of impairment on eight properties which were underperforming. Of the eight underperforming properties, seven were in the manufacturing industry and one was in the quick-service restaurant industry.  
    
  Other expense 
    
  During the three months ended   June 30, 2015  , we recorded a gain on debt extinguishment of   $3.4 million  . During the period, we extinguished $174.0 million in high interest rate CMBS debt with a weighted average interest rate of 5.54%. The gain on debt extinguishment resulted primarily from the sale of four properties securing a portion of a defaulted CMBS note. During the three months ended June 30, 2014, we recorded a loss on debt extinguishment of $64.7 million. The loss on debt extinguishment was primarily attributable to defeasance costs incurred in connection with the retirement of certain senior mortgage notes payable with an aggregate principal balance of $509.8 million and the redemption of $18.0 million of net-lease mortgage notes. The debt extinguished had a weighted average interest rate of 6.54%.  

49 

Gain on disposition of assets 
  For the three months ended   June 30, 2015  , the gain on disposition of assets was primarily attributable to a $47.5 million gain from the sale of 16 Shopko properties. The Shopko property sales are consistent with management's strategic decision to reduce our Shopko tenant concentration while maximizing our investment value. The balance of the gain related to the sale of 26 additional properties including 14 vacant properties and two multi-tenant properties.   
   
  Results of Operations  
  Comparison of   Six Months Ended June 30, 2015   to   Six Months Ended June 30, 2014    
  The following discussion includes the results of our continuing operations as summarized in the table below:  

NM - Percentages over 100% are not displayed. 
  Revenues 
  For the   six months ended     June 30, 2015  , approximately   95.1%   of our total revenues was attributable to long-term leases. The year-over-year increase of   11.7%   in total revenue was due primarily to an increase in base rental revenue resulting from real estate acquisitions subsequent to   June 30, 2014  .  

50 

Rentals 
  The year-over-year increase in rental revenue was primarily attributable to the acquisition of   319   properties with an investment value of   $1.16 billion   during the twelve-month period ended June 30, 2015. This increase was partially offset by the sale of   88   properties during the same period having an investment value of   $447.9 million  . Non-cash rentals for the   six   months ended   June 30, 2015   and   2014   were   $11.8 million   and   $9.6 million  , respectively, representing approximately   3.8%   and   3.4%   of total rental revenue from continuing operations for each of the   six   months ended   June 30, 2015   and   2014  , respectively. Contractual rent escalations subsequent to June 30, 2014 also contributed to the increase.  
    
  As of   June 30, 2015  ,   98.7%   of our owned properties were occupied (based on number of properties). The majority of our nonperforming properties were in the restaurant and manufacturing industries. As of   June 30, 2015   and   2014  , 33 and 29 properties of our owned properties representing approximately   1.3%   of our owned properties were vacant and not generating rent. Of the 33 vacant properties, 11 were held for sale as of   June 30, 2015  . 
    
  Tenant reimbursement income 
  We have a number of leases that require our tenants to reimburse us for certain property costs we incur. Tenant reimbursement income is driven by the tenant reimbursable property costs described below. 
  Expenses    
  General and administrative 
    
  The year-over-year increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily due to higher compensation and related benefits of $3.2 million, which includes $1.5 million related to non-cash stock compensation. The increase in compensation and related benefits is primarily attributable to the acceleration of cash and non-cash stock compensation related to the departure of an executive officer during the first quarter of 2015. The balance of the increase in compensation and related benefits is primarily attributable to an increase in employee headcount and salaries between the comparable periods. Additionally, outside services including servicer fees and temporary employment services increased $0.3 million. These increases were primarily offset by $0.6 million in lower professional fees for accounting, tax, audit and consulting.   
    
  Finance restructuring costs 
    
  In connection with the Exchange Offer, the Company incurred costs of approximately   $13.0 million   during the   six months ended     June 30, 2014  , which include legal, accounting and financial advisory services, and other third-party expenses. No such costs were incurred during the corresponding period in 2015. 
  Property costs  
    
  For the   six months ended     June 30, 2015  , property costs were   $13.8 million   (including   $8.1 million   of tenant reimbursables) compared to   $11.9 million   (including   $6.2 million   of tenant reimbursables) for the same period in   2014  .     The increase in property costs is primarily attributable to increases in operating costs, such as utilities and property taxes at certain CMBS default properties, and general operating costs at various properties that allow for reimbursement of such costs. The increase in tenant reimbursables represents the corresponding increase in general reimbursable operating costs along with greater cost recovery realization at certain of our single site locations. 
  Interest  
  The year-over-year increase in interest expense is primarily attributable to a $3.8 million rise in non-cash interest resulting primarily from the amortization of capitalized deferred financing costs associated with the Master Trust 2014 Notes offering as well as the debt discount associated with our Convertible Notes offering .  These amounts are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the instruments. The higher Convertible Notes interest during the current period was due to the timing of our $747.5 million May 2014 offering. The total year-over-year cash interest, however, remained stable despite our net borrowings of approximately $336.9 million through June 30, 2015. During that period we borrowed $1.26 billion of debt with a weighted average interest rate of 3.69% through our Convertible Notes and Master Trust 2014 notes offerings, and we extinguished $920.6 million of mortgage and notes indebtedness with a weighted average interest rate of 6.13%. The lower weighted average interest rate offset the impact of the increase in our net borrowings.   
  
   51 

The following table summarizes our interest expense and related borrowings from continuing operations: 

(1)     Includes interest expense associated with non-utilization fees of approximately   $0.8 million   and   $0.6 million   for the   six months ended     June 30, 2015   and   2014  , respectively. 
  Depreciation and amortization  
    
  Depreciation and amortization expense relates primarily to depreciation on the commercial buildings and improvements we own and amortization of our lease in place intangibles. The year-over-year increase is primarily due to the acquisition of   319   properties, representing an investment in real estate of   $1.16 billion  , during the twelve-month period ended   June 30, 2015  . The following table summarizes our depreciation and amortization expense from continuing operations: 

Impairments 
    
  During the   six   months ended   June 30, 2015  , impairment losses included $28.1 million on 16 vacant or underperforming properties primarily within the education, restaurant-casual dining and sporting goods industry. In addition, 17 properties held for sale had impairment losses of $7.9 million. For the same period in 2014 we recorded impairment losses of $30.1 million. These charges included $8.8 million on the impairment of four properties that were held for sale, $2.6 million of lease intangible write-offs following lease terminations and $18.7 million of impairment on 10 properties which were underperforming. Of the 10 underperforming properties, seven were in the manufacturing industry and three were in the quick service restaurant industry. 

52 

Other expense 
    
  During the   six months ended     June 30, 2015  , we recognized a gain on debt extinguishment of   $2.1 million  . The gain on debt extinguishment was primarily attributable to the sale of four properties securing a portion of a defaulted CMBS note. During the current period, we retired   $336.8 million   in high interest rate CMBS debt with a weighted average interest rate of   5.64%  . During the   six months ended     June 30, 2014  , we recorded a loss on debt extinguishment of   $64.7 million  . The loss on debt extinguishment was primarily attributable to defeasance costs incurred in connection with the retirement of certain senior mortgage notes payable with an aggregate principal balance of $509.8 million and the redemption of $18.0 million of net-lease mortgage notes. The debt extinguished had a weighted average interest rate of 6.54%.  
    
  Gain on disposition of assets 
    
  During the   six   months ended   June 30, 2015  , we recorded gains totaling $60.3 million from continuing operations on the disposition of certain real estate assets. These gains are primarily attributable to a $52.7 million gain from the sale of 21 Shopko properties. The Shopko property sales are consistent with management's strategic decision to reduce our Shopko tenant concentration while maximizing our investment value. Additionally, we sold or disposed of 36 other properties including 18 vacant properties and three multi-tenant properties.    

Property Portfolio Information 
  Our diverse real estate portfolio at   June 30, 2015   consisted of   2,455   owned properties:  
              
    located in   49   states as well as in the U.S. Virgin Islands, with only   4   states contributing more than 5% of our rental revenue;  
                
    operating in   27   different industries;  
                 
    with a weighted average remaining lease term of   10.8   years.  
     Property Portfolio Diversification 
  The following tables present the diversity of our properties owned at the end of the reporting period. The portfolio metrics are calculated based on the percentage of Normalized Revenue or Normalized Rental Revenue as noted. Total revenues and total rental revenue used in the calculations are normalized to exclude revenues contributed by properties sold during the given period.  
    
  Diversification By Tenant    
    
  The tenant concentration percentage is computed by dividing a tenant's quarterly rental revenue by the Company's Normalized Revenues. The following table lists the top ten tenants of our owned real estate properties as of   June 30, 2015  :  
  
   53 

(1)     Total revenue for the quarter ended   June 30, 2015  , excluding rental revenue contributed from properties sold during the period. 
   (2)     Tenants represent legal entities ultimately responsible for obligations under the lease agreements. Other tenants may operate certain of the same business concepts or brands set forth above, but represent distinct tenant credits.

Liquidity and Capital Resources  
    
  Short-term Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  On a short-term basis, our principal demands for funds will be for operating expenses including financing of acquisitions, distributions to stockholders and interest and principal on current and any future debt financings. We expect to fund our operating expenses and other short-term liquidity requirements, capital expenditures, payment of principal and interest on our outstanding indebtedness, property improvements, re-leasing costs and cash distributions to common stockholders, primarily through cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under the 2015 Credit Facility. On March 31, 2015, the Operating Partnership entered into the 2015 Credit Agreement, establishing a $600.0 million unsecured credit facility and terminated its $400.0 million secured 2013 Credit Facility previously in place. Our 2015 Credit Facility increases our capacity to fund acquisitions, while continuing to meet our short-term working capital requirements. The Credit Agreement also includes an accordion feature to increase the size of the 2015 Credit Facility to up to $1.0 billion, subject to satisfying certain requirements and obtaining additional lender commitments. As of   June 30, 2015  ,   $20.0 million   was outstanding,   $18.0 million   of letters of credit were issued and   $562.0 million   of borrowing capacity was available under the 2015 Credit Facility.  
  We have a shelf registration statement on file with the SEC under which we may issue secured or unsecured indebtedness and equity financing through the instruments and on the terms most attractive to us at such time. During the   six months ended     June 30, 2015  , we sold an aggregate of   6.6 million   shares under our ATM Program for net proceeds of   $78.5 million   after payment of commissions and other issuance costs of   $1.3 million  . The net proceeds were contributed to the Operating Partnership to fund acquisitions, repay borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facilities and for general corporate purposes. As of   June 30, 2015  ,   $103.6 million   in gross proceeds capacity remained available under the ATM Program. In addition, during April 2015, we completed an underwritten public offering of 23.0 million shares of our common stock and raised net proceeds of   $268.8 million  . The net proceeds from the offering were used to repay the outstanding balances under the 2015 Credit Facility and Line of Credit. The remaining proceeds were retained to fund potential future acquisitions and for general corporate purposes (including additional repayments of borrowings outstanding from time to time under the Revolving Credit Facilities).  
  
   58 

Long-term Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  We plan to meet our long-term capital needs, including long-term financing of property acquisitions, by obtaining asset level financing, issuing registered debt or equity securities and occasionally by issuing fixed rate secured notes and bonds. We may continue to issue common stock when we believe that our share price is at a level that allows for the proceeds of any offering to be accretively invested into additional properties. In addition, we may issue common stock to permanently finance properties that were financed by our 2015 Credit Facility or other indebtedness. In the future, some of our property acquisitions could be made by issuing partnership interests of our Operating Partnership in exchange for property owned by third parties. These partnership interests would be exchangeable for cash or, at our election, shares of our common stock.    
    
  We continually evaluate alternative financing and believe that we can obtain financing on reasonable terms. However, we cannot assure you that we will have access to the capital markets at times and at terms that are acceptable to us. We expect that our primary uses of capital will be for property and other asset acquisitions and the payment of tenant improvements, operating expenses, including debt service payments on any outstanding indebtedness, and distributions to our stockholders. 
    
  Description of Certain Debt  
    
  Spirit Master Funding Program 
    
  The Spirit Master Funding Program is an asset-backed securitization platform in which we raise capital through the issuance of non-recourse net-lease mortgage notes collateralized by commercial real estate, net-leases and mortgage loans. The Spirit Master Funding Program allows us to issue notes that are secured by the assets of the special purpose entity note issuers which are pledged to the indenture trustee for the benefit of the noteholders and managed by the Operating Partnership as property manager. These Collateral Pools consist primarily of commercial real estate properties, the issuers  rights in the leases of such properties and commercial mortgage loans secured by commercial real estate property. In general, monthly rental and mortgage receipts with respect to the leases and mortgage loans are deposited with the indenture trustee who will first utilize these funds to satisfy the debt service requirements on the notes and any fees and costs associated with the administration of the Spirit Master Funding Program. The remaining funds are remitted to the issuers monthly on the note payment date. 
    
  In addition, upon satisfaction of certain conditions, the issuers may, from time to time, sell or exchange real estate properties or mortgage loans from the Collateral Pools. Proceeds from the sale of assets within the Collateral Pools are held on deposit by the indenture trustee until a qualifying substitution is made or the amounts are distributed as an early repayment of principal. At   June 30, 2015  ,   $9.6 million   was held on deposit and classified as restricted cash within deferred costs and other assets, net in our consolidated balance sheets. 
    
  The Spirit Master Funding Program consists of two separate securitization trusts which have one or multiple bankruptcy-remote, special purpose entities as issuers of the Master Trust 2013 and Master Trust 2014 notes. Each issuer is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of ours. All outstanding series of Master Trust Notes were rated investment grade as of   June 30, 2015  . 

59 

The Master Trust Notes are summarized below:   

   (1)    The effective interest rates include amortization of debt discount and amortization of deferred financing costs calculated for the three months ended   June 30, 2015   based on the average principal balance outstanding during the period. 
   (2)    Represents the individual series stated interest rate as of   June 30, 2015   and the weighted average stated rate of the Master Trust Notes, based on the outstanding principal balances as of   June 30, 2015  . 
  As of   June 30, 2015  , the Master Trust 2014 notes were secured by   957   owned and financed properties securing mortgage loans issued by five indirect wholly-owned special purpose entity subsidiaries of the Corporation. The notes issued under Master Trust 2014 are cross-collateralized by the assets of all issuers within this trust. As of   June 30, 2015  , the Master Trust 2013 notes were secured by   315   owned and financed properties issued by a single indirect wholly-owned special purpose entity subsidiary of the Corporation.  
  Convertible Notes  
  The Convertible Notes are comprised of two series of notes with an aggregate principal amount of   $747.5 million   at both   June 30, 2015   and   December 31, 2014  . Interest on the Convertible Notes is payable semiannually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year. The 2019 Notes, aggregate principal amount   $402.5 million  , accrue interest at   2.875%   and are scheduled to mature on   May 15, 2019  . The 2021 Notes, aggregate principal amount   $345.0 million  , accrue interest at   3.75%   and are scheduled to mature on   May 15, 2021  . As of   June 30, 2015  , the carrying amount of the Convertible Notes was   $684.1 million  , which is net of discounts (for the value of the embedded conversion feature) and capitalized deferred financing costs. 
  Holders may convert notes of either series prior to November 15, 2018, in the case of the 2019 Notes, or November 15, 2020, in the case of the 2021 Notes, only under the following circumstances: (1) if the closing price of our common stock for each of at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the last 30 consecutive trading days in the quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price for the Convertible Notes; (2) during the five business day period after any 10 consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of the Convertible Notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than 98% of the product of the last closing price of our common stock and the conversion rate for the Convertible Notes; (3) if we call any or all of the Convertible Notes for redemption prior to the redemption date; or (4) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events as described in the Convertible Notes prospectus supplement. On or after November 15, 2018, in the case of the 2019 Notes, or November 15, 2020, in the case of the 2021 Notes, until the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date of the Convertible Notes, holders may convert the Convertible Notes of the applicable series at any time, regardless of the foregoing circumstances. Upon conversion, we will pay or deliver cash, shares of common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock, at our election. 
    
  The initial conversion rate for the Convertible Notes is 76.3636 shares of common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $13.10 per share of common stock). The conversion rate for each series of the Convertible Notes is subject to adjustment for some events including dividends paid in excess  
  
   60 

of threshold amounts stipulated in the agreement, but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid interest. If we undergo a fundamental change (as defined in the Convertible Notes supplemental indentures), holders may require us to repurchase all or any portion of their notes at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased, plus     accrued and unpaid interest. 
    
  2015 Credit Facility 
    
  On March 31, 2015, the Operating Partnership entered into the Credit Agreement establishing a new $600.0 million unsecured credit facility and terminated its secured $400.0 million 2013 Credit Facility. The 2015 Credit Facility matures on March 31, 2019 (extendable at the Operating Partnership's option to March 31, 2020, subject to satisfaction of certain requirements). The facility includes an accordion feature to increase the committed size to up to $1.0 billion, subject to satisfying certain requirements and obtaining additional lender commitments. A $50.0 million sublimit for swingline loans and up to $60.0 million for issuances of letters of credit is also available. Swingline loans and letters of credit reduce availability under the 2015 Credit Facility on a dollar-for-dollar basis. 
    
  At the election of the Operating Partnership, the 2015 Credit Facility initially bears interest at our current leverage grid pricing equal to either LIBOR plus 1.40% to 1.90% per annum, or a specified base rate plus 0.40% to 0.90% per annum. In each case, the applicable rates depend on our leverage ratio. If the Corporation obtains an investment grade rating of its senior unsecured long-term indebtedness of at least BBB- or Baa3 from S P or Moody's, respectively, the Operating Partnership may make an irrevocable election to change the grid pricing for the 2015 Credit Facility from leverage based to credit rating based pricing. Upon such an event, the 2015 Credit Facility will bear interest at a rate equal to either LIBOR plus 0.875% to 1.55% per annum. In each case, the applicable borrowing margin depends on the credit rating for the Corporation. 
    
  The Operating Partnership is initially required to pay a fee on the unused portion of the 2015 Credit Facility at a rate equal to either 0.15% or 0.25% per annum, based on percentage thresholds for the average daily amount by which the aggregate amount of the revolving credit commitment exceeds the aggregate principal amount of advances during a fiscal quarter. If the Corporation converts to credit rating based pricing, the Operating Partnership will instead be required to pay a facility fee in an amount equal to the aggregate revolving credit commitments (whether or not utilized) multiplied by a rate equal to 0.125% to 0.30% per annum, depending on the credit rating for the Corporation. 
  The Operating Partnership may voluntarily prepay the 2015 Credit Facility, in whole or in part, at any time, without premium or penalty, but subject to applicable LIBOR breakage fees, if any. Payment of the 2015 Credit Facility is unconditionally guaranteed by the Corporation and certain of its existing and future subsidiaries that are not currently securing or anticipated to secure other indebtedness. The 2015 Credit Facility is full recourse to the Operating Partnership and the aforementioned guarantors.  
    
  As of   June 30, 2015  ,   $20.0 million   of borrowings were outstanding,   $18.0 million   of letters of credit were issued and   $562.0 million   of borrowing capacity was available under the 2015 Credit Facility. Amounts available for borrowing under the 2015 Credit Facility remain subject to compliance with certain customary restrictive covenants including: 

Maximum leverage ratio (defined as consolidated total indebtedness plus the Corporation s pro rata share of indebtedness of unconsolidated affiliates, net of certain cash and cash equivalents, to total asset value) of 0.60:1.00; 
                
    Minimum fixed charge coverage ratio (defined as EBITDA) plus the Corporation s pro rata share of EBITDA of unconsolidated affiliates, to fixed charges) of 1.50:1.00; 
                
    Maximum secured indebtedness leverage ratio (defined as consolidated secured indebtedness plus the Corporation s pro rata share of secured indebtedness of unconsolidated affiliates, net of certain cash and cash equivalents, to total asset value) of 0.50:1:00; 
                
    Minimum unsecured interest coverage ratio (defined as consolidated net operating income from unencumbered properties to unsecured interest expense) of 1.75:1.00; 
                
    Maximum unencumbered leverage ratio (defined as consolidated unsecured indebtedness plus the Corporation s pro rata share of unsecured indebtedness of unconsolidated affiliates, net of certain cash and cash equivalents, to total unencumbered asset value) of 0.60:1:00; and 
                
    Minimum tangible net worth of at least $3.01 billion plus 75% of the net proceeds of equity issuances by the Corporation or the Operating Partnership after December 31, 2014. 
       
  In addition to these covenants, the Credit Agreement also includes other customary affirmative and negative covenants, such as (i) limitation on liens and negative pledges; (ii) transactions with affiliates; (iii) limitation on mergers,  
  
   61 

consolidations and sales of all or substantially all assets; (iv) maintenance of status as a REIT and listing on any national securities exchange; and (v) material modifications to organizational documents.  
    
  As of   June 30, 2015  , the Corporation and the Operating Partnership were in compliance with these covenants.  
  2013 Credit Facility  
    
  On March 31, 2015, the 2013 Credit Facility was terminated and its outstanding borrowings of $130.0 million were repaid with funds drawn on the 2015 Credit Facility. Properties securing this facility became unencumbered upon its termination.  
  Line of Credit  
  As of   June 30, 2015  , the Line of Credit was undrawn and   $40.0 million   of borrowing capacity was available.  
    
  CMBS  
    
  We may use long-term, fixed-rate debt to finance our properties on a  match-funded  basis. In such events, we generally seek to use asset level financing that bears annual interest less than the annual rent on the related lease(s) and that matures prior to the expiration of such lease(s). In general, the obligor of our asset level debt is a special purpose entity that holds the real estate and other collateral securing the indebtedness. Each special purpose entity is a bankruptcy remote separate legal entity, and is the sole owner of its assets and solely responsible for its liabilities other than typical non-recurring covenants.  
    
  As of   June 30, 2015  , we had   166   loans with approximately   $1.62 billion   of outstanding principal balances under our fixed and variable-rate CMBS loans, with a weighted average contractual interest rate of   5.78%   and a weighted average maturity of   2.9   years. Most of this debt is partially amortizing and requires a balloon payment at maturity. These balances include   four   separate fixed-rate CMBS loans that are in default due to the underperformance of the   ten   properties that secure them. As of   June 30, 2015  , the aggregate principal balance under the defaulted CMBS loans was   $79.0 million  , including   $5.7 million   of interest added to principal. We believe the value of these properties is less than the related debt. As a result, we have notified the servicers of the indebtedness that the special purpose entity owners anticipate surrendering these properties to them or selling the properties under their direction in exchange for extinguishment of the indebtedness for which these properties secure as collateral. Excluding these   four   loans, the outstanding principal obligations under our CMBS fixed and variable-rate loans as of   June 30, 2015   was   $1.54 billion  . 
    
  The table below shows the outstanding principal obligations of these CMBS fixed and variable-rate loans as of   June 30, 2015   and the year in which the loans mature. The information displayed in the table excludes amounts and interest rates related to the defaulted loans and the   ten   properties securing them.  

(    1)    The interest rate range includes the current hedged fixed rate for variable-rate loans.  
   (2)    Excluding loans maturing in 2015, the scheduled principal will amortize subsequent to   June 30, 2015   until the maturity date of the loans. 
    
  CMBS Liquidity Matters 
    
  During the second quarter of 2015, cash reserves totaling approximately $18.0 million, including interest, were held in lender controlled/managed accounts as additional security for a certain CMBS loan. The reserve balance included an $8.0 million Additional Collateral Deposit requirement following an amended loan agreement in 2012. During 2014, when the collateral tenant did not achieve certain financial performance covenants contained in the amended loan  
  
   62 

agreement, the servicer notified the borrower that conditions existed under these covenants that permit the servicer to retain Excess Cash as additional deposited collateral beginning as of September 30, 2013.  
    
  Pursuant to the amended loan agreement, we are permitted to issue a letter of credit for the amount of cash held as Additional Collateral Deposit. In 2015, certain loan covenants which would permit the borrower to terminate the cash sweep trigger event period were achieved, including; the long-term debt of the Corporation was rated at or above "BB" by S P, the collateral tenant continued to significantly exceed the financial performance requirements and no event of default existed under the amended loan agreement. As a result, pursuant to a consent agreement with the loan servicer, entered into in the second quarter of 2015, we were now permitted to issue a letter of credit for the amount of reserves held as Excess Cash and the servicer will allow future Excess Cash to be disbursed to us. However, until the Corporation's long-term debt is rated at or above "Ba2" by Moody's, the cash sweep triggering event period continues and the Corporation must guarantee the Excess Cash of approximately $15.0 million for the remainder of the loan term.  
    
  In June 2015, we posted two letters of credit aggregating approximately $18.0 million for the lender reserves retained for both the Additional Collateral Deposit and Excess Cash. The lender released these funds prior to the end of the second quarter of 2015.  
    
  As of   June 30, 2015  , we are in default on four separate CMBS loans due to the underperformance of the properties securing these loans. The wholly-owned special purpose entities subject to these mortgage loans are separate legal entities and the sole owner of their assets and responsible for their liabilities. The aggregate outstanding principal balance of these loans, including capitalized interest, totaled   $79.0 million  . We believe the value of these properties is less than the related debt. As a result, we have notified the lenders of each special purpose entity that we anticipate either surrendering these properties to the lenders or selling them in certain instances in exchange for relieving the indebtedness, including any accrued interest, encumbering them.  
    
  The following table provides key elements of the defaulted mortgage loans (dollars in thousands): 

(1)    Interest capitalized to principal or accrued that remains unpaid. 
   (2)    Represents restricted cash controlled by the lender that may be applied to reduce the outstanding principal balance.  
   (3)    Weighted average interest rate. 
    
  Debt Maturities     
  Future principal payments due on our various types of debt as of   June 30, 2015   (in thousands):  

(1)      The CMBS - fixed-rate payment balance in 2015 includes   $79.0 million   including $5.7 million of capitalized interest, for the acceleration of principal payable following an event of default under   four   separate CMBS loans with stated maturities in 2015 and 2017. 
  
   63 

Contractual Obligations    
  There were no material changes outside the ordinary course of business to the information regarding specified contractual obligations contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2014  , as filed with the SEC.  
  We may enter into commitments to purchase goods and services in connection with the operations of our properties. Those commitments generally have terms of one-year or less and reflect expenditure levels comparable to our historical expenditures.  
  Distribution Policy    
  Distributions from our current or accumulated earnings and profits are generally classified as ordinary income, whereas distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits, to the extent of a stockholder s federal income tax basis in our common stock, are generally characterized as a return of capital. Distributions in excess of a stockholder s federal income tax basis in our common stock are generally characterized as capital gain.  
  We are required to distribute 90% of our taxable income (subject to certain adjustments and excluding net capital gain) on an annual basis to maintain qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes and are required to pay federal income tax at regular corporate rates to the extent we distribute less than 100% of our taxable income (including capital gains).  
  We intend to make distributions that will enable us to meet the distribution requirements applicable to REITs and to eliminate or minimize our obligation to pay corporate-level federal income and excise taxes.  
    
  Any distributions will be at the sole discretion of our board of directors, and their form, timing and amount, if any, will depend upon a number of factors, including our actual and projected results of operations, FFO, liquidity, cash flows and financial condition, the revenue we actually receive from our properties, our operating expenses, our debt service requirements, our capital expenditures, prohibitions and other limitations under our financing arrangements, our REIT taxable income, the annual REIT distribution requirements, applicable law and such other factors as our board of directors deems relevant.  

Cash Flows  
  Comparison of   Six Months   Ended   June 30, 2015   to   Six Months   Ended   June 30, 2014    
    
  The following table presents a summary of our cash flows for the   six months ended     June 30, 2015   and   June 30, 2014  , respectively:  

As of   June 30, 2015  , we had   $39.7 million   of cash and cash equivalents as compared to   $176.2 million   as of   December 31, 2014  . 
  Operating Activities 
  Our cash flows from operating activities are primarily dependent upon the occupancy level of our portfolio, the rental rates specified in our leases, the collectability of rent and the level of our operating expenses and other general and administrative costs. 
  The increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to a decrease in debt extinguishment costs of   $55.4 million  , an increase in cash revenue of   $29.0 million   and prior year restructuring charges related to our Exchange Offer of   $13.0 million  .  
  
   64 

The increase in revenue was primarily attributable to the acquisition of   319   properties, representing an investment in real estate during the twelve months ended   June 30, 2015   totaling   $1.16 billion  , offset slightly by the disposition of   88   properties during the same period with an investment value of   $447.9 million  .  
  Investing Activities 
  Cash used in investing activities is generally used to fund property acquisitions, for investments in loans receivable and, to a limited extent, for capital expenditures. Cash provided by investing activities generally relates to the disposition of real estate and other assets. 
  Net cash used in investing activities during the   six months ended     June 30, 2015   included   $547.5 million   to fund the acquisition of   148   properties (  62   of which were acquired through a   $172.1 million   non-cash 1031 Exchange) partially offset by cash proceeds of   $341.0 million   from the disposition of   57   properties (  23   of which were disposed of through a   $212.1 million   1031 Exchange). Net cash used in investing activities also included the release of sales proceeds from restricted cash accounts of   $43.4 million   and collections of principal on loans receivable and real estate assets under direct financing leases totaling   $2.9 million   partially offset by investment in loans receivable of   $4.0 million  .  
  During the same period in   2014  , net cash used in investing activities included   $363.6 million   to fund the acquisition of   190   properties (  14   of which were acquired through a   $20.8 million   non-cash 1031 Exchange) and transfers of sales proceeds to restricted cash accounts of   $13.1 million   partially offset by proceeds from property dispositions of   $14.2 million   and collections of principal on loans receivable and real estate assets under direct financing leases of   $3.3 million  .  
  Financing Activities 
  Generally, our net cash used in and provided by financing activities is impacted by our net borrowings and common stock offerings, including sales of our common stock under our ATM Program, and issuances of net-lease mortgage notes under our Spirit Master Funding Program. 
  Net cash used in financing activities during the   six months ended     June 30, 2015   was primarily attributable to repayment of our indebtedness of   $321.9 million  , and the payment of dividends to equity owners of   $141.2 million  , both of which were paid primarily through sources from our operating cash flows and net borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facilities of   $4.8 million  .     These amounts were partially offset by the issuance and sale of 23.0 million shares of our common stock in an underwritten public offering and the sale of   6.6 million   shares of our common stock under our ATM Program for aggregate net proceeds of   $347.3 million  .  
  During the same period in   2014  , net cash provided by financing activities was comprised of borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facilities of   $405.5 million   and borrowings of mortgages and notes payable of   $757.5 million  , partially offset by repayment of our indebtedness of   $979.0 million   and dividends paid to equity owners of   $123.2 million  . 

Non-GAAP Financial Measures  
  FFO and AFFO 
  We calculate FFO in accordance with the standards established by NAREIT. FFO represents net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding real estate-related depreciation and amortization, impairment charges and net losses (gains) from property dispositions. FFO is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure. We use FFO as a supplemental performance measure because we believe that FFO is beneficial to investors as a starting point in measuring our operational performance. Specifically, in excluding real estate-related depreciation and amortization, gains and losses from property dispositions and impairment charges, which do not relate to or are not indicative of operating performance, FFO provides a performance measure that, when compared year-over-year, captures trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs. We also believe that, as a widely recognized measure of the performance of equity REITs, FFO will be used by investors as a basis to compare our operating performance with that of other equity REITs. However, because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization and does not capture the changes in the value of our properties that result from use or market conditions, all of which have real economic effects and could materially impact our results from operations, the utility of FFO as a measure of our performance is limited. In addition, other equity REITs may not calculate FFO as we do, and, accordingly, our FFO may not be comparable to such other equity REITs  FFO.  
  AFFO is a non-GAAP financial measure of operating performance used by many companies in the REIT industry. We adjust FFO to eliminate the impact of certain items that we believe are not indicative of our core operating performance,

including merger and finance restructuring costs, default interest on non-recourse mortgage indebtedness, debt extinguishment gains (losses), transaction costs incurred in connection with the acquisition of real estate investments subject to existing leases and certain non-cash items. These certain non-cash items include non-cash revenues (comprised of straight-line rents, amortization of above and below market rent on our leases, amortization of lease incentives, amortization of net premium (discount) on loans receivable and amortization of capitalized lease transaction costs), non-cash interest expense (comprised of amortization of deferred financing costs and amortization of net debt discount/premium) and non-cash compensation expense (stock-based compensation expense). In addition, other equity REITs may not calculate AFFO as we do, and, accordingly, our AFFO may not be comparable to such other equity REITs' AFFO. 
  FFO and AFFO should not be used as a measure of our liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions or service indebtedness. FFO and AFFO also should not be used as a supplement to or substitute for cash flow from operating activities computed in accordance with GAAP. A reconciliation of net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP) to FFO and AFFO is included in the financial information accompanying this report. 
  Adjusted EBITDA and Annualized Adjusted EBITDA 
    
  Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA modified to include other adjustments to GAAP net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders for real estate acquisition costs, impairment losses, gains/losses from the sale of real estate and debt transactions and other items that we do not consider to be indicative of our on-going operating performance. We exclude these items as they are not key drivers in our investment decision making process. We focus our business plans to enable us to sustain increasing shareholder value. Accordingly, we believe that excluding these items, which are not key drivers of our investment decisions and may cause short-term fluctuations in net income, but are not indicative of overall long-term operating performance, provides a useful supplemental measure to investors and analysts in assessing the net earnings contribution of our real estate portfolio. Because these measures do not represent net income (loss) that is computed in accordance with GAAP, they should not be considered alternatives to net income (loss) or as an indicator of financial performance.  
  Annualized Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by multiplying Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter by four. Our computation of Adjusted EBITDA and Annualized Adjusted EBITDA may differ from the methodology used by other equity REITs to calculate these measures, and, therefore, may not be comparable to such other REITs. A reconciliation of net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders (computed in accordance with GAAP) to EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Annualized Adjusted EBITDA is included in the financial information accompanying this report. 
  Adjusted Debt  
  Adjusted Debt represents interest bearing debt (reported in accordance with GAAP) adjusted to exclude unamortized debt discount/premium and deferred financing costs, as further reduced for cash and cash equivalents as well as cash collateral deposits retained by lenders. By excluding unamortized debt discount/premium and deferred financing costs, cash and cash equivalents, and cash collateral deposits retained by lenders, the result provides an estimate of the contractual amount of borrowed capital to be repaid, net of cash available to repay it. We believe this calculation constitutes a beneficial supplemental non-GAAP financial disclosure to investors in understanding our financial condition. 
  Adjusted Debt to Annualized Adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure we use to evaluate the level of borrowed capital being used to increase the potential return of our real estate investments, and a proxy for a measure we believe is used by many lenders and ratings agencies to evaluate our ability to repay and service our debt obligations over time. We believe the ratio is a beneficial disclosure to investors as a supplemental means of evaluating our ability to meet obligations senior to those of our equity holders. Our computation of may differ from the methodology used by other equity REITs, and, therefore, may not be comparable to such other REITs. A reconciliation of interest bearing debt (reported in accordance with GAAP) to Adjusted Debt is included in the financial information accompanying this report. 
  
   66 

Initial Cash Yield 
    
  We calculate initial cash yield from properties by dividing the annualized first month base rent (excluding any future rent escalations provided for in the lease) by the gross investment in the related properties. Gross investment for an acquired property represents gross acquisition costs including the contracted purchase price and related capitalized transaction costs. Initial cash yield is a measure (expressed as a percentage) of the contractual cash rent expected to be earned on an acquired property in the first year. Because it excludes any future rent increases or additional rent that may be contractually provided for in the lease, as well as any other income or fees that may be earned from lease modifications or asset dispositions, initial cash yield does not represent the annualized investment rate of return of our acquired properties. Additionally, actual contractual cash rent earned from the properties acquired may differ from the initial cash yield based on other factors, including difficulties collecting anticipated rental revenues and unanticipated expenses at these properties that we cannot pass on to tenants, as well as the risk factors set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2014  .

FFO and AFFO 
    
  The following is a reconciliation of net income (loss) (which we believe is the most comparable GAAP measure) to FFO and AFFO. Also presented is information regarding distributions paid to common stockholders and the weighted average shares of common stock outstanding used for the basic and diluted computations per share, as restated (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts): 

(1)      Includes amounts related to discontinued operations. 
   (2)      Assumes the issuance of potentially issuable shares unless the result would be anti-dilutive. 
   (3)       For the three months ended   June 30, 2015   and   2014  , dividends paid to unvested restricted stockholders of $0.2 million and $0.3 million, respectively, and for the   six months ended     June 30, 2015   and   2014  , dividends paid to unvested restricted stockholders of $0.4 million and $0.7 million, respectively, are deducted from net income attributable to common stockholders, FFO and AFFO in the computation of per share amounts (see Note 14).

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
  We are exposed to financial market risks, especially interest rate risk. Interest rates and other factors, such as occupancy, rental rates and the financial condition of our tenants, influence our performance more so than does inflation. Changes in interest rates do not necessarily correlate with inflation rates or changes in inflation rates. As described above, we generally offer leases that provide for payments of base rent with scheduled increases, based on a fixed amount or the lesser of a multiple of the increase in the CPI over a specified period term or fixed percentage and, to a lesser extent, contingent rent based on a percentage of the tenant s gross sales to help mitigate the effect of inflation. Because the properties in our portfolio are generally leased to tenants under triple-net leases, where the tenant is responsible for property operating costs and expenses, our exposure to rising property operating costs due to inflation is mitigated.  
  Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary policies, domestic and global economic and political conditions, and other factors which are beyond our control. Our operating results will depend heavily on the difference between the revenue from our assets and the interest expense incurred on our borrowings. We may incur additional variable rate debt in the future, including amounts that we may borrow under our revolving credit facilities. In addition, decreases in interest rates may lead to additional competition for the acquisition of real estate due to a reduction in desirable alternative income-producing investments. Increased competition for the acquisition of real estate may lead to a decrease in the yields on real estate we have targeted for acquisition. In such circumstances, if we are not able to offset the decrease in yields by obtaining lower interest costs on our borrowings, our results of operations will be adversely affected. Significant increases in interest rates may also have an adverse impact on our earnings if we are unable to acquire real estate with rental rates high enough to offset the increase in interest rates on our borrowings.  
  In the event interest rates rise significantly or there is an economic downturn, defaults may increase and result in credit losses, which may adversely affect our liquidity and operating results. In a decreasing interest rate environment, borrowers are generally more likely to prepay their loans in order to obtain financing at lower interest rates. However, the vast majority of our mortgage notes payable have prepayment clauses that make refinancing during a decreasing interest rate environment uneconomical. Investments in our mortgage loans receivable, however, have significant prepayment protection in the form of yield maintenance provisions, which provide us with substantial yield protection in a decreasing interest rate environment with respect to this portion of our investment portfolio.   
  The objective of our interest rate risk management policy is to match fund fixed-rate assets with fixed-rate liabilities. As of   June 30, 2015  , our assets were primarily long-term, fixed-rate leases (though most have scheduled rental increases during the terms of the leases). As of   June 30, 2015  , approximately   $4.0 billion   of our indebtedness consisted of long-term, fixed-rate obligations, consisting primarily of our Master Trust Notes, fixed-rate CMBS loans and Convertible Notes. As of   June 30, 2015  , the weighted average stated interest rate of fixed-rate obligations, excluding amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts/premiums, was approximately   5.04%  . As of   June 30, 2015  , approximately   $88.3 million   of our indebtedness consisted of variable-rate obligations, consisting primarily of our 2015 Credit Facility and hedged variable-rate CMBS loans. As of   June 30, 2015  , the weighted average stated interest rate of our variable-rate obligations, excluding amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts/premiums, was approximately   3.17%  . With respect to the   $20.0 million   outstanding under our 2015 Credit Facility and for the unhedged portion of our variable-rate obligations, if one-month LIBOR as of   June 30, 2015   increased by 100 basis points, or 1.0%, the resulting increase in annual interest expense would impact our future earnings and cash flows by   $0.2 million  . 
  We intend to continue our practice of employing interest rate derivative contracts, such as interest rate swaps and futures, to reduce our exposure, on specific transactions or on a portfolio basis, to changes in cash flows as a result of interest rate changes. We do not intend to enter into derivative contracts for speculative or trading purposes. We generally intend to utilize derivative instruments to hedge interest rate risk on our liabilities and not use derivatives for other purposes, such as hedging asset-related risks. Hedging transactions, however, may generate income which is not qualified income for purposes of maintaining our REIT status. We intend to structure any hedging transactions in a manner that does not jeopardize our status as a REIT.  
  Even with hedging strategies in place, there can be no assurance that our results of operations will remain unaffected as a result of changes in interest rates. In addition, hedging transactions using derivative instruments involve additional risks such as counterparty credit risk and basis risk. Basis risk in a hedging contract occurs when the index upon which the contract is based is more or less variable than the index upon which the hedged asset or liability is based, thereby making the hedge less effective. We address basis risk by matching, to a reasonable extent, the contract index to the index upon which the hedged asset or liability is based. Our interest rate risk management policy addresses counterparty  
  
   70 

credit risk (the risk of nonperformance by counterparties) by requiring that we deal only with major financial institutions that we deem credit worthy.  
  The estimated fair values of our Revolving Credit Facilities, fixed-rate and variable-rate mortgages and notes payable and Convertible Notes have been derived based on market quotes for comparable instruments or discounted cash flow analysis using estimates of the amount and timing of future cash flows, market rates and credit spreads.  
  The following table discloses the fair value information for these financial instruments as of   June 30, 2015   (in thousands):  

(1)    The carrying value of the debt instruments are net of unamortized deferred financing costs and certain debt discounts/premiums. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
    
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  
  Prior to the filing of the Original Filing, an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act, as of June 30, 2015. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the design and operation of these disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report.  
  As disclosed in Item 9A of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, filed concurrently with this Form 10-Q/A, the Company failed to design controls over the review of the accounting for real estate asset dispositions; specifically, the allocation of a portion of the Company's goodwill to the carrying amount of assets sold or held for sale when determining the gain or loss on sale to be recognized for sold assets or the amount, if any, of impairment losses to be recognized for assets held for sale.  
  Management became aware of this material weakness in internal control over financial reporting and took immediate actions to remediate the material weakness.  The Company will initiate robust controls over the proper application of GAAP in accounting for goodwill related to the disposal of assets and in allocating goodwill to held for sale assets in determining the amount, if any, for impairment charges. The Company currently expects to have this material weakness remediated no later than December 31, 2016. 
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  
    
  Except as noted in the preceding paragraph, there were no changes to our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended   June 30, 2015   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
