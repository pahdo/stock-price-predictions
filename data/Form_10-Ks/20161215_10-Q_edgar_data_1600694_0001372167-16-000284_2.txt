ITEM 1. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

ADAMAS VENTURES, INC.  

  NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

 (Unaudited) 

Note 1: Organization and Basis of Presentation  

Adamas Ventures, Inc. (the  Company ) is a for
profit corporation established under the corporation laws in the State of Nevada, United States of America on January 31, 2014. 

The Company is in the development phase and intends to sell
baby products. As such, the Company is subject to all risks inherent to the establishment of a start-up business enterprise. 

Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included
in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( U.S. GAAP ) have
been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. In our opinion, these financial statements include all adjustments
(consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) necessary for the fair statement of the results for the period. These financial
statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements for the six months ended July 31, 2016. Unless the context
otherwise requires, all references to  Adamas Ventures,   we,   us,   our  or the
 company  are to Adamas Ventures, Inc. and any subsidiaries. 

Note 2: Recent Accounting Pronouncements  

In December 2011, the FASB issued ASU 2011-11, Disclosures
about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities, ( ASU 2011-11 ). ASU 2011-11 requires an entity to disclose both gross information
and net information about both instruments and transactions eligible for offset in the statement of financial position and instruments
and transactions subject to an agreement similar to a master netting arrangement. ASU 2011- 11 is effective for annual reporting
periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013, and interim periods within those annual periods. Retrospective disclosure is required
for all comparative periods presented. The adoption of ASU 2011-11 did not have a material impact on the Company s financial
statements. In October 2012, the FASB issued ASU No. 2012-04, Technical Corrections and Improvements, ( ASU 2012-04 ).
This update includes source literature amendments, guidance clarification, reference corrections and relocated guidance affecting
a variety of topics in the Codification. The update also includes conforming amendments to the Codification to reflect ASC 820 s
fair value measurement and disclosure requirements. The amendments in this update that will not have transition guidance are effective
upon issuance. The amendments in this update that are subject to the transition guidance will be effective for fiscal periods beginning
after December 15, 2012. The adoption of ASU 2012-04 did not have a material impact on the Company s financial statements. 

In January 2013, the FASB issued ASU No. 2013-01, Balance Sheet
(Topic 210): Clarifying the Scope of Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities ( ASU 2013-01 ). This update
clarifies that ordinary trade receivables and receivables are not in the scope of ASU No. 2011-11, Balance Sheet (Topic 210): Disclosures
about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities ( ASU 2011-11 ). Specifically, ASU 2011-11 applies only to derivatives, repurchase
agreements and reverse purchase agreements, and securities borrowing and securities lending transactions that are either offset
in accordance with specific criteria contained in the FASB Accounting Standards Codification or subject to a master netting arrangement
or similar agreement. The Company is required to apply the amendments in ASU 2013-01 beginning January 1, 2013. The adoption of
ASU 2013-01 by the Company did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 

In February 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
issued Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, 2013-02, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220), Reporting of Amounts Reclassified Out of
Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income. This update requires companies to provide information regarding the amounts reclassified
out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component. In addition, companies are required to present, either on the face
of the statement where net income is presented or in the accompanying notes, significant amounts reclassified out of accumulated
other comprehensive income by the respective line items of net income. ASU 2013-02 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning
on or after December 15, 2012, and interim periods within those annual periods. ASU 2013-02 was adopted January 1, 2013 and did
not have a significant impact on our financial statements. 

Note 3: Concentrations  

The company has not had any sales. 

Note 4: Legal Matters  

The Company has no known legal issues pending. 

Note 5: Debt  

The Company has no debt.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)  

Note 6: Capital Stock  

On January 31, 2014 the Company authorized 75,000,000 shares
of commons stock with a par value of $0.0001 per share. 

On January 31, 2014 the Company issued 20,000,000 shares of
common stock for a purchase price of $0.0001 per share to its founding shareholder. The Company received aggregate gross proceeds
of $10,000.00. 

During the period of May and June, 2015, the Company issued
10,000,000 shares of common stocks for a purchase price of $0.01 per share for gross proceeds of $100,000. 

As of July 31, 2016 there were no outstanding stock options
or warrants. 

Note 7: Income Taxes  

The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting
for income taxes in accordance with ASC Topic 740,  Income Taxes.  Under this method, income tax expense is recognized
for the amount of: (i) taxes payable or refundable for the current year and (ii) deferred tax consequences of temporary differences
resulting from matters that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns. Deferred tax assets
and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates
is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is provided to
reduce the deferred tax assets reported if based on the weight of the available positive and negative evidence, it is more likely
than not some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. 

ASC Topic 740.10.30 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty
in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement
attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.
ASC Topic 740.10.40 provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods,
disclosure, and transition. 

Note 8: Related Party Transactions  

The Company neither owns nor leases any real or personal property.
The sole officer of the Company provides office space and services free of charge. The Company's sole officer and director is involved
in other business activities and may in the future, become involved in other business opportunities as they become available. 

Note 9: Subsequent Events  

The Company has evaluated events subsequent through the date
these financial statements have been issued to assess the need for potential recognition or disclosure in this report. Such events
were evaluated through the date these financial statements were available to be issued. Based upon this evaluation, it was determined
that no subsequent events occurred that require recognition or disclosure in the financial statements. 

Note 10: Going Concern  

The accompanying financial statements and notes have been prepared
assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. 

For the period ended July 31, 2016, the Company had an accumulated
deficit of $9,830 and working capital of $100,915, which may not be sufficient to sustain operations over the next 12 months. The
Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company s ability to generate sufficient revenues
to operate profitably or raise additional capital through debt financing and/or through sales of common stock. 

Management plans to fund operations of the Company through
the proceeds from an offering pursuant to a Registration Statement on Form S-1 or private placements of restricted securities or
the issuance of stock in lieu of cash for payment of services until such a time as profitable operations are achieved. There are
no written agreements in place for such funding or issuance of securities and there can be no assurance that such will be available
in the future. Management believes that this plan provides an opportunity for the Company to continue as a going concern. 

The failure to achieve the necessary levels of profitability
or obtain the additional funding would be detrimental to the Company.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

This quarterly report contains forward-looking statements.
These statements relate to future events or our future financial performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements
by terminology such as  may ,  should ,  expects ,  plans ,  anticipates ,  believes ,
 estimates ,  predicts ,  potential  or  continue  or the negative of these terms or other
comparable terminology. These statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors
that may cause our or our industry's actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different
from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements.
Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future
results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. Except as required by applicable law, including the securities laws of
the United States, we do not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform these statements to actual results. 

The following discussion and analysis provides information
which management of  ADAMAS VENTURES, INC.  (the  Company ) believes to be relevant to an assessment and
understanding of the Company's results of operations and financial condition. This discussion should be read together with the
Company's financial statements and the notes to financial statements, which are included in this report. 

Caution About Forward-Looking Statements  

This management's discussion and analysis or plan of operation
should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto of the Company for the quarter ended July 31, 2016. 

This section includes a number of forward-looking statements
that reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance. Forward-looking statements are often identified
by words like: believe, expect, estimate, anticipate, intend, project and similar expressions, or words which, by their nature,
refer to future events. You should not place undue certainty on these forward-looking statements, which apply only as of the date
of this prospectus. These forward-looking statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results
to differ materially from historical results or our predictions. 

General Overview  

We are a development stage company and plan to operate in the
distribution of baby products. We plan to market and distribute an assortment of high quality baby products in the Central and
South American markets. Our products will include cribs, strollers, clothing, shoes, bottles, bibs, blankets, and toys. Some of
our baby products will be designed as part of a series, meaning they will be designed and made in the same color-scheme and style.
We intend to purchase baby products from manufacturers in China, ship them to Central and South America and sell the products directly
to retailers. We are identifying potential manufacturers, shipping companies and negotiating arrangements for such products and
services. In addition, we are securing office space and developing a website.

ITEM 2 MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)  

Results of Operations  

The Company experienced general and administration expenses
of $nil and $1,250 for the six months ended July 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in general and administration expenses
for this period are attributed to a decrease in professional fees. 

For the six months period ended July 31, 2016, the company
experienced a net loss of $nil compared to a loss of $1,250 for the six months ended July 31, 2015. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

During the three months period ended July 31, 2016, the Company
had no working capital needs. As of July 31, 2016, the Company has cash on hand in the amount of $915. Management does not expect
that the current level of cash on hand will be sufficient to fund our operations for the next twelve month period. In the event
that additional funds are required to maintain operations, our officers and directors have agreed to advance us sufficient capital
to allow us to continue operations. We may also be able to obtain loans from our shareholders, but there are no agreements or understandings
in place currently. 

We believe we will require additional funding to expand our
business and ensure its future profitability. We anticipate that any additional funding will be in the form of equity financing
from the sale of our common stock. However, we do not have any arrangements in place for any future equity financing. In the event
we are not successful in selling our common stock, we may also seek to obtain short-term loans from our director.

Item 3. Quantitative Disclosures about Market Risks  

As a  smaller reporting company , we are not required

Item 4. Controls and Procedures . 

Management's Report on Disclosure Controls and Procedures  

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed
to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,
is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules
and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our president (our principal
executive officer and our principal financial officer and principle accounting officer) to allow for timely decisions regarding
required disclosure. 

As of July 31, 2016, the end of our quarter covered by this report,
we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our president (our principal executive officer
and our principal financial officer and principle accounting officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our
disclosure controls and procedures. Based on the foregoing, our president (our principal executive officer and our principal financial
officer and principle accounting officer) concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of
the period covered by this quarterly report.

reporting that occurred during the quarter ended July 31, 2016 that have materially or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
