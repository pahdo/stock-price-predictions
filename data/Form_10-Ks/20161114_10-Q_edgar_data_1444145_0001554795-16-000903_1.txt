NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

  NOTE 1   BASIS OF PRESENTATION  

 The accompanying unaudited condensed
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
( GAAP ) for interim financial information and with the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
(the  SEC ). Accordingly, these condensed financial statements do not include all of the information and footnotes
required for audited annual financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring
accruals) considered necessary to make the condensed financial statements not misleading have been included. The balance sheet
at December 31, 2015 has been derived from the Company s audited financial statements as of that date. 

 The unaudited condensed financial statements
included herein should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and the notes thereto that are included in
the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 that was filed with the SEC on March 30, 2016.
The results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected
for the full year or any other period. 

  NOTE 2 -- SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

   Use of Estimates   

 The preparation of financial statements
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the balance
sheet and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

   Income Taxes   

 The Company utilizes the liability method
of accounting for income taxes. Under the liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences
between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted tax rates
and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. An allowance against deferred tax assets is recognized
when it is more likely than not that such tax benefits will not be realized. 

   Loss per Common Share   

 Basic loss per share is calculated using
the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during each reporting period. Diluted loss per share includes potentially
dilutive securities such as outstanding options and warrants, using various methods such as the treasury stock or modified treasury
stock method in the determination of dilutive shares outstanding during each reporting period. The Company does not have any potentially
dilutive instruments for this reporting period. 

   New Accounting Pronouncements   

 From time to time new accounting pronouncements
are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other standard setting bodies that may have an impact on the Company s
accounting and reporting. The Company believes that such recently issued accounting pronouncements and other authoritative guidance
for which the effective date is in the future will not have an impact on its accounting or reporting or that such impact will
not be material to its financial position, results of operations and cash flows when implemented. 

NOTE 3 - EQUITY  

 On June 17, 2016, Kai Cheng Tang (the
 Buyer ) acquired 68,812,415 shares (the  New Shares ) of the Company s Common Stock from the Company
for a price of $70,000. The Company used all the proceeds from the sale of the New Shares to pay its outstanding liabilities. 

 The total number of shares of stock
which the Company has authority to issue is one hundred ten million (110,000,000). These shares are divided into two classes with
100,000,000 shares designated as common stock at $.0001 par value (the  Common Stock ) and 10,000,000 shares designated
as preferred stock at $.0001 par value (the  Preferred Stock ). The Preferred Stock of the Company shall be issued
by the Board of Directors of the Company in one or more classes or one or more series within any class and such classes or series
shall have such voting powers, full or limited, or no voting powers, and such designations, preferences, limitations or restrictions
as the Board of Directors of the Company may determine, from time to time. 

 Holders of shares of Common Stock shall
be entitled to cast one vote for each share held at all stockholders  meetings for all purposes, including the election of
directors. The Common Stock does not have cumulative voting rights. No holder of shares of stock of any class shall be entitled
as a matter of right to subscribe for or purchase or receive any part of any new or additional issue of shares of stock of any
class, or of securities convertible into shares of stock of any class, whether now hereafter authorized or whether issued for money,
for consideration other than money, or by way of dividend. 

 As of September 30, 2016, the Company
has no shares of Preferred Stock outstanding and 100,000,000 shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding. 

  NOTE 4   GOING CONCERN  

 The Company s financial statements
have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and settlement of liabilities and commitments
in the normal course of business. We have incurred net losses of approximately $325,745 since inception through September 30, 2016.
At September 30, 2016, we had $0 in cash and $316,719 of other assets and our total liabilities were $100,299. Our ability to continue
as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to obtain the necessary financing to meet our obligations and repay our liabilities
when they become due and to generate sufficient revenues from our operations to pay our operating expenses. 

 We may seek to raise additional funds
through public or private sale of our equity or debt securities, or borrowing funds from private or institutional lenders. In addition
to obtaining necessary financing, the Company has discontinued the demand aggregation business in which the Company was previously
engaged. The Company is developing itself into a real estate company engaged primarily in the acquisition, renovation and resale
of residential real estate properties, including single-family detached homes and condominiums, initially located in the San Francisco
Bay area. 

 There are no assurances that we will
continue as a going concern and the Company s financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from
the outcome of this uncertainty. 

  NOTE 5 - SHAREHOLDER ADVANCES  

 Richard Aland, a former officer and
director of the Company and a shareholder of the Company and a related entity, has advanced to the Company a total of $56,845,
which is payable on demand and non-interest bearing. Such advances consist of $10,962 from Demand Pooling Global Services, LLC
and $45,882 from Richard Aland. Such advances were forgiven in connection with the June 2016 Transactions. 

 Kai Cheng Tang, an officer, director
and shareholder of the Company, has advanced to the Company a total of $10,473, which is payable on demand and non-interest bearing. 

  NOTE 6 - INVESTMENT IN PARTNERSHIP  

 On July 15, 2016, the Buyer contributed
his 8% interest in a residential real estate property in San Francisco to the Company. Since July 14, 2016, the property has been
owned by March XIII 2015 LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ( March XIII ). March XIII is managed by Luxury
Landmarks LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ( Luxury ). Luxury is wholly owned and managed by the Buyer. The
members of March XIII are Luxury, which has a twenty percent (20%) interest, the Company, which has an eight percent (8%) interest,
and an individual outside investor, who has a seventy two percent (72%) interest. Net income of March XIII will be allocated among
the members in accordance with their percentage interests. Distributions will be made to the members in accordance with their
percentage interests, except for liquidating distributions which will be made to the members in accordance with their positive
capital account balances. 

NOTE 7   DISCONTINUED OPERATION  

 As of June 17, 2016, the Buyer has discontinued the demand aggregation
business in which the Company was previously engaged and is developing the Company into a real estate company engaged primarily
in the acquisition, renovation and resale of residential real estate properties, including single-family detached homes and condominiums,
initially located in the San Francisco Bay area. 

The table below represents the statement of operations for the discontinued
operations for the periods indicated: 

The liabilities of the discontinued
operations include a note payable bearing interest at 5% per annum which is due January 4, 2017 which was cancelled in connection
with the June 2016 Transactions (as defined below). In addition, on February 25, 2016, the Company borrowed $25,000 pursuant to
a Secured Promissory Note ( Note ) from the Buyer which is payable upon the earlier to occur of (a) the date on which
a proposed Transaction (as defined in the Note) closes; (b) May 31, 2016; and (c) the date on which the Note is accelerated in
accordance with its terms; provided, however, that if the Transaction does not close due to a failure by the Buyer to perform
its material obligations under such Transaction documents, the Maturity Date will be December 31, 2016. Richard K. Aland, the
Company s CEO, has pledged his shares to secure the payment and performance under the Note. The Note was contributed to
the Company s capital in connection with the June 2016 Transactions. 

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations.   

  Plan of Operations  

 From inception (April 29, 2008), Demand
Pooling, Inc. was organized as a vehicle to investigate and, if such investigation warrants, acquire a target company or business
seeking the perceived advantages of being a publicly held corporation. 

 On June 17, 2016, Kai Cheng Tang (the
 Buyer ) acquired 68,812,415 shares (the  New Shares ) of the Company s Common Stock from the Company
for a price of $70,000.00 or $0.001017258 per share. The Company used all the proceeds from the sale of the New Shares to pay its
outstanding liabilities. At the same time, the Buyer acquired (a) 22,310,000 shares of Common Stock from Richard K. Aland for a
price of $110,747.00 and (b) 3,877,585 shares of Common Stock from Donald Kelly for a price of $19,253.00 (such shares, the  Outstanding
Shares  and collectively with the New Shares, the  Shares  and all such transactions, the  June 2016 Transactions ).
Following the June 2016 Transactions, the Buyer owns 95,000,000 shares of Common Stock or 95.0% of the 100,000,000 issued and outstanding
shares of Common Stock and the holdings of Messrs. Aland and Kelly (together, the  Sellers ) were reduced to 1,461,138
and 231,322 shares of Common Stock, respectively, or an aggregate of approximately 1.69% of the total issued and outstanding shares
of Common Stock. Simultaneously with the Buyer s purchases of the Shares, Mr. Aland resigned as CEO and CFO of the Company
and Mr. Tang was elected to such positions, Mr. Aland resigned from the Company s Board of Directors effective as of the
close of business on July 11, 2016, the size of the Board was increased from one to three and Mr. Tang, Daniel L. Conrad and Philip
S. Lanterman were simultaneously appointed to the Company s Board of Directors effective as of the close of business on July
11, 2016. The foregoing actions represent a change of control of the Company. 

 Prior to the purchases of the Shares,
the Buyer was not affiliated with the Company. However, the Buyer will be deemed an affiliate of the Company after the purchases
of the Shares as a result of his stock ownership interest in the Company. 

 The purchase of the New Shares by the
Buyer was completed pursuant to a written Subscription Agreement with the Company while the purchase of the Outstanding Shares
from Messrs. Aland and Kelly was completed pursuant to a written Stock Purchase Agreement among such persons and the Company. The
purchase of the New Shares was not subject to any other terms and conditions other than the sale of the New Shares in exchange
for the cash payment. The Stock Purchase Agreement contained customary representations and warranties and post-closing covenants
of each party and customary closing conditions. Breaches of the representations and warranties of the Company and the Sellers will
be subject to indemnification provisions limited, except in the case of fraud, to the 1,692,460 shares of Common Stock retained
by the Sellers. 

 On June 17, 2016, the Company and the
Licensor, Demand Pooling Global Services, LLC, terminated the Licensing Agreement in connection with the June 2016 Transaction
described above. There were no early termination penalties incurred by the Company in connection with the termination of the Licensing
Agreement. The Buyer has discontinued the demand aggregation business in which the Company was previously engaged and is developing
the Company into a real estate company engaged primarily in the acquisition, renovation and resale of residential real estate properties,
including single-family detached homes and condominiums, initially located in the San Francisco Bay area. 

   Results of Operations   

   Three
Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2015   

 There was no revenue for
the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. Net loss for three months ended September 30, 2016 was $53,312 compared to
a net loss of $6,061 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in net loss was primarily due to increased general
and administrative expenses during the three month period ended September 30, 2016. 

 General and administrative
expenses for three months ended September 30, 2016 increased by $47,251 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. 

   Nine
Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015   

  Net
loss for nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased to $96,496 compared to a net income of $27,048 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2015. The increase in net loss was primarily due to increased general and administrative expenses.  

 General and administrative
expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased by $120,544 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources   

 As of September 30, 2016, the Company had cash on hand of
$0 and total current liabilities of $100,299. 

 The Company s net losses to date
are primarily attributable to development stage activities. The Company believes that these results will not be characteristic
of the Company s operating results once it develops its real estate business. The Company s future success is therefore
very dependent upon its ability to achieve profitable operations and generate cash from operating activities. 

 We may seek to raise additional funds
through public or private sale of our equity or debt securities, or borrowing funds from private or institutional lenders. If we
raise additional funds through the issuance of debt securities, these securities would have rights that are senior to holders of
our Common Stock and could contain covenants that restrict our operations. Any additional equity financing would likely be substantially
dilutive to our stockholders. In addition, if we raise additional funds through the sale of preferred equity securities, new investors
could have rights superior to our existing stockholders. 

 If we are unable to raise sufficient
additional funds when needed, we would be required to further reduce operating expenses by, among other things, curtailing significantly
or delaying or eliminating part or all of our operations. 

 Our ability to obtain additional financing
is dependent on the state of the debt and/or equity market, and such markets  reception of us and our offering terms. In
addition, our ability to obtain financing may be dependent on the status of our operating activities, which cannot be predicted.
There is no assurance that capital in any form will be available to us, and, if available, that it will be on terms and conditions
that are acceptable. 

   Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements   

 The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements
that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the Company s financial condition, changes in financial
condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to
investors. 

  Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About
Market Risk  

 As a  Smaller Reporting Company 
as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K, this Item is inapplicable. 

  Item 4. Controls and Procedures  

   Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   

 Under the supervision and with the participation
of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, we conducted an evaluation of our
disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), as of September 30, 2016. Based on this evaluation, our principal
executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective
to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and
forms and that our disclosure and controls are not designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports
that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive
officer and principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure. 

The matters involving internal controls and
procedures that our management considered to be material weaknesses under the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board were: (1) lack of a functioning audit committee, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of
required internal controls and procedures; (2) inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives; and (3) ineffective
controls over period end financial disclosure and reporting processes.   

Management believes that the material weaknesses
set forth in items (2) and (3) above did not have an effect on our financial results.  However, management believes that
the lack of a functioning audit committee and the lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors results in
ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures, which could result in a
material misstatement in our financial statements in future periods. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial
Reporting   

There were no changes (including corrective
actions with regard to significant deficiencies or material weaknesses) in our internal controls over financial reporting that
occurred during the third quarter of fiscal 2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our
internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II   OTHER INFORMATION   

  Item 1. Legal Proceedings.  

 To the best knowledge of the Company s
management, the Company is not a party to any legal proceeding or litigation. 

  Item 1A. Risk Factors.  

 There have been no material changes
to our Risk Factors disclosed in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 except as set forth
in Item 8.01 of the Company s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on June 23, 2016.
