SPX CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (Unaudited; in millions, except per share data) 

(1)    
    BASIS OF PRESENTATION 
     Unless otherwise indicated,  we,   us  and  our  mean SPX Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries ( SPX ). 
  We prepared the condensed consolidated financial statements pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) for interim reporting. As permitted under those rules and regulations, certain footnotes or other financial information normally required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ) can be condensed or omitted. The financial statements represent our accounts after the elimination of intercompany transactions and, in our opinion, include the adjustments (consisting only of normal and recurring items) necessary for their fair presentation. 
  Spin-Off of FLOW Business 
  On September 26, 2015 (the  Distribution Date ), we completed the spin-off to our stockholders (the  Spin-Off ) of all the outstanding shares of SPX FLOW, Inc. ( SPX FLOW ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of SPX prior to the Spin-Off, which at the time of the Spin-Off held the businesses comprising our Flow Technology reportable segment, our Hydraulic Technologies business, and certain of our corporate subsidiaries (collectively, the  FLOW Business ). On the Distribution Date, each of our stockholders of record as of the close of business on September 16, 2015 (the  Record Date ) received   one   share of common stock of SPX FLOW for every share of SPX common stock held as of the Record Date. SPX FLOW is now an independent public company trading under the symbol  FLOW  on the New York Stock Exchange. Following the Spin-Off, SPX s common stock continues to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange, but trades under the new ticker symbol  SPXC . 
  The financial results of SPX FLOW for the   three and nine   months ended   September 26, 2015   have been classified as discontinued operations within the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. See Note 3 for additional information regarding discontinued operations. 
  In connection with the Spin-Off, SPX and SPX FLOW entered into several administrative agreements covering various services, such as information technology, human resources and finance, to be provided by each party for a period of up to 12 months following the Distribution Date. These services ceased during the third quarter of 2016. The financial activity associated with these agreements was not material to our condensed consolidated financial results for the   three and nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  . 
  Sale of Dry Cooling Business 
  On March 30, 2016, we completed the sale of our dry cooling business, a business within our Power reportable segment, to Paharpur Cooling Towers Limited ( Paharpur ) for cash proceeds of   $45.9   (net of cash transferred with the business of   $3.0  ). During the third quarter of 2016, we reached an agreement with Paharpur regarding the final working capital of the dry cooling business, resulting in additional cash proceeds during the quarter of   $1.7  . In connection with the sale, we recorded a gain of   $18.4  , including   $1.7   recorded during the third quarter of 2016 associated with the aforementioned working capital settlement. The gain includes a reclassification from  Equity  of other comprehensive income totaling   $40.4   related to foreign currency translation.  
  We provided customary indemnifications to Paharpur in connection with the sale. Accordingly, it is possible that the sales price and resulting gain for this divestiture may be materially adjusted in subsequent periods.  
  The assets and liabilities of the dry cooling business, as of December 31, 2015, have been classified as  held for sale  within the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet. See Note 3 for information on such assets and liabilities. 
  Other 
  Preparing financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Actual results could differ from these estimates. The unaudited information included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements contained in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of full year results. Unless otherwise indicated, amounts provided in these Notes pertain to continuing operations only. See Note 3 for information on discontinued operations. 
  We establish actual interim closing dates using a fiscal calendar, which requires our businesses to close their books on the Saturday closest to the end of the first calendar quarter, with the second and third quarters being   91   days in length. Our fourth quarter ends on December 31. The interim closing dates for the first, second and third quarters of 2016 are April 2, July 2 and October 1, compared to the respective March 28, June 27 and September 26, 2015 dates. We had six more days in the first quarter of 2016 and will have five fewer days in the fourth quarter of 2016 than in the respective 2015 periods. We do not believe the six  
  
   6 

additional days during the first quarter of 2016 had a material impact on our consolidated operating results for the first nine months of 2016, when compared to the consolidated operating results for the respective 2015 period. 
   
  (2)                                    NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 
  The following is a summary of new accounting pronouncements that apply or may apply to our business. 
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued a new standard on revenue recognition that outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. The new standard contains a five-step approach that entities will apply to determine the measurement of revenue and timing of when it is recognized, including (i) identifying the contract(s) with a customer, (ii) identifying the separate performance obligations in the contract, (iii) determining the transaction price, (iv) allocating the transaction price to separate performance obligations, and (v) recognizing revenue when (or as) each performance obligation is satisfied. The new standard requires a number of disclosures intended to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue, and the related cash flows. The disclosures include qualitative and quantitative information about contracts with customers, significant judgments made in applying the revenue guidance, and assets recognized from the costs to obtain or fulfill a contract. The standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. We are currently evaluating the effect this new standard will have on our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  In April 2015, the FASB issued a new standard that requires debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability to be reported in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. An amendment to this standard was issued in August 2015 that permits entities to present debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements as an asset and subsequently amortize such debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement. The standard was effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and shall be applied retrospectively. We adopted this guidance on January 1, 2016 and, thus, the debt issuance costs associated with the term loan under our senior credit facilities have been presented as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the term loan in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets. See Note 10 for additional details. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued an amendment to existing guidance that requires lessees to recognize assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by long-term leases. In addition, this amendment requires new qualitative and quantitative disclosures about leasing arrangements. This standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2018 for public business entities, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, and adoption must be applied on a modified retrospective basis. We are currently evaluating the effect this amendment will have on our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued an amendment to existing guidance that simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. This standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those annual reporting periods. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the effect this amendment will have on our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued an amendment to existing guidance to reduce diversity in practice in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. This amendment provides clarification on eight specific cash flow presentation issues. The issues include, but are not limited to, debt prepayment or extinguishment costs, settlement of zero-coupon debt, proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims, and cash receipts from payments on beneficial interests in securitization transactions. This amendment is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those annual reporting periods. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the effect this amendment will have on our condensed consolidated financial statements.

    DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND SALE OF DRY COOLING BUSINESS 
     Spin-Off of SPX FLOW 
  As indicated in Note 1, we completed the spin-off of SPX FLOW on September 26, 2015. The results of SPX FLOW are presented as a discontinued operation within the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations for the   three and nine   months ended   September 26, 2015   and the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows for the   nine   months ended   September 26, 2015  . Major classes of line items constituting pre-tax income and after-tax income of SPX FLOW are shown below:  
   
 ___________________________ 
            (1)   
    Includes   $16.8   and   $30.8   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 26, 2015  , respectively, of professional fees and other costs that were incurred in connection with the Spin-Off. 
     The following table presents selected financial information regarding cash flows of SPX FLOW that are included within discontinued operations in the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows for the   nine   months ended   September 26, 2015  :  
                     Non-cash items included in income from discontinued operations:

      Capital expenditures

Other Discontinued Operations Activity 
  In addition to the Spin-Off of SPX FLOW, we recognized net losses of   $0.7   and   $2.2   during the   three and nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , respectively, and net losses of   $0.6   and   $1.5   during the   three and nine   months ended   September 26, 2015  , respectively, resulting primarily from revisions to liabilities retained from businesses discontinued prior to 2015. 
  For the   three and nine   months ended   October 1, 2016   and   September 26, 2015  , the table below presents a reconciliation of discontinued operations activity to the related amounts in the condensed consolidated statements of operations:

Sale of Dry Cooling Business 
  On November 20, 2015, we entered into an agreement for the sale of our dry cooling business. The assets and liabilities of our dry cooling business are presented as  held for sale  within the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015. The major classes of assets and liabilities held for sale as of December 31, 2015 are shown below: 

As indicated in Note 1, on March 30, 2016, we completed the sale of our dry cooling business to Paharpur for cash proceeds of   $45.9   (net of cash transferred with the business of   $3.0  ). During the third quarter of 2016, we reached an agreement with Paharpur regarding the final working capital of the dry cooling business, resulting in additional cash proceeds during the quarter of   $1.7  . In connection with the sale, we recorded a gain of   $18.4  , including   $1.7   recorded during the third quarter of 2016 associated with the aforementioned working capital settlement. The gain includes a reclassification from  Equity  of other comprehensive income totaling   $40.4   related to foreign currency translation.  

(4)                                      INFORMATION ON REPORTABLE SEGMENTS 
  We are a global supplier of highly specialized, engineered solutions with operations in over   20   countries and sales in over   100   countries around the world. 
  We have aggregated our operating segments into the following   three   reportable segments: HVAC, Detection and Measurement, and Power. The factors considered in determining our aggregated segments are the economic similarity of the businesses, the nature of products sold or services provided, production processes, types of customers, distribution methods, and regulatory environment. In determining our segments, we apply the threshold criteria of the Segment Reporting Topic of the Codification to operating income or loss of each segment before considering gains/losses on sales of businesses, impairment and special charges, pension and postretirement expense/income, long-term incentive compensation and other indirect corporate expenses. This is consistent with the way our CODM evaluates the results of each segment. 
  
   9

The primary distribution channels for the segment s products are direct to customers and third-party representatives. The segment serves a global customer base, with a strong presence in North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, and South Africa. 
  Corporate Expense 
  Corporate expense generally relates to the cost of our Charlotte, NC corporate headquarters. Corporate expense for the   three and nine   months ended   September 26, 2015   also included costs related to our former Asia Pacific center in Shanghai, China, which was part of the Spin-Off, costs that were previously allocated to the FLOW Business that do not meet the requirements to be presented within discontinued operations, and the cost of corporate employees who became employees of SPX FLOW at the time of the Spin-Off. 
  Financial data for our reportable segments for the   three and nine   months ended   October 1, 2016   and   September 26, 2015   are presented below:

sheets. Billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts accounted for under the percentage-of-completion method were   $75.8   and   $116.3   as of   October 1, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, and are reported as a component of   Accrued expenses   in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
            (2)   
    As further discussed in Note 13, during the three months ended   September 26, 2015  , we made revisions to our estimates of expected revenues and profits on our large power projects in South Africa. As a result of these revisions, we reduced revenue and segment income by   $57.2   and   $95.0  , respectively, during the three and nine months ended   September 26, 2015  .  
      
           (5) 
    SPECIAL CHARGES, NET 
     Special charges, net, for the   three and nine   months ended   October 1, 2016   and   September 26, 2015   are described in more detail below: 

HVAC Segment     The benefit for the three months ended   September 26, 2015   related primarily to the reversal of previously accrued costs associated with our boiler products business, while the charges for the   nine   months ended   September 26, 2015   related primarily to costs associated with facility consolidation efforts in Asia Pacific.  
  Detection and Measurement Segment     Charges for the   three and nine   months ended   October 1, 2016   related to severance and other costs associated with our bus fare collection systems business.

The costs incurred for the Heat Transfer business restructuring actions included asset impairment charges associated with the discontinuance of a product line and outsourcing initiatives of   $0.7   and   $3.3   for the   three and nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , respectively, as well as severance costs. Charges for the   three and nine   months ended   September 26, 2015   related primarily to severance and other costs associated with restructuring actions at our Balcke Duerr and dry cooling businesses.

Other Intangibles, Net 
  Identifiable intangible assets at   October 1, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   comprised the following: 

___________________________ 
            (1)   
    The net carrying value at December 31, 2015 includes   $2.4   and   $5.9   of technology and trademarks, respectively, related to our dry cooling business. As previously noted, the assets and liabilities of the dry cooling business have been classified as  held for sale  in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015. See Note 3 for information on the assets and liabilities of the dry cooling business as of December 31, 2015. 
               (2)   
    As noted below, we recorded an impairment charge of   $4.0   during the first quarter of 2016 related to the trademarks of our Heat Transfer business. 
               (3)   
    Changes in the gross carrying values of  Other Intangibles, Net  during the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016   related to the sale of our dry cooling business, the impairment charge related to the Heat Transfer trademarks noted above, and, to a lesser extent, foreign currency translation. 
     At   October 1, 2016  , the net carrying value of intangible assets with determinable lives consisted of   $4.4   in the HVAC segment and   $26.7   in the Power segment. At   October 1, 2016  , trademarks with indefinite lives consisted of   $89.2   in the HVAC segment,   $10.2   in the Detection and Measurement segment and   $14.6   in the Power segment. 
  We perform our annual goodwill impairment testing during the fourth quarter in conjunction with our annual financial planning process, with such testing based primarily on events and circumstances existing as of the end of the third quarter. In addition, we test goodwill for impairment on a more frequent basis if there are indications of potential impairment. A significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indication of impairment has occurred between annual testing dates. Such indication may include: a significant decline in expected future cash flows; a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate; unanticipated competition; and a more likely than not expectation of selling or disposing all, or a portion, of a reporting unit.  
  We perform our annual trademarks impairment testing during the fourth quarter, or on a more frequent basis if there are indications of potential impairment. The fair values of our trademarks are determined by applying estimated royalty rates to projected revenues, with the resulting cash flows discounted at a rate of return that reflects current market conditions (fair value based on unobservable inputs - Level 3, as defined in Note 15). The primary basis for these projected revenues is the annual operating plan for each of the related businesses, which is prepared in the fourth quarter of each year. Based on our annual impairment testing during the fourth quarter of 2015, the estimated fair value of the trademarks for Heat Transfer was comparable to their carrying value of   $9.5  . The revenue projections used in the 2015 annual impairment analysis were based on the most recent historical trends for Heat Transfer. At the end of the first quarter of 2016, we concluded that the more recent trends were indicating that Heat Transfer s revenues for the foreseeable future would be significantly less than the projected amounts included in the 2015 annual analysis. In response to this new information, we performed an impairment analysis of Heat Transfer s trademarks as of April 2, 2016. Based on such analysis, we recorded an impairment charge of   $4.0   to our consolidated results of operations during the first quarter of 2016. 
  In addition to its trademarks, Heat Transfer has definite-lived intangible assets with an aggregate carrying value at   October 1, 2016   of   $26.7  . Although there are no current indications of impairment associated with Heat Transfer s intangible assets, further deterioration in the business s financial results could lead to impairment charges in subsequent periods. 
  No   impairment charges were recorded in the first nine months of 2015.

    EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS 
     In connection with the Spin-Off, participants in the SPX U.S. Pension Plan (the  U.S. Plan ) that were transferred to SPX FLOW became eligible to elect a lump-sum payment option in lieu of a future pension benefit under the U.S. Plan. During the second quarter of 2016, approximately   9%  , or   $25.2  , of the projected benefit obligation of the U.S. Plan was settled as a result of lump-sum payments. In connection with these lump-sum payments, we remeasured the assets and liabilities of the U.S. Plan as of May 31, 2016, which resulted in a charge to net periodic pension benefit expense of   $1.0   during the second quarter. 
  During the second quarter of 2016, we made lump-sum payments to certain participants of the Supplemental Individual Account Retirement Plan ( SIARP ), settling approximately   22%  , or   $2.7  , of the SIARP's projected benefit obligation. In connection with these lump-sum payments, we remeasured the liabilities of the SIARP as of June 30, 2016, which resulted in a charge to net periodic pension benefit expense of   $0.8   during the second quarter. 
  On July 14, 2015, we amended the U.S. Plan and SIARP to freeze all benefits for active non-union participants. The amendments resulted in a curtailment gain of   $5.1   during the third quarter of 2015. In connection with the amendments, we remeasured the assets and liabilities of the U.S. Plan and the SIARP as of June 30, 2015, which resulted in a charge to net periodic pension benefit expense of   $11.4   during the third quarter of 2015. 
  Net periodic benefit expense (income) for our pension and postretirement plans included the following components:

The following summarizes our debt activity (both current and non-current) for the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  : 

___________________________ 
             (2)   
    Under this arrangement, we can borrow, on a continuous basis, up to   $50.0  , as available. At   October 1, 2016  , we had   $26.4   of available borrowing capacity under this facility. 
               (3)   
    Primarily includes balances under a purchase card program of   $3.7   and   $4.8  , capital lease obligations of   $5.2   and   $1.7  , and borrowings under a line of credit in China of $  9.7   and $  17.3   at   October 1, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The purchase card program allows for payment beyond the normal payment terms for goods and services acquired under the program. As this arrangement extends the payment of these purchases beyond their normal payment terms through third-party lending institutions, we have classified these amounts as short-term debt.  
               (4)   
     Other  primarily includes   $3.8   of capital lease obligations and the impact of amortization of debt issuance costs associated with the term loan, partially offset by foreign currency translation on any debt instruments denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.  
     Senior Credit Facilities 
  A detailed description of our senior credit facilities is included in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
  
   15 

On September 29, 2016, we elected to reduce our participation foreign credit instrument facility commitment and our bilateral foreign credit instrument facility commitment by   $125.0  , to   $175.0  , and by   $75.0  , to   $125.0  , respectively. In connection with the reduction of our foreign credit instrument facility commitments, we recorded a charge of   $1.3   to "Loss on early extinguishment of debt" during the third quarter of 2016 associated with the write-off of the deferred financing costs related to this previously available issuance capacity of   $200.0  . 
  At   October 1, 2016  , we had   $46.5   and   $207.6   of outstanding letters of credit issued under our revolving credit and our foreign credit instrument facilities of our senior credit agreement, respectively.  
  The weighted-average interest rate of outstanding borrowings under our senior credit agreement was approximately   2.3%   at   October 1, 2016  . 
  At     October 1, 2016  , we were in compliance with all covenants of our senior credit agreement.

    DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
     Interest Rate Swaps  
  During the second quarter of 2016, we entered into interest rate swap agreements ( Swaps ) to hedge the interest rate risk on our variable rate term loan. These Swaps, which we designate and account for as cash flow hedges, have effective dates beginning in January 2017 and maturities through September 2020 and effectively converted   50%   of the borrowing under the variable rate term loan to a fixed rate of   1.2895%   plus the applicable margin. These are amortizing Swaps; therefore, the outstanding notional value is scheduled to decline commensurate with the scheduled maturities of the term loan. As of   October 1, 2016  , the aggregate notional amounts of the Swaps was   $170.8   and the unrealized loss, net of tax, recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income ( AOCI ) was   $1.2  . In addition, we have recorded a long-term liability of   $1.9   to recognize the fair value of these Swaps. 
  Currency Forward Contracts 
  From time to time, we enter into forward contracts to manage the exposure on contracts with forecasted transactions denominated in non-functional currencies and to manage the risk of transaction gains and losses associated with assets/liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of certain subsidiaries ( FX forward contracts ). In addition, some of our contracts contain currency forward embedded derivatives ( FX embedded derivatives ), because the currency of exchange is not  clearly and closely  related to the functional currency of either party to the transaction. Certain of our FX forward contracts are designated as cash flow hedges. To the extent these derivatives are effective in offsetting the variability of the hedged cash flows, changes in the derivatives  fair value are not included in current earnings, but are included in AOCI. These changes in fair value are reclassified into earnings as a component of revenues or cost of products sold, as applicable, when the forecasted transaction impacts earnings. 
  We had FX forward contracts with an aggregate notional amount of   $63.7   and   $139.8   outstanding as of   October 1, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, with all of the   $63.7   scheduled to mature within one year. We also had FX embedded derivatives with an aggregate notional amount of   $18.7   and   $120.8   at   October 1, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, with notional amounts of   $17.9   and   $0.8   scheduled to mature within one and two years thereafter, respectively. The decline in the notional amount of FX forward contracts and FX embedded derivatives was due primarily to the sale of our dry cooling business. The unrealized losses, net of tax, recorded in AOCI related to FX forward contracts were   $0.0   and   $0.6   as of   October 1, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  With regard to our FX forward contacts, these arrangements are designed to provide the right of setoff in the event of counterparty default or insolvency, and, thus, we have elected to offset the fair values of these instruments in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. The gross fair values of our FX forward contracts were   $0.0   and   $0.1   (gross assets) and   $0.5   and   $1.5   (gross liabilities) at   October 1, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  The fair values of our embedded derivative instruments were not material in relation to our condensed consolidated balance sheets as of   October 1, 2016   and December 31, 2015. 
  Commodity Contracts 
  From time to time, we enter into commodity contracts to manage the exposure on forecasted purchases of commodity raw materials. At   October 1, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the outstanding notional amount of commodity contracts was   4.0   and   4.2   pounds of copper, respectively. We designate and account for these contracts as cash flow hedges and, to the extent these commodity contracts are effective in offsetting the variability of the forecasted purchases, the change in fair value is included in AOCI. We reclassify AOCI associated with our commodity contracts to cost of products sold when the forecasted transaction impacts earnings. As of   October 1, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the fair value of these contracts was   $0.2   (current asset) and  
  
   16 

$1.7   (current liability), respectively. The unrealized gains (losses), net of tax, recorded in AOCI were   $0.1   and   $(1.2)   as of   October 1, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. We anticipate reclassifying the unrealized losses as of   October 1, 2016   to income over the next   12 months  .

    SHAREHOLDERS  EQUITY AND LONG-TERM INCENTIVE COMPENSATION 
     Income (Loss) Per Share 
  The following table sets forth the number of weighted-average shares outstanding used in the computation of basic and diluted income (loss) per share: 

The weighted-average number of restricted stock shares/units and stock options excluded from the computation of diluted income per share because the assumed proceeds for these instruments exceed the average market value of the underlying common stock for the related periods was   0.992   and   1.542  , respectively, for the three months ended   October 1, 2016  , and   1.134   and   1.346  , respectively, for the nine months ended   October 1, 2016  . 
  For the   three and nine   months ended   September 26, 2015  ,   0.342   and   0.315   of unvested restricted stock shares/units, respectively, and   0.323   of outstanding stock options were excluded from the computation of diluted income (loss) per share as we incurred losses from continuing operations during the periods. In addition,   0.536   and   0.541   of unvested restricted stock shares/units, respectively, did not meet the required market thresholds for vesting (as discussed in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K). 
  Long-Term Incentive Compensation 
  Long-term incentive compensation awards may be granted to certain eligible employees or non-employee directors. A detailed description of the awards granted prior to 2016 is included in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
  Awards granted on March 2, 2016 to executive officers and other members of senior management were comprised of performance stock units ( PSU s ), stock options, time-based restricted stock units ( RSU s ), and long-term cash awards, while other eligible employees were granted RSU s and long-term cash awards. The PSU s are eligible to vest at the end of a   three  -year performance period, with performance based on the total return of our stock over the   three  -year performance period against the S P 600 Capital Goods Index. Stock options and RSU s vest ratably over the   three  -year period subsequent to the date of grant. Long-term cash awards are eligible to vest at the end of a   three  -year performance measurement period, with performance based on our achieving a target segment income amount over the   three  -year measurement period.  
  Effective May 24, 2016, we granted   0.049   RSU s to our non-employee directors, which vest in their entirety immediately prior to the annual meeting of stockholders in May 2017. 
   Compensation expense within income from continuing operations related to long-term incentive awards totaled   $4.2   and   $5.5   for the three months ended   October 1, 2016   and   September 26, 2015  , respectively, and   $10.5   and   $30.5   for the nine months ended   October 1, 2016   and   September 26, 2015  , respectively. The related tax benefit was   $1.6   and   $2.1   for the three months ended   October 1, 2016   and   September 26, 2015  , respectively, and   $4.0   and   $11.4   for the nine months ended   October 1, 2016   and   September 26, 2015  , respectively.

    CONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND OTHER MATTERS 
     General 
  Numerous claims, complaints and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business have been asserted or are pending against us or certain of our subsidiaries (collectively,  claims ). These claims relate to litigation matters (e.g., class actions, derivative lawsuits and contracts, intellectual property and competitive claims), environmental matters, product liability matters (predominately associated with alleged exposure to asbestos-containing materials), and other risk management matters (e.g., general liability, automobile, and workers  compensation claims). Additionally, we may become subject to other claims of which we are currently unaware, which may be significant, or the claims of which we are aware may result in our incurring significantly greater loss than we anticipate. While we (and our subsidiaries) maintain property, cargo, auto, product, general liability, environmental, and directors  and officers  liability insurance and have acquired rights under similar policies in connection with acquisitions that we believe cover a significant portion of these claims, this insurance may be insufficient or unavailable (e.g., in the case of insurer insolvency) to protect us against potential loss exposures. Also, while we believe we are entitled to indemnification from third parties for some of these claims, these rights may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against potential loss exposures.  
  Our recorded liabilities related to these matters totaled   $584.4   (including   $531.3   for asbestos product liability matters) and   $591.1   (including   $534.4   for asbestos product liability matters) at   October 1, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. Of these amounts,   $548.2   and   $552.8   are included in  Other long-term liabilities  within our condensed consolidated balance sheets at   October 1, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, with the remainder included in  Accrued expenses.  The liabilities we record for these claims are based on a number of assumptions, including historical claims and payment experience and, with respect to asbestos claims, actuarial estimates of the future period during which additional claims are reasonably foreseeable. While we base our assumptions on facts currently known to us, they entail inherently subjective judgments and uncertainties. As a result, our current assumptions for estimating these liabilities may not prove accurate, and we may be required to adjust these liabilities  
  
   22 

in the future, which could result in charges to earnings. These variances relative to current expectations could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations. 
  Our asbestos-related claims are typical in certain of the industries in which we operate or pertain to legacy businesses we no longer operate. It is not unusual in these cases for   fifty   or more corporate entities to be named as defendants. We vigorously defend these claims, many of which are dismissed without payment, and the significant majority of costs related to these claims have historically been paid pursuant to our insurance arrangements. During the three months ended   October 1, 2016   and   September 26, 2015  , our payments for asbestos-related matters, net of insurance recoveries, were   $0.0   and   $2.3  , respectively. During the nine months ended   October 1, 2016   and   September 26, 2015  , our payments for asbestos-related matters, net of insurance recoveries, were   $3.0   and   $6.2  , respectively. A significant increase in claims, costs and/or issues with existing insurance coverage (e.g., dispute with or insolvency of insurer(s)) could have a material adverse impact on our share of future payments related to these matters, and, as such, have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
  We have recorded insurance recovery assets associated with the asbestos product liability matters, with such amounts totaling   $493.5   and   $493.3   at   October 1, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, and included in  Other assets  within our condensed consolidated balance sheets. These assets represent amounts that we believe we are or will be entitled to recover under agreements we have with insurance companies. The assets we record for these insurance recoveries are based on a number of assumptions, including the continued solvency of the insurers. Our current assumptions for estimating these assets may not prove accurate, and we may be required to adjust these assets in the future, which could result in additional charges to earnings. These variances relative to current expectations could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations. 
  During the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016   and   September 26, 2015  , there were no changes in estimates associated with the liabilities and assets related to our asbestos product liability matters. 
  Large Power Projects in South Africa 
  The business environment surrounding our large power projects in South Africa remains difficult, as we have experienced delays, cost over-runs, and various other challenges associated with a complex set of contractual relationships among the end customer, prime contractors, various subcontractors (including us and our subcontractors), and various suppliers. We currently are involved in a number of claim disputes relating to these challenges. We are pursuing various commercial alternatives for addressing these challenges, in an attempt to mitigate our overall financial exposure. During the third quarter of 2015, we gained considerable insight into the path forward for completing these projects, including our remaining scope, the estimated costs for completing such scope, and our expected recoverability of costs from the prime contractors and our subcontractors.  In response to this information, we revised our estimates of revenues, costs and profits associated with the projects. These revisions resulted in an increase in our  Loss from continuing operations before income taxes  for the three and nine months ended September 26, 2015 of   $95.0  , which was comprised of a reduction in revenue of   $57.2   and an increase in cost of products sold of   $37.8  . In addition, these revisions resulted in an increase in our  Net loss  of   $71.2   for the three and nine months ended September 26, 2015 and an increase in our  Loss per share of common stock  of   $1.75   for the same periods. 
  We recognize revenue associated with unapproved change orders and claims to the extent the related costs have been incurred and the amount expected of recovery is probable and reasonably estimable. At   October 1, 2016  , the projected revenues related to our large power projects in South Africa included approximately   $27.0   related to claims and unapproved change orders. We believe these amounts are recoverable under the provisions of the related contracts and reflect our best estimate of recoverable amounts. 
  Although we believe that our current estimates of revenues, costs and profits relating to these projects are reasonable, it is possible that future revisions of such estimates could have a material effect on our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  Noncontrolling Interest in South African Subsidiary 
  Our South African subsidiary, DBT Technologies (PTY) LTD ( DBT ), has a Black Economic Empowerment shareholder (the  BEE Partner ) that holds a   25.1%   noncontrolling interest in DBT. Under the terms of the shareholder agreement between the BEE Partner and SPX Technologies (PTY) LTD ( SPX Technologies ), the majority shareholder of DBT, the BEE Partner had the option to put its ownership interest in DBT to SPX Technologies at a redemption amount determined in accordance with the terms of the shareholder agreement (the  Put Option ). The BEE Partner notified SPX Technologies of its intention to exercise the Put Option and, on July 6, 2016, an Arbitration Tribunal declared that the BEE Partner was entitled to South African Rand   287.3   in connection with the exercise of the Put Option, having not considered an amount due from the BEE Partner under a promissory note of South African Rand   30.3   held by SPX Technologies. As a result, we have reflected the net redemption amount of South African Rand   257.0   (or   $18.8  ) within  Accrued expenses  on our condensed consolidated balance sheet as of   October 1, 2016  , with the related offset recorded to  Paid-in-capital  and  Accumulated other comprehensive income.  In addition, we reclassified   $38.7   from  Noncontrolling Interests  to  Paid-in capital  (see Note 12). Lastly, under the two-class method of calculating earnings per share, we have reflected an adjustment of   $18.1   to  Net income (loss) attributable to SPX Corporation  
  
   23 

common shareholders  for the excess redemption amount of the Put Option (i.e., the increase in the redemption amount during the nine months ended   October 1, 2016   in excess of fair value) in our calculations of basic and diluted earnings per share for the nine months ended   October 1, 2016  .  
  SPX Technologies disagrees with the arbitration determination and will continue to pursue all available legal recourse in this matter. 
  Beginning in the third quarter of 2016, in connection with our accounting for the redemption of the BEE Partner's ownership interest in DBT, we discontinued allocating earnings/losses of DBT to the BEE Partner within our condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  Patent Infringement Lawsuit 
  Our subsidiary, SPX Cooling Technologies, Inc. ( SPXCT ), is a defendant in a legal action brought by Baltimore Aircoil Company ( BAC ) alleging that a SPXCT product (the  product ) infringes United States Patent No. 7,107,782 (the   782 Patent ), entitled  Evaporative Heat Exchanger and Method.  BAC filed suit on July 16, 2013 in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland seeking monetary damages and injunctive relief. 
  On August 22, 2016, the trial court rendered its decision on several summary judgment issues; some rulings were favorable to SPXCT s defense while others were favorable to BAC s claims. SPXCT continues to dispute that the product at issue infringes upon any valid claim of BAC s  782 patent. 
  The trial for this matter began on October 24, 2016 and the District Court proceedings are ongoing. At this time, we do not believe that we have a probable liability associated with BAC s claims, nor can we reasonably estimate the range of potential liability, if any, given the stage of proceedings, potential appeals, and nature of the damages and relief sought. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in the litigation and, if we are not successful, the ultimate outcome could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. In the event the court finds in favor of BAC, SPXCT will consider appealing such adverse decision. 
  Other Legal Matters 
  We are subject to other legal matters that arise in the normal course of business. We believe these matters are either without merit or of a kind that should not have a material effect, individually or in the aggregate, on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows; however, we cannot assure you that these proceedings or claims will not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  
  Environmental Matters 
  Our operations and properties are subject to federal, state, local and foreign regulatory requirements relating to environmental protection. It is our policy to comply fully with all applicable requirements. As part of our effort to comply, we have a comprehensive environmental compliance program that includes environmental audits conducted by internal and external independent professionals, as well as regular communications with our operating units regarding environmental compliance requirements and anticipated regulations. Based on current information, we believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations, and we are not aware of any violations that could have a material effect, individually or in the aggregate, on our business, financial condition, and results of operations or cash flows. As of   October 1, 2016  , we had liabilities for site investigation and/or remediation at   34   sites (  35   sites at December 31, 2015) that we own or control. In addition, while we believe that we maintain adequate accruals to cover the costs of site investigation and/or remediation, we cannot provide assurance that new matters, developments, laws and regulations, or stricter interpretations of existing laws and regulations will not materially affect our business or operations in the future. 
  Our environmental accruals cover anticipated costs, including investigation, remediation, and operation and maintenance of clean-up sites. Our estimates are based primarily on investigations and remediation plans established by independent consultants, regulatory agencies and potentially responsible third parties. Accordingly, our estimates may change based on future developments, including new or changes in existing environmental laws or policies, differences in costs required to complete anticipated actions from estimates provided, future findings of investigation or remediation actions, or alteration to the expected remediation plans. It is our policy to revise an estimate once it becomes probable and the amount of change can be reasonably estimated. We do not discount our environmental accruals and do not reduce them by anticipated insurance recoveries. We take into account third-party indemnification from financially viable parties in determining our accruals where there is no dispute regarding the right to indemnification. 
  
   24 

In the case of contamination at offsite, third-party disposal sites, as of   October 1, 2016  , we have been notified that we are potentially responsible and have received other notices of potential liability pursuant to various environmental laws at   24   sites at which the liability has not been settled, of which   7   sites have been active in the past few years. These laws may impose liability on certain persons that are considered jointly and severally liable for the costs of investigation and remediation of hazardous substances present at these sites, regardless of fault or legality of the original disposal. These persons include the present or former owners or operators of the site and companies that generated, disposed of or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances at the site. We are considered a  de minimis  potentially responsible party at most of the sites, and we estimate that our aggregate liability, if any, related to these sites is not material to our condensed consolidated financial statements. We conduct extensive environmental due diligence with respect to potential acquisitions, including environmental site assessments and such further testing as we may deem warranted. If an environmental matter is identified, we estimate the cost and either establish a liability, purchase insurance or obtain an indemnity from a financially sound seller; however, in connection with our acquisitions or dispositions, we may assume or retain significant environmental liabilities, some of which we may be unaware. The potential costs related to these environmental matters and the possible impact on future operations are uncertain due in part to the complexity of government laws and regulations and their interpretations, the varying costs and effectiveness of various clean-up technologies, the uncertain level of insurance or other types of recovery, and the questionable level of our responsibility. We record a liability when it is both probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. 
  In our opinion, after considering accruals established for such purposes, the cost of remedial actions for compliance with the present laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment are not expected to have a material impact, individually or in the aggregate, on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
  Self-insured Risk Management Matters 
  We are self-insured for certain of our workers  compensation, automobile, product and general liability, disability and health costs, and we believe that we maintain adequate accruals to cover our retained liability. Our accruals for risk management matters are determined by us, are based on claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not yet reported, and generally are not discounted. We consider a number of factors, including third-party actuarial valuations, when making these determinations. We maintain third-party stop-loss insurance policies to cover certain liability costs in excess of predetermined retained amounts. The insurance may be insufficient or unavailable (e.g., because of insurer insolvency) to protect us against loss exposure.  
  Collaborative Arrangements 
  Collaborative arrangements are defined as a contractual arrangement in which the parties are (1) active participants to the arrangements and (2) exposed to significant risks and rewards that depend on the commercial success of the endeavor. Costs incurred and revenues generated from transactions with third parties are required to be reported by the collaborators on the appropriate line item in their respective statements of operations. 
  We enter into consortium arrangements for certain projects within our Power segment. Under such arrangements, each consortium member is responsible for performing certain discrete items of work within the total scope of the contracted work and the consortium expires when all contractual obligations are completed. The revenues for these discrete items of work are defined in the contract with the project owner and each consortium member bearing the profitability risk associated with its own work. Our consortium arrangements typically provide that each consortium member assumes responsibility for its share of any damages or losses associated with the project; however, the use of a consortium arrangement typically results in joint and several liability for the consortium members. If responsibility cannot be determined or a consortium member defaults, then the consortium members are responsible according to their share of the contract value. Within our condensed consolidated financial statements, we account for our share of the revenues and profits under the consortium arrangements. As of   October 1, 2016  , our share of the aggregate contract value on open consortium arrangements was   $44.1   (of which approximately   57%   had been recognized as revenue), and the aggregate contract value on open consortium arrangements was   $90.3  . As of   December 31, 2015  , our share of the aggregate contract value on open consortium arrangements was   $100.2   (of which approximately   68%   had been recognized as revenue), and the aggregate contract value on open consortium arrangements was   $371.7  . At   October 1, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we recorded liabilities of   $0.4   and   $0.6  , respectively, representing the estimated fair value of our potential obligation under the joint and several liability provisions associated with the consortium arrangements. 
   
   Uncertain Tax Benefits 
  As of   October 1, 2016  , we had gross and net unrecognized tax benefits of   $44.0   and   $26.7  , respectively. Of these net unrecognized tax benefits,   $25.4  , if recognized, would impact our effective tax rate from continuing operations. 
  
   25 

We classify interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of our income tax provision. As of   October 1, 2016  , gross accrued interest totaled   $3.7   (net accrued interest of   $2.4  ). As of   October 1, 2016  , we had   no   accrual for penalties included in our unrecognized tax benefits. 
  Based on the outcome of certain examinations or as a result of the expiration of statutes of limitations for certain jurisdictions, we believe that within the next   12 months   it is reasonably possible that our gross unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by approximately   $6.0   to   $10.0  . The gross unrecognized tax benefits relate to a variety of tax matters relating to deemed income inclusions, transfer pricing and various state matters. 
  Other Tax Matters 
  For the three months ended   October 1, 2016  , we recorded an income tax provision of   $0.0   on   $2.6   of pre-tax income from continuing operations. This compares to an income tax provision for the three months ended   September 26, 2015   of   $5.5   on   $125.2   of a pre-tax loss from continuing operations. The most significant item impacting the income tax provision for the third quarter of 2016 was the   $1.7   of additional gain that was recorded during the quarter on the sale of the dry cooling business, for which no income taxes were required to be provided. The most significant item impacting the effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2015 was the effects of approximately   $102.0   of pre-tax losses generated during the period (the majority of which relate to our large projects in South Africa) for which no tax benefit was recognized, as future realization of any such tax benefit is considered unlikely. 
  For the nine months ended   October 1, 2016  , we recorded an income tax provision of   $6.1   on   $26.8   of pre-tax income from continuing operations. This compares to an income tax benefit for the nine months ended   September 26, 2015   of   $8.6   on   $192.2   of a pre-tax loss from continuing operations. The most significant items impacting the income tax provision for the first nine months of 2016 were   $0.3   of income taxes that were provided in connection with the   $18.4   gain that was recorded on the sale of the dry cooling business and   $10.5   of foreign losses generated during the period for which no tax benefit was recognized, as future realization of any such tax benefit is considered unlikely. The most significant items impacting the effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2015 were (i) the effects of approximately   $130.0   of pre-tax losses generated during the period (the majority of which relate to our large projects in South Africa) for which no tax benefit was recognized, as future realization of any such tax benefit is considered unlikely, and (ii)   $3.6   of taxes incurred during the first quarter of 2015 related to the Spin-Off, including   $3.4   of foreign income taxes related to reorganization actions undertaken to facilitate the separation. 
  We perform reviews of our income tax positions on a continuous basis and accrue for potential uncertain positions when we determine that an uncertain position meets the criteria of the Income Taxes Topic of the Codification. Accruals for these uncertain tax positions are recorded in  Income taxes payable  and  Deferred and other income taxes  in the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets based on the expectation as to the timing of when the matters will be resolved. As events change and resolutions occur, these accruals are adjusted, such as in the case of audit settlements with taxing authorities. 
  We have filed our federal income tax returns for the 2013 through 2015 tax years and those returns are subject to examination. With regard to all open tax years, we believe any contingencies are adequately provided for. 
  State income tax returns generally are subject to examination for a period of three to five years after filing the respective tax returns. The impact on such tax returns of any federal return changes remains subject to examination by various states for a period of up to one year after formal notification to the states. We have various state income tax returns in the process of examination or administrative appeal. We believe any uncertain tax positions related to these examinations have been adequately provided for. 
  We have various foreign income tax returns under examination. The most significant of these is in Germany for the 2010 through 2014 tax years. We believe that any uncertain tax positions related to these examinations have been adequately provided for. 
  An unfavorable resolution of one or more of the above matters could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in the quarter and year in which an adjustment is recorded or the tax is due or paid. As audits and examinations are still in process or we have not yet reached the final stages of the appeals process, the timing of the ultimate resolution and any payments that may be required for the above matters cannot be determined at this time. 
   
   Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. In the absence of active markets for the identical assets or liabilities, such measurements involve developing assumptions based on market observable data and, in the absence of such data, internal information consistent with what market participants would use in a hypothetical transaction that occurs at the measurement date. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our market assumptions. Preference is given to observable inputs. These two types of inputs create the following fair value hierarchy: 
  
   26 

Level 1   Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets. 
                
    Level 2   Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable. 
                
    Level 3   Significant inputs to the valuation model are unobservable. 
     There were no changes during the periods presented to the valuation techniques we use to measure asset and liability fair values on a recurring basis. 
  The following section describes the valuation methodologies we use to measure different financial instruments at fair value on a recurring basis. 
  Derivative Financial Instruments 
  Our derivative financial assets and liabilities include FX forward contracts, FX embedded derivatives, commodity contracts and interest rate swaps, valued using valuation models based on observable market inputs such as forward rates, interest rates, our own credit risk and the credit risk of our counterparties, which comprise investment-grade financial institutions. Based on these inputs, the derivative assets and liabilities are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. We have not made any adjustments to the inputs obtained from the independent sources. Based on our continued ability to enter into forward contracts, we consider the markets for our fair value instruments active. We primarily use the income approach, which uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts to a single present amount. 
  As of   October 1, 2016  , there has been no significant impact to the fair value of our derivative liabilities due to our own credit risk, as the related instruments are collateralized under our senior credit facilities. Similarly, there has been no significant impact to the fair value of our derivative assets based on our evaluation of our counterparties  credit risks. 
  Goodwill, Indefinite-Lived Intangible and Other Long-Lived Assets 
  Certain of our non-financial assets are subject to impairment analysis, including long-lived assets, indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill. We review the carrying amounts of such assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable or at least annually for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill. Any resulting asset impairment would require that the instrument be recorded at its fair value. 
  Indebtedness       
  The estimated fair value of our debt instruments as of   October 1, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   approximated the related carrying values due primarily to the variable market-based interest rates for such instruments. See Note 10 for further details.

  EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW 
  Spin-Off of SPX FLOW 
  On September 26, 2015, we completed the spin-off of SPX FLOW, Inc. (the  Spin-Off ). The results of SPX FLOW, Inc. ( SPX FLOW ) for the   three and nine   months ended   September 26, 2015   are presented as discontinued operations. See Notes 1 and 3 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the Spin-Off and the financial results of SPX FLOW. 
  Summary of Operating Results 
  Revenues for the   three and nine   months ended   October 1, 2016     increased   by   $11.1   (or   3.0  %) and decreased   $22.4   (or   1.9  %), respectively, when compared to the same periods in   2015  . Revenues for the   three and nine   months ended   September 26, 2015   were impacted by the fact that our third quarter 2015 revenues included a revision to the expected revenues and profits on our large power projects in South Africa, which resulted in a reduction in revenues during the periods of $57.2. Revenues for the   three and nine   months ended   October 1, 2016   were impacted negatively by the sale of our dry cooling business on March 30, 2016, while organic revenue, which declined during the   three and nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , was impacted by lower sales in our HVAC and power generation businesses and higher sales in our power transformer business. Lastly, a stronger U.S. dollar negatively impacted revenues during the   three and nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , compared to the respective periods in 2015. See  Results of Reportable Segments  for additional details. 
  During the   three and nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , we generated operating income of   $7.1   and   $37.1  , respectively, compared to an operating loss of   $113.6   and   $166.9   during the same periods in 2015. Operating results for the   three and nine   months ended   October 1, 2016   and   September 26, 2015   were impacted by the following: 
   
   28 

On March 30, 2016, we completed the sale of our dry cooling business to Parharpur Cooling Towers Limited ( Parharpur ) for cash proceeds of   $45.9   (net of cash transferred with the business of   $3.0  ). During the third quarter of 2016, we reached an agreement with Paharpur regarding the final working capital of the dry cooling business, resulting in additional cash proceeds during the quarter of $1.7. In connection with the sale, we recorded a gain of $18.4, including $1.7 recorded during the third quarter of 2016 associated with the aforementioned working capital settlement. The gain includes a reclassification from  Equity  of other comprehensive income totaling   $40.4   related to foreign currency translation. 
                
    Net pension charges/actuarial losses of $1.8 recorded during the second quarter of 2016 related to the remeasurement of the SPX U.S. Pension Plan (the  U.S. Plan ) and Supplemental Individual Account Retirement Plan ( SIARP ) resulting from lump sum benefit payments to certain participants. 
                
    During the first quarter of 2016, we recorded an impairment charge of   $4.0   associated with the trademarks of our SPX Heat Transfer business ( Heat Transfer ). 
                 
    A reduction in operating profit of $95.0 associated with a third quarter 2015 revision to our estimates of expected revenues and profits on our large power projects in South Africa. 
                
    Net pension charges of $6.3 recorded during the third quarter of 2015 related to amendments of the U.S. Plan and the SIARP, with such net charges comprised of actuarial losses of $11.4, partially offset by curtailment gains of $5.1.  
                
    A significant amount of general and administrative costs associated with corporate employees and other corporate support that transferred to SPX FLOW at the time of the Spin-Off. 
                
    Special charges during the three and nine months ended September 26, 2015 of $8.4 and $14.0, respectively, for severance and other costs associated with restructuring actions primarily within our Power segment. 
     Cash flows   used in   continuing operations totaled   $44.0   during the first   nine   months of 2016, compared to   $168.3   during the first   nine   months of   2015  . The decrease in cash outflows was due primarily to (i) increases in operating cash flows at our power transformer business due to improvements in profitability and declines in working capital and (ii) a decline in cash outflows associated with our large power projects in South Africa and the dry cooling business. In addition, cash flows used in continuing operations for the first nine months of 2015 included disbursements for general corporate overhead costs related to a corporate structure that supported the SPX business prior to the Spin-Off. A significant portion of this corporate structure transferred to SPX FLOW at the time of the Spin-Off and, thus, was no longer part of our company during the first nine months of 2016. 
   
  RESULTS OF CONTINUING OPERATIONS 
  The unaudited information included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements contained in our   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year. We establish actual interim closing dates using a fiscal calendar, which requires our businesses to close their books on the Saturday closest to the end of the first calendar quarter, with the second and third quarters being 91 days in length. Our fourth quarter ends on December 31. The interim closing dates for the first, second and third quarters of   2016   are April 2, July 2 and October 1, compared to the respective March 28, June 27 and September 26,   2015   dates. We had six more days in the first quarter of   2016   and will have five fewer days in the fourth quarter of   2016   than in the respective   2015   periods. We do not believe the six additional days during the first quarter of 2016 had a material impact on our consolidated operating results for the first nine months of 2016, when compared to the consolidated operating results for the respective 2015 period. 
  Cyclicality of End Markets, Seasonality and Competition     The financial results of our businesses closely follow changes in the industries in which they operate and end markets in which they serve. In addition, certain of our businesses have seasonal fluctuations. Our heating and ventilation businesses tend to be stronger in the third and fourth quarters, as customer buying habits are driven largely by seasonal weather patterns. Demand for cooling towers used in power generation applications, along with the related services, is highly correlated to the timing of large construction contracts and power plant outages, which may cause significant fluctuations from period to period. In aggregate, our businesses generally tend to be stronger in the second half of the year. 
  Although our businesses operate in highly competitive markets, our competitive position cannot be determined accurately in the aggregate or by segment since none of our competitors offer all the same product lines or serve all the same markets as we do. In addition, specific reliable comparative figures are not available for many of our competitors. In most product groups, competition comes from numerous concerns, both large and small. The principal methods of competition are service, product  
  
   29 

performance, technical innovation and price. These methods vary with the type of product sold. We believe we compete effectively on the basis of each of these factors. 
  Non-GAAP Measures     Organic revenue growth (decline) presented herein is defined as revenue growth (decline) excluding the effects of foreign currency fluctuations, acquisitions/divestitures, and the impact of the revenue reduction that resulted from the third quarter 2015 revision to the expected revenues and profits on our large power projects in South Africa, which resulted in a reduction in revenues of   $57.2   for the three and nine months ended   September 26, 2015  . We believe this metric is a useful financial measure for investors in evaluating our operating performance for the periods presented, as, when read in conjunction with our revenues, it presents a useful tool to evaluate our ongoing operations and provides investors with a tool they can use to evaluate our management of assets held from period to period. In addition, organic revenue growth (decline) is one of the factors we use in internal evaluations of the overall performance of our business. This metric, however, is not a measure of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ), should not be considered a substitute for net revenue growth (decline) as determined in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. 
  The following table provides selected financial information for the   three and nine   months ended   October 1, 2016   and   September 26, 2015  , respectively, including the reconciliation of organic revenue decline to net revenue increase (decrease): 

___________________________ 
  *              Not meaningful for comparison purposes. 
  Revenues     For the   three months ended October 1, 2016  , the   increase   in revenues, compared to the respective period in   2015  , was primarily due to a reduction in revenues of $57.2 during the three months ended September 26, 2015 resulting from a revision to the expected revenues and profits on our large power projects in South Africa. This increase was offset partially by the impact of the sale of our dry cooling business on March 30, 2016, a decline in organic revenue and, to a lesser extent, the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar during the third quarter of 2016. The decline in organic revenue was due primarily to lower sales by our HVAC and power generation businesses, partially offset by an increase in sales by our power transformer business. See  Results of Reportable Segments  for additional details. 
  For the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , the   decrease   in revenues, compared to the respective period in 2015, was due to the aforementioned sale of our dry cooling business, the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar during 2016, and, to a lesser extent, a decline in organic revenue. These decreases were offset partially by the impact of the third quarter 2015 revenue revision noted above of $57.2 associated with our large power projects in South Africa. The decline in organic revenue was attributable primarily

to lower sales by our power generation and HVAC businesses, partially offset by higher sales by our power transformer business. See  Results of Reportable Segments  for additional details. 
  Gross Profit     The   increase   in gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of revenues for the   three and nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , compared to the respective periods in   2015  , was due primarily to a reduction in gross profit of $95.0 during the third quarter of 2015 associated with a revision to the expected revenues and profits of our large power projects in South Africa. In addition, gross profit as a percentage of revenues for the three and nine months ended October 1, 2016 was impacted favorably by cost reductions and the improved operating efficiency at our heating and ventilation and power transformer businesses. 
  Selling, General and Administrative ( SG A ) Expense     For the   three and nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , the   decrease   in SG A expense, compared to the respective periods in   2015  , was due primarily to a decrease in corporate expense, pension and postretirement expense, and long-term incentive compensation. As previously noted, corporate expense for the   three and nine   months ended   September 26, 2015   included a significant amount of costs associated with corporate employees and other corporate support that transferred to SPX FLOW at the time of the Spin-Off. See  Corporate and Other Expenses  for additional details on pension and postretirement expense and long-term incentive compensation. 
  Intangible Amortization       For the   three and nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , the decline in intangible amortization was primarily the result of discontinuing amortization on the long-term assets of our dry cooling business in connection with classifying the business s assets and liabilities as  held for sale,  effective December 31, 2015. 
  Special Charges, net     Special charges, net, related primarily to restructuring initiatives to consolidate manufacturing, distribution, sales and administrative facilities, reduce workforce and rationalize certain product lines. See Note 5 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for the details of actions taken in   2016   and   2015  . 
  Impairment of Intangible Assets       During the first quarter of 2016, we recorded an impairment charge of   $4.0   related to the trademarks of Heat Transfer. See Note 7 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for additional details. 
  Gain on Sale of Dry Cooling Business       On March 30, 2016, we completed the sale of our dry cooling business for cash proceeds of   $45.9   (net of cash transferred with the business of $3.0). During the third quarter of 2016, we reached an agreement with Paharpur regarding the final working capital of the dry cooling business, resulting in additional cash proceeds during the quarter of $1.7. In connection with the sale, we recorded a gain of $18.4, including $1.7 recorded during the third quarter of 2016 associated with the aforementioned working capital settlement. 
  See Notes 1 and 3 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for additional details. 
  Other Income (Expense), net     Other income, net, for the three months ended   October 1, 2016   was composed primarily of foreign currency transaction gains of $2.1, income derived from company-owned life insurance policies of $0.5, and income associated with transition services provide in connection with the sale of the dry cooling business of $0.1, partially offset by losses on foreign currency forward contracts ( FX forward contracts ) of $2.5 and losses on currency forward embedded derivatives ( FX embedded derivatives ) of $0.1. 
  Other expense, net, for the three months ended   September 26, 2015   was composed primarily of foreign currency transaction losses of $8.0 and a settlement charge of $1.4 associated with a legacy product liability matter, partially offset by gains on FX forward contracts of $3.9 and gains on FX embedded derivatives of $0.7. 
  Other income, net, for the nine months ended   October 1, 2016   was composed primarily of foreign currency transaction gains of $4.1, income derived from company-owned life insurance policies of $2.1, and income associated with transition services provided in connection with the sale of the dry cooling business of $0.6, partially offset by losses on FX forward contracts of $4.7 and losses on FX embedded derivatives of $1.7. 
  Other expense, net, for the nine months ended   September 26, 2015   was composed primarily of foreign currency transaction losses of $6.2, losses on FX forward contracts of $5.2, and a settlement charge of $1.4 associated with a legacy product liability matter, partially offset by gains on FX embedded derivatives of $3.5, a gain on an asset sale of $1.2, and investment earnings of $0.6. 
  Interest Expense, net       Interest expense, net, includes both interest expense and interest income. The   decrease   in interest expense, net, during the   three and nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , compared to the same periods in   2015  , was primarily a result of a decline in interest expense resulting from lower average debt balances during the   three and nine   months ended   October 1, 2016   compared to the respective periods in 2015. 
  Loss on early extinguishment of debt       During the three months ended   October 1, 2016  , we reduced the issuance capacity under our foreign credit facilities by $200.0. In connection with such reduction, we recorded a charge of $1.3 associated with the write-off of the deferred financing costs related to the $200.0 of previously available issuance capacity. 
  
   31 

In connection with the Spin-Off, we entered into a new credit agreement. As a result, we recorded a charge of $1.4 during the third quarter of 2015 associated with the write-off of a portion of the deferred financing costs related to our prior credit agreement. 
  Income Tax (Provision) Benefit     For the three months ended   October 1, 2016  , we recorded an income tax provision of   $0.0   on   $2.6   of pre-tax income from continuing operations. This compares to an income tax provision for the three months ended   September 26, 2015   of   $5.5   on   $125.2   of a pre-tax loss from continuing operations. The most significant item impacting the income tax provision for the third quarter of 2016 was the $1.7 of additional gain that was recorded during the quarter for the sale of the dry cooling business, for which no income taxes were required to be provided. The most significant item impacting the income tax provision for the third quarter of 2015 was the effects of approximately   $102.0   of pre-tax losses generated during the period (the majority of which relate to our large projects in South Africa) for which no tax benefit was recognized, as future realization of any such tax benefit is considered unlikely. 
  For the nine months ended   October 1, 2016  , we recorded an income tax provision of   $6.1   on   $26.8   of pre-tax income from continuing operations. This compares to an income tax benefit for the nine months ended   September 26, 2015   of   $8.6   on   $192.2   of a pre-tax loss from continuing operations. The most significant items impacting the income tax provision for the first nine months of 2016 were   $0.3   of income taxes that were provided in connection with the   $18.4   gain that was recorded on the sale of the dry cooling business and   $10.5   of foreign losses generated during the period for which no tax benefit was recognized, as future realization of any such tax benefit is considered unlikely. The most significant items impacting the effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2015 were (i) the effects of approximately   $130.0   of pre-tax losses generated during the period (the majority of which relate to our large projects in South Africa) for which no tax benefit was recognized, as future realization of any such tax benefit is considered unlikely, and (ii)   $3.6   of taxes incurred during the first quarter of 2015 related to the Spin-Off, including   $3.4   of foreign income taxes related to reorganization actions undertaken to facilitate the separation. 
   
  RESULTS OF DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND SALE OF DRY COOLING BUSINESS 
  Spin-Off of SPX FLOW 
  We completed the spin-off of SPX FLOW on September 26, 2015. The results of SPX FLOW are presented as a discontinued operation for the   three and nine   months ended   September 26, 2015  . Major classes of line items constituting pre-tax income and after-tax income of SPX FLOW are shown below: 
   
 ___________________________ 
            (1)   
    Includes   $16.8   and   $30.8   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 26, 2015  , respectively, of professional fees and other costs that were incurred in connection with the Spin-Off. 
     Other Discontinued Operations Activity 
  In addition to the Spin-Off of SPX FLOW, we recognized net losses of   $0.7   and   $2.2   during the   three and nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , respectively, and   $0.6   and   $1.5   during the   three and nine   months ended   September 26, 2015  , respectively, resulting primarily from revisions to liabilities retained from businesses discontinued prior to 2015. 
  
   32 

For the   three and nine   months ended   October 1, 2016   and   September 26, 2015  , the table below presents a reconciliation of discontinued operations activity to the related amounts in the condensed consolidated statements of operations: 

Sale of Dry Cooling Business 
  On November 20, 2015, we entered into an agreement for the sale of our dry cooling business. On March 30, 2016, we completed the sale of the business to Paharpur for cash proceeds of   $45.9   (net of cash transferred with the business of $3.0). During the third quarter of 2016, we reached an agreement with Paharpur regarding the final working capital of the dry cooling business, resulting in additional cash proceeds during the quarter of $1.7. In connection with the sale, we recorded a gain of $18.4, including $1.7 recorded during the third quarter of 2016 associated with the aforementioned working capital settlement. The gain includes a reclassification from  Equity  of other comprehensive income totaling $40.4 related to foreign currency translation.  
  We provided customary indemnifications to Paharpur in connection with the sale. Accordingly, it is possible that the sales price and resulting gain for this divestiture may be materially adjusted in subsequent periods. 
   
  RESULTS OF REPORTABLE SEGMENTS 
  The following information should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes. These results exclude the operating results of discontinued operations for all periods presented. See Note 4 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for a description of each of our reportable segments. 
  Non-GAAP Measures     Throughout the following discussion of segment results, we use  organic revenue  growth (decline) to facilitate explanation of the operating performance of our segments. Organic revenue growth (decline) is a non-GAAP financial measure and is not a substitute for revenue growth (decline). Refer to the explanation of this measure and purpose of use by management under  Results of Continuing Operations Non-GAAP Measures.  
  HVAC Reportable Segment   

  Revenues     For the   three and nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , the decrease in revenues, compared to the respective periods in 2015, was due to a decline in organic revenue and, to a lesser extent, the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar during the 2016 periods. The decline in organic revenue was primarily the result of a decrease in sales of heating products. In addition, revenues for the three months ended September 26, 2015 were favorably impacted by a large cooling products project that was executed during the quarter. 
  
   33 

Income     For the three months ended   October 1, 2016  , the decrease in income and margin, compared to the respective period in 2015, was due primarily to the organic revenue decline noted above. 
  For the nine months ended   October 1, 2016  , the decrease in income, compared to the respective period in 2015, was due primarily to the decline in organic revenue noted above, generally offset by the impact of improved operating efficiency and other cost reductions within the segment s boiler products business. The increase in margin during the nine months ended   October 1, 2016  , compared to the respective period in 2015, was due to the improved operating efficiency and other cost reductions noted above. 
  Backlog     The segment had backlog of $34.3 and $44.2 as of   October 1, 2016   and   September 26, 2015  , respectively.  
  Detection and Measurement Reportable Segment 

Revenues     For the three months ended   October 1, 2016  , the decrease in revenues, compared to the respective period in 2015, was due to a decline in organic revenue and the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar during the 2016 period. The decline in organic revenue was primarily the result of a decrease in sales of communication technologies products, partially offset by an increase in sales of bus fare collection systems and specialty lighting products. 
  For the nine months ended   October 1, 2016  , the increase in revenues, compared to the respective period in 2015, was due to an increase in organic revenue, partially offset by the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar during the 2016 period. The increase in organic revenue was due primarily to increases in sales of bus fare collection systems and specialty lighting products, partially offset by a decrease in sales of communication technologies products. 
  Income     For the three months ended   October 1, 2016  , the decrease in income, compared to the respective period in 2015, was due primarily to the revenue decline noted above. For the three months ended October 1, 2016, the increase in margin, compared to the respective period in 2015, was due primarily to a more profitable sales mix within the specialty lighting and portable cable and pipe locator businesses. 
  For the nine months ended   October 1, 2016  , the increase in income and margin, compared to the respective period in 2015, was due to the favorable sale mix noted above along with the impact of the organic revenue growth during the period. 
  Backlog     The segment had backlog of $52.6 and $39.5 as of as of   October 1, 2016   and   September 26, 2015  , respectively.  
  Power Reportable Segment 

Revenues     For the three months ended   October 1, 2016  , the increase in revenues, compared to the respective period in 2015, was due primarily to the reduction in revenues of $57.2 during the three months ended September 26, 2015 resulting from a revision to the expected revenues and profits on our large power projects in South Africa and, to a lesser extent, an increase in  
  
   34 

organic revenue during the three months ended October 1, 2016. These increases were offset partially by the impact of the sale of the segment s dry cooling business on March 30, 2016 and, to a lesser extent, the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar during the third quarter of 2016. The increase in organic revenue was attributable primarily to higher sales of power transformers, partially offset by lower sales of power generation equipment in the Americas and Asia Pacific during the period. 
  For the   nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , the decrease in revenues, compared to the respective period in 2015, was due primarily to the impact of the sale of the dry cooling business noted above and, to a lesser extent, the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar during 2016. These decreases in revenues were offset partially by the impact of the third quarter 2015 revenue revision noted above of $57.2 associated with our large power projects in South Africa. The nominal increase in organic revenue was attributable primarily to higher sales of power transformers, generally offset by lower sales of power generation equipment in Asia Pacific during the period. 
  Loss     For the   three and nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , losses for the segment declined, compared to the respective periods in 2015, primarily due to the fact that the segment s results for the three and nine months ended September 26, 2015 included a reduction in profit of $95.0 associated with a revision during the third quarter of 2015 to the expected revenues and profits of our large power projects in South Africa. During the three and nine months ended October 1, 2016, income and margin for the segment s power transformer business increased as a result of the organic revenue growth noted above, as well as improved operating efficiency. However, these increases generally were offset by lower profitability within the segment s power generation businesses resulting primarily from the declines in revenue noted above. 
  Backlog     The segment had backlog of $568.0 and $822.1 as of   October 1, 2016   and   September 26, 2015  , respectively. Of the $254.1 year-over-year decline in backlog, $26.1 was attributable to the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar as of   October 1, 2016  , as compared to   September 26, 2015  . In addition, the balance at   September 26, 2015   included $145.6 of backlog associated with our dry cooling business. Portions of the segment s backlog are long-term in nature, with the related revenues expected to be recorded through the fourth quarter of 2016 and beyond. 

CORPORATE AND OTHER EXPENSES 

Corporate Expense     Corporate expense generally relates to the cost of our Charlotte, NC corporate headquarters. Corporate expense for the three and nine months ended   September 26, 2015   also included costs related to our former Asia Pacific center in Shanghai, China, which was part of the Spin-Off, costs that were previously allocated to the FLOW Business that do not meet the requirements to be presented within discontinued operations, and the cost of corporate employees who became employees of SPX FLOW at the time of the Spin-Off. The decrease in corporate expense for the   three and nine   months ended   October 1, 2016  , compared to the respective periods in 2015, was due primarily to the elimination of costs in connection with the Spin-Off, including the cost of the corporate employees who became employees of SPX FLOW. 
  Long-Term Incentive Compensation Expense     Long-term incentive compensation expense represents our consolidated expense, which we do not allocate for segment reporting purposes. Long-term incentive compensation expense for the three and nine months ended   September 26, 2015   included $2.7 and $21.6, respectively, related to corporate employees who became employees of SPX FLOW at the time of the Spin-Off or retired in connection with the Spin-Off. 
  Pension and Postretirement Expense     Pension and postretirement expense represents our consolidated expense, which we do not allocate for segment reporting purposes. The decrease in pension and postretirement expense during the three months ended   October 1, 2016  , compared to the respective period in 2015, was due primarily to net charges of   $6.3   (actuarial losses of   $11.4  , partially offset by a curtailment gain of   $5.1  ) during the third quarter of 2015 associated with amendments of the U.S. Plan and SIARP, which resulted in the freezing of benefits for active non-union participants of these plans. The decrease in pension and postretirement expense during the nine months ended October 1, 2016, compared to the respective period in 2015, was due primarily to net charges of   $6.3   noted above during the third quarter of 2015, partially offset by the impact of charges of   $1.8   during the second quarter of 2016 associated with lump-sum benefit payments during the period to certain participants of the U.S. Plan and the SIARP and a decrease in expected returns on plan assets during 2016. See Note 9 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information on pension and postretirement expense. 
  
   35 

LIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL CONDITION 
  Listed below are the cash flows from (used in) operating, investing, and financing activities and discontinued operations, as well as the net change in cash and equivalents for the nine months ended   October 1, 2016   and   September 26, 2015  . 

Operating Activities       The decrease in cash flows used in operating activities during the nine months ended   October 1, 2016  , as compared to the same period in 2015, was due primarily to (i) increases in operating cash flows at our power transformer business due to improvements in profitability and declines in working capital and (ii) a decline in cash outflows associated with our large power projects in South Africa and the dry cooling business. In addition, cash flows used in operating activities for the first nine months of 2015 included disbursements for general corporate overhead costs related to a corporate structure that supported the SPX business prior to the Spin-Off. As previously noted, a significant portion of this corporate structure transferred to SPX FLOW at the time of the Spin-Off and, thus, was no longer part of our company during the first nine months of 2016. 
  Investing Activities     Cash flows from investing activities for the nine months ended   October 1, 2016   were comprised primarily of net proceeds from the sale of our dry cooling business of   $47.6  , partially offset by capital expenditures of   $8.4   and an increase in restricted cash of   $1.7  . Cash flows used in investing activities for the nine months ended   September 26, 2015   related to capital expenditures of   $12.8  , partially offset by proceeds from asset sales of   $2.0  . 
  Financing Activities     Cash flows used in financing activities for the nine months ended   October 1, 2016   related to net repayments under our various debt instruments of $11.5 and withholdings paid on behalf of employees for net share settlements of   $1.6  . Cash flows used in financing activities for the nine months ended   September 26, 2015   primarily related to cash divested in connection with the Spin-Off of $207.1, dividends paid of   $30.6  , and financing fees paid of   $12.2  , partially offset by net borrowings under our senior credit facilities and trade receivables financing arrangement of $129.0. 
  Discontinued Operations     Cash flows used in discontinued operations for the nine months ended   October 1, 2016   related primarily to disbursements for liabilities retained in connection with dispositions prior to 2015. Cash flows used in discontinued operations for the nine months ended   September 26, 2015   related primarily to the cash flows associated with the FLOW Business.  
  Change in Cash and Equivalents due to Changes in Foreign Currency Exchange Rates     Changes in foreign currency exchange rates did not have a significant impact on our cash and equivalents during the nine months ended   October 1, 2016  . The decrease of   $57.8   in cash and equivalents due to foreign currency exchange rates for the nine months ended   September 26, 2015   reflected primarily a reduction in U.S. dollar equivalent balances of our Euro-denominated cash and equivalents as a result of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Euro during the period. 
  
   36 

Borrowings and Availability 
  Borrowings    The following summarizes our debt activity (both current and non-current) for the nine months ended   October 1, 2016  . 
   
 ___________________________ 
             (2)   
    Under this arrangement, we can borrow, on a continuous basis, up to   $50.0  , as available. At   October 1, 2016  , we had   $26.4   of available borrowing capacity under this facility. 
               (3)   
    Primarily includes balances under a purchase card program of   $3.7   and   $4.8  , capital lease obligations of   $5.2   and   $1.7  , and borrowings under a line of credit in China of $  9.7   and $  17.3   at   October 1, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The purchase card program allows for payment beyond the normal payment terms for goods and services acquired under the program. As this arrangement extends the payment of these purchases beyond their normal payment terms through third-party lending institutions, we have classified these amounts as short-term debt.  
               (4)   
     Other  primarily includes   $3.8   of capital lease obligations and the impact of amortization of debt issuance costs associated with the term loan, partially offset by foreign currency translation on any debt instruments denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.  
     At   October 1, 2016  , we were in compliance with all covenant provisions of our senior credit agreement. 
  Availability     At   October 1, 2016  , we had $303.5 of available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities after giving effect to   $46.5   reserved for outstanding letters of credit. In addition, at   October 1, 2016  , we had   $92.4   of available issuance capacity under our foreign credit facilities after giving effect to (i)   $207.6   reserved for outstanding letters of credit   and   (ii) our recent election to reduce the issuance capacity of the facilities by $200.0. See Note 10 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information.  
  Financing instruments may be used from time to time including, but not limited to, public and private debt and equity offerings, operating leases, capital leases and securitizations. We expect that we will continue to access these markets as appropriate to maintain liquidity and to provide sources of funds for general corporate purposes, acquisitions or to refinance existing debt. 
  Concentrations of Credit Risk 
  Financial instruments that potentially subject us to significant concentrations of credit risk consist of cash and equivalents, trade accounts receivable, interest rate swaps, foreign currency forwards and commodity contracts. These financial instruments, other than trade accounts receivable, are placed with high-quality financial institutions throughout the world. We periodically evaluate the credit standing of these financial institutions. 
  We maintain cash levels in bank accounts that, at times, may exceed federally-insured limits. We have not experienced, and believe we are not exposed to, significant risk of loss in these accounts. 
  We have credit loss exposure in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to the above financial instruments, but have no other off-balance-sheet credit risk of accounting loss. We anticipate, however, that counterparties will be able to fully satisfy their obligations under the contracts. We do not obtain collateral or other security to support financial instruments subject to credit risk, but we do monitor the credit standing of counterparties. 
  Concentrations of credit risk arising from trade accounts receivable are due to selling to customers in a particular industry. Credit risks are mitigated by performing ongoing credit evaluations of our customers  financial conditions and obtaining collateral, advance payments, or other security when appropriate. No one customer, or group of customers that to our knowledge are under common control, accounted for more than 10% of our revenues for any period presented. 
  
   37 

Other Matters 
  Contractual Obligations     There have been no material changes in the amounts of our contractual obligations from those disclosed in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our total net liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits including interest were $27.6 as of   October 1, 2016  . Of that amount, we believe that within the next 12 months it is reasonably possible that we could pay approximately   $6.0   to   $10.0   relating to uncertain tax positions, which includes an estimate of interest and penalties.    
  Contingencies and Other Matters     Numerous claims, complaints and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business have been asserted or are pending against us or certain of our subsidiaries (collectively,  claims ). These claims relate to litigation matters (e.g., class actions, derivative lawsuits and contracts, intellectual property and competitive claims), environmental matters, product liability matters (predominately associated with alleged exposure to asbestos-containing materials), and other risk management matters (e.g., general liability, automobile, and workers  compensation claims). Additionally, we may become subject to other claims of which we are currently unaware, which may be significant, or the claims of which we are aware may result in our incurring significantly greater loss than we anticipate. We accrue for these contingencies when we believe a liability is probable and can be reasonably estimated. As events change and resolutions occur, these accruals may be adjusted and could differ materially from amounts originally estimated. See Note 13 to the condensed consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of contingencies and other matters. 
  Our Certificate of Incorporation provides that we shall indemnify our officers and directors to the fullest extent permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law for any personal liability in connection with their employment or service with us. While we maintain insurance for this type of liability, the liability could exceed the amount of the insurance coverage. 
  In addition, you should read  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Other Matters  and  Risk Factors  in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as similar sections in any future filings for an understanding of the risks, uncertainties, and trends facing our businesses. 
  Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates 
  General     The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The accounting policies that we believe are most critical to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations, and that require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments in estimating the effect of inherent uncertainties are discussed in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have affected no material change in either our critical accounting policies or use of estimates since the filing of our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

38 

ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
    
  Management does not believe our exposure to market risk has significantly changed since December 31, 2015 and does not believe that such risks will result in significant adverse impacts to our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 

ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures 
    
  SPX management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures, pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b), as of   October 1, 2016  . Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of   October 1, 2016  . 
    
  In connection with the evaluation by SPX management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, of our internal control over financial reporting, pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(d), no changes during the quarter ended   October 1, 2016   were identified that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

    I have reviewed this quarterly report on Form 10-Q of SPX Corporation; 
              2.     
    Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report; 
              3. 
    Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report; 
              4. 
    The registrant's other certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)), for the registrant and have: 
              a. 
    designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared; 
              b. 
    designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; 
              c. 
    evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and

    disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant's most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant's fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal control over financial reporting; and 
              5. 
    The registrant's other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions): 
              a. 
    all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and 
              b. 
    any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting.
