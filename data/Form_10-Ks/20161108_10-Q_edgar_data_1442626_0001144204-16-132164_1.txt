BLUEROCK RESIDENTIAL GROWTH REIT, INC.  

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

Note 1   Organization and Nature of Business  

Bluerock Residential
Growth REIT, Inc. (the  Company ) was incorporated as a Maryland corporation on July 25, 2008. The Company s
objective is to maximize long-term stockholder value by acquiring well-located institutional-quality apartment properties in demographically
attractive growth markets across the United States. The Company seeks to maximize returns through investments where it believes
it can drive substantial growth in its funds from operations and net asset value through one or more of its Core-Plus, Value-Add,
Opportunistic and Invest-to-Own investment strategies. 

As of September 30,
2016, the Company's portfolio consisted of interests in twenty-five properties (seventeen operating properties and eight development
properties). The Company s twenty-five properties contain an aggregate of 7,790 units, comprised of 5,573 operating units
and 2,217 units under development. As of September 30, 2016, these properties, exclusive of development properties, and EOS, the
lease-up property, were approximately 94% occupied. 

The Company has elected
to be treated, and currently qualifies, as a real estate investment trust ( REIT ), for federal income tax purposes.
As a REIT, the Company generally is not subject to corporate-level income taxes. To maintain its REIT status, the Company is required,
among other requirements, to distribute annually at least 90% of its  REIT taxable income,  as defined by the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the  Code ), to the Company s stockholders. If the Company fails to qualify
as a REIT in any taxable year, it would be subject to federal income tax on its taxable income at regular corporate tax rates. 

Note 2   Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies  

Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation   

The Company operates
as an umbrella partnership REIT in which Bluerock Residential Holdings, L.P. (its  Operating Partnership ), or the
Operating Partnership s wholly-owned subsidiaries, owns substantially all of the property interests acquired on the Company s
behalf. As of September 30, 2016, limited partners other than the Company owned approximately 8.22% of the Operating Partnership
(1.41% is held by holders of limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership ( OP Units ) and 6.81% is held
by holders of the Operating Partnership s long-term incentive plan units ( LTIP Units )). Bluerock Real Estate,
L.L.C., a Delaware limited liability company, is referred to as Bluerock ( Bluerock ), and the Company s external
manager, BRG Manager, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, is referred to as its Manager ( Manager ). Both Bluerock
and the Manager are related parties with respect to the Company, but are not within the Company s control and are not consolidated
in the Company s financial statements. 

Because the Company
is the sole general partner of its Operating Partnership and has unilateral control over its management and major operating decisions
(even if additional limited partners are admitted to the Operating Partnership), the accounts of the Operating Partnership are
consolidated in its consolidated financial statements. The Company consolidates entities in which it controls more than 50% of
the voting equity and in which control does not rest with other investors. Investments in real estate joint ventures over which
the Company has the ability to exercise significant influence, but for which it does not have financial or operating control,
are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. These entities are reflected on the Company s consolidated financial
statements as  Preferred equity investments and investments in unconsolidated real estate joint ventures.  All significant
intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.  The Company will consider
future joint ventures for consolidation in accordance with the provisions required by the Financial Accounting Standards Board
( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 810: Consolidation. 

Certain amounts in
prior year financial statement presentation have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.  

Investments in Unconsolidated Real
Estate Joint Ventures  

The Company first
analyzes its investments in joint ventures to determine if the joint venture is a variable interest entity ( VIE )
in accordance with ASC 810 and if so, whether the Company is the primary beneficiary requiring consolidation.  A VIE is an
entity that has (i) insufficient equity to permit it to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support
or (ii) equity holders that lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest.  VIEs are consolidated by the primary
beneficiary, which is the entity that has both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity s
economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the entity that potentially could
be significant to the entity.  Variable interests in a VIE are contractual, ownership, or other financial interests in a
VIE that change with changes in the fair value of the VIE s net assets. The Company continuously re-assesses at each level
of the joint venture whether the entity is (i) a VIE, and (ii) if the Company is the primary beneficiary of the VIE. 
If it was determined an entity in which the Company holds a joint venture interest qualified as a VIE and the Company was the
primary beneficiary, the entity would be consolidated.  

7   

If, after consideration
of the VIE accounting literature, the Company has determined that VIE accounting is not applicable to the joint ventures, the
Company assesses the need for consolidation under all other provisions of ASC 810.  These provisions provide for consolidation
of majority-owned entities through a majority voting interest held by the Company providing control, or through determination
of control by virtue of the Company being the general partner in a limited partnership or the controlling member of a limited
liability company. 

In assessing whether
the Company is in control of and requiring consolidation of the limited liability company and partnership venture structures,
the Company evaluates the respective rights and privileges afforded each member or partner (collectively referred to as  member ). 
The Company s member would not be deemed to control the entity if any of the other members have either (i) substantive kickout
rights providing the ability to dissolve (liquidate) the entity or otherwise remove the managing member or general partner without
cause or (ii) has substantive participating rights in the entity.  Substantive participating rights (whether granted by contract
or law) provide for the ability to effectively participate in significant decisions of the entity that would be expected to be
made in the ordinary course of business that are not otherwise protective rights.     

If it has been determined
that the Company does not have control, but does have the ability to exercise significant influence over the entity, the Company
accounts for these unconsolidated investments under the equity method of accounting. The equity method of accounting requires
these investments to be initially recorded at cost and subsequently increased (decreased) for the Company s share of net
income (loss), including eliminations for the Company s share of intercompany transactions, and increased (decreased) for
contributions (distributions). The Company s proportionate share of the results of operations of these investments is reflected
in the Company s earnings or losses. 

Interim Financial Information  

The accompanying
unaudited consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) for interim financial reporting, and the instructions to Form 10-Q
and Article 10-1 of Regulation S-X.  Accordingly, the financial statements for interim reporting do not include all of the
information and notes or disclosures required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments
(consisting of normal recurring items) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included.  Operating results
for interim periods should not be considered indicative of the operating results for a full year. 

The balance sheet
at December 31, 2015 has been derived from the audited financial statements at that date, but does not include all of the
information and disclosures required by GAAP for complete financial statements.  For further information, refer to the financial
statements and notes thereto included in our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015
contained in the Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) on February
24, 2016.    

Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies   

There have been no
significant changes to the Company s accounting policies since it filed its audited consolidated financial statements in
its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

Use of Estimates  

The preparation of
the financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

New Accounting Pronouncements    

In
August 2016, the  Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB )  issued
ASU 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments    ( ASU-2016-15 ).
The ASU  provides guidance on the treatment of cash receipts and cash
payments for certain types of cash transactions, to eliminate diversity in practice in the presentation of the cash flow statement.
For public business entities, the amendments in ASU 2016-15 are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Earlier application is permitted.  The Company is
still in the process of determining the impact that the implementation of ASU 2016-15 will have on the Company s financial
statements. 

In March 2016, the
FASB issued ASU No. 2016-07,  Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting , which eliminates the
requirement to retroactively adjust an investment, results of operations, and retained earnings when the investment qualifies
for the use of the equity method as a result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence. The new
standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and early adoption is permitted. The Company
is still in the process of determining the impact that the implementation of ASU 2016-07 will have on the Company s financial
statements. 

8   

In February 2016,
the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842)  ( ASU 2016-02 ). Under ASU 2016-02, an entity will
be required to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on its balance sheet and disclose key information about leasing
arrangements. ASU 2016-02 offers specific accounting guidance for a lessee, a lessor and sale and leaseback transactions. Lessees
and lessors are required to disclose qualitative and quantitative information about leasing arrangements to enable a user of the
financial statements to assess the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. For public companies, ASU
2016-02 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that reporting
period, and requires a modified retrospective adoption, with early adoption permitted. The Company is in the process of evaluating
the future impact of ASU 2016-02 on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 

In August 2014, the
FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15,  Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern  ( ASU 2014-15 ), which
requires an entity's management to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial
doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are
issued. ASU 2014-15 is effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2016. ASU 2014-15 is not expected to have a material
impact on the Company's financial statements. 

In May 2014, the
FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  ( ASU 2014-09 ). The
updated standard is a new comprehensive revenue recognition model that requires revenue to be recognized in a manner that depicts
the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the consideration expected to be received in exchange
for those goods or services. In July 2015, the FASB voted to approve the deferral of the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by one
year. Therefore, ASU 2014-09 will become effective for the Company in the first quarter of the fiscal year ending December 31,
2018. Early adoption is permitted, but not earlier than the first quarter of the fiscal year ending December 31, 2017. The ASU
allows for either full retrospective or modified retrospective adoption. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10,  Revenue
from Contracts with Customers  (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing, which adds guidance on identifying
performance obligations within a contract. The Company has not selected a transition method, and is currently evaluating the effect
that ASU 2014-09, as amended, will have on the consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. 

Note 3     Sale of Unconsolidated
Real Estate Joint Ventures and Held for Sale Property  

Sale of Joint Venture Equity Interests  

On January 14, 2015,
the Company, along with the other two holders of tenant-in-common interests in Berry Hill, sold their respective interests to
2300 Berry Hill General Partnership, an unaffiliated third party. The aggregate purchase price was $61.2 million, subject to certain
prorations and adjustments typical in such real estate transactions. After deduction for payment of the existing mortgage indebtedness
and payment of closing costs and fees, the sale of the Company s interest in Berry Hill generated net proceeds of approximately
$7.3 million to the Company and a consolidated gain on sale of $11.3 million, of which the Company s pro rata share of gain
is $5.3 million before disposition expenses of $0.1 million, which was included in the Company s statement of operations
for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

Sale of Springhouse at Newport News  

On August 10, 2016,
the Company closed on the sale of the Springhouse at Newport News property, located in Newport News, Virginia, and the buyout
of our 25% joint venture partner in conjunction with the sale. The property was sold for approximately $38.0 million, subject
to certain prorations and adjustments typical in such real estate transactions. After deduction for the defeasance of the existing
mortgage indebtedness encumbering the Springhouse at Newport News property in the amount of $25.4 million and payment of closing
costs and fees of $0.5 million the sale of the property generated net proceeds for the Company of approximately $9.0 million and
a gain on sale of approximately $4.9 million. 

9   

Note 4   Investments in Real Estate  

As of September 30,
2016, the Company was invested in seventeen operating real estate properties and eight development properties generally through
joint ventures. The following tables provide summary information regarding our operating and development investments, which are
either consolidated or presented on the equity method of accounting. 

Operating Properties     

(1)  Represents date of
last significant renovation or year built if there were no renovations.   

Depreciation expense was $5.9 million and $3.1 million for
the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $16.7 million and $8.2 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Intangibles related to the Company s consolidated investments
in real estate consist of the value of in-place leases. In-place leases are amortized over the remaining term of the in-place
leases, which is approximately six months. Amortization expense related to the in-place leases was $1.3 million and $0.9 million
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $5.8 million and $2.3 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Development Properties  

Note 5   Acquisition of Real Estate  

The following describes
the Company s significant acquisition activity during the nine months ended September 30, 2016: 

Acquisition of Summer Wind and Citation
Club Apartments  

On January 5, 2016,
the Company, through subsidiaries of its Operating Partnership, completed investments of approximately $15.9 million and approximately
$13.6 million in a multi-tiered joint venture along with an affiliate of Carroll Organization, to acquire (i) a 368-unit apartment
community located in Naples, Florida to be known as ARIUM Gulfshore, formerly known as the Summer Wind Apartments ( ARIUM
Gulfshore ) and (ii) a 320-unit apartment community located in Sarasota, Florida to be known as ARIUM at Palmer Ranch, formerly
known as Citation Club Apartments ( ARIUM at Palmer Ranch ), respectively. The Company s indirect ownership
interest in the joint venture that owns ARIUM Gulfshore and ARIUM at Palmer Ranch is 95.0%. ARIUM Gulfshore s purchase price
of approximately $47.0 million was funded, in part, with a $32.6 million senior mortgage loan secured by ARIUM Gulfshore property
and improvements. ARIUM at Palmer Ranch s purchase price of approximately $39.3 million was funded, in part, with a $26.9
million senior mortgage loan secured by the ARIUM at Palmer Ranch property and improvements. 

10   

Acquisition of The Preserve at Henderson
Beach  

On March 15, 2016,
the Company, through subsidiaries of its Operating Partnership, acquired a 340-unit apartment community located in Destin, Florida,
known as Alexan Henderson Beach to be rebranded as The Preserve at Henderson Beach ( Henderson Beach ) for approximately
$53.7 million.  The purchase price for Henderson Beach included the assumption of a $37.5 million loan secured by Henderson
Beach. 

Acquisition of ARIUM Westside  

On July 14, 2016,
the Company, through subsidiaries of its Operating Partnership, acquired a leasehold interest in a 336-unit, Class A, mixed-use
apartment community located in Atlanta, Georgia, known as Tenside Apartment Homes, to be rebranded as ARIUM Westside ( Westside ). 
The Company s indirect ownership interest in the joint venture that owns Westside is 90%. The purchase price for Westside
of approximately $74.5 million was funded, in part, with a $52.2 million senior mortgage loan secured by the Westside leasehold
interest (the  Westside Loan ). The Westside Loan matures August 1, 2023 and bears interest at a rate of 3.68%. The
Company provided certain standard scope non-recourse carveout guarantees in conjunction with the Westside Loan. 

Preliminary Purchase Price Allocations  

The acquisitions
of ARIUM Gulfshore, ARIUM at Palmer Ranch, The Preserve at Henderson Beach and ARIUM Westside have been accounted for as business
combinations. The purchase prices were allocated to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities based on their estimated fair
values at the dates of acquisition. The preliminary measurements of fair value reflected below are subject to change. The Company
expects to finalize the purchase price allocations as soon as practical, but no later than one year from each property s
respective acquisition date. 

The following table
summarizes the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. The amounts listed below reflect provisional amounts
that will be updated as information becomes available (amounts in thousands):  

In connection with
the acquisition of The Preserve at Henderson Beach, the Company assumed mortgage debt with a fair value of approximately $39.1
million.

Following is a summary
of the Company s ownership interests in the investments reported under the equity method of accounting. The carrying amount
of the Company s investments in unconsolidated real estate joint ventures as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015
is summarized in the table below (amounts in thousands): 

As of September 30,
2016, the Company had outstanding preferred equity investments in ten multi-tiered joint ventures, each of which were created
to develop a multifamily property. In each case, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Operating Partnership made a preferred investment
in a joint venture, except Flagler Village and APOK Townhomes, which are common interests. The common interests in these joint
ventures, as well as preferred interests in some cases, are owned by affiliates of the Manager. In each case, the Company s
preferred investment in the joint venture generates a preferred return of 15% on its outstanding capital contributions and the
Company is not allocated any of the income or loss. The joint venture then becomes the controlling member in an entity whose purpose
is to develop a multifamily property. Each joint venture in which the Company owns a preferred interest is required to redeem
the Company s preferred membership interests plus any accrued but unpaid preferred return on the earlier of the date which
is six months following the maturity of the related development s construction loan, or any earlier acceleration or due
date. Additionally, the Company has the right, in its sole discretion, to convert its preferred membership interest in each joint
venture into a common membership interest for a period of six months from the date upon which 70% of the units in the related
development have been leased.

and chief operating officer, along with appropriate support personnel. None of the officers or employees of the Manager are dedicated
exclusively to the Company. The Company is dependent on its Manager to provide these services that are essential to the Company.
In the event that the Manager or its affiliates are unable to provide the respective services, the Company will be required to
obtain such services from other sources. 

The Company pays the
Manager a base management fee in an amount equal to the sum of: (A) 0.25% of the Company s stockholders  existing
and contributed equity prior to the IPO and in connection with our contribution transactions, per annum, calculated quarterly
based on the Company s stockholders  existing and contributed equity for the most recently completed calendar quarter
and payable in quarterly installments in arrears, and (B) 1.5% of the equity per annum of the Company s stockholders who
purchase shares of the Company s stock, calculated quarterly based on their equity for the most recently completed calendar
quarter and payable in quarterly installments in arrears. The base management fee is payable independent of the performance of
the Company s investments. The Company amended the Management Agreement to provide that the base management fee can be payable
in cash or LTIP Units, at the election of the Board. The number of LTIP Units issued for the base management fee or incentive
fee will be based on the fees earned divided by the 5-day trailing average Class A common stock price prior to issuance. Base
management fees for the Manager of $0.5 million were expensed for the three months ended March 31, 2015. Base management fees
of $0.7 million were expensed during the three months ended June 30, 2015, which were paid through the issuance of 59,077 LTIP
Units on August 13, 2015. Base management fees of $0.9 million were expensed during the three months ended September 30, 2015,
which were paid through the issuance of 77,497 LTIP Units on November 18, 2015. Base management fees of $1.1 million were expensed
during the three months ended December 31, 2015, which were paid through the issuance of 115,304 LTIP Units on February 29, 2016.
Base management fees of $1.2 million were expensed during the three months ended March 31, 2016, which were paid through the issuance
of 108,045 LTIP Units on May 10, 2016. Base management fees of $1.4 million were expensed during the three months ended June 30,
2016, which were paid through the issuance of 105,036 LTIP Units on August 9, 2016. Base management fees of $1.7 million were
expensed during the three months ended September 30, 2016, which will be paid through the issuance of approximately 131,604 LTIP
Units assuming the $13.00 closing share price for the Company s Class A common stock on September 30, 2016. The actual number
of LTIP Units to be issued in payment of the base management fees for the three months ended September 30, 2016 is subject to
change based on the average closing share price of the Company s Class A common stock on the five business days prior to
the date of issuance. 

19   

The Company also
pays the Manager an incentive fee with respect to each calendar quarter in arrears. The incentive fee is equal to the difference
between (1) the product of (x) 20% and (y) the difference between (i) the Company s adjusted funds from operations ( AFFO ),
for the previous 12-month period, and (ii) the product of (A) the weighted average of the issue price of equity securities issued
in the IPO and in future offerings and transactions, multiplied by the weighted average number of all shares of the Company s
Class A common stock outstanding on a fully-diluted basis (including any restricted stock units, any restricted shares of Class
A common stock, LTIP Units, and other shares of common stock underlying awards granted under the Incentive Plans and OP Units)
in the previous 12-month period, exclusive of equity securities issued prior to the IPO or in the contribution transactions, and
(B) 8%, and (2) the sum of any incentive fee paid to the Manager with respect to the first three calendar quarters of such previous
12-month period; provided, however, that no incentive fee is payable with respect to any calendar quarter unless AFFO is greater
than zero for the four most recently completed calendar quarters, or the number of completed calendar quarters since the closing
date of the IPO, whichever is less. For purposes of calculating the incentive fee during the first 12 months after completion
of the IPO, AFFO will be determined by annualizing the applicable period following completion of the IPO. One half of each quarterly
installment of the incentive fee will be payable in LTIP Units, calculated pursuant to the formula above. The remainder of the
incentive fee will be payable in cash or in LTIP Units, at the election of the Board, in each case calculated pursuant to the
formula above. Incentive fees of $0.15 million were expensed during the three months ended December 31, 2014, which resulted in
the issuance of 10,896 LTIP Units on February 18, 2015. Incentive fees to the Manager of $0.9 million were expensed during the
three months ended March 31, 2015, which resulted in the issuance of 67,837 LTIP Units on May 14, 2015. No incentive fees to the
Manager were earned or expensed during the nine months ended December 31, 2015. Incentive fees of $0.15 million were expensed
during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 which will be paid through the issuance of approximately 11,977 LTIP Units assuming
the $13.00 closing share price for the Company s Class A common stock on September 30, 2016. 

Management fee expense
of $0.1 million and $0.3 million, and $0.1 million and $0.7 million, was recorded as part of general and administrative expenses
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, related to the 179,562 LTIP Units granted in connection
with the IPO. The expense recognized during 2016 and 2015 was based on the Class A common stock closing price at the vesting date
or end of the period, as applicable. These LTIP Units vest over a three year period that began in April 2014, with 59,854 LTIP
Units vested on April 30, 2015 and 59,854 LTIP Units vested on April 30, 2016. 

On July 2, 2015,
the Company issued a grant of LTIP Units under the Amended 2014 Incentive Plans to the Manager. The equity grant consisted of
283,390 LTIP Units (the  2015 LTIP Units ). The 2015 LTIP Units will vest ratably over a three year period that began
in July 2015, subject to certain terms and conditions. On August 3, 2016, the Company issued a grant of LTIP Units under the Amended
2014 Incentive Plans to the Company s external manager, BRG Manager, LLC. The equity grant consisted of 176,610 LTIP Units
(the  2016 LTIP Units ). The 2016 LTIP Units will vest ratably over a three year period that began in August 2016,
subject to certain terms and conditions. These LTIP Units may be convertible into OP Units under certain conditions and then may
be settled in shares of the Company s Class A common stock. These LTIP Units provide for the payment of distribution equivalents
at the same time distributions are paid to holders of the Company s Class A common stock. 

LTIP expense of $0.5
million and $1.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and $1.0 million was recorded as part of general
and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015, respectively, related to the 2015 LTIP Units and the 2016 LTIP
Units. The expense recognized during 2016 and 2015 was based on the Class A common stock closing price at the vesting date or
the end of the period, as applicable. 

The Company is also
required to reimburse the Manager for certain expenses and pay all operating expenses, except those specifically required to be
borne by the Manager under the Management Agreement. The Manager waived all reimbursements through the six months ended June 30,
2015. Reimbursements of $0.3 million were expensed during the six months ended December 31, 2015 and are recorded as part of general
and administrative expenses. Reimbursements of $0.2 million and $0.5 million were expensed during the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016, respectively, and are recorded as part of general and administrative expenses. In addition, BRG Manager was
reimbursed for offering costs in conjunction with the Series B Preferred Offering of $0.08 million and $0.18 million during the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

The initial term
of the Management Agreement expires on April 2, 2017 (the third anniversary of the closing of the IPO), and will be automatically
renewed for a one-year term on each anniversary date thereafter unless previously terminated in accordance with the terms of the
Management Agreement. Following the initial term of the Management Agreement, the Management Agreement may be terminated annually
upon the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the Company s independent directors, based upon (1) unsatisfactory performance
that is materially detrimental to the Company, or (2) the Company s determination that the fees payable to the Manager are
not fair, subject to the Manager s right to prevent such termination due to unfair fees by accepting a reduction of the
fees agreed to by at least two-thirds of the Company s independent directors. The Company must provide 180 days  prior
notice of any such termination. Unless terminated for cause, as further described in the Management Agreement, the Manager will
be paid a termination fee equal to three times the sum of the base management fee and incentive fee earned, in each case, by the
Manager during the 12-month period immediately preceding such termination, calculated as of the end of the most recently completed
fiscal quarter before the date of termination. The Company may also terminate the Management Agreement at any time, including
during the initial term, without the payment of any termination fee, for cause with 30 days  prior written notice from the
Board. 

During the initial
three-year term of the Management Agreement, the Company may not terminate the Management Agreement except as described above
or in the following circumstance: At the earlier of (i) April 2, 2017 (three years following the completion of the IPO), and (ii)
the date on which the value of the Company s stockholders  equity exceeds $250.0 million, the Board may, but is not
obligated to, internalize the Company s management. The Manager may terminate the Management Agreement if it becomes required
to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, with such termination deemed to occur immediately before
such event, in which case the Company would not be required to pay a termination fee. In addition, if the Company defaults in
the performance of any material term of the Management Agreement and the default continues for a period of 30 days after written
notice to the Company, the Manager may terminate the Management Agreement upon 60 days  written notice. If the Management
Agreement is terminated by the Manager upon a breach by the Company, the Company is required to pay the Manager the termination
fee described above. 

20   

The Manager may retain,
at its sole cost and expense, the services of such persons and firms as the Manager deems necessary in connection with our management
and operations (including accountants, legal counsel and other professional service providers), provided that such expenses are
in amounts no greater than those that would be payable to third-party professionals or consultants engaged to perform such services
pursuant to agreements negotiated on an arm s-length basis. 

Prior and Terminated Advisory Agreement  

Prior to the entry
by the Company into the Management Agreement upon the completion of the IPO and the concurrent termination of the Advisory Agreement,
the Former Advisor performed essentially the same duties and responsibilities as the Company s new Manager. The Advisory
Agreement had a one-year term expiring October 14, 2014, and was renewable for an unlimited number of successive one-year
periods upon the mutual consent of the Company and its Advisor. 

The Former Advisor
was entitled to the payment of certain fees in compensation for advisory and general management services rendered thereunder for
periods prior to the Company s initial public offering on April 2, 2014, and reimbursements for certain costs and expenses
incurred in connection with the provision thereof, in an aggregate amount of $1.18 million. Effective on September 4, 2015, the
Former Advisor and Manager entered into an Assignment Agreement pursuant to which the Former Advisor assigned its right to payment
of the obligation due to the Former Advisor to the Manager. The Manager agreed to receive the payment entirely in LTIP Units of
the Operating Partnership. The obligation was paid by the number of LTIP Units equal to (i) the dollar amount of the obligation
payable in such LTIP Units (calculated as $1.18 million), divided by (ii) the average of the closing prices of the Company s
Class A common stock, $0.01 par value per share, on the NYSE MKT on the five business days prior to the issuance date. The payment
was made through the issuance of 108,119 LTIP Units by the Operating Partnership to the Manager on the September 14, 2015. The
LTIP Units were fully vested upon issuance, and may convert to OP Units upon reaching capital account equivalency with the OP
Units held by the Company, and may then be settled in shares of the Company s Class A common stock. The Manager will be
entitled to receive  distribution equivalents  with respect to the LTIP Units at the same time distributions are paid
to the holders of the Company s Class A common stock. 

Selling Commissions and Dealer Manager
Fees  

In conjunction with
the offering of the Series B Preferred Stock, the Company engaged a related party, as dealer manager, and pays up to 10% of the
gross offering proceeds from the offering as selling commissions and dealer manager fees. The dealer manager may re-allow the
selling commissions and dealer manager fees to participating broker-dealers, and is expected to incur costs in excess of the 10%,
which costs will be borne by the dealer manager. As of September 30, 2016, the Company has incurred $0.6 million and $0.3 million,
in selling commissions and dealer manager fees, respectively. 

All of the Company s
executive officers, and some of its directors, are also executive officers, managers and/or holders of a direct or indirect controlling
interest in the Manager and other Bluerock-affiliated entities.  As a result, they owe fiduciary duties to each of these
entities, their members, limited partners and investors, which fiduciary duties may from time to time conflict with the fiduciary
duties that they owe to the Company and its stockholders. 

Some of the
material conflicts that the Manager or its affiliates face are: 1) the determination of whether an investment opportunity should
be recommended to us or another Bluerock-sponsored program or Bluerock-advised investor; 2) the allocation of the time of key
executive officers, directors, and other real estate professionals among the Company, other Bluerock-sponsored programs and Bluerock-advised
investors, and the activities in which they are involved; and 3) the fees received by the Manager and its affiliates. 

Pursuant to the terms
of the Management Agreement, summarized below are the related party amounts payable to our Manager, as of September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015 (in thousands): 

21   

As of September 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had no amounts and $0.1 million, respectively, in payables due to related parties other
than the Manager. 

As of September 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had $1.0 million and $0.9 million, respectively, in receivables due from related parties
other than the Manager primarily for accrued preferred returns for the most recent month. 

Preferred Equity Investments and Investments in Unconsolidated
Real Estate Joint Ventures  

The Company invests
with related parties in various joint ventures in which the Company owns either preferred or common interests. Please refer to
Footnote 6 for further information. 

Bluerock Property Management,
LLC  

The Company incurred
$0.14 million in property management fees to Bluerock Property Management, LLC, an affiliate of Bluerock, on behalf of the North
Park Towers property during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. No property management fees were payable in 2016 due to
the sale of North Park Towers in October 2015. 

Note 10   Stockholders 
Equity  

Net Income (Loss) Per Common Share  

Basic net income
(loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders, less dividends on restricted
stock expected to vest plus gains on redemptions on common stock, by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding
for the period.  Diluted net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) attributable to common
stockholders by the sum of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and any potential dilutive shares for the
period.  Net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders is computed by adjusting net income (loss) for the non-forfeitable
dividends paid on non-vested restricted stock. 

The Company considers
the requirements of the two-class method when preparing earnings per share. Earnings per share is not affected by the two-class
method because the Company s Class A, B-1, B-2 and B-3 common stock and LTIP Units participate in dividends on a one-for-one
basis. 

The following table reconciles the components
of basic and diluted net (loss) income per common share (amounts in thousands, except share and per share amounts): 

The effect of the
conversion of OP Units is not reflected in the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share, as they are exchangeable for
Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis. The income allocable to such units is allocated on this same basis and reflected
as noncontrolling interests in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. As such, the assumed conversion of these units
would have no net impact on the determination of diluted earnings per share. 

(1)     For
                                         2016, amounts relate to shares of the Company s Class A, B-3 common stock and LTIP
                                         Units outstanding. For 2015, amounts relate to shares of Class A, B-1, B-2 and B-3 common
                                         stock and LTIP Units outstanding.

Class A Common Stock and Class B Common
Stock  

The Company raised
capital in a continuous registered offering, carried out in a manner consistent with offerings of non-listed REITs, from its inception
until September 9, 2013, when it terminated the continuous registered offering in connection with the Board s consideration
of strategic alternatives to maximize value to the Company s stockholders. Through September 9, 2013, the Company had raised
an aggregate of $22.6 million in gross proceeds through its continuous registered offering, including its distribution reinvestment
plan. 

The Company subsequently
determined to register shares of newly authorized Class A common stock that were to be offered in a firmly underwritten public
offering (the  IPO ), by filing a registration statement on Form S-11 (File No. 333-192610) with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (the  SEC ) on November 27, 2013. On March 28, 2014, the SEC declared the registration statement
effective and the Company announced the pricing of the IPO of 3,448,276 shares of Class A common stock at a public offering price
of $14.50 per share for total gross proceeds of $50.0 million. The net proceeds of the IPO, which closed on April 2, 2014, were
approximately $44.0 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering costs. The Company listed its
Class A common stock on the NYSE MKT on March 28, 2014. 

In connection with
the IPO, on January 23, 2014, the Company's stockholders approved the second articles of amendment and restatement to the Company s
charter (the  Second Charter Amendment ), which provided, among other things, for the designation of a new share class
of Class A common stock, and for the change of each existing outstanding share of the Company s common stock into: 

1/3
                                         of a share of Class B-1 common stock; plus    

1/3
                                         of a share of Class B-2 common stock; plus    

1/3
                                         of a share of Class B-3 common stock.    

This transaction
was effective upon filing the Second Charter Amendment with the State Department of Assessments and Taxation of the State of Maryland
on March 26, 2014. Immediately following the filing of the Second Charter Amendment, the Company effectuated a 2.264881 to 1 reverse
stock split of its outstanding shares of Class B-1 common stock, Class B-2 common stock and Class B-3 common stock, and on March
31, 2014, the Company effected an additional 1.0045878 to 1 reverse stock split of its outstanding shares of Class B-1 common
stock, Class B-2 common stock and Class B-3 common stock. 

The Company refers
to Class B-1 common stock, Class B-2 common stock and Class B-3 common stock collectively as  Class B  common stock.
The Class B common stock is identical to the Class A common stock, except that (i) the Company does not intend to list the Class
B common stock on a national securities exchange, and (ii) shares of the Class B common stock convert automatically into shares
of Class A common stock at specified times, as follows: 

On March 23, 2015,
353,630 shares of Class B-1 common stock converted into Class A common stock in accordance with the above, and no Class B-1 common
stock remains outstanding. On September 19, 2015, 353,630 shares of Class B-2 common stock converted into Class A common stock
in accordance with the above, and no Class B-2 common stock remains outstanding. On March 17, 2016, 353,629 shares of Class B-3
common stock converted into Class A common stock in accordance with the above, and no Class B-3 common stock remains outstanding.

Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred
Stock  

The Series A Preferred
Stock ranks senior to common stock and on parity with the Series B Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock as to rights upon
our liquidation, dissolution or winding up. The Series A Preferred Stock is entitled to priority cumulative dividends to be paid
quarterly, in arrears, when, as and if authorized by the board of directors. Commencing October 21, 2022, the annual dividend

limited circumstances related to its qualification as a REIT, complying with an asset coverage ratio or upon a change in control.

At the date of issuance,
the carrying amount of the Series A Preferred Stock was less than the redemption value. As a result of the Company s determination

the redemption amount at the earliest redemption date. Such accretion is recorded as a preferred stock dividend on the Statement
of Stockholders  Equity.

to 10%, after year three it decreases to 5%, after year four it decreases to 3%, and after year five there is no redemption fee.
Any redeemed shares are entitled to any accrued but unpaid dividends at the time of the redemption, payable by the Company at
its option in cash or shares of Class A common stock. The Company may redeem the Series B Preferred Stock beginning two years
from the original issuance for the liquidation preference per share plus any accrued and unpaid dividends in either cash or shares
of Class A common stock, based on the volume weighted average price for the Class A common shares for the 20 trading days prior
to the redemption.

Operating Partnership and Long-Term
Incentive Plan Units  

On April 2, 2014,
concurrently with the completion of the IPO, the Company entered into the Second Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership
of its Operating Partnership, Bluerock Residential Holdings, L.P. Pursuant to the amendment, the Company is the sole general partner
of the Operating Partnership and may not be removed as general partner by the limited partners with or without cause. The limited
partners of the Operating Partnership were Bluerock REIT Holdings, LLC, BR-NPT Springing Entity, LLC ( NPT ), Bluerock
Property Management, LLC ( BPM ), our Manager, and Bluerock Multifamily Advisor, LLC (the  Former Advisor ),
all of which are affiliates of Bluerock. 

Prior to the completion
of the IPO, the Company owned, directly and indirectly, 100% of the limited partnership units in the Operating Partnership. Effective
as of the completion of the IPO, limited partners other than the Company owned approximately 9.87% of the Operating Partnership
(282,759 OP Units, or 4.59%, were held by OP Unit holders, and 325,578 LTIP Units, or 5.28%, were held by LTIP Unit holders.)
As of September 30, 2016, limited partners other than the Company owned approximately 8.22% of the Operating Partnership (301,136
OP Units, or 1.41%, is held by OP Unit holders, and 1,451,527 LTIP Units, or 6.81%, is held by LTIP Unit holders.) 

The Partnership Agreement,
as amended, provides, among other things, that the Operating Partnership initially has two classes of limited partnership interests,
which are units of limited partnership interest ( OP Units ), and the Operating Partnership s long-term incentive
plan units ( LTIP Units ). In calculating the percentage interests of the partners in the Operating Partnership, LTIP
Units are treated as OP Units. In general, LTIP Units will receive the same per-unit distributions as the OP Units. Initially,
each LTIP Unit will have a capital account balance of zero and, therefore, will not have full parity with OP Units with respect
to any liquidating distributions. However, the Partnership Agreement Amendment provides that  book gain,  or economic
appreciation, in the Company s assets realized by the Operating Partnership as a result of the actual sale of all or substantially
all of the Operating Partnership s assets, or the revaluation of the Operating Partnership s assets as provided by
applicable U.S. Department of Treasury regulations, will be allocated first to the holders of LTIP Units until their capital account
per unit is equal to the average capital account per-unit of the Company s OP Unit holders in the Operating Partnership.
The Company expects that the Operating Partnership will issue OP Units to limited partners, and the Company, in exchange for capital
contributions of cash or property, and will issue LTIP Units pursuant to the Company s Amended and Restated 2014 Equity
Incentive Plan for Individuals and Amended and Restated 2014 Equity Incentive Plan for Entities (collectively, the  Amended
2014 Incentive Plans ), to persons who provide services to the Company, including the Company s officers, directors
and employees. 

Pursuant to the Partnership
Agreement, as amended, any holders of OP Units, other than the Company or its subsidiaries, will receive redemption rights which,
subject to certain restrictions and limitations, will enable them to cause the Operating Partnership to redeem their OP Units
in exchange for cash or, at the Company s option, shares of the Company s Class A common stock, on a one-for-one basis.
The Company agreed to file, not earlier than one year after the closing of the IPO, one or more registration statements registering
the issuance or resale of shares of its Class A common stock issuable upon redemption of the OP Units issued upon conversion of
LTIP Units, which include those issued to the Manager and the Former Advisor. Subject to certain exceptions, the Operating Partnership
will pay all expenses in connection with the exercise of registration rights under the Partnership Agreement. The Resale Shelf
Registration Statement covers all such OP Units and LTIP Units issued prior to January 18, 2016. 

The Operating Partnership,
in conjunction with the issuance of preferred stock by the Company, has issued preferred OP Units which provide for similar rights
as for each class of preferred stock.

Equity Incentive Plans  

Prior to the Company s
IPO on April 2, 2014, the Company s independent directors received an automatic grant of 5,000 shares of restricted
stock on the initial effective date of the continuous registered offering and received an automatic grant of 2,500 shares
of restricted stock when such directors were re-elected at each annual meeting of the Company s stockholders thereafter
through the 2013 annual meeting held on August 5, 2013. The restricted stock vested 20% at the time of the grant and 20% on each
anniversary thereafter over four years from the date of the grant. All shares of restricted stock granted to the independent directors
receive distributions, whether vested or unvested. The value of the restricted stock granted was determined at the date of grant.
Commencing with the Company s IPO, the Company s independent directors no longer receive automatic grants upon appointment
or reelection at each annual meeting of the Company s stockholders. 

On March 24, 2015,
in accordance with the Company s 2014 Equity Incentive Plan for Individuals (the  2014 Individuals Plan ), the
Board authorized and each of the Company s independent directors received two grants of 2,500 restricted shares of the Company s
Class A common stock. The first grant of 2,500 restricted shares related to services rendered in 2014 (each, a  2014 Restricted
Stock Award ), while the second grant of 2,500 restricted shares relates to services rendered or to be rendered in 2015
(each, a  2015 Restricted Stock Award ). The vesting schedule for each 2014 Restricted Stock Award was as follows:
(i) 834 shares as of March 24, 2015, (ii) 833 shares on March 24, 2016, and (iii) 833 shares on March 24, 2017. The vesting schedule
for each 2015 Restricted Stock Award was as follows: (i) 834 shares as of March 24, 2016, (ii) 833 shares on March 24, 2017, and
(iii) 833 shares on March 24, 2018.  The stock awards were made pursuant to certain stock award agreements by and between
the Company and each independent director, each dated effective as of March 24, 2015 (collectively, the  2014-2015 Stock
Award Agreements ). 

On February
22, 2016, the board reviewed peer REIT compensation practices for independent directors, and found that equity awards for peer
REITs generally vest either on the grant date, or after one year. In order to normalize compensation practices with peer REITs,
on February 22, 2016, the board approved the amendment of each of the 2014-2015 Stock Award Agreements, effective as of March
24, 2016, such that the Stock Awards that did not vest on the grant date of March 24, 2015 vested on the one-year anniversary
of such grant date. As a result, (i) 1,666 shares of the 2014 Stock Award to each independent director, and (ii) all 2,500 shares
of the 2015 Stock Award to each independent director, became vested and nonforfeitable on March 24, 2016. The expense for the
accelerated vesting was approximately $0.1 million which was recorded in the three months ended March 31, 2016. 

On May 28, 2015,
the Company s stockholders approved the amendment and restatement of the 2014 Individuals Plan (the  Amended 2014
Individuals Plan ), and the Company s 2014 Entities Plan (the  Amended 2014 Entities Plan  and together
with the Amended 2014 Individuals Plan, the  Amended 2014 Incentive Plans ). The Amended 2014 Incentive Plans allow
for the issuance of up to 475,000 shares of Class A common stock. The Amended 2014 Incentive Plans provide for the grant of options
to purchase shares of the Company s common stock, stock awards, stock appreciation rights, performance units, incentive
awards and other equity-based awards. 

On March 24, 2016,
the Company granted a total of 7,500 shares of Class A common stock to its independent directors. The fair value of the grants
was approximately $0.1 million and the shares vested immediately. 

A summary of the
status of the Company s non-vested shares as of September 30, 2016 is as follows (amounts in thousands, except share amounts):  

(1)  
The number of shares and per share amounts for the prior period have been retroactively restated to reflect the two reverse stock
splits of the Class B common stock discussed above. 

At September 30,
2016, there was $0.01 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested restricted stocks granted under the
independent director compensation plan. The original cost is expected to be recognized over a period of 0.83 years.

Equity Incentive Plans - LTIP Grants  

On July 2, 2015,
the Company issued a grant of LTIP Units under the Amended 2014 Incentive Plans to the Manager. The equity grant consisted of
283,390 LTIP Units (the  2015 LTIP Units ). The 2015 LTIP Units will vest ratably over a three year period that began
in July 2015, subject to certain terms and conditions. On August 3, 2016, the Company issued a grant of LTIP Units under the Amended
2014 Incentive Plans to the Manager. The equity grant consisted of 176,610 LTIP Units (the  2016 LTIP Units ). The
2016 LTIP Units will vest ratably over a three year period that began in August 2016, subject to certain terms and conditions.
These LTIP Units may be convertible into OP Units under certain conditions and then may be settled in shares of the Company s
Class A common stock. These LTIP Units provide for the payment of distribution equivalents at the same time distributions are
paid to holders of the Company s Class A common stock. 

LTIP expense of $0.5
million and $1.7 million was recorded as part of general and administrative expenses for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2016, respectively, related to the 2015 LTIP Units and the 2016 LTIP Units. The expense recognized during 2016 was based primarily
on a price of $13.00 per LTIP Unit, which represents the closing share price for the Company s Class A common stock on September
30, 2016. 

Distributions  

A portion of each
dividend may constitute a return of capital for tax purposes. There is no assurance that the Company will continue to declare
dividends or at this rate. 

Holders of OP and
LTIP Units are entitled to receive  distribution equivalents  at the same time as dividends are paid to holders of the
Company's Class A common stock. 

The Company has a
dividend reinvestment plan that allows for participating stockholders to have their dividend distributions automatically invested
in additional Class A common shares based on the average price of the shares on the investment date. The Company plans to issue
Class A common shares to cover shares required for investment. 

28   

Distributions
declared and paid for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were as follows (amounts in thousands):

On March 15, 2016,
the Company, through its Operating Partnership and several affiliated unconsolidated co-borrowers that are accounted for on the
equity method of accounting, entered into an approximately $14.9 million secured credit facility ( Credit Facility )
with KeyBank as lender. The proceeds of the Credit Facility may be used for payment (or reimbursement) of acquisition costs, fees
and expenses of the mortgaged properties and to fund interest advances. Draws under the Credit Facility are secured by properties
owned by unconsolidated real estate joint ventures in Garland, Texas, Charlotte, North Carolina and Fort Lauderdale, Florida.
At the closing of the loan, an initial advance of approximately $10.4 million was made directly to the affiliated property entities
and the liability was recorded by the unconsolidated entities and prior advances were repaid to the Operating Partnership. Principal
amounts may be repaid at any time without penalty, and amounts repaid may not be re-borrowed. The borrowings under the Credit
Facility are at a rate equal to LIBOR plus 3.75% or the base rate plus 2.75%, at the company s option. Our Operating Partnership s
obligations with respect to the Credit Facility are guaranteed by us, pursuant to the terms of a limited recourse guaranty dated
as of March 15, 2016. The outstanding credit facility balance at September 30, 2016, was $10.6 million.

Overview  

We were incorporated
as a Maryland corporation on July 25, 2008. Our objective is to maximize long-term stockholder value by acquiring well-located
institutional-quality apartment properties in demographically attractive growth markets across the United States. We seek to maximize
returns through investments where we believe we can drive substantial growth in our funds from operations, adjusted funds from
operations and net asset value through one or more of our Core-Plus, Value-Add, Opportunistic and Invest-to-Own investment strategies. 

We are externally managed
by our Manager, an affiliate of Bluerock. We conduct our operations through Bluerock Residential Holdings, L.P., our operating
partnership (the  Operating Partnership ), of which we are the sole general partner. The consolidated financial statements
include our accounts and those of the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries. 

As of September 30,
2016, our portfolio consisted of interests in twenty-five properties (seventeen operating properties and eight development properties).
The twenty-five properties contain an aggregate of 7,790 units, comprised of 5,573 operating units and 2,217 units under development.
As of September 30, 2016, these properties, exclusive of our development properties, and EOS, a lease-up property, were approximately
94% occupied. 

We have elected to
be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Code and have qualified as a REIT commencing with our taxable year ended
December 31, 2010. In order to continue to qualify as a REIT, we must distribute to our stockholders each calendar year at least
90% of our taxable income (excluding net capital gains). If we qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we generally
will not be subject to federal income tax on income that we distribute to our stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in
any taxable year, we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates and will not be permitted
to qualify as a REIT for four years following the year in which our qualification is denied. Such an event could materially and
adversely affect our net income and results of operations. We intend to continue to organize and operate in such a manner as to
remain qualified as a REIT. 

Significant Developments  

During the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, we made one convertible preferred investment, one common interest investment, acquired four stabilized
properties and disposed of one property as discussed below. 

Acquisition of Summer Wind and Citation
Club Apartments  

On January 5, 2016,
we, through subsidiaries of our Operating Partnership, completed investments of approximately $15.9 million and approximately

Gulfshore ) and (ii) a 320-unit apartment community located in Sarasota, Florida to be known as ARIUM at Palmer Ranch, formerly

interest in the joint venture that owns ARIUM Gulfshore and ARIUM at Palmer Ranch is 95.0%. ARIUM Gulfshore s purchase price

Our indirect ownership interest in the joint venture that owns Westside is 90%. The purchase price for Westside of approximately
$74.5 million was funded, in part, with a $52.2 million senior mortgage loan secured by the Westside leasehold interest (the  Westside

we closed on the sale of the Springhouse at Newport News property, located in Newport News, Virginia, and the buyout of our 25%
joint venture partner in conjunction with the sale. The property was sold for approximately $38.0 million, subject to certain
prorations and adjustments typical in such real estate transactions. After deduction for the defeasance of the existing mortgage
indebtedness encumbering the Springhouse at Newport News property in the amount of $25.4 million and payment of closing costs
and fees of $0.5 million the sale of the property generated net proceeds for us of approximately $9.0 million and a gain on sale
of approximately $4.9 million.

through a wholly-owned subsidiary of our Operating Partnership, we made an investment in a multi-tiered joint venture, along with

million, and an increase in interest expense, net, of $6.1 million, as the result of the increase in mortgages payable resulting
from the acquisition of interests in the properties mentioned above and loss on extinguishment of debt of $2.4 million related
to the sale of Springhouse and the refinancing of the Lansbrook Village property. 

Property Operations   

We define  same
store  properties as those that we owned and operated for the entirety of both periods being compared, except for properties
that are in the construction or lease-up phases, or properties that are undergoing development or significant redevelopment.
We move properties previously excluded from our same store portfolio for these reasons into the same store designation once they
have stabilized or the development or redevelopment is complete and such status has been reflected fully in all quarters during
the applicable periods of comparison. For newly constructed or lease-up properties or properties undergoing significant redevelopment,
we consider a property stabilized upon attainment of 90% physical occupancy, subject to loss-to-lease, bad debt and rent concessions. 
For comparison of our three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the same store properties included properties owned at July
1, 2015. Our same store properties for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were Enders Place at Baldwin Park, Village
Green of Ann Arbor, MDA Apartments, Lansbrook Village, ARIUM Grandewood, Fox Hill and Park   Kingston. Our non-same store
properties for the same period were Springhouse at Newport News, North Park Towers, Ashton Reserve, ARIUM Palms, Sovereign, Sorrel,
ARIUM Gulfshore, ARIUM at Palmer Ranch, The Preserve at Henderson Beach and ARIUM Westside. For comparison of our nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the same store properties included properties owned at January 1, 2015. Our same store properties
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were Enders Place at Baldwin Park, Village Green of Ann Arbor, MDA Apartments,
Lansbrook Village and ARIUM Grandewood. Our non-same store properties for the same period were 23Hundred@Berry Hill, Springhouse
at Newport News, North Park Towers, Fox Hill, Park   Kingston, Ashton Reserve, ARIUM Palms, Sovereign, Sorrel, ARIUM Gulfshore,
ARIUM at Palmer Ranch, The Preserve at Henderson Beach and ARIUM Westside. 

38   

23Hundred@Berry Hill
was accounted for under the equity method during the nine months September 30, 2015, but is reflected in our table of net operating
income as if it was consolidated. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the components of non-same store property revenues,
property expenses and net operating income represented by this property were $0.2 million, $0.1 million and $0.1 million, respectively.
23Hundred@Berry Hill financial information can be found at Note 3,  Sale of Unconsolidated Real Estate Joint Ventures and
Held for Sale Property.  Berry Hill was sold on January 14, 2015. 

The following table
presents the same store and non-same store results from operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015: 

(1)  See  Net
Operating Income  below for a reconciliation of Same Store NOI, Non-Same Store NOI and Total NOI to net income (loss) and
a discussion of how management uses this non-GAAP financial measure. 

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Three
Months Ended September 30, 2015   

Same store NOI for
the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased by 8.1% to $5.7 million from $5.3 million for the 2015 period. There was a
7.5% increase in same store property revenues as compared to the 2015 period, primarily attributable to a 4.7% increase in average
rental rates, a 39 basis point increase in average occupancy, 16 additional units at our Lansbrook Village property and 15 additional
units at Park   Kingston. Same store expenses increased 6.5% as the three months ended September 30, 2015 included favorable
real estate tax adjustments at two properties. 

Property revenues
and property expenses for our non-same store properties increased significantly due to the properties acquired during 2016 and
2015. The results of operations for these properties have been included in our consolidated statements of operations from the
date of acquisition. 

39   

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Nine
Months Ended September 30, 2015   

Same store NOI for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased by 7.4% to $13.9 million from $13.0 million for the 2015 period. There was
a 5.6% increase in same store property revenues as compared to the 2015 period, primarily attributable to a 4.7% increase in average
rental rates, a 55 basis point increase in average occupancy, 16 additional units at our Lansbrook Village property and 15 additional
units at Park   Kingston. Same store expenses increased 2.7%. 

Property revenues
and property expenses for our non-same store properties increased significantly due to the properties acquired during 2016 and
2015. The results of operations for these properties have been included in our consolidated statements of operations from the
date of acquisition. 

Net Operating Income   

We believe that net
operating income ( NOI ), is a useful measure of our operating performance. We define NOI as total property revenues
less total property operating expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization and interest. Other REITs may use different methodologies
for calculating NOI, and accordingly, our NOI may not be comparable to other REITs. NOI also is a computation made by analysts
and investors to measure a real estate company's operating performance. 

We believe that this
measure provides an operating perspective not immediately apparent from GAAP operating income or net income. We use NOI to evaluate
our performance on a same store and non-same store basis because NOI allows us to evaluate the operating performance of our properties
because it measures the core operations of property performance by excluding corporate level expenses and other items not related
to property operating performance and captures trends in rental housing and property operating expenses. 

However, NOI should
only be used as an alternative measure of our financial performance. The following table reflects same store and non-same store
contributions to consolidated NOI, together with a reconciliation of NOI to net (loss) income attributable to common stockholders,
as computed in accordance with GAAP for the periods presented (amounts in thousands): 

40   

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

Liquidity is a measure
of our ability to meet potential cash requirements. Our primary short-term liquidity requirements relate to (a) our operating
expenses and other general business needs, (b) distributions to our stockholders, (c) committed investments and capital requirements
to fund development and renovations at existing properties, and (d) ongoing commitments to repay maturing short-term debt. 

The Company believes
the properties underlying its real estate investments are performing well. The Company had a portfolio-wide debt service coverage
ratio of 2.17x and occupancy of 94%, exclusive of its development properties, at September 30, 2016. In the recent past, we have
met our short-term liquidity requirements through revenues on our multifamily investments and the proceeds of our equity offerings. 

The net proceeds
of our IPO and our follow-on common and preferred stock offerings (collectively the  Follow-On Offerings ), provided
us with the ability to grow our asset base quickly and better service our general and administrative expenses. At the same time,
the Management Agreement with our Manager provides an overall lower relative fee structure than our previous Advisory Agreement
with our Former Advisor, which we believe has reduced our corporate general and administrative expenses as a percentage of our
revenues. 

In general, we believe
our cash flows from operations, available cash balances, the use of equity offerings, including the ATM Offerings, the April 2016
Preferred Stock Offering, the May 2016 Preferred Stock Offering, the Series B Preferred Offering, the July 2016 Preferred Stock
Offering, and the October 2016 Preferred Stock Offering and other future financing arrangements will be sufficient to fund our
liquidity requirements with respect to our existing portfolio for the next 12 months. 

41   

Our primary long-term
liquidity requirements relate to (a) costs for additional apartment community investments; (b) repayment of long-term debt; (c)
capital expenditures; and (d) cash redemption requirements related to our Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock. 

We intend to finance
our long-term liquidity requirements with net proceeds of additional issuances of common and preferred stock, including our Series
B Preferred Stock, as well as future borrowings. Our success in meeting these requirements will therefore depend upon our ability
to access capital. Our ability to access capital is dependent upon, among other things, general market conditions for REITs and
the capital markets generally, market perceptions about us and our asset class, and current trading prices of our securities.  

We may also selectively
sell assets at appropriate times, which would be expected to generate cash sources for both our short-term and long-term liquidity
needs. 

We may also meet
our long-term liquidity needs through borrowings from a number of sources, either at the corporate or project level. We will continue
to monitor the debt markets, including Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and as market conditions permit, access borrowings that are
advantageous to us. 

We intend to continue
to use prudent amounts of leverage in making our investments, which we define as having total indebtedness of approximately 65%
of the fair market value of the properties in which we have invested as determined by our Manager. For purposes of calculating
our leverage, we assume full consolidation of all of our real estate investments, whether or not they would be consolidated under
GAAP, include assets we have classified as held for sale, and include any joint venture level indebtedness in our total indebtedness.
However, we are not subject to any limitations on the amount of leverage we may use, and accordingly, the amount of leverage we
use may be significantly less or greater than we currently anticipate. We expect our leverage to decline commensurately as we
execute our business plan to grow our net asset value. 

If we are unable
to obtain financing on favorable terms or at all, we would likely need to curtail our investment activities, including acquisitions
and improvements, to and developments of, real properties, which could limit our growth prospects. This, in turn, could reduce
cash available for distribution to our stockholders and may hinder our ability to raise capital by issuing more securities or
borrowing more money. We also may be forced to dispose of assets at inopportune times in order to maintain our REIT qualification
and Investment Company Act exemption. 

In prior quarters,
including the six months ended June 30, 2015, our Manager waived current year reimbursable operating expenses to support our continued
operations. Operating expense reimbursements of $0.1 million were expensed during the three months ended September 30, 2015, were
reimbursed in cash and are recorded as part of general and administrative expenses. Operating expense reimbursements of $0.1 million
were expensed during the three months ended December 31, 2015, which were paid through the issuance of 14,138 LTIP Units on February
29, 2016. Operating expense reimbursements of $0.5 million were expensed during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, were
reimbursed in cash and are recorded as part of general and administrative expenses. 

For the remainder
of 2016, the Company expects to maintain a distribution paid on a monthly basis to all of our Class A common stockholders at a
quarterly rate of $0.29 per share. To the extent the Company continues to pay distributions at this rate, the Company expects
to substantially use cash flows from operations to fund distribution payments. The Board will review the distribution rate quarterly,
and there can be no assurance that the current distribution level will be maintained. While our policy is generally to pay distributions
from cash flow from operations, our distributions through September 30, 2016 have been paid from cash flow from operations, proceeds
from our continuous registered public offering, proceeds from the IPO and Follow-On Offerings and sales of assets, and may in
the future be paid from additional sources, such as from borrowings. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

As of September 30,
2016, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have had or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our
financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital resources or capital expenditures. As of
September 30, 2016, we own interests in ten joint ventures that are accounted for under the equity method as we exercise significant
influence over, but do not control, the investee. 

Cash Flows from Operating Activities  

As of September 30,
2016, we owned indirect equity interests in twenty-five real estate properties (seventeen operating properties and eight development
properties), fifteen of which are consolidated for reporting purposes.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
net cash provided by operating activities was $24.3 million.  After the net loss of $3.0 million was reduced for $15.7
million of non-cash items, net cash provided by operating activities consisted of the following: 

Distributions from unconsolidated joint ventures of $8.3
                                         million;   

Increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of
                                         $7.3 million;   

42   

Increase in payables due to
affiliates of $0.7 million; 

Partially offset by a decrease in our accounts receivable
                                         and other assets of $3.6 million;   

and $1.1 million of early extinguishment of debt.   

Cash Flows from Investing Activities  

During the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, net cash used in investing activities was $179.1 million, primarily due to the following: 

$178.4 million used in acquiring consolidated real estate
                                         investments;   

$17.1 million used in acquiring investments in unconsolidated
                                         joint ventures;   

$3.2 million purchase of interests from noncontrolling
                                         interests;   

$13.1 million increase in restricted cash;   

$4.0 million used on capital expenditures; and   

Partially offset by proceeds of sale of real estate assets
                                         of $36.7 million.   

Cash Flows from Financing Activities  

During the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, net cash provided by financing activities was $216.4 million, primarily due to the following: 

net borrowings of $177.7 million on mortgages payable;   

net proceeds of $68.5 million from issuance of Series
                                         A preferred stock;   

net borrowings of $63.5 million on mortgages payable;   

net proceeds of $7.6 million from issuance of Series B
                                         preferred units;   

net proceeds of $56.0 million from issuance of Series
                                         C preferred stock;   

$4.1 million of contributions from noncontrolling interests;   

partially offset by $2.8 million in distributions paid
                                         to our noncontrolling interests;   

$18.2 million paid in cash distributions paid to common
                                         stockholders;   

$5.6 million paid in cash distributions paid to preferred
                                         stockholders;   

$6.0 million paid in cash distributions paid to common
                                         stockholders;   

$2.9 million increase in deferred financing costs; and   

$6.0 million paid in cash distributions paid to common
                                         stockholders;   

$68.1 million of repayments of our mortgages payable.   

Capital Expenditures  

The following table
summarizes our total capital expenditures for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 (amounts in thousands): 

We define redevelopment
and renovation costs as non-recurring capital expenditures for significant projects that upgrade units or common areas and projects
that are revenue enhancing for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. We define routine capital expenditures as capital expenditures
that are incurred at every property and exclude development, investment, revenue enhancing and non-recurring capital expenditures. 

43   

Funds
from Operations and Adjusted Funds from Operations, Attributable to Common Stockholders  

Funds from operations
attributable to common stockholders ( FFO ), is a non-GAAP financial measure that is widely recognized as a measure
of REIT operating performance. We consider FFO to be an appropriate supplemental measure of our operating performance as
it is based on a net income analysis of property portfolio performance that excludes non-cash items such as depreciation. The
historical accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight-line depreciation of buildings and improvements,
which implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values historically rise
and fall with market conditions, presentations of operating results for a REIT, using historical accounting for depreciation,
could be less informative. We define FFO, consistent with the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT's,
definition, as net income, computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains (or losses) from sales of property, plus depreciation
and amortization of real estate assets, plus impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate, and after adjustments for unconsolidated
partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect
FFO on the same basis. 

In addition to FFO,
we use adjusted funds from operations attributable to common stockholders ( AFFO ). AFFO is a computation made by
analysts and investors to measure a real estate company's operating performance by removing the effect of items that do not reflect
ongoing property operations. In computing AFFO, we further adjust FFO by adding back certain items that are not added to net income
in NAREIT's definition of FFO, such as acquisition expenses, equity based compensation expenses, and any other non-recurring or
non-cash expenses, which are costs that do not relate to the operating performance of our properties, and subtracting recurring
capital expenditures (and when calculating the quarterly incentive fee payable to our Manager only, we further adjust FFO to include
any realized gains or losses on our real estate investments). 

During the nine
months ended September 30, 2016, we incurred $2.1 million of acquisition expense and $0.4 million of disposition expense, of
which $2.5 million was our pro rata share of the expense. We incurred $1.4 million of acquisition expense and $0.8 million of
disposition expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2015, of which $1.4 million was our pro-rata share of
expense. 

Our calculation of
AFFO differs from the methodology used for calculating AFFO by certain other REITs and, accordingly, our AFFO may not be comparable
to AFFO reported by other REITs. Our management utilizes FFO and AFFO as measures of our operating performance after adjustment
for certain non-cash items, such as depreciation and amortization expenses, and acquisition expenses and pursuit costs that are
required by GAAP to be expensed but may not necessarily be indicative of current operating performance and that may not accurately
compare our operating performance between periods. Furthermore, although FFO, AFFO and other supplemental performance measures
are defined in various ways throughout the REIT industry, we also believe that FFO and AFFO may provide us and our stockholders
with an additional useful measure to compare our financial performance to certain other REITs. We also use AFFO for purposes of
determining the quarterly incentive fee, if any, payable to our Manager. 

Neither FFO nor AFFO
is equivalent to net income or cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP. Furthermore, FFO and
AFFO do not represent amounts available for management's discretionary use because of needed capital replacement or expansion,
debt service obligations or other commitments or uncertainties. Neither FFO nor AFFO should be considered as an alternative to
net income as an indicator of our operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure
of our liquidity. 

We have acquired
interests in six additional properties and five investments accounted for on the equity method of accounting and sold two properties
subsequent to September 30, 2015. The results presented in the table below are not directly comparable and should not be
considered an indication of our future operating performance. 

44   

The table below presents
our calculation of FFO and AFFO for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 (in thousands): 

(1)  The real estate
depreciation and amortization amount includes our share of consolidated real estate-related depreciation and amortization of intangibles,
less amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests, and our similar estimated share of unconsolidated depreciation and amortization,
which is included in earnings of our unconsolidated real estate joint venture investments.    

  (2)  Normally recurring
capital expenditures exclude development, investment, revenue enhancing and non-recurring capital expenditures. 

Operating cash flow,
FFO and AFFO may also be used to fund all or a portion of certain capitalizable items that are excluded from FFO and AFFO, such
as tenant improvements, building improvements and deferred leasing costs. 

Presentation of this
information is intended to assist the reader in comparing the sustainability of the operating performance of different REITs,
although it should be noted that not all REITs calculate FFO or AFFO the same way, so comparisons with other REITs may not be
meaningful.  FFO or AFFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss), as an indication of our liquidity,
nor is either indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions.  Both
FFO and AFFO should be reviewed in connection with other GAAP measurements. 

45   

Contractual Obligations  

The following table summarizes our contractual
obligations as of September 30, 2016 (in thousands) which consisted of mortgage notes secured by our properties. At September
30, 2016, our estimated future required payments on these obligations were: 

Estimated interest payments are based
on the stated rates for mortgage notes payable assuming the interest rate in effect for the most recent quarter remains in effect
through the respective maturity dates. 

Distributions  

46   

A portion of each
dividend may constitute a return of capital for tax purposes. There is no assurance that the Company will continue to declare
dividends or at this rate. 

Our Board will determine
the amount of dividends to be paid to our stockholders. The Board s determination will be based on a number of factors,
including funds available from operations, our capital expenditure requirements and the annual distribution requirements necessary
to maintain our REIT status under the Internal Revenue Code. As a result, our distribution rate and payment frequency may vary
from time to time.  However, to qualify as a REIT for tax purposes, we must make distributions equal to at least 90% of our
 REIT taxable income  each year. Especially during the early stages of our operations, we may declare distributions
in excess of funds from operations. 

Distributions paid
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, were funded from cash provided by operating activities except
with respect to $2.5 million and $0 respectively, which was funded from sales of real estate, borrowings, and/or proceeds from
our equity offerings.   

Significant Accounting Policies and
Critical Accounting Estimates  

Our significant accounting
policies and critical accounting estimates are disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015
and Note 2  Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 

Subsequent Events  

Other than the items
disclosed in Note 12,  Subsequent Events  to our interim Consolidated Financial Statements for the period ended September
30, 2016, no material events have occurred that required recognition or disclosure in these financial statements.  See Note
12 to our interim Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion. 

47   

Item 3.  Quantitative and
Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk  

We are exposed to
interest rate risk primarily through borrowing activities. There is inherent roll-over risk for borrowings as they mature and
are renewed at current market rates. The extent of this risk is not quantifiable or predictable because of the variability of
future interest rates and our future financing requirements. We are not subject to foreign exchange rates or commodity price risk,
and all of our financial instruments were entered into for other than trading purposes. 

Our interest rate
risk is monitored using a variety of techniques. The table below presents the principal payments and the weighted average interest
rates on outstanding debt, by year of expected maturity, to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate
changes. 

($ in thousands)  

The fair value (in thousands) is estimated
at $543.7 million for mortgages payable as of September 30, 2016. 

The table above incorporates those exposures
that exist as of September 30, 2016; it does not consider those exposures or positions which could arise after that date. As a
result, our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise
during the period and interest rates. 

As of September 30, 2016, a 100 basis
point increase or decrease in interest rates on the portion of our debt bearing interest at variable rates would result in an
increase in interest expense of approximately $575,000 or decrease by $303,000, respectively, for the quarter ended September
30, 2016. The difference between the interest expense amounts related to an increase or decrease in our floating rate is because
LIBOR was 0.53% at September 30, 2016, therefore we have limited the estimate of how much the interest costs may decrease as we
use a floor of 0% for LIBOR.    

Item 4.  Controls and Procedures  

Disclosure Controls and Procedures  

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and
Procedures  

As required by Rule
13a-15(b) and Rule 15d-15(b) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ), our management,
including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Accounting Officer, evaluated, as of September 30, 2016, the effectiveness of
our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e).  Based on that evaluation,
our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Accounting Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective
as of September 30, 2016, to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us in this report filed
or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the rules
and forms of the Exchange Act and is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Accounting Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 

We believe, however,
that a controls system, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the
controls systems are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of
fraud or error, if any, within a company have been detected. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting  

There has been no
change in internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2016 that has materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

48   

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION  

Item 1. Legal Proceedings   

None. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors  

Other than the following,
there have been no material changes to our potential risks and uncertainties presented in the section entitled  Risk Factors 
in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 filed with the SEC on February 24, 2016. 

Your interests could be diluted by
the incurrence of additional debt, the issuance of additional shares of preferred stock, including additional shares of Series
A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock and Series D Preferred Stock (together the  Preferred
Stock ) and by other transactions.   

As of September 30, 2016, our total long
term indebtedness was approximately $529.1 million, and we may incur significant additional debt in the future. The Preferred
Stock is subordinate to all of our existing and future debt and liabilities and those of our subsidiaries. Our future debt may
include restrictions on our ability to pay dividends to preferred stockholders in the event of a default under the debt facilities
or under other circumstances. Our charter currently authorizes the issuance of up to 250,000,000 shares of preferred stock in
one or more classes or series, and as of the date of this filing, we have issued 5,721,460 shares of Series A Preferred Stock
(146,460 of which have been issued in the Series A ATM Offering), 10,546 shares of Series B Preferred Stock, 2,323,750 shares
of Series C Preferred Stock and 2,850,602 shares of Series D Preferred Stock. The issuance of additional preferred stock on parity
with or senior to the Preferred Stock would dilute the interests of the holders of shares of Preferred Stock, and any issuance
of preferred stock senior to the Preferred Stock or of additional indebtedness could affect our ability to pay dividends on, redeem
or pay the liquidation preference on the Preferred Stock. We may issue preferred stock on parity with the Preferred Stock without
the consent of the holders of the Preferred Stock. Other than the Asset Coverage Ratio and the right of holders to cause us to
redeem the Series A Preferred Stock and Series C Preferred Stock upon a Change of Control/Delisting, none of the provisions relating
to the Preferred Stock relate to or limit our indebtedness or afford the holders of shares of Preferred Stock protection in the
event of a highly leveraged or other transaction, including a merger or the sale, lease or conveyance of all or substantially
all our assets or business, that might adversely affect the holders of shares of Preferred Stock.

All of the Bonds shall be equally and ratably secured by this Indenture and by the pledge herein made, it being expressly understood
and agreed that no Bonds issued hereunder shall be prior to any other Bonds thereafter issued hereunder, but shall be on a parity
therewith, with respect to the pledge of this Indenture. 

Section 202.  Dates and
Places of Payment of Bonds . Each series of the Bonds shall bear such date as shall be specified in this Indenture or in the
supplemental indenture providing for the issuance thereof and shall mature on such dates in such years and in such amounts as

maturities shall be payable at such rates as shall be fixed therefor prior to the issuance thereof. 

The Bonds shall be issued as
fully registered Bonds as hereinafter provided. 

Each Bond
shall be dated the date of its authentication and delivery by the Trustee. The Bonds shall bear interest from the Interest Payment
Date next preceding the date of authentication of such Bond to which interest has been paid or provided for, unless: (1) the date
of authentication of such Bond is an Interest Payment Date to which interest has been paid or provided for, then from the date

of and interest on each of the Bonds shall be payable in lawful money of the United States of America by check to the owner thereof
delivered at the address of such owner as shown on the bond register maintained by the Trustee as Bond Registrar (the  Bond
Register ), unless there shall be in effect a home office payment agreement satisfactory to the Trustee, as provided in

of the Trustee upon any such Bond shall be conclusive evidence that such Bond has been authenticated and delivered under this
Indenture. Said certificate of authentication on any Bond shall be deemed to have been executed by the Trustee if signed by an

Bond, such mutilated Bond shall first be surrendered to the Trustee, and in the case of any lost, stolen or destroyed Bond, there
shall be first furnished to the Issuer and the Trustee evidence satisfactory to them and to the Company of the ownership of such
Bond and of such loss, theft or destruction, together with indemnity satisfactory to them. If any such Bond shall have fully matured,

the principal of and interest on such Bond shall be made only to or upon the order of the registered owner thereof, or its attorney
duly authorized in writing, and neither the Issuer, the Trustee (acting in its capacity as Bond Registrar or otherwise), nor any
paying agent acting for the Issuer shall be affected by any notice to the contrary. All such payments shall be valid and effectual

in this Indenture to the contrary notwithstanding, there shall not be effected, and the Trustee acting as Bond Registrar shall

of the Bonds in satisfaction of the principal and interest on the Bonds). The Trustee agrees to make or permit to be made payments
of principal and interest on the Bonds in accordance with the provisions of such home office payment agreement. The Trustee shall
not be liable to any such owner or to the Issuer for any act or omission to act on the part of the Issuer, any such owner or any
agent of the Issuer, in connection with any such agreement, and the Trustee shall have no obligation in connection with any payment
of principal or interest made in compliance with any such agreement and shall not be deemed to have notice of any default in the

trades, including cash sweep account fees.  In  the absence of investment instructions from
the Company or the Authorized Lessee Representative, as applicable, the Trustee shall not be responsible or liable for keeping
the moneys held by it hereunder fully invested in permitted investments.

required to be issued by the Trustee for each month in which a monthly statement is rendered. No statement need be rendered for
any fund or account if no activity occurred in such fund or account during such month.

ARTICLE XI. 

DEFAULT PROVISIONS AND REMEDIES   

  OF TRUSTEE  AND
 BONDHOLDERS  

Section 1101.  Defaults;
Events of Default .  If  any of the following events occurs, subject to the terms of Section
1112 hereof, it is hereby defined as and declared to be and to constitute an  event of default  under this Indenture: 

(a)          default
in the due and punctual payment of any interest on any Bond; or 

(b)          default
in the due and punctual payment of the principal of any Bond, whether at the maturity thereof or any prepayment date prior to
maturity, or upon maturity thereof by declaration; or 

(c)          default
in the performance or observance of any other of the covenants, agreements or conditions on the part of the Issuer in this Indenture
or in the Bonds contained; or 

(d)          the
occurrence of an  Event of Default  under the Lease Agreement as provided in Section 10.1 thereof; or 

(e)          the
Company shall have effected a transaction in violation of Section 8.3 of the Lease Agreement. 

Section
1102.  Acceleration . Upon the occurrence of an event of default, and subject to the waiver provisions of Section 1111 hereof,
the owners of not less than 25% in principal amount of Bonds outstanding may, by notice in writing, instruct the Trustee, to declare
the principal of all Bonds and the interest accrued thereon to the date of such acceleration immediately due and payable, by notice
in writing delivered to the Issuer, and the same shall thereupon become and be immediately due and payable. Upon any declaration
of acceleration hereunder, the Trustee shall immediately declare all rental payments due under the Lease Agreement to be immediately
due and payable in accordance with Section 10.2 of the Lease Agreement. 

Section 1103.  Other Remedies .
Upon the occurrence of an event of default, and subject to the waiver provisions of Section 1111 hereof, the Trustee, subject

and laws of the State of Georgia, as it may deem best, including any suit, action or special proceeding in equity or at law for
the specific performance of any covenant or agreement contained herein or for the enforcement of any proper, legal or equitable
remedy as the Trustee shall deem most effectual to protect the rights aforesaid, insofar as such may be authorized by law, and
the right to the appointment, as a matter of right and without regard to the sufficiency of the security afforded by the Trust
Estate, of a receiver for all or any part of the Trust Estate and the rents, revenues and receipts thereof; the rights herein
specified are to be cumulative to all other available rights, remedies or powers and shall not exclude any such rights, remedies
or powers. Without intending to limit the foregoing rights, remedies and powers by virtue of such specification, the Trustee is
authorized to further assign the Issuer s right, title and interest in the Lease Agreement to a successor trustee in the
manner set forth in this Indenture. When the Trustee incurs costs and expenses or renders services after the occurrence of an
event of default, such expenses and the compensation for such services are intended to constitute expenses of administration under
any federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency, arrangement, moratorium, reorganization or other debt relief law.

Article as the owners of the Bonds shall have instructed the Trustee, subject, however to the provisions of Section 1215 hereof. 

No right
or remedy by the terms of this Indenture conferred upon or reserved to the Trustee (or to the owners of the Bonds) is intended
to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, but each and every such right and remedy shall be cumulative and shall be in addition
to any other right or remedy given to the Trustee or to the owners of the Bonds or now or hereafter existing at law, in equity
or by statute. 

No delay
or omission to exercise any right or remedy accruing upon any event of default shall impair any such right or remedy or shall
be construed to be a waiver of any such event of default or acquiescence therein; and every such right and remedy may be exercised
from time to time and as often as may be deemed expedient. 

No waiver
of any event of default hereunder, whether by the Trustee or by the owners of the Bonds, shall extend to or shall affect any subsequent
event of default or shall impair any rights or remedies consequent thereon. 

Section
1105.  Right of Owners of the Bonds to Direct Proceedings .  Anything in this Indenture to the contrary notwithstanding,
the owners of a majority in principal amount of Bonds outstanding shall have the right, at any time, by an instrument or instruments
in writing executed and delivered to the Trustee, to direct the method and place of conducting all proceedings to be taken in
connection with the enforcement of the terms and conditions of this Indenture, or for the appointment of a receiver or any other
proceedings hereunder; provided, that such direction shall not be otherwise than in accordance with the provisions of law and
of this Indenture. 

Section
1106.  Appointment of Receivers .  Upon the occurrence of an event of default and upon the filing of a suit or other commencement
of judicial proceedings to enforce the rights and remedies of the Trustee and of the owners of the Bonds under this Indenture,
the Trustee shall be entitled, as a matter of right, to the appointment of a receiver or receivers of the Project and of the rents,
revenues and receipts thereof and therefrom, pending such proceedings, with such powers as the court making such appointment shall
confer. 

Section
1107.  Application of Moneys .  All moneys received by the Trustee pursuant to any right given or action taken under the
provisions of this Article shall, after payment of the reasonable costs and expenses of the proceedings resulting in the collection
of such moneys and of the fees, expenses (including, without limitation, counsel fees, costs and expenses), liabilities and advances
of, incurred or made by the Trustee, be deposited in the Bond Fund and all moneys in the Bond Fund shall be applied as follows:  

(a)          Unless
the principal of all the Bonds shall have become or shall have been declared due and payable, all such moneys shall be applied: 

first
- To the payment to the persons entitled thereto of all installments of interest then due on the Bonds (other than installments
of interest on Bonds with respect to the payment of which moneys and/or Government Obligations are set aside in the special account
in the Bond Fund), in the order of the maturity of the installments of such interest and, if the amount available shall not be
sufficient to pay in full any particular installment, then to the payment ratably, according to the amounts due on such installment,
to the persons entitled thereto, without any discrimination or privilege; and 

second
- To the payment to the persons entitled thereto of the unpaid principal of any of the Bonds which shall have become due (other
than principal of Bonds with respect to the payment of which moneys and/or Government Obligations are set aside in the special
account in the Bond Fund), in the order of their due dates, with interest on such Bonds from the respective dates upon which they
become due and, if the amount available shall not be sufficient to pay in full Bonds due on any particular date, together with
such interest, then to the payment ratably, according to the amount of principal due on such date, to the persons entitled thereto
without any discrimination or privilege. 

(b)           If
 the principal of all the Bonds shall have become due or shall have been declared due and payable, all such moneys shall
be applied to the payment of the principal and interest then due and unpaid upon the Bonds (other than principal of and interest
on Bonds with respect to the payment of which moneys and/or Government Obligations are set aside in the Special Account in the
Bond Fund), without preference or priority of principal over interest or of interest over principal, or of any installment of
interest over any other installment of interest, or of any Bond over any other Bond, ratably, according to the amounts due respectively
for principal and interest, to the persons entitled thereto without any discrimination or privilege. 

(c)           If
 the principal of all the Bonds shall have been declared due and payable, and if such declaration shall thereafter have
been rescinded and annulled under the provisions of this Article then, subject to the provisions of paragraph (b) of this Section
in the event that the principal of all the Bonds shall later become due or be declared due and payable, the moneys shall be applied
in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (a) of this Section. 

Whenever moneys are to be
applied pursuant to the provisions of this Section, such moneys shall be applied at such times, and from time to time, as the
Trustee shall determine, having due regard to the amount of such moneys available for application and the likelihood of additional
moneys becoming available for such application in the future. Whenever the Trustee shall apply such funds, it shall fix the date
(which shall be an interest payment date unless it shall deem another date more suitable) upon which such application is to be
made and upon such date interest on the amounts of principal to be paid on such dates shall cease to accrue. The Trustee shall
give such notice as it may deem appropriate of the deposit with it of any such moneys and of the fixing of any such date, and
shall not be required to make payment to the owner of any Bonds until such Bond shall be presented to the Trustee for appropriate
endorsement or for cancellation if paid in full. 

Whenever
all Bonds and interest thereon have been paid under the provisions of this Section 1107 and all expenses and charges of the Trustee
have been paid, any balance remaining in the Bond Fund shall be paid to the Company as provided in Section 609 hereof. 

Section
1108.  Rights and Remedies Vested in Trustee . Subject to the provisions of Section 1104, all rights and remedies of action
(including the right to file proof of claims) under this Indenture or under any of the Bonds may be enforced by the Trustee without
the possession of any of the Bonds or the production thereof in any trial or other proceedings relating thereto and any such suit
or proceeding instituted by the Trustee shall be brought in its name as Trustee without the necessity of joining as plaintiffs
or defendants any owners of the Bonds, and any recovery of judgment shall be for the equal benefit of the owners of the Bonds. 

Section
1109.  Rights and Remedies of Owners of the Bonds . No owner of any Bonds shall have any right to institute any suit, action
or proceeding in equity or at law for the enforcement of this Indenture, for the execution of any trust thereof or for the appointment
of a receiver or to enforce any other right or remedy hereunder, unless a default has occurred of which the Trustee has been notified
in writing as provided in subsection (h) of Section 1201 hereof, or of which by said subsection it is deemed to have notice, nor
unless also such default shall have become an event of default and the owners of 25% in principal amount of Bonds outstanding
shall have made written request to the Trustee and shall have offered reasonable opportunity either to proceed to exercise the
powers hereinbefore granted or to institute such action, suit or proceeding in its own name, nor unless also such owners have
offered to the Trustee indemnity as provided in Section 1201(m) hereof, nor unless also the Trustee shall thereafter fail or refuse
to exercise the powers hereinbefore granted, or to institute such action, suit or proceeding in its, his or their own name or
names. Such notification, request and offer of indemnity are hereby declared in every case at the option of the Trustee to be
conditions precedent to the execution of the powers and trusts of this Indenture and to any action or cause of action for the
enforcement of this Indenture, or for the appointment of a receiver or for any other right or remedy hereunder; it being understood
and intended that no one or more owners of the Bonds shall have any right in any manner whatsoever to affect, disturb or prejudice
the lien of this Indenture by its, his, her or their action or to enforce any right or remedy hereunder except in the manner herein
provided, and that all proceedings at law or in equity shall be instituted, had and maintained  in
 the manner herein provided and for the equal benefit of the owners of all Bonds. Nothing in this Indenture contained shall,
however, affect or impair the right of any owner of the Bonds to enforce the payment of the principal of and interest on any Bond
at and after the maturity thereof, or the obligation of the Issuer to pay the principal of and interest on each of the Bonds issued
hereunder to the respective owners hereof at the time, place, from the source and in the manner expressed in the Bonds. 

Section
 1110.   Termination of Proceedings .  In case the Trustee shall have proceeded
to enforce any right or remedy under this Indenture by the appointment of a receiver, by entry or otherwise, and such proceedings
shall have been discontinued or abandoned for any reason, or shall have been determined adversely, then and in every such case
the Issuer and the Trustee shall be restored to their former positions and rights hereunder with respect to the Trust Estate,
and all rights, remedies and powers of the Trustee shall continue as if no such proceedings had been taken. 

Section
 1111.  Waivers  of Events of Default   .  The
Trustee (a) may waive any event of default hereunder and its consequences and rescind any declaration of maturity of principal
and its consequences, if such event of default has been cured and there is no longer continuing any default hereunder, and (b)
shall waive any event of default hereunder and its consequences and rescind any declaration of maturity of principal, upon the
written request of the owners of a majority in principal amount of the Bonds outstanding; provided, however, that there shall
not be waived (i) any event of default pertaining to the payment of the principal of any Bond at its maturity date or any prepayment
date prior to maturity, or (ii) any event of default pertaining to the payment when due of the interest on any Bond, unless prior
to such waiver or rescission, all arrears of principal (due otherwise than by declaration) and interest, with interest (to the
extent permitted by law) at the rate borne by the Bonds on overdue installments of principal and interest and all arrears of payments
of principal when due, as the case may be, and all fees, costs and expenses of the Trustee in connection with such event of default
(including reasonable attorneys  fees, costs and expenses), shall have been paid or provided for, and in case of any such
waiver or rescission, or in case any proceeding taken by the Trustee on account of any such event of default shall have been discontinued
or abandoned or determined adversely, then and in every such case the Issuer, the Trustee and the owners of the Bonds shall be
restored to their former positions and rights hereunder respectively, but no such waiver or rescission shall extend to any subsequent
or other event of default, or impair any right consequent thereon. 

Section
 1112.   Notice of Defaults; Opportunity    of  the
Issuer and Company to Cure Defaults   .  No default specified in Section l l 0 l(c)
hereof shall constitute an event of default hereunder until notice of such default by registered or certified mail shall be given
by the Trustee to the Issuer and the Company, and the Issuer shall have had 30 days after receipt of such notice to correct said
default or cause said default to be corrected, and shall not have corrected said default or caused said default to be corrected
within the applicable period; provided, further, that if a default specified in said Section ll 0 l(c)
be such that it can be corrected but not within the period specified herein, it shall not constitute the basis of an event of
default hereunder (i) if corrective action capable of remedying such default is instituted by the Issuer within the applicable
period and diligently pursued until the default is corrected, and (ii) if the Issuer shall within the applicable period furnish
to the Trustee a certificate executed as provided in Section 1201(f)   hereof certifying that
said default is such that it can be corrected but not within the applicable period and that corrective action capable of remedying
such default has been instituted and is being diligently pursued and will be diligently pursued until the default is corrected.
The Issuer shall notify the Trustee by certificate executed as above when such default has been corrected. The Trustee shall be
entitled to conclusively rely upon any such certificate given pursuant to this Section. 

With regard
to any default concerning which notice is given to the Company or the Issuer under the provisions of this Section 1112, the Issuer
hereby grants to the Company full authority to perform any obligation the performance of which by the Issuer is alleged in said
notice to be in default, such performance by the Company to be in the name and stead of the Issuer with full power to do any and
all things and acts to the same extent that the Issuer could do and perform any such things and acts and with power of substitution. 

ARTICLE XII. 

THE TRUSTEE  

Section 1201.  Acceptance
of the Trusts . The Trustee hereby accepts the trusts imposed upon it by this Indenture, and agrees to perform its duties hereunder
as would an ordinarily prudent trustee, but only upon and subject to the following express terms and conditions: 

(a)          The
Trustee, prior to the occurrence of an event of default and after the curing of all events of default which may have occurred,
undertakes to perform such duties and only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Indenture, and no implied covenants
or obligations shall be read into this Indenture against the Trustee. In case an event of default has occurred and is continuing,
the Trustee shall exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture, and use the same degree of care and skill
in their exercise, as a prudent man would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of his own affairs. 

(b)          The
Trustee may execute any of the trusts or powers hereof and perform any of its duties by or through attorneys, agents, receivers
or employees and shall not be liable for the conduct of the same if such attorneys, agents, receivers or employees are selected
with reasonable care, and shall be entitled to advice of Counsel concerning all matters of trust hereof and the duties hereunder,
and may in all cases pay such reasonable compensation to all such attorneys, agents, receivers and employees as may reasonably
be employed in connection with the trusts hereof. The Trustee may act upon the opinion or advice of any attorney (who may be the
attorney or attorneys for the Issuer or the Company), approved by the Trustee in the exercise of reasonable care. The Trustee
shall not be responsible for any loss or damage resulting from any action or non-action in good faith in reliance upon such opinion
or advice. 

(c)          The
Trustee shall not be responsible for any recital herein, or in the Bonds (except in respect to the authentication certificate
of the Trustee endorsed on the Bonds), or for the recording or re-recording, filing or re-filing of this Indenture, or the Lease
Agreement, or for insuring the Trust Estate or any part of the Project or collecting any insurance moneys, or for the validity
of the execution by the Issuer of this Indenture or of any supplements hereto or instruments of further assurance, or for the
sufficiency of the security for the Bonds, or for the value of or title in and to the Trust Estate or any part of the Project
or otherwise as to the maintenance of the security hereof; except that if the Trustee enters into possession of a part or all
of the Trust Estate pursuant to any provision of this Indenture it shall use due diligence in preserving the same, and the Trustee
shall not be bound to ascertain or inquire as to the performance or observance of any covenants, agreements or conditions on the
part of the Issuer or on the part of the Company under the Lease Agreement, except as hereinafter set forth; but the Trustee may
require of the Issuer or the Company full information and advice as to the performance of the covenants, agreements and conditions
aforesaid and as to the condition of the Trust Estate. The Trustee shall not be liable for any loss suffered in connection with
any investment of funds made by it in accordance with Sections 801 and 802 hereof. 

(d)          The
Trustee may become the owner of Bonds with the same rights which it would have  if  it were
not Trustee. 

(e)          The
Trustee may conclusively rely upon and shall be fully protected in acting upon any notice, request, consent, certificate, order,
affidavit, letter, telegram or other paper or documents believed to be genuine and correct and to have been signed or sent by
the proper Person or Persons. Any action taken by the Trustee, pursuant to this Indenture upon the request, authority or consent
of any Person who at the time of making such request or giving such authority or consent is the owner of any Bond, shall be conclusive
and binding upon all future owners of the same Bond and upon Bonds issued in exchange therefor or in place thereof. 

(f)           As
to the existence or non-existence of any fact or as to the sufficiency or validity of any instrument, paper or proceeding, the
Trustee shall be entitled to conclusively rely upon a certificate signed on behalf of the Issuer by the Chair or Vice Chair of
the Issuer and attested by the Secretary or Assistant Secretary of the Issuer as sufficient evidence of the facts therein contained
and prior to the occurrence of a default of which the Trustee has been notified as provided in subsection (h) of this Section,
or of which by said subsection it is deemed to have notice, shall also be at liberty to accept a similar certificate to the effect
that any particular dealing, transaction or action is necessary or expedient, but may at its discretion secure such further evidence
deemed necessary or advisable, but shall in no case be bound to secure the same. The Trustee may accept a certificate of the Secretary
or Assistant Secretary of the Issuer under its seal to the effect that a resolution in the form therein set forth has been adopted
by the Issuer as conclusive evidence that such resolution has been duly adopted, and is in full force and effect. 

(g)          The
right of the Trustee to do things enumerated in this Indenture shall not be construed as a duty and the Trustee shall not be answerable
for other than its gross negligence or willful misconduct. 

(h)          The
Trustee shall not be required to take notice or be deemed to have notice of any default hereunder or under the Lease Agreement
except, to the extent hereinafter provided, failure by the Issuer to cause to be made any of the payments to the Trustee required
to be made by Article V hereof and failure by the Company to make the rental payments required to be made under Section 5.3 of
the Lease, unless the Trustee shall be specifically notified in writing of such default by the Issuer or by the owners of at least
25% in principal amount of the Bonds. The Trustee shall not be deemed to have notice of any of the defaults described in the preceding
sentence during any period or with respect to any Bond in respect of which a home office payment agreement is in effect, unless
specifically notified in writing of such default by the Purchaser, the Issuer or the Company. All notices or other instruments
required by this Indenture to be delivered to the Trustee must, in order to be effective, be delivered at the Principal Office
of the Trustee, and in the absence of such notice so delivered the Trustee may conclusively assume there is no default except
as aforesaid. 

(i)          The Trustee shall not be personally liable for any debts contracted or for damages to persons or property, or for salaries or
non-fulfillment of contracts during any period in which it may be in the possession of or managing the Project as in this Indenture
provided. 

(j)          At reasonable times the Trustee, and its duly authorized agents, attorneys, experts, engineers, accountants and representatives
who are acceptable to the Company, and accompanied by an official of the Company, shall have the right to inspect the Project
as well as all books, papers and records of the Issuer pertaining to the Project and the Bonds, and to take copies of such memoranda
from and in regard thereto only as required from the books, papers and records of the Issuer. 

(k)          The
Trustee shall not be required to give any bond or surety in respect of the execution of the said trusts and powers or otherwise
in respect of the premises. 

(1)          Notwithstanding
anything elsewhere in this Indenture contained, the Trustee shall have the right, but shall not be required, to demand, in respect
of the authentication of any Bonds, the withdrawal of any cash, the release of any property, or any action whatsoever within the
purview of this Indenture, any showings, certificates, opinions of Counsel, appraisals or other information, or corporate action
or evidence thereof, in addition to that by the terms hereof required as a condition of such action by the Trustee relevant to
and deemed desirable in connection with the authentication of any Bonds, the withdrawal of any cash, or the taking of any other
action by the Trustee. 

(m)         Before
taking any action hereunder the Trustee may require that a satisfactory indemnity bond be furnished for the reimbursement of all
expenses to which it may be put and to protect it against all liability, including, but not limited to, any liability arising
directly or indirectly under any federal, state or local statute, rule, law or ordinance related to the protection of the environment
or to hazardous substances, except liability which is adjudicated to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct
of the Trustee by reason of any action so taken. None of the provisions contained in this Indenture shall require the Trustee
to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise to incur liability, financial or otherwise, in the performance of any of its duties
or the exercise of any of its rights or powers hereunder. 

(n)          All

required herein or by law. Neither the Trustee nor any such paying agent shall be under any liability for interest on any moneys
received hereunder except such as may be agreed upon. 

(o)          The
Trustee shall not be accountable for the use or application by the obligor of any of the Bonds or the proceeds thereof or for

shall provide to the Trustee an incumbency certificate listing designated persons with the authority to provide such instructions,
which incumbency certificate shall be amended whenever a person is to be added or deleted from the listing. If the Issuer or the
Company elect to give the Trustee e-mail or facsimile instructions (or instructions by a similar electronic method) and the Trustee
in its discretion elects to act upon such instructions, the Trustee s understanding of such instructions shall be deemed
controlling. The Trustee shall not be liable for any losses, costs or expenses arising directly or indirectly from the Trustee s
reliance upon and compliance with such instructions notwithstanding such instructions conflict or are inconsistent with a subsequent
written instruction. The Issuer and the Company each agree to assume all risks arising out of the use of such electronic methods
to submit instructions and directions to the Trustee, including without limitation the risk of the Trustee acting on unauthorized
instructions, and the risk of interception and misuse by third parties.

epidemic; riots; interruptions; loss or malfunctions of utilities, computer (hardware or software) or communications services;

to reasonable extra compensation therefor, and to reimbursement for reasonable and necessary Extraordinary Expenses in connection
therewith; provided, that if such Extraordinary Services or Extraordinary Expenses are occasioned by its gross negligence or willful
misconduct, it shall not be entitled to compensation or reimbursement therefor. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, but

Charges   . If  any tax, assessment or governmental or other charge upon any part
of the Trust Estate or the Project is not paid as required herein, the Trustee may pay such tax, assessment or charge, without

corporations or associations to transact business as a trustee in such jurisdiction. It is recognized that in case of litigation
under this Indenture, and in particular in case of the enforcement of either the Indenture or the Lease Agreement upon the occurrence
of an event of default, it may be necessary that there be appointed an additional individual or institution as a separate Trustee
or Co-Trustee. The following provisions of this Section 1213 are adapted to these ends. 

In the event
of the incapacity or lack of authority of the Trustee, by reason of any present or future law of any jurisdiction, to exercise
any of the rights, powers and trusts herein granted to the Trustee or to hold title to the Trust Estate or to take any other action
which may be necessary or desirable in connection therewith, the Issuer with the consent of the Company may appoint, and at the
request of the Trustee shall appoint, a separate Trustee or Co-Trustee and each and every remedy, power, right, claim, demand,
cause of action, immunity, estate, title, interest and lien expressed or intended by this Indenture to be exercised by or vested
in or conveyed to the Trustee with respect thereto shall be exercisable by and vest in such separate Trustee or Co-Trustee but
only to the extent necessary to enable the separate Trustee or Co-Trustee to exercise such rights, powers and trusts, and every
covenant and obligation necessary to the exercise thereof by such separate Trustee or Co-Trustee shall run to and be enforceable
by either of them. 

Should any
deed, conveyance or instrument in writing from the Issuer be required by the separate Trustee or Co-Trustee so appointed in order
to more fully and certainly vest in and confirm to him or it such properties, rights, powers, trusts, duties and obligations,
any and all such deeds, conveyances and instruments shall, on request, be executed, acknowledged and delivered by the Issuer.
In case any separate Trustee or Co-Trustee or a successor to either, shall die, become incapable of acting, resign or be removed,
all the estates, properties, rights, powers, trusts, duties and obligations of such separate Trustee or Co-Trustee, so far as
permitted by law, shall vest in and be exercised by the Trustee until the appointment of a new Trustee or successor to such separate
Trustee or Co-Trustee. 

Section
1214.  Continuation Statements .  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Trustee shall not
be responsible for any initial filings of any Financing Statements or the information contained therein (including the exhibits
thereto), the perfection of any such security interests, or the accuracy or sufficiency of any description of collateral in such
initial filings or for filing any modifications or amendments to the initial filings required by any amendments to Article 9 of
the Uniform Commercial Code. In addition, unless the Trustee shall have been notified in writing by the Issuer or the Company
that any such initial filing or description of collateral was or has become defective, the Trustee shall be fully protected in
(i) relying on such initial filing and descriptions in filing any continuation statements or modifications thereto pursuant to
this Section and  (ii)  filing any continuation statements in the same filing offices as the
initial filings were made. The Trustee shall cause to be filed a continuation statement with respect to each Uniform Commercial
Code financing statement relating to the Bonds which was filed at the time of the issuance thereof, in such manner and in such
places as the initial filings were made, provided that a copy of the filed original financing statement is timely delivered to
the Trustee. The Company shall be responsible for the reasonable costs incurred by the Trustee in the preparation and filing of
all continuation statements hereunder. 

Section
1215.  Special Trustee Powers Due to Environmental Conditions .   Prior to exercising any remedy against the Project
which requires the Trustee to re-enter and take possession of the Project, to sub-lease the Project, to terminate the Lease Term
and use its best efforts to lease the Project to another lessee, or to exercise any remedies under the U.C.C. of the State or
any similar remedy, the Trustee may cause an environmental assessment of the Project to be made and to take such action, based
upon advice by its counsel, to safeguard the Trustee from liability and to protect the Trust Estate from liability or impairment
of value.

a sum equal to the amount payable on such date as principal of and interest on the Bonds, as provided in the Indenture. Each Rental
Payment under this Section 5.3 shall be sufficient to pay the total amount of principal and interest payable on such semiannual
interest payment date, and if at any semiannual interest payment date the balance in the Bond Fund is insufficient to make required
payments of principal and interest on such date, the Lessee shall forthwith pay any such deficiency. 

Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, if the Company is the lessee of the Project and is also the Bondholder, then the payment
of Rental Payments under this Lease and the payment of the principal of and interest on such Bond shall be deemed to have been
constructively made when due and shall be noted on the Schedule of Payment attached to the Bond.  If
 the Company elects to terminate this Lease or elects to purchase the Project, and if the Bond has not theretofore been retired,
the Company shall make a final payment of Rental Payments in an amount sufficient to retire the Bond and shall cause the Bond to
be retired on the date the Term expires or the date this Lease is terminated or the date the purchase of the Project is closed,
as applicable, provided that if the Company or an Affiliate of the Company is also the Holder of the Bond, then in lieu of such
payment, such Bond shall be marked  canceled and paid  and shall be promptly surrendered by the Holder to the Registrar. 

Anything
herein to the contrary notwithstanding, any amount at any time held by the Trustee in the Bond Fund shall be credited against the
next succeeding rental payment and such credit shall reduce the payment to be then made by the Lessee; and further, if the amount
held by the Trustee in the Bond Fund should be sufficient to pay at the times required the   principal
of and interest on all Bonds then remaining unpaid, the Lessee shall not be obligated to make any further rental payments under
the provisions of this Section.  

The
Lessee agrees to pay to the Trustee until Payment in Full of the Bonds (i) at least once a year an amount equal to the annual fee
of the Trustee for the Ordinary Services of the Trustee rendered and its Ordinary Expenses incurred under the Indenture, (ii) the
reasonable fees, costs and expenses of Trustee s Counsel as provided in the Indenture, as and when the same become due, and (iii)
the reasonable fees and charges of the Trustee for Extraordinary Services rendered by it and Extraordinary Expenses incurred under
the Indenture, as and when the same become due; provided, that the Lessee may, without creating a default hereunder, withhold such
payment to contest in good faith the necessity for any such Extraordinary Services and Extraordinary Expenses and the reasonableness
of any such fees, charges or expenses. 

If
the Lessee should fail to make any of the payments required in this Section, the item or installment so in default shall continue
as an obligation of the Lessee until the same shall have been fully paid, and the Lessee agrees to pay the same with interest thereon,
to the extent legally enforceable, at the Default Rate per annum until paid. The provisions of this Section 5.3 shall be subject
to the provisions of Section 9.5 hereof. 

Section
5.4      
  Place of Rental Payments . The rents provided for in the first paragraph of Section 5.3 hereof and the interest on delinquent
rents shall be paid directly to the Trustee for the account of the Issuer and will be deposited in the Bond Fund subject to the
provisions of Section 208 of the Indenture. The other payments provided for in Section 5.3 hereof shall be paid directly to the
Trustee for its own use or for disbursement to any other paying agent on the Bonds, as the case may be. 

Section
5.5         Obligations        of
Lessee Hereunder      Absolute and Unconditional   .
Subject to the provisions of Section 9.5 hereof, the obligations of the Lessee to make the payments required in Section 5.3 hereof
and to perform and observe the other agreements on its part contained herein shall be absolute and unconditional with no right
of set-off. Until such time as Payment in Full of the Bonds shall have been made, the Lessee (i) will not suspend or discontinue
any payments provided for in Section 5.3 hereof except to the extent the payments have been prepaid, (ii) will perform and observe
all of its other agreements contained in this Lease Agreement, and (iii) except as provided in Sections      11.1
and 11.2 hereof, will not terminate the Lease Term for any cause, including, without      limiting
the generality of the foregoing, failure of the Issuer s title in and to the Project or any part thereof, any acts or circumstances
that may constitute failure of consideration, eviction or constructive eviction, destruction of or damage to the Project, commercial
frustration of purpose, any change in the tax or other laws of the United States of America or of the State of Georgia or any political
subdivision of either thereof or any failure of the Issuer to perform and observe any agreement, whether express or implied, or
any duty, liability or obligation arising out of or connected with this Lease or the Indenture. Nothing contained in this Section
5.5 shall be construed to release the Issuer from the performance of any of the agreements on its part herein contained; and if
the Issuer should fail to perform any such agreement, the Lessee may institute such action against the Issuer as the Lessee may
deem necessary to compel performance or recover its damages for nonperformance so long as such action shall not conflict with the
agreements on the part of the Lessee contained in the preceding sentence.      The
Lessee may, however, at its own cost and    expense
and in its own name or in the name of the Issuer, prosecute or defend any action or proceeding or take any other action involving
third persons which the Lessee deems reasonably necessary or in order to insure the acquisition of the Project or to secure or
protect its right of possession, occupancy and use of the Project hereunder, and in such event the Issuer hereby agrees to cooperate
fully with the Lessee and to take all lawful action which is required to effect the substitution of the Lessee for the Issuer in
any such action or proceeding if the Lessee shall so request.  

Section
5.6              Lessee s
Performance under Indenture  .  The Lessee agrees, for the benefit of the owners from time to time of the Bonds, to do
and perform all acts and things contemplated in the Indenture to be done or performed by it.  

Section
5.7      
   Exculpation.    Notwithstanding any other provision of this Lease Agreement, by acceptance hereof the Issuer
agrees, for so long as any Superior Security Document remains outstanding and unpaid, that payment of the rents and other amounts
payable under Section 5.3 but not including payments pursuant to Sections 6.7, 6.9 and 10.4, shall be without recourse to the
Lessee or its members personally, and the Issuer shall not be entitled either to seek or procure payment of such amounts out of
any source other than the Lessee s interest in this Lease Agreement  or to procure judgment of any kind against either
the Lessee, any member of the Lessee, or any property of the Lessee or any member of the Lessee, except for the Lessee s
interest in this Lease Agreement, including, without limitation, for any deficiency remaining after the transfer or other disposition
of the Lessee s interest in this Lease Agreement; provided, however, that nothing in this paragraph shall be deemed to preclude
the Issuer from exercising its rights under this Lease Agreement or from obtaining a judgment for purposes of enforcing its rights
under this Lease Agreement, or to preclude the Trustee from exercising its rights under the Indenture or from obtaining a judgment
for purposes of enforcing its rights under the Indenture. This provision is intended to ensure that the obligations of the Lessee
under this Lease Agreement remain junior and subordinate in priority to the obligations of the Lessee under any Superior Security
Document and shall be so construed.

MAINTENANCE AND MODIFICATIONS,
TAXES AND INSURANCE 

Section 6.1         Maintenance
and Modifications of Project by Lessee . 

(a)           The
Lessee will cause the Project to be maintained, preserved and kept in good repair, working order and condition and will from time
to time cause to be made all necessary and proper repairs, replacements and renewals; provided, however, that the Lessee will have
no obligation to cause to be maintained, preserved, repaired, replaced or renewed any element or unit of the Project, the maintenance,
repair, replacement or renewal of which, in the opinion of the Lessee, becomes uneconomical to the Lessee because of damage or
destruction or obsolescence, or change in economic or business conditions, or change in government standards and regulations. The
Lessee agrees that the Issuer shall have no obligation to maintain the Project or any portion thereof. 

The
Lessee covenants that as long as the Lessee or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates operates the Project, it or such subsidiary
or affiliate will cause the Project to be maintained and operated as a  project  under the Act. 

(b)          The
Lessee may from time to time, in its sole discretion, at its own expense and not from the proceeds of the Bonds, make any additions,
modifications or improvements to the Project, including installation of machinery, equipment and related property in the Improvements
or on the Land, which it may deem desirable for its business purposes. All machinery, equipment and related property so installed
by the Lessee shall remain the sole property of the Lessee in which neither the Issuer nor the Trustee shall have any interest.
All such machinery, equipment and other related property may be modified or removed at any time. 

(c)          The
Lessee shall not permit any mechanics  liens, materialmen s liens or other liens to be established and remain against the Project
for labor or materials furnished or services rendered in connection with any additions, modifications, improvements, repairs, renewals
or replacements so made by it; provided, that if the Lessee shall first notify the Trustee of its intention so to do, the Lessee
may in good faith contest any mechanics  liens, materialmen s liens or other liens filed or established against the Project, and
in such event may permit the items so contested to remain undischarged and unsatisfied during the period of such contest and any
appeal therefrom unless the Issuer or the Trustee shall notify the Lessee that, in the opinion of Independent Counsel, by nonpayment
of any such items, the Project or any material part thereof or the revenues from the Project will be subject to loss or forfeiture,
in which event the Lessee shall promptly pay and cause to be satisfied and discharged all such unpaid items. The Issuer will cooperate
fully with the Lessee in any such contest. 

Section
6.2              Reserved .  

Section
6.3              Taxes,
Other Governmental     Charges and Utility   Charges   .
The Issuer and the Lessee further acknowledge that under present law no part of the Project owned by  the Issuer
will be subject to ad valorem taxation by the State of Georgia or by any political or taxing subdivision thereof, and that
under present law the income and profits (if any) of the Issuer from the Project are not subject to either federal or
Georgia taxation and these factors have induced the Lessee to enter into this Lease. However, under current law and pursuant
to the uniform assessment methodologies applied by the Fulton County Board of Assessors, the Lessee shall pay, as the same
become lawfully due and payable, (i) all taxes and governmental charges of any kind whatsoever upon or with respect to the
interest held by the Lessee under this Lease,  (ii) all taxes and
governmental charges of any kind whatsoever upon or with respect to the Project or any machinery, equipment or related
property installed or brought by the Lessee therein or thereon (including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
any taxes levied upon or with respect to the income or profits of the Issuer from the Project which, if not paid, will become
a charge on the rents, revenues and receipts from the Project prior to or on a parity with the pledge or assignment thereof
created and made in the Indenture), (iii) all utility and other charges incurred in the operation, maintenance, use,
occupancy and upkeep of the Project and (iv) all assessments and charges lawfully made by any governmental body for public
improvements that may be secured by a lien on the Project; provided, that with respect to special assessments or other
governmental charges that may lawfully be paid in installments over a period of years, the Lessee shall be obligated to pay
only such installments as are required to be paid during the Lease Term.  

It is the
understanding and intent of the parties that the Issuer s acquisition of title to the Project, including but not limited to the
leased equipment comprising a portion of the Project, shall be solely for the purpose of leasing the same to the Lessee pursuant
to the terms hereof. Without limiting the generality of the preceding paragraph concerning payment by the Lessee of all taxes and
governmental charges of any kind whatsoever upon or with respect to the Project, it is specifically agreed that the Lessee shall
pay, as the same become lawfully due and payable, either in its own name and behalf or in the name and behalf of the Issuer as
appropriate, any sales or use taxes due upon payments of rent pursuant to Section 5.3 hereof attributable to leased equipment. 

The Lessee
may, at its own expense and in its own name and behalf or in the name and behalf of the Issuer, in good faith contest any such
taxes, assessments and other charges and, in the event of any such contest, may permit the taxes, assessments and other charges
so contested to remain unpaid during the period of such contest and any appeal therefrom. The Issuer shall cooperate fully with
the Lessee in any such contest. 

Section
6.4            Insurance
Required .   

(a)          The
Lessee acknowledges and agrees that the Issuer shall have no obligation to insure the Project or any part thereof, and no responsibility
for any damage or destruction thereof. Throughout the Lease Term, the Lessee shall cause the Project to be insured against such
property and personal injury risks as is consistent with its insurance practices in effect from time to time, including self insurance,
and Lessee shall procure and maintain at its expense a commercial general liability policy covering claims for bodily injury, death
or property damage occurring upon, in or about the Property in an amount not less than $1,000,000 per occurrence and $3,000,000
in the aggregate with no deductible or self insurance retention, and an umbrella liability policy in the amount of  $25,000,000.
In lieu of separate insurance policies, such insurance may be in the form of a blanket insurance policy or policies of the Lessee.
Insurance policies may be written with reasonable deductible amounts and with exceptions and exclusions as the Lessee deems necessary
in the normal course of its business. The Issuer and the Trustee shall be named as additional insureds under any general liability
insurance policy or policies, as their respective interests may appear, and certificates of insurance reflecting the Issuer and
the Trustee as additional insureds under such policy or policies shall be delivered to the Issuer and the Trustee in connection
with the execution of this Lease and annually thereafter upon written request to Lessee. The Trustee shall have no duty to review
or analyze such insurance policies and shall hold such insurance policies solely as a repository for the benefit of the bondholders;
the Trustee shall not be deemed to have notice of any information contained therein or event of default which may be disclosed
therein in any manner. The Issuer and the Trustee shall be provided thirty days  written notice of cancellation of any such insurance
policies. 

(b)          Issuer
shall have the right, but not the obligation, to obtain a separate liability policy or policies covering the Project with the Issuer
as the named insured thereunder. In the event the Issuer shall elect at any time during the term of this Lease to obtain a separate
liability insurance policy or policies covering the Project with the Issuer as the named insured thereunder, the insurance premium
for such policy or policies shall be allocated among the projects covered under such policy or policies, and Lessee agrees to pay
its pro rata share of the premium for such liability insurance not to exceed $7,500.00 in any year (and such maximum annual amount
shall be prorated in the case of any partial year of such coverage or any partial year during the term of this Lease). Lessee shall
pay its pro rata share of such premium for any year within thirty (30) days after receipt by Lessee of a statement therefor together
with back-up information regarding the amount of such premium and the calculation of Lessee s pro rata share thereof. Lessee shall
be an additional insured under any such liability insurance policy or policies obtained by the Issuer, and annually upon written
request to the Issuer, the Issuer shall provide Lessee with a certificate of insurance reflecting Lessee as an additional insured
under such policy or policies. The Issuer s own liability insurance shall provide for the waiver of the insurers  rights of subrogation
against Lessee where such waivers are possible. 

Section
6.5      Application of Net Proceeds of Insurance .      Unless otherwise provided by any Superior Security
Document or a Leasehold Security Deed that has been executed pursuant to the provisions of Section 9.7 hereof, the Net Proceeds
of any casualty insurance carried pursuant to the provisions of Section 6.4(a) hereof shall be paid to the Lessee and applied to
the repair or replacement of the portion of the Project that was damaged or destroyed by the casualty, the redemption of the Bonds,
or for such other use as the Lessee shall determine; provided, however, that no damage to, or destruction of, the Project shall
affect the Lessee s obligation to pay rent hereunder, or entitle the Lessee to reduce or otherwise diminish its rental payments. 

Section
6.6           Additional
Provisions Respecting Insurance .         Unless
otherwise provided by any Superior Security Document or a Leasehold Security Deed that has been executed pursuant to the provisions
of Section 9.7 hereof, all claims made under any insurance    policies carried by Lessee
pursuant to the requirements of Section 6.4(a) hereof, regardless of amount, may be adjusted by the Lessee with the insurers.  

Section
6.7      Other Issuer Expenses .
Anything to the contrary herein
notwithstanding, the Lessee shall pay any expenses not specifically mentioned herein which are reasonably incurred by
the Issuer and its counsel in connection with the Project, this Lease, the Indenture or the Bonds, and which are not paid
from the Project Fund pursuant to Section 4.3 hereof. 

Section
6.8      Advances by   Issuer or
Trustee .  If  the Lessee fails to maintain the full
insurance coverage required by this Lease or fails to keep the Project in as reasonably safe condition as its operating
conditions will permit, or fails to keep the Project in good repair and good operating condition, the Issuer or the Trustee
may (if satisfactorily indemnified) but shall be under no obligation to, take out the required policies of insurance and pay
the premiums on the same or make the required repairs, renewals and replacements if the Lessee   shall   fail
to do so within thirty (30) days after written notice of failure to do so has been delivered to Lessee by the Trustee or the
Issuer; and all amounts so advanced therefor by the Issuer or the Trustee will become an additional obligation of the Lessee
to the one making the advancement, which amounts, together with interest thereon at the Default Rate from the date thereof,
the Lessee agrees to pay; provided, however, if the failure stated in the notice cannot be corrected in the applicable time
period, the Lessee shall be afforded such additional time as shall be reasonably necessary to correct such failure,
provided corrective action is instituted by the Lessee within the applicable time period and diligently pursued until such
failure is corrected.  

Section
6.9      Indemnification of Issuer and the Trustee . The
Lessee shall, indemnify and save the Issuer and the Trustee and the officers, members, directors, agents, employees and attorneys
of each harmless against and from all claims by or on behalf of any person, firm, corporation or governmental entity arising from
the conduct or management of, or from any work or thing done on, the Project during the Lease Term, and against and from all claims
arising during the Lease Term from (a) any condition of the Project, (b) any breach or default on the part of the Lessee in the
performance of any of its obligations under this Lease, (c)  any contract entered into in compliance
with the provisions of Section 4.1 hereof in connection with the acquisition of the Project, (d) any act of negligence of the Lessee
or of any of its agents, contractors, servants, employees or licensees, (e) any act of negligence of any assignee or sublessee
of the Lessee, or of any agents, contractors, servants, employees or licensees of any assignee or sublessee of the Lessee, and
(f) in the case of the Issuer and the Trustee and the respective officers, members, directors and agents of each, against and from
any loss, liability, expense or claim arising under or in connection with the acceptance or administration of the Trust Estate
or the performance by the Trustee of its duties and obligations under the Indenture.  

The
Lessee shall indemnify and save the Issuer and the Trustee and the officers, members, directors, agents, employees and attorneys
of each harmless from and against all costs and expenses incurred in or in connection with any action or proceeding brought on
such claims. Nothing contained herein shall require the Lessee to indemnify the Issuer and the Trustee and the officers, directors,
agents, employees and attorneys of each for any claim or liability resulting from the Issuer s or the Trustee s own willful acts
or gross negligence. The Issuer or the Trustee   shall reimburse the Lessee for payments made
by the Lessee pursuant to this Section 6.9 to the extent of any proceeds, net of all expenses of collection, actually received
by either such party from any insurance covering such claims with respect to the losses sustained. The Issuer or the Trustee, as
applicable, shall promptly claim any such insurance proceeds and shall assign its rights to such proceeds, to the extent of such
required reimbursement, to the Lessee.  

In case any
action shall be brought against the Issuer or the Trustee in respect of which indemnity may be sought against the Lessee pursuant
to this Section 6.9, the Issuer or the Trustee, as applicable, shall promptly notify the Lessee in writing and the Lessee shall
have the right to assume the investigation and defense thereof including the employment of counsel and the payment of all expenses.
Failure to give any such notice shall not affect the right of the Issuer or Trustee, as applicable, to receive the indemnification
provided herein; unless such failure resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Issuer or the Trustee, such
failure could not be remedied and the result of such failure is that the interests of the Lessee were materially and adversely
affected as a direct result of such failure. The Issuer or the Trustee, as applicable shall have the right to employ separate counsel
in any such action and participate in the investigation and defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be
paid by the Issuer or the Trustee unless (i) the employment of such counsel has been authorized by the Lessee or, (ii) the Lessee
shall have failed promptly after receiving notice of such action from the Issuer or the Trustee, as applicable, to assume the defense
of such action and employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Issuer or the Trustee, as applicable, or (iii) the named parties
to any such action (including any impleaded parties) include both the Issuer or the Trustee, as applicable, and the Lessee or an
affiliate of the Lessee, and the Issuer or the Trustee, as applicable, shall have been advised by counsel that there may be one
or more legal defenses available to such party which are different from or in addition to those available to the Lessee or affiliate
of the Lessee or (iv) the Issuer or the Trustee, as applicable, shall have been advised by counsel that there is a conflict on
any legal issue between the Issuer or the Trustee, as applicable, and the Lessee (in which case, if the Issuer or the Trustee,
as applicable, notifies the Lessee in writing that it elects to employ separate counsel at the expense of the Lessee, the Lessee
shall not have the right to assume the defense of such action or proceeding on behalf of the Issuer or the Trustee, as applicable).
The Lessee shall not be liable for any settlement of any such action without its consent but, if any such action is settled with
the consent of the Lessee or if there be a final unappealable judgment for the plaintiff in any such action, the Lessee agrees
to indemnify and hold harmless the Issuer and the Trustee and the officers, directors, agents, employees and attorneys of each
from and against any loss by reason of such settlement or judgment. Nothing herein shall be construed as requiring the Issuer or
the Trustee to acquire or maintain insurance of any form or nature with respect to the Project or any portion thereof or with respect
to any phrase, term, provision, condition or obligation of this Lease or any other matter in connection herewith. 

The obligations
of the Lessee under this Section 6.9 shall survive the termination of this Lease and the satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture
or the sooner resignation or removal of the Trustee thereunder and shall continue in full force and effect, binding the Lessee
to the provisions of this Section 6.9 without regard to the manner of termination of this Lease.

of public highways), and other rights or privileges in the nature of easements with respect to any property included in the Project
and such grant will be free from the lien or Security Interests created by the Indenture or this Lease, or the Lessee may cause
to be amended, modified or released existing easements, licenses, rights-of-way and other rights or privileges in the nature of

intended to be given by or under this Lease or the Indenture, and (iii) during the time any Superior Security Document or any
Leasehold Security Deed is outstanding, as and to the extent permitted any Superior Security Document or any Leasehold Security
Deed.  

Section
8.7       Release of Certain Land . Notwithstanding any other provision of this Lease, the parties
hereto reserve the right at any time and from time to time by mutual agreement and as and to the extent permitted by any Superior
Security Document or any Leasehold Security Deed, at any time any Superior Security Document or any Leasehold Security Deed is
outstanding, to amend this Lease for the purpose of effecting the release of and removal from this Lease (i) of any unimproved
part of the Land (on which the Improvements are not located but on which parking, transportation, utility facilities or other

lease agreement or (ii) of any part of the Land with respect to which the Issuer proposes to convey a fee or other title to a
railroad or other public body or quasi-public body or to a public utility in order that transportation facilities or services
by rail, water, road or other means or utility services for the Project, for the benefit of the Lessee, may be provided, increased
or improved; provided, that if at the time any such amendment is made any of the Bonds are Outstanding and unpaid, there shall

an adequate legal description of that portion of the Land to be released, (iii) stating the purpose for which the Lessee desires

certificate of an Authorized Lessee Representative, dated not more than sixty (60) days prior to the date of the release and stating
that, in the opinion of the person signing such certificate, the release so proposed to be made will not materially impair the
utility of the Project and will not destroy the means of ingress thereto and egress therefrom. 

No release
effected under the provisions hereof shall entitle the Lessee to any abatement or diminution of the rents payable under Section
5.3 hereof. 

Section 8.8        Reports by   Lessee . The Lessee agrees if any of the Bonds are Outstanding and owned and permitted to be owned under
the Indenture by an entity which is not the Lessee or a parent, affiliate or subsidiary of the Lessee or a holder of a Superior
Security Document or a Leasehold Mortgagee, and if the Lessee is required by law to file the reports described below, to furnish
to the Trustee (for inspection by any owner of the Bonds or any portion thereof or an authorized representative of such Bondholder): 

(a)          Not
later than one hundred (100) days after the end of each fiscal year of the Lessee, the Lessee s Annual Report to the Commission
on Form 10-K (or any successor form) for the Lessee s most recent fiscal year then ended, excluding any exhibits and excluding
any documents incorporated by reference therein, other than (if applicable) the audited financial statements appearing in the Lessee s
annual report to stockholders for the Lessee s most recent fiscal year then ended (such Form 10-K or successor form, subject to
such exclusion, being hereinafter called the  Form 10-K ), the Form 10-K to contain audited financial statements prepared
in accordance with the requirements of such form, or, if the Lessee is not required to file the Form 10-K with the Commission,
audited annual financial statements of the Lessee, for the Lessee s most recent fiscal year then ended, which financial statements
will be prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; and 

(b)          Not
later than ninety (90) days after the end of each fiscal quarter of the Lessee, the Lessee s Quarterly Report to the Commission
on Form 10-Q (or any successor form) for the Lessee s most recent fiscal quarter then ended, excluding any  exhibits and
excluding any documents incorporated by reference therein, such Form 10-Q to contain unaudited financial statements prepared in
accordance with the requirements of such form, or, if the Lessee is not required to file the Form 10-Q with the Commission, unaudited
financial statements of the Lessee, for the Lessee s most recent fiscal quarter then ended. The Trustee shall have no duty to review
or analyze such reports and shall hold such reports solely as a repository for the benefit of the bondholders; the Trustee shall
not be deemed to have notice of any information contained therein or event of default which may be disclosed therein in any manner. 

Section
8.9       Filing of Certain Continuation Statements .  Pursuant to Section 1214 of the Indenture, upon written request of the
owners of a majority in principal amount of the Bonds, from time to time, the Trustee shall duly file or cause to be filed continuation
statements for the purpose of continuing without lapse the effectiveness of  (i)
 those Financing Statements which shall have been filed at or prior to the issuance of the Bonds in connection with the security
for the Bonds pursuant to the authority of the Uniform Commercial Code of Georgia, and (ii) any previously filed continuation statements
which shall have been filed as herein required. The Lessee shall sign (if necessary) and deliver to the Issuer or its designee
and the Issuer shall sign and deliver (if necessary) to the Trustee such continuation statements as may be requested of it from
time to time by the Trustee. Upon the filing of any such continuation statement the Trustee shall immediately notify the Lessee
and the Issuer that the same has been accomplished. 

Section
8.10     Compliance with Laws .  The Lessee agrees that it will comply with any applicable law, ordinance,
rule or regulation of any governmental authority with respect to its use of the Project other than such as the Lessee is contesting
in good faith and by appropriate proceedings. 

Section
8.11     Permitted Contests .  The Lessee may, at its expense and in its name and behalf or in the name and behalf of the
Issuer, in good faith contest any: 

(a)          taxes,
assessments and other charges referred to in Section 6.3 hereof; or 

(b)          regulations
or other requirements referred to in Section 8.10 hereof. 

In the event
of such contest, the Lessee may permit said taxes, assessments or other charges so contested to remain unpaid and undischarged
during the period of such contest and any appeal therefrom, unless by nonpayment of any such items, the Project or any part thereof
is liable to be subject to loss or forfeiture, in which case (unless bonded or superseded in a manner reasonably satisfactory to
the Issuer), the Lessee shall promptly pay such items or cause such items to be satisfied and discharged. 

No such contest
shall subject the Issuer to the risk of any material civil liability (other than the charge being contested) or any criminal liability,
and the Lessee shall give such reasonable security to the Issuer as may be demanded by the Issuer to ensure compliance with the
foregoing provisions of this Section. 

Section
8.12     Special Covenants Related to Ad Valorem Taxation .            The
Issuer represents and warrants that under the provisions of existing law, the Issuer is required to    pay
no ad valorem taxes or similar taxes upon any property owned by it in fee simple, including the Project. The Lessee acknowledges
that it may be required to pay ad valorem taxes based upon the value of its leasehold estate in the Project.  

The Lessee
has consulted with the Assessors with reference to the ad valorem tax treatment of the Lessee s interest in the Project during
the Lease Term and the Issuer and the Lessee expect that ad valorem taxes will be assessed against the Project on the basis of
the leasehold interest held by the lessee as determined pursuant to the uniform assessment methodologies applied by the Fulton
Count Board of Assessors. The Lessee and the Issuer agree to cooperate with each other and with the Assessors with respect to such
matters, including the manner from time to time reasonably required by the Issuer or the Assessors for the conveyance of title
to the Improvements and the Land which is a part of the Project. 

Section
8.13         Special
Environmental Indemnification.    

(a)          The
Lessee agrees to and shall indemnify, hold harmless, and defend the Issuer and Trustee, its officers, members, directors, agents,
and employees from and against any and all claims, losses, damages, expenses, causes of action, lawsuits, government regulatory
enforcement actions, and liability (individually, a  Claim,  collectively,  Claims ) asserted against the Issuer
arising out of alleged or actual  environmental contamination  (hereinafter defined) arising from the condition of the
Leased Land or the Lessee s leasing and operation of the Project. 

(b)           Environmental
contamination  as used herein shall mean damages to persons or property or violations of state or federal environmental laws
or regulations arising out of the Lessee s past operations at the Project or the operations of the Lessee at any time at the Project
with respect to but not limited to air emissions, water effluent discharges, and waste generation, transportation, storage, disposal,
or the handling of hazardous materials. 

(c)          The
Issuer shall notify the Lessee in writing within thirty (30) days after any Claim is made, brought, or asserted, in any event,
in writing, against the Issuer, and as to which the Issuer has actual knowledge by receipt of such written notification. The Lessee
shall similarly notify the Issuer in writing within thirty (30) days after any Claim is made, brought, or asserted against the
Lessee. 

(d)          The
Issuer shall fully cooperate with the Lessee, including but not limited to, assisting the Lessee in the preparation of a defense
to Claims when and as the Lessee fulfills its obligations under this Section of the Lease. In the event the Issuer provides notice
to the Lessee under subsection (c) above, the Lessee shall handle and control the defense of all Claims and the Lessee s decision
on litigation and settlement and all other such aspects shall be final; provided, however, no settlement or decision shall impose
upon the Issuer by apportionment or otherwise, any loss, damage or liability as a result thereof. 

(e)            The
Issuer shall use its best efforts to deliver the notice specified in subsection (c) above within a period of thirty (30) days after
the Issuer has direct knowledge (by receipt of written notice or otherwise) of a Claim.  

(f)
 The provisions of this Section 8.13 shall survive the termination of this Lease and shall continue in full force and effect,
binding the Lessee to the provisions of this Section 8.13 without regard to the manner of termination of this Lease. 

Section
8.14     Resolution of Disputes .  The Lessee agrees that it will respond to the Issuer within fifteen (15) days after notice
from the Issuer of any dispute, lawsuit or lien (other than a Superior Security Document) relating in any way to the Project and
will cooperate fully with the Issuer to resolve such dispute. If any lien (other than a Superior Security Document) placed on the
Project is not removed within ninety (90) days, the Lessee, upon the written request of the Issuer, shall dissolve such lien by
the filing of lien dissolution bond pursuant to O.C.G.A. Section 44-14-364.

  REDEMPTION;
RENT PREPAYMENT AND ABATEMENT  

Section
9.1         Assignment and
Subleasing .      Except as set forth in
Sections 9.7 and 9.8 below, this Lease may not be assigned, in whole on or in part, by the Lessee without the consent of (i)
the Issuer, (ii) the holder of a Superior Security Document or any Leasehold Mortgagee in its sole discretion at any time any
Superior Security Document or Leasehold Security Deed is outstanding, and (iii) the Trustee or the owners of a majority in
principal amount of the Bonds Outstanding, which consents of Issuer and Trustee shall   not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; provided, however, that this Lease may be assigned in whole or in part
without such consents, (1) to any entity controlled, controlling or under common control with the Lessee or to any successor
to substantially all of the business of the Lessee or (2) in connection with any sale/leaseback or other arrangement entered
into by the Lessee in connection with a financing transaction, only with the prior written consent of any holder of a
Superior Security Document and any Leasehold Mortgagee, in its sole discretion, at any time any Superior Security Document or
Leasehold Mortgagee is outstanding. Any such assignment is further subject to the following conditions:  

(a)          The
Lessee shall, within thirty (30) days after the delivery thereof, furnish or cause to be furnished to the Issuer and to the Trustee
a true and complete copy of each such assignment, together with any instrument of assumption executed by the assignee (which shall
become the  Lessee  hereunder); 

(b)          Upon
such assignment and assumption, the Lessee that is the assignor shall not be relieved of any of its obligations and covenants under
this Lease and said Lessee and the assignee  Lessee  shall be jointly and severally obligated hereunder, unless (i) all
owners of the Bonds that are then Outstanding under the Indenture and the holder of a Superior Security Document and any Leasehold
Mortgagee shall have consented in writing to such release, or (ii) if the Lessee is the owner of all Bonds and there is no holder
of a Superior Security Document or Leasehold Mortgagee of the Project; and 

(c)          If
any required consents to a release of the Lessee is obtained or is not required, as provided in (b) above, then upon such assignment
and assumption, the Lessee which is the assignor shall be relieved of all obligations and covenants under this Lease with respect
to the Project and the Bonds and the assignee shall thereafter be obligated hereunder as the  Lessee  of the Project. 

The Project
or any portion thereof may be subleased, in part, without the consent of the Issuer or of the Trustee, but no sublease shall relieve
the Lessee of any of its obligations hereunder. 

Section
9.2       Restrictions on Sale of Project by Issuer . The Issuer agr  ees
that, except as otherwise permitted under the terms of this Lease or the Indenture, it will not mortgage, sell, assign, transfer,
convey or otherwise encumber the Project or any portion thereof  or its interest in this Lease during the Lease Term and
that it will not, unless legally required to do so, take any other action which results in the levy or assessment of ad valorem
taxes on the Project or the Lessee s leasehold interest in the Project, except as otherwise provided herein.  If
 the laws of the State of Georgia at the time require or permit such action to be taken, nothing contained in this Section
9.2 shall prevent the consolidation of the Issuer with, or the merger of the Issuer into, or the transfer of the Project as an
entirety to, any public entity whose property and income are not subject to taxation and which has the authority to carry on the
business of owning and leasing the Project; provided, (a) that no such action shall be taken without the prior written consent
of the Lessee, the Trustee and the Bondholders, unless such action shall be required by law, and (b) that upon any such consolidation,
merger or transfer, the due and punctual payment of the principal of and interest on the Bonds according to their tenor, and the
due and punctual performance and observance of all the agreements and conditions of this Lease to be kept and performed by the
Issuer, shall be assumed (either as a matter of law or by express written assumption agreement) by the entity resulting from such
consolidation or surviving such merger or to which the Project shall be transferred as an entirety. 

Section
9.3       Prepayment of Bonds .     The Issuer, at the request at any time of the Lessee and if the same
are then redeemable, shall forthwith take all   steps   that
may be necessary under the applicable prepayment provisions of the Indenture to effect prepayment of all or any portion of the
Bonds, as may be specified by the Lessee, on the earliest prepayment date on which such prepayment may be made under such applicable
provisions of such Bonds or the Indenture. So long as the Lessee is not in default hereunder and the Issuer is not obligated to
prepay the Bonds pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, the Issuer shall not redeem any Bonds prior to their maturity unless requested
in writing by the Lessee. The Lessee agrees to give notice to the Issuer and the Trustee of any prepayment at least forty-five
(45) days prior to the prepayment date or such shorter period of time as may be acceptable to the Issuer and the Trustee unless
the holders of the Bonds waive, in writing, notice of such prepayment.  

Section
9.4       Prepayment of Rents .  There is expressly reserved to the Lessee the right, and the Lessee
is authorized and permitted, at any time it may choose, so long as it is not in default hereunder, to prepay all or any part of
the rents payable under Section 5.3 hereof, and the Issuer agrees that the Trustee may accept such prepayment when the same is
tendered by the Lessee. All prepaid rents shall be credited on the rents specified in Section 5.3, in the chronological order of
their due dates. 

Section
9.5       Rent Abatements if Bonds Paid Prior to Maturity .   If  at
any time the aggregate moneys in the Bond Fund are sufficient to retire or defease, in accordance with the terms of
the Indenture, all of the Outstanding Bonds and to pay all Ordinary Expenses of the Trustee due or to become due through the
date on which the last of the Bonds is to be paid and retired, under circumstances not resulting in termination of the Lease
Term, and if the Lessee is not at the time otherwise in default hereunder, the Lessee shall be entitled to use and occupy the
Project from the date on which such aggregate moneys are in the Bond Fund to and including midnight on January   1,   2022,
without the payment of rent during that interval (but otherwise on the terms and conditions hereof). 

Section
9.6         
 Reference to Bonds Ineffective After Bonds Paid.         Upon
Payment in Full of the Bonds and all fees, charges and expenses of the Trustee, all references in          this
Lease to the Bonds and the Trustee shall be ineffective and neither the Trustee nor the holders of any of the Bonds shall thereafter
have any rights hereunder, saving and excepting those that shall have theretofore vested. Reference is hereby made to Sections
1001 and 1002 of the Indenture which sets forth the conditions upon the existence or occurrence of which Payment in Full of the
Bonds shall be deemed to have been made.  

Section
9.7       Leasehold Security Deeds   I       Cooperation   of   Issuer   .     Lessee
is hereby given the right by the Issuer to mortgage and/or give security interests in this Lease under one or more
leasehold deeds to secure debt relating to the Project, the rents and Net Proceeds therefrom as the same may be amended,
modified, consolidated or extended (each such leasehold deed to secure debt (including any assignment of rents and leases or
other similar documents) and amendment, modification, consolidation or extension being herein called a  Leasehold
Security Deed ) and may assign this Lease to a lender as collateral security under any such permitted Leasehold
Security Deed.  

The Issuer
shall, at Lessee s written request, join in any such new Leasehold Security Deed or execute a separate security deed in order to
subject its fee interest in the Project described therein, and the rents and Net Proceeds therefrom, to the lien of such Leasehold
Security Deed or separate security deed provided that such Leasehold Security Deed or separate security deed shall be fully non-recourse
to the Issuer and the Issuer shall deliver such other documents or instruments as the holder of the Leasehold Security Deed or
separate security deed shall reasonably require in connection therewith. 

If 
 Lessee shall give a permitted Leasehold Security Deed with respect to the Project, Lessee shall provide the Issuer and the
Trustee with notice of the Leasehold Security Deed and the name and address of the Leasehold Mortgagee, and the Trustee shall subordinate
its interest in the Trust Estate to the lien of such Leasehold Security Deed. Subject to compliance with law, the Issuer agrees
that following receipt of such notice by the Issuer, and so long as the Leasehold Security Deed shall not be discharged or reconveyed,
or until written notice of discharge and reconveyance is given by the Leasehold Mortgagee to the Issuer and to the Trustee, the
following provisions shall apply with respect to this Lease: 

(a)          No
termination, cancellation, surrender or modification of this Lease by Lessee, including, without limitation, any amendment, supplement
or modification to the Project Summary or Exhibit  A  to the Lease, nor the waiver by Lessee of any of the provisions
of this Lease nor the giving by Lessee of any consent, shall be effective as to the Leasehold Mortgagee unless consented to in
writing by the Leasehold Mortgagee. 

(b)          The
Issuer or the Trustee, upon providing Lessee any notice of (i) default under this Lease or (ii) a matter on which the Issuer or
the Trustee may predicate or claim a default, shall at the same time provide a copy of such notice to the Leasehold Mortgagee of
which the Issuer and Trustee have been provided notice as provided above. The Issuer and the Trustee shall have no liability for
the failure to give any such notice, except that no such notice by the Issuer or by the Trustee to Lessee shall be deemed to have
been duly given to Lessee or the Leasehold Mortgagee unless and until a copy thereof has been so provided to the Leasehold Mortgagee
of which the Issuer and the Trustee have been provided notice as provided above. 

(c)                So long as the Leasehold Security Deed is in effect and has not
been canceled, unless the Leasehold Mortgagee shall otherwise expressly consent in writing, the fee simple title in and to the
Project held by the Issuer and the leasehold estates of Lessee created by this Lease shall not merge but shall remain separate
and distinct, notwithstanding the acquisition of said fee simple title and said leasehold estate by the Issuer or by Lessee or
by a third party, by purchase or otherwise.  

(d)            Notices
from the Issuer or from the Trustee to the Leasehold Mortgagee shall be mailed to the address furnished to the Issuer and Trustee,
as aforesaid, and those from the Leasehold Mortgagee to the Issuer or to the Trustee shall be mailed to the address designated
pursuant to the provisions of this Lease. Such notices, demands and requests shall be given in the manner described in this Lease.  

(e)            In
the event of any proceeding by either the Issuer or Lessee under the United States Bankruptcy Code (Title 11 U.S.C.) as now or
hereafter in effect:  

(i)        If
 this Lease is rejected as to the Project in connection with a bankruptcy proceeding by Lessee or a trustee in bankruptcy
for Lessee, (1) such rejection shall be deemed an assignment by Lessee to the Leasehold Mortgagee of the leasehold estate in the
Project and all of Lessee s interest under this Lease, (2) this Lease shall not terminate, and (3) the Leasehold Mortgagee shall
have all rights of the Leasehold Mortgagee under this Section 9.7 as if such bankruptcy proceeding had not occurred, unless the
Leasehold Mortgagee shall reject such deemed assignment by notice in writing to the Issuer and to the Trustee within thirty (30)
days following rejection of this Lease by Lessee or Lessee s trustee in bankruptcy.  If
 any court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that this Lease shall have been terminated notwithstanding the terms
of the preceding sentence as a result of rejection by Lessee or the trustee in bankruptcy in connection with any such proceeding,
the Issuer shall promptly, within a reasonable time, provide the Leasehold Mortgagee with written notice that this Lease has been
terminated (for the purposes of this clause  (i)  a  New Lease Notice ). The Issuer agrees to enter into a
new lease of the Project (for purposes of this clause   (i) ,
 a  New Lease ) with the Leasehold Mortgagee of the Project or its designee for the remainder of the Lease Term
of this Lease, effective as of the date of termination, upon the terms, covenants and conditions of this Lease provided: 

(A)         The
Leasehold Mortgagee shall make written request upon the Issuer for such New Lease within thirty (30) days after the date the Leasehold
Mortgagee receives the New Lease Notice given pursuant to this subsection. 

(B)         Any
New Lease made pursuant to this subsection shall have the same priority with respect to any lien, charge or encumbrance on the
Project as this Lease, and the tenant under such New Lease shall have the same right, title and interest in and to the project
as Lessee has under this Lease as of the date of such New Lease. 

(ii)               If   this
Lease is rejected by the Issuer or by the Issuer's trustee in bankruptcy:  

(A)         Lessee
shall not have the right to treat this Lease as terminated except with the prior written consent of the Leasehold Mortgagee; and
the right to treat this Lease as terminated in such event shall be deemed assigned to the Leasehold Mortgagee, whether or not specifically
set  forth  in the Leasehold Security Deed, so that the concurrence
in writing of Lessee and such Leasehold Mortgagee shall be required as a condition to treating this Lease as terminated in connection
with such proceeding. 

(B)         Unless
this Lease is treated as terminated in accordance with Subsection (ii)(A) above, then this Lease shall continue in effect upon
all the terms and conditions set forth herein, but excluding requirements that are not then applicable or pertinent to the remainder
of the Lease Term. 

(f)          The
Issuer shall have no rights in and to the rentals payable to Lessee under any sublease(s) of all or any part of the Project, which
rentals Issuer acknowledges may be assigned by Lessee to the Leasehold Mortgagee of the Project. 

(g)         The
Issuer acknowledges that, in the event of damage to or taking of the improvements that are part of the Project due to casualty
or condemnation, the Net Proceeds of casualty insurance or condemnation, as the case may be, may be required by the Leasehold Mortgagee
to be applied to reduce the then balance of the indebtedness secured by the Leasehold Security Deed or may be required by Leasehold
Mortgagee to be used for the restoration or replacement of such improvements. In the event of any conflict between the provisions
of this Lease and the provisions of a Leasehold Security Deed with respect to application of the Net Proceeds of casualty insurance
and condemnation, the provisions of the Leasehold Security Deed shall control. 

(h)         Notwithstanding any provisions of this Lease to the contrary, no default or event of default under the Leasehold Security Deed
or any other document or instrument evidencing or securing the indebtedness secured by the Leasehold Security Deed will, in and
of itself, constitute a default or Event of Default under this Lease unless the Leasehold Mortgagee directs that the same be treated
as an Event of Default under this Lease. 

(i)            (i)
Issuer acknowledges that, if the Leasehold Mortgagee or any other party succeeds to the interest of Lessee in the Project under
this Lease as a result of foreclosure proceedings or sale under a power of sale or the granting of a deed in lieu of foreclosure,
the Leasehold Mortgagee or any such other party, and any transferee of Leasehold Mortgagee or such other party (each, a  Successor
Tenant ), shall become a substituted Lessee under this Lease without necessity of any consent of, approval by or notification
to Issuer or Trustee. Without the consent of Issuer or the Trustee, the Successor Tenant shall have the right to sell and assign
its leasehold estate in the Project   or sublease the Project as provided in
Section 9.1 hereof without necessity of any consent of, approval by or notification to Issuer. As used in this Lease, the terms
 Leasehold estate  or  leasehold  shall mean the estate in the Project created by this Lease.  

(ii)         The
Successor Tenant shall be required to assume such Lessee's obligations under this Lease, and shall be deemed to have agreed to
perform all of such Lessee's obligations hereunder only from and after the date of such acquisition and only for so long as such
Successor Tenant is the owner of the leasehold estate. The Successor Tenant shall, upon any subsequent assignment of the leasehold
estate and the assumption by such assignee of this Lease in writing, be relieved of all obligations under this Lease. 

(iii)        So
long as any Successor Tenant is the owner of the leasehold estate, the Issuer and the Trustee shall look solely to the interest
of such Successor Tenant in the Project in the event of the breach or default by such Successor Tenant under the terms of this
Lease and any judgment or decree to enforce the obligations of such Successor Tenant shall be enforceable only to the extent of
the interest of such Successor Tenant in the Project. 

(iv)        Upon
the request of any such Successor Tenant, Issuer agrees to enter into a new, separate direct lease for the Project with any such
Successor Tenant for the remainder of the term remaining hereunder at the same rent and having the same other provisions as this
Lease, as theretofore amended. 

(j)             As
long as a Leasehold Mortgagee (including any successor or assign) holds a Leasehold Security Deed:

Leasehold Mortgagee may, but shall not be obligated to, cure any default by the Lessee under this Lease within sixty (60) days
after Leasehold Mortgagee's receipt of Issuer's or Trustee's default notice; provided, however, that if any non-monetary default
reasonably cannot be cured within such sixty (60) day-period, the same shall be deemed to have been timely cured if that Leasehold
Mortgagee commences reasonably appropriate curative action within such sixty (60) day-period and diligently prosecutes same to
completion thereafter. If any such non-monetary default reasonably cannot be cured by Leasehold Mortgagee without Leasehold Mortgagee
obtaining possession of the Project, such sixty (60) day cure period shall not commence until Leasehold Mortgagee obtains possession
of the Project, as long as all rent payments are made and all other defaults which reasonably can be cured by Leasehold Mortgagee
without Leasehold Mortgagee obtaining possession of the Project are so cured, and provided that Leasehold Mortgagee commences to
exercise any rights under its Leasehold Security Deed to obtain possession or to effect foreclosure on the Project, and diligently
pursues the exercise of such rights thereafter. 

(ii)          Notwithstanding
anything in this Lease to the contrary, if any, default by the Lessee under this Lease is of such a nature that it reasonably
cannot    be cured by such
Leasehold Mortgagee, or reasonably cannot be cured by such Leasehold Mortgagee without such Leasehold Mortgagee obtaining possession
of the Project, neither the Issuer nor the Trustee shall terminate this Lease as long as all rent payments are made with respect
to the Project and all other defaults which reasonably can be cured by such Leasehold Mortgagee without obtaining possession of
the Project are so cured.  

(iii)      Such
Leasehold Mortgagee may exercise any renewal option or any purchase option relating to the Project to which the Lessee under the
Lease is now or hereafter entitled under this Lease. 

(iv)      Neither
the Issuer nor the Trustee shall terminate this Lease as to the Project without first giving the Leasehold Mortgagee (i) written
notice of its intent to terminate this Lease and (ii) a reasonable period after such notice in which to obtain possession of the
Project or to effect foreclosure or otherwise acquire the leasehold estate from the Lessee and, within a reasonable time thereafter,
to cure any default which is capable of being cured by such Leasehold Mortgagee without such Leasehold Mortgagee obtaining possession
of the Project. If such Leasehold Mortgagee cures those defaults which reasonably can be cured by such Leasehold Mortgagee without
obtaining possession of the Project, then Issuer will not terminate this Lease. Further, neither the Issuer nor the Trustee shall
exercise any remedies for a default under this Lease as it relates to any property pledged under any Leasehold Security Deed without
the prior written consent of the Leasehold Mortgagee which is the holder thereof. 

(v)       In
addition to the rights of any Leasehold Mortgagee set forth in this Lease, if the Lease is terminated due to an Event of Default
under this Lease, and if, after giving effect to the provisions of Section 10.2 of this Lease, as amended, or any other agreements
or state of facts, the lien of the Leasehold Mortgagee  '  s
Leasehold Security Deed on the Project would be terminated, Issuer will enter into a new lease (for purposes of this clause  (v) ,
the  New Lease  with such Leasehold Mortgagee for the remainder of the term which was theretofore terminated at the same
rent and having the same other provisions as this Lease, as theretofore amended). Such right may be exercised (whether under the
provisions of this paragraph or under the provisions of this Lease) by written notice from the Leasehold Mortgagee to Issuer on
or before the expiration of thirty (30) days after the receipt by the Leasehold Mortgagee of a written notice from Issuer (for
the purposes of this clause  (v) , a  New Lease Notice ) of such termination, which notice shall advise such
Leasehold Mortgagee of such termination and expressly refer to the New Lease rights of such Leasehold Mortgagee under the provisions
of this Lease. After any termination of this Lease after which such Leasehold Mortgagee has the right to obtain a New Lease as
provided in this Section 9.7, for so long as such Leasehold Mortgagee has such right, Issuer shall not terminate any tenant subleases
or the rights of any subtenant.  

(vi)      Within
twenty (20) days after request by such Leasehold Mortgagee from time to time made, Issuer will execute and deliver to such Leasehold
Mortgagee or to such other person or entity as may be specified by such Leasehold Mortgagee an estoppel certificate containing
such information concerning this Lease as such Leasehold Mortgagee may reasonably request.

days after written notice thereof has been given to Lessee; or 

(d)         A
default by the Lessee or the Issuer under any Leasehold Security Deed on the Project, if the Leasehold Mortgagee which holds the

attorneys or incur other expenses for collection of rents or the enforcement of performance    or observance
of any obligation or agreement on the part of the Lessee herein contained, the Lessee agrees that it shall on demand therefor pay
to the Issuer or the Trustee the reasonable fees, costs and expenses of such attorneys and such other reasonable expenses so incurred

resolution by the Issuer, have happened, exist and have been performed. The issuance of this bond and the series of which it forms
a part, together with all other obligations of the Issuer, does not exceed or violate any constitutional or statutory limitation.

  EVENTS

SECTION

of the following events shall constitute an Event of Default under this Agreement:  

(a)          the
Borrower fails to pay when due any amount payable by the Borrower under the Loan Agreement or the Lease Agreement, subject to any
applicable notice and cure rights set forth therein; or 

(b)          any
failure by the Borrower to perform or observe any of its obligations under this Agreement (other than as set out in (a) above),
as and when required, which continues for a period of 30 days after notice of such failure by the Lender to the Borrower; provided,
that if any such failure concerning a non-monetary covenant or condition is susceptible to cure and cannot reasonably be cured
within said thirty (30) day period, then Borrower shall have an additional sixty (60) day period to cure such failure and no Event
of Default shall be deemed to exist hereunder so long as Borrower commences such cure within the initial thirty (30) day period
and diligently and in good faith pursues such cure to completion within such resulting ninety (90) day period from the date of
Lender's notice. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice or grace period shall apply in the case of any such failure which
could, in Lender's judgment, absent immediate exercise by the Lender of a right or remedy under this Agreement, result in harm
to Lender, impairment of this Agreement or any of the Collateral; or 

(c)          any
representation or warranty on the part of the Borrower contained in this Agreement or repeated and reaffirmed in this Agreement
proves to be false, misleading or incorrect in any material respect when made or deemed made; provided that if such breach is reasonably
susceptible of cure, then no Event of Default shall exist so long as Borrower cures such breach (i) within ten (10) days after

in (b) above for any other breach; or 

(d)          the
occurrence of an Event of Default under the Second Modification, the Modification Documents, the Loan Agreement, any of the Loan
Documents, the Lease Agreement, or any of the Bond Program Documents, subject to any applicable notice and cure periods set forth
therein. 

SECTION 5.2            Remedies
Upon Borrower's Default . If any Event of Default has occurred and is continuing: 

(a)          Lender
may, without further notice, exercise all rights, privileges or options pertaining to the Collateral as if Lender were the absolute
owner of such Collateral, upon such terms and conditions as Lender may determine, all without liability except to account for property
actually received by Lender and Lender shall not have any duty to exercise any of those rights; privileges or options and shall
not be responsible for any failure to do so or delay in so doing; and 

(b)          Lender
may exercise in respect of the Collateral, in addition to other rights and remedies provided for in this Agreement or
otherwise available to it, all of the rights and remedies of a secured party under the UCC and also may, without notice
except as specified below, sell the Collateral at public or private sale, at any of the offices of Lender or elsewhere, for
cash, on credit or for future delivery, and upon such other terms as may be commercially reasonable. The Borrower agrees
that, to the extent notice of sale shall be required by the UCC, ten days prior notice to the Borrower of the time and place
of any public or private sale shall constitute reasonable notification. Lender shall not be obligated to make any sale of
Collateral notwithstanding notice of sale having been previously given. Lender may adjourn any public or private sale from
time to time by announcement at the time and place fixed therefor, and such sale may, without further notice, be made at the
time and place to which it was so adjourned. In case of any sale by Lender of any of the Collateral, the Collateral so sold
may be retained by Lender until the selling price is paid by the purchaser, but Lender shall incur no liability in case of
failure of the purchaser to take up and pay for the Collateral so sold. 

The foregoing rights and remedies (i) shall be cumulative and concurrent,
(ii) may be pursued separately, successively or concurrently against the Borrower and any other party obligated under the Secured
Obligations, or against the Collateral, or any other security for the Secured Obligations, at the sole discretion of Lender, (iii)
may be exercised as often as occasion therefore shall arise, it being agreed by Borrower that the exercise or failure to exercise
any of same shall not in any event be construed as a waiver or release thereof or of any other right, remedy or recourse and (iv)
are intended to be and shall be non-exclusive. Nothing in this Agreement shall require or be construed to require Lender to accept
tender of performance of any of the Borrower's obligations under this Agreement after the expiration of any time period set forth
in this Agreement for the performance of such obligations and the expiration of any applicable cure periods, if any. 

Notwithstanding anything contained in this Section to the contrary,
following an Event of Default the Borrower shall continue to be the owner of all Bonds and other Collateral until written notice
to the contrary is provided by Lender under this Section. 

SECTION 5.3            Application
of Proceeds . The cash proceeds actually received from any sale or other disposition of the Collateral shall be applied as follows: 

(a)          first,
to reimburse the Lender for reasonable expenses actually incurred in preparing for sale, selling and the like and for reasonable
attorneys' fees and expenses actually incurred by the Lender in connection therewith; 

(b)          second,
to the repayment of all amounts then due and unpaid on the Secured Obligations; and 

(c)          third,
to remit the balance, if any, to the Borrower as required by law. 

The Borrower shall be liable for any deficiency if the proceeds
of any sale or other disposition of the Collateral is insufficient to pay the Secured Obligations. 

SECTION 5.4            No
Additional Waiver Implied  by  One Waiver . If the Borrower shall fail to perform any obligation

of LTIP Units  . The restrictions and conditions in  Section 2  of this Agreement shall lapse with respect to the number
of LTIP Units specified below on the Vesting Dates specified below, so long as the Management Agreement remains effective from

5.             Merger-Related
Action  . In contemplation of and subject to the consummation of a consolidation or merger or sale of all or substantially
all of the assets of the Company in which outstanding common shares are exchanged for securities, cash, or other property of an
unrelated corporation or business entity or in the event of a liquidation of the Company (in each case, a   Transaction  ),
the Board of Directors of the Company, or the board of trustees or directors of any corporation assuming the obligations of the
Company (the   Acquiror  ), may, in its discretion, take any one or more of the following actions, as to the outstanding
LTIP Units subject to this Award: (i) provide that such LTIP Units shall be assumed or equivalent awards shall be substituted,
by the acquiring or succeeding entity (or an affiliate thereof), and/or (ii) upon prior written notice to the LTIP Unitholders
(as defined in the Partnership Agreement) of not less than 30 days, provide that such LTIP Units shall terminate immediately prior
to the consummation of the Transaction. The right to take such actions (each, a   Merger-Related Action  ) shall
be subject to the following limitations and qualifications: 

2   

(a)          if
all LTIP Units awarded to the Grantee hereunder are eligible, as of the time of the Merger-Related Action, for conversion into
Common Units (as defined and in accordance with the Partnership Agreement) and the Grantee is afforded the opportunity to effect
such conversion and receive, (A) in consideration for the Common Units into which the Grantee s LTIP Units shall have been
converted, the same kind and amount of consideration as other holders of Common Units in connection with the Transaction, or (B)
the kind and amount of consideration payable to holders of the number of common shares into which such Common Units could be exchanged
(including the right to make elections as to the type of consideration), then Merger-Related Action of the kind specified in (i)
or (ii) of the first paragraph of  Section 5  above shall be permitted and available to the Company and the Acquiror; 

(b)          if
some or all of the LTIP Units awarded to the Grantee hereunder are not, as of the time of the Merger-Related Action, so eligible
for conversion into Common Units (in accordance with the Partnership Agreement), and the acquiring or succeeding entity is itself,
or has a subsidiary which is organized as a partnership or limited liability company (consisting of a so-called  UPREIT 
or other structure substantially similar in purpose or effect to that of the Company and the Partnership), then Merger-Related
Action of the kind specified in clause (i) of this  Section 5  above must be taken by the Acquiror with respect to all LTIP
Units subject to this Award which are not so convertible at the time, whereby all such LTIP Units covered by this Award shall be
assumed by the acquiring or succeeding entity, or equivalent awards shall be substituted by the acquiring or succeeding entity,
and the acquiring or succeeding entity shall preserve with respect to the assumed LTIP Units or any securities to be substituted
for such LTIP Units, as far as reasonably possible under the circumstances, the distribution, special allocation, conversion and
other rights set forth in the Partnership Agreement for the benefit of the LTIP Unitholders; and 

(c)          if
some or all of the LTIP Units awarded to the Grantee hereunder are not, as of the time of the Merger-Related Action, so eligible
for conversion into Common Units (in accordance with the Partnership Agreement), and after exercise of reasonable commercial efforts
the Company or the Acquiror is unable to treat the LTIP Units in accordance with  Section 5(b) , then Merger-Related Action
of the kind specified in clause (ii) of this  Section 5  above must be taken by the Company or the Acquiror, in which case
such action shall be subject to a provision that the settlement of the terminated award of LTIP Units which are not convertible
into Common Units requires a payment of the same kind and amount of consideration payable in connection with the Transaction to
a holder of the number of Common Units into which the LTIP Units to be terminated could be converted or, if greater, the consideration
payable to holders of the number of common shares into which such Common Units could be exchanged (including the right to make
elections as to the type of consideration) if the Transaction were of a nature that permitted a revaluation of the Grantee s
capital account balance under the terms of the Partnership Agreement, as determined by the Committee in good faith in accordance
with the Plan.     

3   

6.             Distributions  .
Distributions on the LTIP Units shall be paid currently to the Grantee in accordance with the terms of the Partnership Agreement.
The right to distributions set forth in this  Section 6  shall be deemed a Dividend Equivalent Right for purposes of the Plan. 

7.             Incorporation
of Plan  . Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, this Agreement shall be subject to and governed by all the terms
and conditions of the Plan. Capitalized terms used in this Agreement shall have the meaning specified in the Plan, unless a different
meaning is specified herein. 

8.             Covenants  .
The Grantee hereby covenants as follows: 

(a)          So
long as the Grantee holds any LTIP Units, the Grantee shall disclose to the Partnership in writing such information as may be reasonably
requested with respect to ownership of LTIP Units as the Partnership may deem reasonably necessary to ascertain and to establish
compliance with provisions of the Code applicable to the Partnership or to comply with requirements of any other appropriate taxing
authority. 

(b)          The
Partnership and the Grantee hereby agree to treat the Grantee as the owner of the LTIP Units from the Grant Date. The Grantee hereby
agrees to take into account the distributive share of Partnership income, gain, loss, deduction, and credit associated with the
LTIP Units in computing the Grantee s income tax liability for the entire period during which the Grantee has the LTIP Units. 

(c)          The
Grantee hereby recognizes that the IRS has proposed regulations under Sections 83 and 704 of the Code that may affect the proper
treatment of the LTIP Units for federal tax purposes. In the event that those proposed regulations are finalized, the Grantee hereby
agrees to cooperate with the Partnership in amending this Agreement and the Partnership Agreement, and to take such other action
as may be required, to conform to such regulations. 

(d)          The
Grantee hereby recognizes that the U.S. Congress is considering legislation that could change the federal tax consequences of owning
and disposing of LTIP Units. 

9.             Transferability  .
This Agreement is personal to the Grantee, is non-assignable and is not transferable in any manner, by operation of law or otherwise,
other than by will or the laws of descent and distribution, without the prior written consent of the Company. 

10.            Amendment  .
The Grantee acknowledges that the Plan may be amended or terminated in accordance with  Article XVI  thereof and that this
Agreement may be amended or canceled by the Committee, on behalf of the Partnership, for the purpose of satisfying changes in law
or for any other lawful purpose, provided that no such action shall adversely affect the Grantee s rights under this Agreement
without the Grantee s written consent. The provisions of  Section 5  of this Agreement applicable to the termination
of the LTIP Units covered by this Award in connection with a Transaction (as defined in  Section 5  of this Agreement) shall
apply,  mutatis mutandi  to amendments, discontinuance or cancellation pursuant to this  Section 10  or the Plan. 

4   

11.            Notices .
 Notices hereunder shall be mailed or delivered to the Partnership at its principal place of business and shall be mailed or
delivered to the Grantee at the address on file with the Partnership or, in either case, at such other address as one party may
subsequently furnish to the other party in writing. 

12.            Governing
Law .  This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware, applied
without regard to conflict of law principles. The parties agree that any action or proceeding arising directly, indirectly or otherwise
in connection with, out of, related to or from this Agreement, any breach hereof or any action covered hereby, shall be resolved
within the State of Delaware and the parties hereto consent and submit to the jurisdiction of the federal and state courts located
within the District of Delaware. The parties hereto further agree that any such action or proceeding brought by either party to
enforce any right, assert any claim, obtain any relief whatsoever in connection with this Agreement shall be brought by such party
exclusively in federal or state courts located within the District of Delaware.

and 00/100 Dollars ($250,000.00) (the   Initial Deposit  ), by wire transfer of immediately available federal

to the provisions of  Section 15  of this Agreement. 

2.2.          In
the event Purchaser does not terminate this Agreement prior to the expiration of the Due Diligence Period (as hereinafter defined)
pursuant to  Section 35  of this Agreement, Purchaser shall, within three (3) Business Days of the expiration of the Due Diligence

shall mean the Initial Deposit, together with the Additional Deposit and (b)   Downpayment   shall mean the Deposit
together with all interest thereon. 

2.3 Purchaser acknowledges
and agrees that time shall be of the essence with respect to Purchaser s obligation to deliver the Initial Deposit and the
Additional Deposit. The Downpayment shall automatically become nonrefundable upon the expiration of the Due Diligence Period, unless
Purchaser terminates (or is deemed to have terminated) this Agreement in accordance with the express provisions of this Agreement
and Purchaser is entitled to the return of the Downpayment in accordance with the express provisions of  Section 9  of this
Agreement. 

2.4.          An

with respect to Purchaser s obligation to deliver the Closing Funds. 

2.5.          Notwithstanding
the foregoing or anything to the contrary contained herein, a portion of the Initial Deposit in the amount of One Hundred
and no/100 Dollars ($100.00) shall be non-refundable (the   Independent Consideration  ) which amount shall

Agent, which amount Seller and Purchaser agree has been bargained for as independent consideration for (i) Seller s
execution and delivery of this Agreement, and (ii) Purchaser s right to inspect the Premises pursuant to  Section 35  below.
Such sum is in addition to and independent of any other consideration or payment provided for in this Agreement and is
non-refundable in all events. 

2  

3.          Assignment
of Contracts. 

3.1.          Purchaser
acknowledges that Seller has disclosed to it that the Premises is subject to the contracts and agreements described on  Exhibit
D  attached hereto and made a part hereof (as amended, modified, renewed or extended in accordance with this Agreement, the
  Existing   Contracts  , and together with any new contracts and agreements entered into after the Effective
Date in accordance with this Agreement, the   Contracts  ). 

3.2.          At
Closing, Seller shall assign to Purchaser and Purchaser shall assume all Contracts not fully and effectively terminated as of Closing
pursuant to  Section 17.6  herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser shall not be required to assume any Contract that,
by its terms, may not be assigned to and assumed by Purchaser without the consent of a third party, unless such third party s
written consent is actually obtained by Seller at or before the Closing, at Seller s sole cost and expense. 

4.          Closing
Date. 

The consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby (the   Closing  ), shall take place in escrow with the Escrow Agent or
at a mutually acceptable location as agreed to by Purchaser and Seller, on the date that is thirty (30) days after the expiration
of the Due Diligence Period (the   Initial Scheduled   Closing Date  ). Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions
of this  Section 4 , both Seller and Purchaser shall each have the right, by delivering five (5) days  prior written
notice to the other party, to adjourn the Closing Date (as hereinafter defined) up to two (2) times (but not for more than thirty
(30) days in the aggregate) (any date to which Seller or Purchaser so adjourns the Closing pursuant to the foregoing being referred
to herein as an   Adjourned Closing Date  ). As used herein, the term   Closing Date   shall
mean the Initial Scheduled Closing Date, or, if the Closing is adjourned, any Adjourned Closing Date. It is expressly agreed by
Seller and Purchaser that time is of the essence with respect to the parties  respective obligations to close this transaction
on the Closing Date. 

5.          Violations. 

Subject to Seller s
obligations to provide Purchaser a credit with respect to same pursuant to this Section 5, Purchaser shall accept title to the
Premises subject to all violations of law or municipal ordinances, orders or requirements issued by the departments of buildings,
fire, labor, health or other federal, state, county, municipal or other departments and governmental agencies having jurisdiction
against or affecting the Premises, and any outstanding work orders, whether any of the foregoing are outstanding as of the Effective
Date (each, an   Existing Violation  ) or noticed after the Effective Date (each, a   New Violation  
together with the Existing Violations, the   Violations  ). Purchaser acknowledges that Seller shall have no
restoration, repair or other obligation or liability of any kind or nature with respect to the Violations, except as expressly
provided herein. Except as required by law or in connection with the transfer of the Premises, Purchaser shall not, without first
obtaining the prior written consent of Seller, request that any governmental authority inspect or otherwise evaluate the condition
of the Premises in respect of the existence of Violations, provided that the foregoing shall not prohibit Purchaser from making
customary inquiries of governmental authorities as to whether Violations have been noticed by any such governmental authorities.
Purchaser (i) acknowledges that Seller has disclosed to Purchaser and/or Purchaser is otherwise aware of the existence of the
matters listed on  Exhibit E  attached hereto and made a part hereof, and (ii) agrees that same constitute Existing Violations
for purposes of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, Seller shall cause all Violations to
be cured and shall furnish evidence of same to Purchaser s reasonable satisfaction on or prior to the Closing Date, or,
in the absence of such cure and evidence, Seller shall credit Purchaser at Closing an amount equal to the estimate of the costs
and expenses required to cure any Violations outstanding as of the Closing Date, as established by quotes obtained from mutually
acceptable third party contractors. Notwithstanding the foregoing to the contrary, in no event shall Seller be obligated to expend
(whether in pursuit of a cure of such Violations or in the form of a credit to Purchaser) more than $25,000 in connection with
any such Violations;  provided ,  however , if, at Closing, a Violation remains uncured as of the Closing Date, and
Seller has elected not to give Purchaser a credit with respect to same because the cost of such cure exceeds $25,000, then Purchaser
shall have the right to terminate this Agreement and receive a refund of the Downpayment by written notice to Seller delivered
on or prior to the Closing Date. 

3  

6.          Apportionments. 

6.1.          The
parties agree that the following shall be apportioned between Seller and Purchaser at the Closing, as of 11:59 p.m. of the day
immediately preceding the Closing Date on the basis of the actual number of days of the month that shall have elapsed as of the
Closing Date and based upon the actual number of days in the month and a 365-day year, with Seller receiving credit (and retaining
obligations) with respect to any periods prior to the Closing Date, and Purchaser receiving credit (and assuming obligations) with
respect to any period from and after the Closing Date, and the net aggregate amount thereof either shall be paid by Purchaser to
Seller or credited to Purchaser towards the Purchase Price, as the case may be, at the Closing: 

(i)          Non-delinquent
real property taxes and assessments (including, without limitation, any assessments relating to Permitted Title/Survey Exceptions
(as hereinafter defined), business improvement district assessments or similar charges), water rates and charges, and sewer taxes,
in each case, not otherwise payable directly to the taxing authority by any tenant under a Lease. 

(ii)         Fixed,
escalation, additional and percentage rent, parking charges and all other charges under the Leases (including, without limitation,
electricity and utility surcharges, administrative fees in connection with security deposits held by Seller under the Leases),
if, as and when collected in accordance with  Section 6.6  of this Agreement (all of the foregoing being collectively referred
to as   Rents  ). 

(iii)        Charges
under the Contracts. 

(iv)        Non-delinquent
vault charges and taxes not otherwise payable directly to the taxing authority by any tenant under a Lease. 

(v)         Annual
license, permit, franchise and inspection fees, to the extent transferred to Purchaser at Closing pursuant hereto. 

(vi)        Deposits,
if any, on account with utility companies servicing the Premises (and Seller and Purchaser each agrees to cooperate to effectuate
the transfer of any such deposits), provided that, at Seller s option, Seller will obtain a refund of any such utility deposits
in effect and Purchaser shall provide Purchaser s own utility deposits directly to the applicable utility companies. 

4  

(vii)       All
other items (including, without limitation, utilities) customarily apportioned in connection with the sale of similar properties
similarly located. 

6.2.          If
the real property taxes and assessments (including, without limitation, any assessments relating to Permitted Title/Survey Exceptions,
business improvement district assessments or similar charges), water rates and charges, and sewer taxes, in each case, not otherwise
payable directly to the taxing authority by any tenant under a Lease are not finally fixed before the Closing Date, the apportionments
thereof made at the Closing shall be based on the real property taxes and assessments assessed for the preceding fiscal year or
the applicable billing period, or on estimated water and sewer charges and after the real property taxes or assessments or water
and sewer charges are finally fixed, Seller and Purchaser shall, within thirty (30) days after the date such taxes or rates and
charges are fixed, make a recalculation or the apportionment of the same, and Seller or Purchaser, as the case may be, shall promptly
make an appropriate settlement with the other based upon such recalculation. 

6.3.          (i)
If the Premises or any part thereof shall be or shall have been affected by any bond or special assessment prior to the Closing
Date, such bond or special assessment due and relating to the period of time prior to the Closing Date shall be paid by Seller
and such bond or special assessment due or relating to the period of time from and after the Closing Date shall be paid by Purchaser.
If any bond or special assessment on the Premises is payable in installments, then the installment for the current period shall
be prorated (with Purchaser assuming the obligation to pay any installments due from and after the Closing Date). 

(ii) If the Premises
or any part thereof shall be or shall have been affected by any bond or special assessment on or subsequent to the Closing Date,
whether or not payable in annual installments, the entire amount of such assessment shall be paid by Purchaser. 

6.4.          If
there are any water meters on the Premises (other than meters measuring water consumption costs which are the obligation of tenants
to pay under Leases), Seller shall furnish readings as close to Closing as reasonably practicable (provided such third-parties
are able to provide such meter readings), but in any event not more than five (5) days prior to Closing, and the unfixed water
rates and charges and sewer taxes and rents, if any, based thereon for the intervening time, shall be apportioned on the basis
of such last readings. If there is any fuel on hand, Seller shall furnish a reading, and the unfixed charges for such fuel, for
the period from the date of such reading until the Closing Date shall be apportioned based upon such reading. 

6.5.          The
amount of any unpaid taxes, assessments, water charges, sewer taxes and rents and vault charges and taxes which Seller is obligated
to pay and discharge, with interest and penalties thereon through and including the date two (2) days after the Closing Date may,
at the option of Seller, be allowed to Purchaser out of the balance of the Purchase Price, provided that official bills therefor
with interest and penalties thereon are furnished by Seller and paid at Closing. If there are any other liens or encumbrances which
Seller is paying and discharging pursuant to  Section 8  of this Agreement, Seller may use any portion of the Purchase Price
to satisfy the same, provided that the Title Company (as hereinafter defined) shall be willing to insure Purchaser against collection
of such liens and/or encumbrances, including interest and penalties, in which event such liens and encumbrances shall not be objections
to title. 

6.6.          (i)
To the extent that Purchaser or Seller receives Rents under Leases (including monthly payments of escalation and percentage rents
and  pass-throughs ) after the Closing Date, such Rents shall be distributed and applied in the following order of
priority: (x)  first , to Purchaser for Rents due and payable which accrue on or after the Closing Date until such tenants
are current on post-Closing Rents; (y)  second , to Purchaser and Seller on a prorated basis for Rents due and payable which
accrue for the calendar month in which the Closing occurred; and (z)  third , to Seller to the extent of all past due Rents
which accrued pre-Closing. 

5  

(ii) Purchaser
shall use good faith efforts to collect any and all Rents due pursuant to the Leases with respect to any period prior to Closing
for a period of six (6) months thereafter, provided that Purchaser shall not be obligated to file suit or dispossess any tenant
to collect same. If Seller is entitled, in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, to all or any portion of any Rents
owed by any tenant under a Lease and such tenant shall be in default of such tenant s obligation to pay such Rents, Seller
reserves the right to commence any and all appropriate legal proceedings to collect such Rents only (i) against those former tenants
who no longer occupy any portion of the Premises, and (ii) after the expiration of the aforesaid six (6) month period. 

6.7.          Prior
to the Closing, Purchaser and Seller shall cooperate to arrange for utility services to the Premises to be discontinued in Seller s
name, as of the day immediately prior to the Closing Date, and to be reinstated in Purchaser s name, as of the Closing Date.
In the event that the foregoing cannot be effectuated, then Seller shall furnish readings of the applicable utility meters to a
date not more than thirty (30) days prior to the Closing Date, and the unfixed charges, if any, based thereon for the intervening
time, shall be apportioned on the basis of such last readings. 

6.8.          Intentionally
Omitted. 

6.9.          It
is the intention of the parties for Seller to transfer to Purchaser concurrently with the Closing all security deposits of tenants
under the Leases, together with any interest accrued on such security deposits,  provided ,  however , Seller shall have
the right to deduct from any security deposit any amount due from a tenant of the Premises pursuant to the terms of such tenant s
lease for matters arising prior to the Closing Date. To effectuate such intent, at Closing, Purchaser shall receive a credit against
the Purchase Price in the amount of any such security deposits. In the event any security deposits are evidenced by letters of
credit, Seller cause such letters of credit to be transferred to Purchaser effective as of the Closing Date, at Seller s
sole cost and expense. 

6.10.         Intentionally
Omitted. 

6.11.         To
the extent units become vacant at the Premises more than five (5) days prior to the Closing Date (the   Rent-Ready Date  ),
Seller shall cause such vacant units to be put in Rent-Ready Condition (as hereinafter defined), and if Seller fails to make such
units in Rent-Ready Condition by the Closing Date, Seller shall grant Purchaser a rent-ready credit at Closing against the Purchase
Price in an amount equal to Six Hundred Twenty-Five and No/100 Dollars ($625.00) (the   Rent-Ready Credit  ) for
each unit that is not in Rent-Ready Condition. The term   Rent-Ready Condition   shall mean the condition in which
Seller currently delivers vacant units to new tenants at the Premises in Sellers  ordinary course of business and operations,
freshly painted and cleaned, with all appliances, fixtures, and equipment therein in good working order. Notwithstanding the foregoing
or anything to the contrary contained herein, Seller shall have no obligation to provide a Rent-Ready Credit for any unit at the
Premises which become vacant after the Rent-Ready Date. 

6.12 Except as provided
in  Section 6.2 , in the event the Closing occurs, the provisions of this  Section 6  shall survive the Closing Date
for six (6) months and either party shall have the right prior to expiration of such six (6) month period to require by written
notice to the other that errors related to computations and calculations under this  Section 6  be corrected or adjusted
to reflect actual amounts, if prorations as of the Closing Date were based on estimates pursuant hereto, and the parties agree
to negotiate in good faith to resolve any such errors or adjustments. Any errors or adjustments not raised prior to the expiration
of such six (6) month period shall be deemed to be waived. Purchaser and Seller acknowledge and agree that the provisions of Section
37 do not apply with respect to post-closing corrections to the prorations contemplated by this Section 6.

obligations on the part of Seller to be performed pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement, except where such agreements and
obligations are specifically stated to survive the Closing herein. 

9  

8.          Title
Insurance and Survey Matters. 

8.1.          Within
five (5) days after the Effective Date, to the extent in the possession or reasonable control of Seller or its property manager,
Seller shall deliver to Purchaser Seller s existing survey of the Premises (the   Existing Survey  ). Purchaser
may, at its sole cost, obtain and deliver to Seller (i) an update of the Existing Survey or a new survey (any such update or new
survey being referred to as the   Updated Survey  ) and (ii) a commitment for title insurance (the   Title
Commitment  ) through Chicago Title Insurance Company, c/o Fidelity National Title Group, 5565 Glenridge Drive, Suite
300, Atlanta, Georgia 30342, Attn: Chris Valentine (  chris.valentine@fntg.com  ) (the   Title
Company  ) with respect to the Premises. The Existing Survey or the Updated Survey, as applicable, are referred to herein
individually or collectively as the   Survey  . If the Title Commitment or Survey discloses exceptions to title
which are unacceptable to Purchaser (any such exception being referred to herein as an   Unpermitted Title/Survey Matters  ),
then Purchaser shall have the right to give Seller notice of any such Unpermitted Title/Survey Matters (  Purchaser s
Title/Survey Objection Notice  ) on or prior to the date that is seven (7) Business Days prior to the expiration of the
Due Diligence Period (the   Title/Survey   Objection Out Date  ). Any matters revealed by the Title Commitment
and/or Survey, other than Monetary Liens (as defined herein) and matters which can be removed by Seller s delivery of a
title or owner s affidavit reasonably satisfactory to the Title Company, which are not objected to by Purchaser on or prior
to the Title/Survey Objection Out Date shall be deemed   Permitted Title/Survey Exceptions  . In addition, any
matters revealed by the Title Commitment and/or Survey that do not constitute Unpermitted Title/Survey Matters shall constitute
Permitted Title/Survey Exceptions. Seller shall have five (5) Business Days following the receipt of any such notice in which
to give Purchaser notice (the   Seller s Title/Survey Response  ) that Seller will either (a) cause such
Unpermitted Title/Survey Matter(s) to be deleted from the Title Commitment or Survey or insured against by the Title Company or
(b) not cause such Unpermitted Title/Survey Matter(s) to be deleted from the Title Commitment or Survey or insured against by
the Title Company. If Seller gives notice pursuant to  clause (a)  above, then Seller will cause such Unpermitted Title/Survey
Matter(s) to be deleted from the Title Commitment or Survey or cause such Unpermitted Title/Survey Matter(s) to be insured against
by the Title Company prior to the Closing Date. If Seller (i) fails to deliver the Seller s Title/Survey Response to Purchaser
within said five (5) Business Day period, or (ii) gives notice pursuant to  clause (b)  above, then Purchaser shall give
written notice to Seller prior to the expiration of the Due Diligence Period either (x) terminating this Agreement (in which event
the provisions of  Section 9  of this Agreement shall apply to such termination) or (y) waiving the right to terminate this
Agreement as a result of any such Unpermitted Title/Survey Matter(s). If Purchaser fails to deliver such notice terminating this
Agreement pursuant to  clause (x)  above prior to expiration of the Due Diligence Period, then Purchaser shall be deemed
to have elected under  clause (y)  above. If Purchaser elects (or is deemed to have elected) under  clause (y)  above
in accordance with the foregoing, then any Unpermitted Title/Survey Matters previously objected to by Purchaser shall become Permitted
Title/Survey Exceptions. Purchaser acknowledges that Seller shall be entitled to deliver Seller s notice under  clause
(a)  or  clause (b)  above in Seller s sole and absolute discretion subject to the provisions of  Section 8.3
 of this Agreement and that Purchaser shall be required to accept title to the Premises subject to all Permitted Title/Survey
Exceptions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in the event Purchaser fails to submit objections with
respect to Title/Survey Matters within the time period set forth above, then Purchaser will be deemed to have waived its right
to object to matters appearing on the Title Commitment (or update thereto) or any Updated Survey (or update thereto) pursuant
to  Section 8.1  or  Section 8. 2. 

10  

8.2.          Except
as provided in  Section 8.1  above, in the event that any update of the Title Commitment or the Survey shows any new matters
or conditions which are both (A) not included within the list of Existing Title/Survey Matters shown on  Exhibit N  attached
hereto and made a part hereof and are not Permitted Title/Survey Exceptions, and (B) material and adverse to Purchaser in Purchaser s
reasonable judgment, Purchaser shall have the right to object to same by delivering notice (each such notice, a   Purchaser s
Title/Survey Update Notice  ) thereof to Seller prior to the date that is the earlier of (X) the Closing Date or (Y)
the date that is five (5) Business Days after Purchaser receives such update of the Title Commitment or the Survey (and if Purchaser
fails to deliver such notice within such five (5) Business Day (or shorter) period, then Purchaser shall be deemed to have accepted
such matters or conditions as Permitted Title/Survey Exceptions). Seller shall have five (5) Business Days following the receipt
of any Purchaser s Title/Survey Update Notice (and if the expiration of such five (5) Business Day period is after the Closing
Date, then, at the option of Seller, the Closing shall be adjourned to the date three (3) Business Days after the expiration of
such five (5) Business Day period) in which to give Purchaser notice (each such notice, a   Seller s Title/Survey
Update Response  ) that Seller will either (a) cause such new matter or condition to be deleted from the Title Commitment
or Survey or insured against by the Title Company, as the case may be, or (b) not cause such new matter or condition to be deleted
from the Title Commitment or removed from the Survey, or insured against by the Title Company, as the case may be. If Seller gives
a Seller s Title/Survey Update Response pursuant to  clause (a) , then Seller will cause such new matter or condition
to be deleted from the Title Commitment or Survey or insured against by the Title Company, as the case may be, to occur on or
prior to the Closing Date (as same may be adjourned pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this  Section 8.2 ), and Seller s
failure to cure such matters as just described shall constitute a default by Seller hereunder. If Seller (i) fails to give any
Seller s Title/Survey Update Response within said five (5) Business Day period, or (ii) gives notice pursuant to  clause
(b) , then Purchaser will deliver written notice to Seller on or before the earlier of (I) one (1) Business Day prior to the
Closing Date (as same may be adjourned pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this  Section 8 .2) or (II) the date that
is three (3) Business Days following the earlier of the expiration of such five (5) Business Day period or the delivery of the
Seller s Title/Survey Update Response, either (x) terminating this Agreement (in which event the provisions of  Section
9  of this Agreement shall apply to such termination) or (y) waiving the right to terminate this Agreement as a result of any
such new matter or condition. If Purchaser fails to deliver such notice terminating this Agreement pursuant to  clause (x)  within
said three (3) Business Day (or shorter) period, then Purchaser shall be deemed to have elected under  clause (y)  above.
If Purchaser elects to waive the right (or is deemed to have elected to waive the right) to terminate this Agreement pursuant
to  clause (y)  above, then any new matter or condition previously objected to by Purchaser shall become Permitted Title/Survey
Exceptions. 

8.3.          Notwithstanding
anything contained herein to the contrary, except as specified in this  Section 8 .3, Seller shall have no obligation to take
any steps, bring any action or proceeding or incur any effort or expense whatsoever to cure any title or survey objection,  provided ,
 however , notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller shall cause to be removed as exceptions to title or insured against by the
Title Company the liens of any mortgages or deeds of trust of Seller and any and all judgment liens, tax liens and mechanics 
and materialmens  liens caused by, through, or under Seller, which encumber or otherwise affect the Premises (collectively,
  Monetary Liens  ), whether or not same are included in Purchaser s Title/Survey Objection Notice or Purchaser s
Title/Survey Update Notice. 

9.          Disposition
of Downpayment. 

If (a) Purchaser is entitled
to and does elect to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the provisions of  Sections 8 ,  1 1,  14 , or
 35  of this Agreement or (b) Seller is entitled to and does elect to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the provisions
of  Section 21.2  of this Agreement, then Seller and Purchaser shall direct Escrow Agent to refund to Purchaser the Downpayment
(or such portion thereof as shall have been deposited with Escrow Agent). Upon such delivery of the Downpayment to Purchaser,
this Agreement shall terminate and neither party to this Agreement shall have any further rights or obligations hereunder, except
for the Post-Termination Obligations (as hereinafter defined), which shall survive such termination. 

11  

10.         Defaults
and Remedies. 

10.1         If
Purchaser shall default hereunder (including, without limitation, a default hereunder based on a breach or breaches by Purchaser
of Purchaser s Representations (as hereinafter defined) that is discovered prior to the Closing) or shall fail or refuse
to perform Purchaser s obligation to purchase the Premises in accordance with this Agreement, Seller, as Seller s sole
remedy (except as provided in this  Section 10 ), shall have the right to cause Escrow Agent to deliver to Seller the Downpayment,
as and for Seller s liquidated damages (the parties hereto acknowledging that it would be difficult or impossible to accurately
ascertain the amount of Seller s damages), whereupon this Agreement shall terminate and neither party shall have any further
rights or obligations under this Agreement other than the Post-Termination Obligations, which shall survive such termination. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the liquidated damages limitation set forth above shall (a) not limit or otherwise prevent Seller from receiving
any amounts owed under  Section 32  of this Agreement, (b) have no application to any claim made by Seller against Purchaser
based on Purchaser s obligations under the Post-Termination Obligations, and in the event Seller has a claim against Purchaser
based on any such Post-Termination Obligation, Seller shall be entitled to recover damages for such claim in addition to retention
of the Downpayment and (c) not limit or otherwise prevent Seller from receiving any prejudgment interest (statutory or otherwise)
awarded by a court in addition to retention of the Downpayment and any amounts owed under  Section 32  of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in no event shall Purchaser be liable to Seller for any direct, punitive, speculative
or consequential damages. 

10.2         If
Seller shall default hereunder or shall fail or refuse to perform Seller s obligation to convey title to the Premises in
accordance with this Agreement, Purchaser, as Purchaser s sole remedy may either: 

(a)          terminate
this Agreement and receive a refund of the Downpayment, whereupon this Agreement shall terminate and neither party shall have any
further rights or obligations under this Agreement other than the Post-Termination Obligations, which shall survive such termination;
or 

(b)          provided
that Purchaser is not otherwise in default under this Agreement, bring an action against Seller to seek specific performance of
Seller s obligations hereunder within thirty (30) days of the scheduled Closing Date. Such action for specific performance
will not be construed to require Seller to cure any title defect (except as specifically provided in  Section 8.3  of this
Agreement). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if Purchaser elects to pursue the equitable remedy of specific
performance and, due to the wrongful or intentional act of Seller, such remedy is not available, Purchaser may seek any other right
or remedy available at law or in equity except as otherwise limited by this Agreement. The foregoing shall (a) not limit or otherwise
prevent Purchaser from receiving any amounts owed under  Section 32  of this Agreement, (b) have no application to any claim
made by Purchaser against Seller based on Seller s obligations under the Post-Termination Obligations, and in the event Purchaser
has a claim against Seller based on any such Post-Termination Obligation, Purchaser shall be entitled to recover damages for such
claim in addition to any remedies set forth above. 

12  

If Purchaser believes that Seller has defaulted
as aforesaid on or prior to the Closing Date, then Purchaser shall be required to elect one (1) of the remedies set forth in either
 Section 10.2(a)  or  Section 10.2(b)  on or prior to the Closing Date and if Purchaser fails to make such an election
same shall conclusively mean that Purchaser has determined to proceed under  Section 10.2(a)  of this Agreement. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in the event that Purchaser has actual knowledge that Seller has defaulted
in any respect under this Agreement on or prior to the Closing Date and nonetheless proceeds to Closing, then same shall be deemed
to be a waiver by Purchaser of any further right to make a claim arising out of such pre-Closing default. For the avoidance of

Each of the representations and warranties set forth in  Section 11.1  of this Agreement (collectively,   Seller s
Representations  ) shall be deemed to have been remade at and as of the Closing Date with the same force and effect as
if first made on and as of the Closing Date;  provided , that, at the Closing, Seller may submit to Purchaser one (1) or more
schedules, certified by Seller as true and correct as of the Closing Date, which modify or update any of Seller s Representations,
or any exhibits referred to therein, to reflect matters, if any, which arose subsequent to the Effective Date, and, if and only
if Purchaser has not elected to terminate this Agreement as a result of such changes pursuant to  Section 11.3(b) , Seller s
Representations shall be deemed to have been remade with the changes, if any, set forth in such schedule or schedules. 

15  

(b)          If
on or prior to Closing, Seller s Representations, as made as of the Effective Date, are actually known by Purchaser to be
untrue in any material respect as of the Effective Date, or if Seller s Representations, as remade on the Closing Date under
 Section 11.3(a)  or otherwise, shall result in Seller s Representations made as of the Effective Date being untrue
in any material respect as of the Closing Date, then Purchaser may, at Purchaser s option and as Purchaser s sole remedy
(Purchaser specifically waiving any right to bring any action against Seller for damages arising therefrom), either (i) terminate
this Agreement by notice in writing to Seller, in which event (subject to the provisions of this  Section 11.3 ) the provisions
of  Section 9  of this Agreement shall apply to such termination, or (ii) waive the same, in which case Purchaser and Seller
shall close the transaction without any increase or abatement of the Purchase Price;  provided ,  however , that Purchaser

or Contracts, or amendments, modifications or renewals of same, as approved in accordance with  Section 18  herein; 

(x)          changes
after the Effective Date to the list of Leases that arise in the ordinary course of business after the Effective Date (it being
expressly acknowledged and agreed by Purchaser that the risk of changes to the list of Leases or the leasing status of the Premises,
for any reason after the Effective Date is Purchaser s risk and no such change is intended to grant Purchaser any right to
terminate this Agreement or obtain any damages from Seller); 

(y)          changes
after the Effective Date to the schedule of litigation set forth in  Exhibit P  to reflect any additions or deletions other
than litigation that, if adversely determined, would (i) affect title to the Premises, (ii) materially and adversely affect the
value of the Premises, or (iii) seek to restrain or prevent the sale of the Premises to Purchaser; 

(z)          condemnation
or eminent domain proceedings commenced after the Effective Date (it being agreed that Purchaser s rights in respect of condemnation
and eminent domain proceedings are governed by  Section 14  below); or 

(aa)         actions
that Seller is not prohibited from taking pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. 

(c)          Notwithstanding
the provisions of  Section 11.3(b)  of this Agreement, if, within five (5) days after the delivery of Purchaser s notice
terminating this Agreement pursuant to  Section 11.3(b) , Seller delivers written notice to Purchaser of Seller s intention
to cure, then Purchaser s notice of termination shall be without effect and Seller shall cause such untrue Seller s
Representation to be corrected at or before Closing (and Seller shall be entitled to adjourn the Closing Date one or more times
(but for not more than ten (10) days in the aggregate) to effectuate such cure). If Seller fails to effectuate such cure on or
before the Closing Date (as same may have been adjourned), then Purchaser shall have the right at Closing, as Purchaser s
sole remedy (Purchaser specifically waiving any right to bring an action against Seller for damages arising therefrom), to either
(i) terminate this Agreement by notice in writing to Seller, in which event (subject to the provisions of this  Section 11.3 )
the provisions of  Section 9  of this Agreement shall apply to such termination, or (ii) waive the same, in which case Purchaser
and Seller shall close the transaction without any increase or abatement of the Purchase Price.

(d)          If
(i) on or prior to the Closing Date, Purchaser delivers notice to Seller that any Seller s Representations were or
have become false in any material respect as hereinabove provided and/or (ii) on or prior to the date to which Seller
adjourns the Closing pursuant to  Section 11.3(c)  above, Seller has elected to cure any then-untrue Seller s
Representations, then Purchaser shall be required to elect one of the remedies set forth in  Section 11.3(b)  or  Section
11.3(c)  (as applicable). If Purchaser fails to make such an election on or prior to the Closing Date, same shall
conclusively mean that Purchaser has determined to proceed under  clause (ii)  of  Section 11.3(b)  above or  clause
(ii)  of  Section 11.3(c)  above (as applicable). In the event that Purchaser has actual knowledge that any of
Seller s Representations are untrue in any material respect prior to the Closing Date and nonetheless proceeds to
Closing, then same shall be deemed to be a waiver by Purchaser of any further right to make a claim arising out of such
untrue nature of such Seller s Representation(s). 

11.4.          Seller s
Representations (including those modified or updated by Seller in accordance with the provisions of  Section 11.3  of this
Agreement) shall survive the Closing for a period of six (6) months. Each of the representations and warranties set forth in  Section
11.2  of this Agreement (collectively,   Purchaser s Representations  ) shall be deemed to have been
remade at and as of the Closing Date with the same force and effect as if first made on and as of the Closing Date. Purchaser s
Representations shall survive the Closing for a period of six (6) months.

any of Purchaser s Representations or Seller s Representations is discovered to be untrue in any material respect after
Closing, and a claim is asserted within the time periods set forth in  Section 11.4  of this Agreement, then Seller or Purchaser,
as the case may be, shall, subject to the provisions of  Sections 19  and  37  of this Agreement, have the right to pursue
any and all remedies available against Purchaser or Seller, as the case may be, as a result of such inaccuracy.

Omitted.

purposes of this Agreement, (a) the term  to the actual knowledge of Seller  and words of similar import, shall mean
the actual knowledge of Kevin Pleasant, who Seller represents is an authorized representative of Seller with respect to the Premises,
and the person with the actual knowledge about Seller s ownership, use and operation of the Premises and the condition thereof,
without any obligation to make inquiry of any kind other than those which he would make in the performance of his duties in the
just-described capacity, and (b) the term  to the actual knowledge of Purchaser  and words of similar import, shall
mean the actual knowledge of Josh Champion. The knowledge parties referenced in this Section shall have no personal liability under

or omitted to be done by Escrow Agent in good faith without gross negligence or willful misconduct in the performance of
Escrow Agent s duties hereunder. 

15.5.        Escrow
Agent is acting as a stake-holder only with respect to the Downpayment. If there is any dispute as to whether Escrow Agent is obligated
to deliver all or any portion of the Downpayment or as to whom the proceeds of the Downpayment are to be delivered, Escrow Agent
shall not be required to make any delivery, but in such event Escrow Agent shall hold the Downpayment until receipt by Escrow Agent
of an authorization in writing, signed by all of the parties having any interest in such dispute, directing the disposition of
the Downpayment, or, in the absence of such authorization, Escrow Agent shall hold the Downpayment, until the final determination
of the rights of the parties in an appropriate proceeding. If such written authorization is not given, or proceedings for such
determination have not begun within ninety (90) days after the date Escrow Agent receives written notice of such dispute, and thereafter
diligently continued, Escrow Agent may, but is not required to, bring an appropriate action or proceeding for leave to deposit
the Downpayment in court, pending such determination. Escrow Agent shall be reimbursed for all costs and expenses of such action
or proceeding including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys  fees and disbursements, by the party determined not to
be entitled to the Downpayment, or if the Downpayment is split between the parties hereto, such costs of Escrow Agent shall be
split,  pro rata , between Seller and Purchaser, based upon the amount of Downpayment received by each. Upon making delivery
of the Downpayment, in the manner provided in this Agreement, Escrow Agent shall have no further liability hereunder. 

15.6.        Escrow
Agent has executed this Agreement solely to confirm (i) receipt of the Deposit and (ii) that Escrow Agent, upon receipt thereof,
will hold the Downpayment in escrow, pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement. 

16.         Closing
Costs.

pay (a) all title insurance premiums (including any and all premiums charged by the Title Company for endorsements and affirmative
coverages to the title policy, with the exception of any costs charged or incurred with respect to objections which Seller has
agreed to or is required to cure pursuant to  Section 8 ) and all other title insurance company charges and all survey costs
in connection with the transaction contemplated by this Agreement, (b) fifty percent (50%) of any escrow fees charged by Escrow Agent, (c) all due diligence
costs, and (d) all recording fees and charges for the Deed other than Conveyance Taxes (as defined below). Seller shall pay (x)

to this  Section 17 , between the Effective Date and the Closing Date or earlier termination of this Agreement, Seller will
lease, operate, manage (or cause to be managed) and maintain the Premises and will provide or cause to be provided substantially
such services with respect to the Premises that have been provided by Seller in the past in accordance with Seller s customary
practice, substantially the same as if Seller did not intend to transfer the Premises. 

17.2.          Between
the Effective Date and the Closing Date or earlier termination of this Agreement, Seller will maintain casualty and liability insurance
with respect to the Premises (which insurance may be effected under a blanket policy or policies of insurance) in accordance with
Seller s past practice. 

17.3.          Between
the Effective Date and the Closing Date or earlier termination of this Agreement, subject to  Section 34  of this Agreement,
Seller will make all books, records, billing information, Leases, Contracts and other documents relating to the operation of the
Premises available to Purchaser and Purchaser s accountants, attorneys and other third party consultants, upon advance written
request therefor, and will permit Purchaser s accountants, attorneys and other third party consultants to examine the same,
during regular business hours, at Purchaser s sole cost and expense,  provided ,  however , notwithstanding the
foregoing, Seller shall not be required to make available to Purchaser any of the foregoing to the extent that same (i) constitutes
privileged information pertaining to any potential or existing litigation or other proceeding or (ii) constitutes confidential
information prepared by Seller pertaining to the Premises (including internal evaluations, appraisals, reports or other documentation
and information pertaining to the business relationships among the members comprising Seller). The making available to Purchaser
of the foregoing shall in no event be deemed to constitute a representation by Seller as to the accuracy, correctness or completeness
thereof. 

22  

17.4.          Between
the Effective Date and the Closing Date or earlier termination of this Agreement, subject to the rights of all tenants and other
occupants of the Premises, Seller will permit Purchaser and Purchaser s engineers, at Purchaser s sole cost and expense,
to inspect the Premises and all portions thereof from time to time upon reasonable advance request therefor and accompanied by
a representative of Seller; provided, however, Purchaser will not be permitted to perform any such inspection unless and until
Purchaser delivers to Seller reasonably satisfactory evidence, in the form of a properly completed Certificate of Insurance, that
Purchaser has obtained such insurance as Seller shall reasonably require in connection with any such inspection, which insurance
shall name Seller and Seller s managing agent as additional insureds (it being agreed by Purchaser that such insurance shall
include (i) policies of workers  compensation and employers  liability for all employees of Purchaser with a Waiver
of Subrogation in favor of all of the Sellers legal entities with an interest in the Premises, (ii) commercial
general liability insurance which insure Purchaser and Purchaser s Representatives (as hereinafter defined) with liability
insurance limits of not less than $3,000,000 combined single limit per occurrence and in the aggregate for personal injury and
property damage, coverage shall be on a per location/project basis and shall be primary and noncontributory, include all of the
Sellers legal entities as Additional Insured s for both Premises Operations and/or Products and/or Completed Operations,
and (iii) pollution legal liability coverage of not less than $3,000,000 per claim/annual
aggregate for any of Purchaser s environmental consultants). In no event shall Purchaser be permitted to conduct any drilling
or other invasive testing of the Premises without the prior written consent of Seller. Purchaser hereby agrees to repair and restore
any portion of the Premises damaged or otherwise disturbed as a result of any inspection of the Premises by Purchaser and, in
addition, hereby indemnifies and holds harmless Seller and each Seller Exculpated Party from and against any and all damages,
demands, claims, losses, liabilities, costs (including the cost of remediation, if necessary) and expenses (including, without
limitation, reasonable attorneys  fees and disbursements and costs incurred in the enforcement of the foregoing indemnity)
incurred by Seller and any Seller Exculpated Party by reason of or in connection with any entry onto, or inspection of, the Premises
by Purchaser or Purchaser s agents, employees, representatives or contractors in connection therewith (except to the extent
arising from (y) the mere discovery of existing conditions that are not exacerbated by Purchaser or its agents, or (z) the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of Seller or any Seller Exculpated Party), which indemnity shall survive the Closing or earlier
termination of this Agreement. This Agreement is enforceable to the maximum available protection under Georgia State Law. In addition,
the Purchaser shall obtain and provide proof of Business Auto Liability coverage at the same $3,000,000 limit which will include
all of the Seller s entities and affiliates as additional insured s and include a Waiver of Subrogation in favor of
these same entities and include Owned, Non-Owned and Hired Business Auto Liability protection. 

All insurance requirements in this
Agreement are required to be passed on to each and every third party or subcontractor of the Purchaser and must be applicable to
their insurance coverage as well as the Purchaser. 

17.5.          Between
the Effective Date and the Closing Date, Seller will cause the Premises to materially comply with applicable law and cause to be
performed all normal operational repairs required to be made to the Premises in order to maintain the Premises in the condition
of the Premises as of the Effective Date, reasonable wear and tear and natural deterioration and damage by fire or other casualty
or condemnation excepted, provided that the foregoing shall not have the effect of requiring Seller to make any repairs or replacements
of a capital nature to the Premises. 

17.6         Between
the Effective Date and the Closing Date, Seller shall terminate any terminable Contract promptly after receiving written notice
from Purchaser requesting such termination; provided, however, that Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that: (i) all costs and expenses
associated with any such termination shall be paid by Purchaser; (ii) any such termination may be conditioned on the completion
of the Closing; and (iii) any such termination shall be effective only after expiration of any notice or grace period specified
in the provisions of the applicable Contract (which may not occur until after the Closing). 

17.7         Between
the Effective Date and the Closing Date, Seller shall promptly deliver to Purchaser any written notices of alleged material violations
of applicable law with respect to the Premises received by Seller.

on the Effective Date and continuing through the Closing Date, Seller shall deliver to Purchaser the following items with respect
to the Premises on a weekly basis: (i) all tenant correspondence regarding lease renewals; (ii) an updated Rent Roll; and (iii)
reports detailing unit availability, lease expirations, lease renewals and new leases (collectively, the   Weekly

of Leases and Contracts. 

18.1.          Seller
shall continue to lease the Premises in the ordinary course of business, consistent with its past leasing practices, the same
as if this Agreement had not been entered into by the parties; provided, however, that, notwithstanding Seller s past practices
or anything else in this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall Seller (x) enter into any new Lease or amend or otherwise
modify any Existing Lease to provide for (i) rents on less than fair market rates, (ii) rent concessions, abatements or other
tenant inducements, other than one-time inducements which are paid for up-front by Seller, at Seller s sole cost and expense,
or (iii) a term of less than six (6) months or more than fifteen (15) months without, in each instance, first obtaining Purchaser s
prior written approval of same, which approval Purchaser may withhold in its reasonable discretion. 

18.2.          Seller
shall not enter into, materially modify or terminate any additional service or equipment leasing contracts or other similar agreements
relating to the Premises or materially modify or terminate any of the Contracts without Purchaser s written consent, which
approval Purchaser may withhold in its reasonable discretion; provided, however, that Seller shall not be required to obtain Purchaser s
consent to any contracts entered into after the Effective Date in response to an emergency situation at the Premises (including,
for example, any condemnation or casualty affecting the Premises). If Purchaser fails to notify Seller in writing of Purchaser s
objections within five (5) Business Days of Purchaser s receipt of the proposed modification, termination or new contract
terms requiring Purchaser s approval hereunder (and a request for Purchaser s approval), then Purchaser shall be deemed
to have approved the same.

but not required, to provide that the losing party in any arbitration will pay all or a portion of the prevailing party s
costs incurred in connection therewith, including, without limitation, the costs and fees of the arbitrators,  provided ,
 however , if the arbitrators decline to make such a provision, then the costs of the arbitration will be split equally between

Prevailing Party the amount determined by the arbitrators to be necessary to make the Prevailing Party whole (the   Arbitrated

(and such Funds Escrow is established) by the Non-Prevailing Party with respect to a monetary Matter in Dispute and the amount
in the Funds Escrow is greater than the Arbitrated Amount, then the Non-Prevailing Party shall, within such ten (10) day period,
instruct the escrow agent for the Funds Escrow to disburse an amount equal to the Arbitrated Amount from the Funds Escrow to the
Prevailing Party and, unless otherwise provided in this Agreement, the Non-Prevailing Party shall be entitled to a return of the
remaining funds in the Funds Escrow. In the event that the arbitrators make a determination in favor of the Prevailing Party and
the Matter in Dispute is non-monetary in nature, then the Non-Prevailing Party shall take such action as is required by the arbitrators
in connection therewith within ten (10) days after the determination is made in such arbitration proceeding. 

38.3.          The
parties agree that the arbitration proceeding described in this  Section 38  is the sole and exclusive manner in which the
parties may resolve Matters in Dispute and the parties fully waive any right to commence any action or proceeding in any court
arising out of any Matter in Dispute, subject only to the right of a party hereto to bring an action in court to enforce the determination
made in an arbitration proceeding. For the avoidance of doubt the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that any dispute arising
out of this Agreement that is not a Matter in Dispute shall not be required to be submitted to arbitration as hereinabove provided.

amount remains unpaid at a rate per annum equal to the sum of (x) one percent (1%) and (y) the rate per annum equal to the cost

of, or any change in, or change in the interpretation of, any law, regulation or treaty, that party shall give notice to that effect

that other party to modify this Agreement or change the method of payment hereunder so that the payment will not be unlawful. If
an assignment or agreement is not made as provided herein on or before the tenth Business Day after that notice becomes effective,
either party may give notice of termination as provided in Section 11. 

Section 6. Taxes . 

(a)          Except

that withholding; 

(ii)         make
timely payment of the amount withheld to the appropriate governmental authority; 

(iii)        forthwith
pay the other party such additional amount as may be necessary to ensure that the net amount actually received by it free and clear
of Taxes (including any Taxes on the additional amount) is equal to the amount that it would have received had no Taxes been withheld;
and 

(iv)        on
or before the thirtieth day after payment, send the payee the original or a certified copy of an official tax receipt evidencing
that payment; provided, however, that if the representation and warranty made by a party in Section 7(d) proves not to have
been true when made or, if repeated on each Payment Date, would not then be true, or if a party fails to perform or observe any
of its covenants set forth in Section 7 or Section 8, the other party shall be under no obligation to pay any additional
amount hereunder to the extent that the withholding would not have been required if the representation and warranty had been true
when made, or would have been true if so repeated, or if the failure had not occurred. 

(b)          If
a party would be required to make any withholding for or on account of Taxes and pay any additional amount as provided in Section 6(a)
with respect to any payment to be made by it in accordance with Section 2, it shall give notice to that effect to the other
party and shall use reasonable efforts 

(i)          to
assign or transfer its rights and obligations under this Agreement, subject to Section 15, to another of its branches, offices
or affiliates, or to any leading participant in the interest rate cap market, that may make the payments to be made by it hereunder
lawfully and without withholding for or on account of Taxes; or 

(ii)         to
agree with that other party to modify this Agreement or change the method of payment hereunder so that those payments will not
be subject to the withholding. If an assignment or agreement is not made as provided herein on or before the tenth day after that
notice becomes effective, the party that would be required to make the withholding may give notice of termination as provided in
Section 11. 

(c)          In
addition, each party agrees with the other that it will deliver to the other party any forms, documents or certificates relating

(vii)       The

or substantially all its assets to, another entity, and the creditworthiness of the resulting, surviving or transferee entity after
such consolidation, amalgamation, merger or transfer of assets is materially weaker than that of the Seller or such Credit Support
Provider (as the case may be) immediately prior to such action as determined by the Buyer or Freddie Mac; or 

(viii)      If
at any time the long term unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness or deposits (the   Long Term Senior Debt  
of the Credit Support Provider of the Seller are rated below A+ by S P (or such rating is suspended or withdrawn) or below
A1 by Moody s (or such rating is suspended or withdrawn), and Seller fails to post collateral to Buyer or assign Seller s
interest in this Agreement pursuant to Section 10(a) hereof. 

(ix)         At
the option of the Buyer if at any time the Long Term Senior Debt of the Credit Support Provider of the Seller are rated below A-
by S P (or such rating is suspended or withdrawn) or below A3 by Moody s (or such rating is suspended or withdrawn); 

(x)          The
Seller shall fail to comply with the provisions of Section 10(a) hereof. 

(b)          Seller
shall notify Buyer upon the occurrence of a Termination Event identified in Sections 9(a)(iii), (v) or (vi) hereof. 

Section 10. Collateralization
or Seller Replacement Event . (a) In the event that the Long Term Senior Debt of the Credit Support Provider for the Seller
shall be below A1 by Moody s or A+ by S P, (such event being referred to herein as a  Credit Event ), within
five Local Business Days of such Credit Event either (1) Seller s obligations hereunder shall be collateralized on the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in the Collateral Trust Agreement dated as of May 8, 2014 between
the Seller and U.S. Bank National Association ( USB ), as supplemented from time to time, and incorporated by reference
herein (the  Collateral Trust Agreement ), a copy of which is attached as Exhibit C hereto, or (2) at Seller s
sole cost and expense, Seller shall obtain a replacement counterparty who shall enter into an Agreement with Buyer on substantially
the same terms as contained in this Agreement. Until such replacement counterparty is in place, Seller shall continue to perform
its obligations under this Agreement. Such replacement counterparty must be approved by Freddie Mac and acceptable to Buyer in
its sole discretion. Seller s failure to comply with this provision will constitute a Termination Event for purposes of this
Agreement. 

Upon the occurrence of a Credit Event,
and upon each subsequent change to the Long Term Senior Debt of the Credit Support Provider for the Seller, the Seller shall give
notice to that effect to the Buyer, but failure to provide such notice shall not result in a Termination Event if Seller shall
otherwise have provided Buyer collateral or obtained a replacement counterparty on the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement and in the Collateral Trust Agreement. 

(b) The amount
of Collateral posted pursuant to section 10(a)(1) above will be calculated as a mid-market estimate of the value of this Agreement
as of the date of the Credit Event and the collateral will be posted to USB. 

The parties acknowledge that the calculation
of the mid-market value used to determine the amount of collateral posted pursuant to the Collateral Trust Agreement may result
in a value different than the Damages payable in connection with an early termination of this Agreement as calculated in Section
12(b) hereof. The cost to replace this Agreement with a new interest rate cap provider would be determined by a variety of factors,
such as the then-current market conditions, and documentation requirements and credit rating requirements of the replacement transaction. 

Section 11.  Early
Termination . 

(a)          At
any time while a Termination Event is continuing, the Buyer may, with the prior written consent of Freddie Mac, or Freddie Mac
may, in its absolute discretion, give notice of termination in accordance with this Section. If a party gives notice of supervening
illegality, either party may give notice of termination in accordance with this Section in the circumstances described in Section 5.
If a party is required to pay any additional amount pursuant to Section 6, it may give notice of termination in accordance
with this Section in the circumstances described in Section 6. 

(b)          Any
notice of termination hereunder 

(i)          shall
state the grounds for termination; 

(ii)         shall
specify a date that is not before, nor more than 10 days after, the date the notice of early termination is given on which
the payments required by Section 1 shall be made as provided therein (the  Early Termination Date ); and 

(iii)        shall
declare the obligations of the Seller to make the payments required by Section 2 that are scheduled to be made after the Early
Termination Date to be terminated as of that date, and those obligations shall so terminate and be replaced by the parties 
obligations to make the payments specified in Section 12. 

Section 12. Payments
Upon Early Termination . 

(a)          If
notice of termination is given pursuant to Section 11, the Seller shall pay the Buyer an amount in Dollars determined pursuant
to this Section 12 (the  Damages ). 

(b)          The
Buyer s Damages in the event of early termination shall be the Market Quotation, if it can be determined and the Unpaid Amounts
owing to the Buyer in respect of this Agreement. If it cannot be determined, the Buyer s Damages shall be an amount in Dollars
equal to the sum of the losses (including loss of bargain) a determined by the Buyer that it may incur as a result of the early
termination or as a result of the event that served as the ground for early termination. 

(c)          Payments
to be made in accordance with this Section shall be made on the Early Termination Date. If the Buyer is entitled to be paid any
amount in respect of its Damages in accordance with this Section, it shall submit to the Seller a statement in reasonable detail
of those Damages. 

Section 13. Market
Quotation . 

(a)          For
the purpose of determining the Market Quotation, the Buyer shall select, with the consent of Freddie Mac, four leading participants
in the interest rate cap market (each a  Reference Market-maker ), in its sole discretion and in good faith, with a
view to minimizing the Market Quotation (to the extent required by law); provided, however, that in doing so the Buyer shall be
entitled to select market participants that are of the highest credit standing and that otherwise satisfy all the criteria that
the Buyer applies generally at the time in deciding whether to enter into an interest rate protection transaction. 

(b)          The
Buyer shall request from each of the Reference Market-makers it has selected a quotation of the amount in Dollars which that Reference
Market-maker would charge on the Early Termination Date as an up-front payment for entering into an agreement, effective on the
Early Termination Date, pursuant to which it would be obligated to make all the payments scheduled to be made by the Seller under
this Agreement after the Early Termination Date. 

(c)          The
Market Quotation shall be the arithmetic mean (rounded up, if necessary, to the nearest cent) of the amounts described in Section 12(b)
that are quoted to the Buyer by the Reference Market-makers it has selected or, if only one Reference Market-maker will quote such
a fee, the Market Quotation Value shall be the amount quoted by that Reference Market-maker. If no quotations are provided, it
will be deemed that the Market Quotation in respect of the Agreement cannot be determined. 

Section 14. Costs
and Expenses . 

(a)          Each
of the parties shall pay, or reimburse the other on demand for, all stamp, registration, documentation or similar taxes or duties,
and any penalties or interest that may be due with respect thereto, that may be imposed by any jurisdiction in respect of its execution
or delivery of this Agreement. If any such tax or duty is imposed by any jurisdiction as the result of the conduct or status of
both parties, each party shall pay one half of the amount of the tax or duty. 

(b)          The
Seller shall pay, or reimburse the Buyer on demand for, all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the Buyer in connection with
enforcement of its rights under this Agreement or as a consequence of a Termination Event, including, without limitation, fees
and expenses of legal counsel. 

Section 15. Nonassignment .
Neither party shall assign or otherwise transfer its rights or obligations hereunder or any interest herein to any other Person
or any of its other branches or offices without the prior written consent of the other party to this Agreement and Freddie Mac,
unless the assignment or transfer by the Seller is pursuant to Section 5 or Section 6 and provided that: 

(a)          the
Seller gives the Buyer 10 Business Days  prior written notice of the assignment or transfer; 

(b)          the
assignee or transferee meets the criteria set forth in Section 5(a) or Section 6(b)(i), as the case may be; 

(c)          the
credit policies of the Buyer or Freddie Mac at the time would permit the Buyer to purchase an interest rate cap from the assignee
or transferee without credit support; 

(d)          a
Termination Event does not occur as a result of such transfer; 

(e)          on
or prior to the effective date of the transfer, this Agreement (including, without limitation, any Tax covenants (if any) in Exhibit B
to this Agreement) and all other related documents shall have been amended to reflect the transfer in a manner reasonably satisfactory
to Buyer; and 

(f)          on
or prior to the effective date of the transfer, Seller shall have agreed in writing to indemnify and hold harmless Buyer in a manner
reasonably satisfactory to Buyer from and against any adverse tax consequences and any related fees, expenses and other losses
resulting from the transfer, subject to the following conditions: (i) notwithstanding Seller s duty to indemnify Buyer,
Buyer shall at all times retain sole control and decision-making authority with regard to any tax issues affecting Buyer or related
litigation arising from or in connection with said transfer; and (ii) such indemnification shall be made as such expenses
are incurred by Buyer and at such time as Buyer is required to pay any such tax liability, provided that Seller shall not be required
to make such indemnification until five Business Days after it has received written notice from Buyer of expenses or liabilities
for which Buyer seeks reimbursement. 

Any purported
transfer in violation of this Section shall be void. The parties are acting for purposes of this Agreement through their respective
branches or offices specified in Exhibit A. 

The Seller
shall not unreasonably withhold its consent to an assignment or transfer proposed by the Buyer, or by any subsequent assignee or
transferee of the Buyer, if the Seller would be entitled to make the payments it is required to make pursuant to Section 2 to the
proposed assignee or transferee lawfully and without withholding for or on account of Taxes and the proposed assignee or transferee
assumes the obligations of the Buyer under the Tax covenants (if any) of the Buyer in Exhibit B to this Agreement to the satisfaction
of the Seller and if the proposed assignee or transferee provides all information (if any) necessary for Seller to comply with
any applicable money laundering  know your customer  or government regulations, including but not limited to regulations
under the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. 

Notwithstanding
the provisions of this Section 15 to the contrary, the Seller consents to the Buyer s grant of a security interest herein
to Freddie Mac, its successors and a Permitted Assign. The Buyer and Seller agree that Freddie Mac may exercise the rights of the
Buyer hereunder from time to time, and Buyer agrees that the Seller (i) may rely conclusively on the written instructions
of Freddie Mac or a Permitted Assign to Seller made pursuant to this Agreement, (ii) has no duty to investigate or verify
such written instructions, and (iii) shall not be liable for any actions taken in accordance with such written instructions
except actions involving Seller s own gross negligence or willful misconduct.  Permitted Assign  means any national
banking association organized under the laws of the United States or Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas which serves as trustee
( Trustee ) of a Freddie Mac-sponsored securitization trust and its successors and assigns. No assignment of a security
interest in this Agreement shall be effective with respect to the Seller until delivery to the Seller of a written notice of such
assignment ( Assignment Notice ) in the form of Exhibit E hereto, in connection with an assignment by Freddie Mac to
the Trustee, and Exhibit F hereto with respect to an assignment by the Trustee, executed by the Trustee, as assignor, and by the
assignee. The Assignment Notice identified in Exhibit F must be accompanied by a certificate of authority and incumbency satisfactory
to the Seller delivered by each of the assignor and assignee. No assignment by the Trustee shall be effective with respect to the
Seller unless the Seller determines under the then-current regulations and policies of the Seller that the assignee qualifies as
a counterparty to the Seller. Buyer hereby consents to the assignment of Freddie Mac s security interest in this Agreement
to any Permitted Assign. Buyer and Seller agree that, following receipt of an Assignment Notice by Seller, the assignee, or its
designated servicer, shall be entitled to exercise all rights of Freddie Mac set forth herein. Accordingly, all payments hereunder
shall be made in accordance with Section 3 hereof and to the account of the Servicer as specified in Exhibit A hereto unless instructed
otherwise by Freddie Mac or a Permitted Assign, as applicable. 

Seller shall
be held harmless and shall be fully indemnified by the Buyer, from and against any and all claims, other than those arising out
of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Seller, from and against any damages, penalties, judgments, liabilities, losses
or expenses (including attorney s fees and disbursements) reasonably incurred by the Seller as a result of the assertion
of any claim, by any person or entity, arising out of, or otherwise related to, any action taken or omitted to be taken by the
Seller in reliance upon the Assignment Notice, the assignment of the security interest in the Rate Cap Agreement to Freddie Mac,
or any instructions or notice provided by Freddie Mac, a Permitted Assign or its servicer, or the Buyer. 

All notices
delivered to Seller pursuant to this Section 15 shall also be delivered to USB at the address set forth in the Collateral Trust
Agreement. 

Section 16. Waivers:
Rights Not Exclusive . No failure or delay by a party in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver of, or impair,
any such right. No single or partial exercise of any such right shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise
of any other right. No waiver of any such right shall be effective unless given in writing. No waiver of any such right shall be
deemed a waiver of any other right hereunder. The right to terminate provided for herein is in addition to, and not exclusive of,
any other rights, powers, privileges or remedies provided by law.
