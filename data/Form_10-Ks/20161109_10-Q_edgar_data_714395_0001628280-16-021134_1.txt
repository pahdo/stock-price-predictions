  NOTE 3 - Securities (continued) 

Proceeds from the Sales of Securities are summarized below:   

The carrying value of securities pledged to secure repurchase agreements, public and trust deposits, and for other purposes as required by law was   $202,808   and   $154,628   as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 
    
  Below is a summary of securities with unrealized losses as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, presented by length of time the securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position: 

Securities are written down to fair value when a decline in fair value is not considered temporary. In estimating other-than-temporary losses, management considers many factors, including: (1) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, (2) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, (3) whether the market decline was affected by macroeconomic conditions, and (4) whether the Company has the intent to sell the debt security or more likely than not will be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery.  The Company does not intend to sell or expect to be required to sell these securities, and the decline in fair value is largely due to changes in market interest rates.  Therefore, the Company does not consider these securities to be other-than-temporarily impaired. All mortgage-backed securities in the Company s portfolio are guaranteed by government sponsored entities, are investment grade, and are performing as expected.

NOTE 4   Derivatives 
    
  The Company executes interest rate swaps with commercial banking customers to facilitate their respective risk management strategies. The notional amounts of these interest rate swaps and the offsetting counterparty derivative instruments were   $68.3 million   at September 30, 2016 and   $36.8 million   at December 31, 2015. These interest rate swaps are simultaneously hedged by offsetting interest rate swaps that the Company executes with a third party, such that the Company minimizes its net risk exposure resulting from such transactions with independent counterparties with substantially matching terms. The agreements are considered stand alone derivatives and changes in the fair value of derivatives are reported in earnings as non-interest income.   
    
  Credit risk arises from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts. The Company s exposure is limited to the replacement value of the contracts rather than the notional, principal or contract amounts. There are provisions in the agreements with the counterparties that allow for certain unsecured credit exposure up to an agreed threshold. Exposures in excess of the agreed thresholds are collateralized. In addition, the Company minimizes credit risk through credit approvals, limits, and monitoring procedures. 
    
  The following table reflects the fair value hedges included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of:

NOTE 5   Loans 
    
  Loans were comprised of the following classifications at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:  

As further described in Note 12, during 2016 the Company acquired loans with a fair value of   $317,760   as a part of a business combination.  This was made up of loans with an acquired balance of   $328,431  , net of   $10,671   of fair value discounts at date of acquisition.  At September 30, 2016, the remaining carrying amount of such loans total   $280,027  , which is included in the September 30, 2016 table above.  This amount is made up of loans with a remaining balance of   $288,559   net of remaining fair value discounts of   $8,532  . 
    
  The following tables present the activity in the allowance for loan losses by portfolio class for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:

  NOTE 5 - Loans (continued) 

The following tables present the activity in the allowance for loan losses by portfolio class for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

In determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan loss, general allocations are made for  pools of loans, including non-classified loans, homogeneous portfolios of consumer and residential real estate loans, and loans within certain industry categories believed to present unique risk of loss. General allocations of the allowance are primarily made based on historical averages for loan losses for these portfolios, judgmentally adjusted for current economic factors and portfolio trends.  During 2016, the overall allowance for loan and lease losses was increased in the agricultural sector as a result of qualitative considerations for current economic conditions and trends which included a decline in the aggregate debt service coverage ratios for agricultural borrowers and a decline in per acre values of crop production real estate. 
    
  Loan impairment is reported when full repayment under the terms of the loan is not expected. This methodology is used for all loans, including loans acquired with deteriorated credit quality if such loans perform worse than what was expected at the time of acquisition. For purchased loans, the assessment is made at the time of acquisition as well as over the life of loan. If a loan is impaired, a portion of the allowance is allocated so that the loan is reported net, at the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan s existing rate, or at the fair value of collateral if repayment is expected solely from the collateral. Commercial and industrial loans, commercial real estate loans, and agricultural loans are evaluated individually for impairment. Smaller balance homogeneous loans are evaluated for impairment in total. Such loans include real estate loans secured by one-to-four family residences and loans to individuals for household, family and other personal expenditures. Individually evaluated loans on non-accrual are generally considered impaired. Impaired loans, or portions thereof, are charged off when deemed uncollectible. 
    
  Specific allocations on impaired loans are determined by comparing the loan balance to the present value of expected cash flows or expected collateral proceeds. Allocations are also applied to categories of loans not considered individually impaired but for which the rate of loss is expected to be greater than historical averages, including non-performing consumer or residential real estate loans. Such allocations are based on past loss experience and information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values.  The allowance for commercial real estate loans declined during 2016 primarily as a result of the repayment of a single non-accrual commercial real estate credit during the third quarter of 2016.  This credit relationship was considered impaired and therefore had a specific allocation assigned prior to repayment.

The following tables present loans individually evaluated for impairment by class of loans for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

All classes of loans, including loans acquired with deteriorated credit quality, are generally placed on non-accrual status when scheduled principal or interest payments are past due for 90 days or more or when the borrower s ability to repay becomes doubtful. For purchased loans, the determination is made at the time of acquisition as well as over the life of the loan. Uncollected accrued interest for each class of loans is reversed against income at the time a loan is placed on non-accrual. Interest received on such loans is accounted for on the cash-basis or cost-recovery method, until qualifying for return to accrual. All classes of loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments

are reasonably assured. Loans are typically charged-off at 180 days past due, or earlier if deemed uncollectible. Exceptions to the non-accrual and charge-off policies are made when the loan is well secured and in the process of collection.

  NOTE 5 - Loans (continued) 

Troubled Debt Restructurings: 
    
  In certain instances, the Company may choose to restructure the contractual terms of loans. A troubled debt restructuring occurs when the Bank grants a concession to the borrower that it would not otherwise consider due to a borrower s financial difficulty.   In order to determine whether a borrower is experiencing financial difficulty, an evaluation is performed of the probability that the borrower will be in payment default on any of its debt in the foreseeable future without modification. This evaluation is performed under the Company s internal underwriting policy. The Company uses the same methodology for loans acquired with deteriorated credit quality as for all other loans when determining whether the loan is a troubled debt restructuring. 
    
  During the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, there were   no   loans modified as troubled debt restructurings.  
    
  The following tables present the recorded investment of troubled debt restructurings by class of loans as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

(1)   The non-accrual troubled debt restructurings are included in the Non-Accrual Loan table presented on a previous page. 
    
  The Company had not committed to lending any additional amounts as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 to customers with outstanding loans that are classified as troubled debt restructurings. 
    
  For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, there were   no   loans modified as troubled debt restructurings for which there was a payment default within twelve months following the modification.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, there were   no   loans modified as troubled debt restructurings for which there was a payment default within the twelve months following the modification.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, there was   one   troubled debt restructuring with a recorded investment of   $95   for which there was a payment default within twelve months following the modification.  The troubled debt restructuring that subsequently defaulted resulted in   no   change to the allowance for loan losses and a charge-off of   $95   during the nine months ending September 30, 2015.  A loan is considered to be in payment default once it is 30 days contractually past due under the modified terms. 
    
  Credit Quality Indicators: 
    
  The Company categorizes loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as: current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other factors. The Company classifies loans as to credit risk by individually analyzing loans. This analysis includes commercial and industrial loans, commercial real estate loans, and agricultural loans with an outstanding balance greater than $100. This analysis is typically performed on at least an annual basis. The Company uses the following definitions for risk ratings: 
    
  Special Mention. Loans classified as special mention have a potential weakness that deserves management s close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or of the institution s credit position at some future date. 
    
  Substandard. Loans classified as substandard are inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans so classified have a well-defined weakness or weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation

of the debt. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. 
    
  Doubtful. Loans classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard, with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. 
    
  Loans not meeting the criteria above that are analyzed individually as part of the above described process are considered to be pass rated loans. Based on the most recent analysis performed, the risk category of loans by class of loans is as follows: 

The Company considers the performance of the loan portfolio and its impact on the allowance for loan losses. For home equity, consumer and residential mortgage loan classes, the Company also evaluates credit quality based on the aging status of the loan, which was previously presented, and by payment activity.  The following table presents the recorded investment in home equity, consumer and residential mortgage loans based on payment activity as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:

  NOTE 5 - Loans (continued) 

Contractually required payments receivable of loans purchased with evidence of credit deterioration during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 are included in the table below.  The value of the purchased loans included in the table are as of acquisition date.  There were no such loans purchased during the year ended December 31, 2015.   

The carrying amount of consumer mortgage loans secured by residential real estate properties for which formal foreclosure proceedings are in process according to local requirements of the applicable jurisdiction totaled   $315   as of September 30, 2016 and   $169   as of December 31, 2015. 

NOTE 6   Repurchase Agreements Accounted for as Secured Borrowings 
    
  Repurchase agreements are short-term borrowings included in FHLB Advances and Other Borrowings and mature overnight and continuously.  Repurchase agreements, which were secured by mortgage-backed securities, totaled $  39,462   and   $18,417   as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  Risk could arise when the collateral pledged to a repurchase agreement declines in fair value.  The Company minimizes risk by consistently monitoring the value of the collateral pledged.  At the point in time where the collateral has declined in fair value, the Company is required to provide additional collateral based on the value of the underlying securities. 

NOTE 7   Segment Information 
    
  The Company s operations include   three   primary segments: core banking, trust and investment advisory services, and insurance operations. The core banking segment involves attracting deposits from the general public and using such funds to originate consumer, commercial and agricultural, commercial and agricultural real estate, and residential mortgage loans, primarily in the Company s local markets. The core banking segment also involves the sale of residential mortgage loans in the secondary market. The trust and investment advisory services segment involves providing trust, investment advisory, and brokerage services to customers. The insurance segment offers a full range of personal and corporate property and casualty insurance products, primarily in the Company s banking subsidiary s local markets. 
    
  The core banking segment is comprised by the Company s banking subsidiary, German American Bancorp, which operated through   52   banking offices at September 30, 2016. Net interest income from loans and investments funded by deposits and borrowings is the primary revenue for the core-banking segment. The trust and investment advisory services segment s revenues are comprised primarily of fees generated by the trust operations of the Company's banking subsidiary and by German American Investment Services, Inc.  These fees are derived by providing trust, investment advisory, and brokerage services to its customers. The insurance segment primarily consists of German American Insurance, Inc., which provides a full line of personal and corporate insurance products. Commissions derived from the sale of insurance products are the primary source of revenue for the insurance segment. 
    
  The following segment financial information has been derived from the internal financial statements of the Company which are used by management to monitor and manage financial performance. The accounting policies of the   three   segments are the same as those of the Company. The evaluation process for segments does not include holding company income and expense. Holding company amounts are the primary differences between segment amounts and consolidated totals, and are reflected in the column labeled  Other  below, along with amounts to eliminate transactions between segments.

NOTE 9   Equity Plans and Equity Based Compensation 
    
  The Company maintains   three   equity incentive plans under which stock options, restricted stock, and other equity incentive awards can be granted. At September 30, 2016, the Company has reserved   314,393   shares of common stock (as adjusted for subsequent stock dividends and subject to further customary anti-dilution adjustments) for the purpose of issuance pursuant to outstanding and future grants of options, restricted stock, and other equity awards to officers, directors and other employees of the Company.  
    
  For the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company granted   no   options.  The Company recorded   no   stock compensation expense applicable to options during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 because all outstanding options were fully vested prior to 2007. In addition, there was   no   unrecognized option expense.  
    
  During the periods presented, awards of long-term incentives were granted in the form of restricted stock.  Awards that were granted to management under a management incentive plan were granted in tandem with cash credit entitlements (typically in the form of   60%   restricted stock grants and   40%   cash credit entitlements).  The management and employee restricted stock grants and tandem cash credit entitlements awarded will vest in   three   equal installments of   33.3%   with the first annual vesting on December 5th of the year of the grant and on December 5th of the next   two   succeeding years.  Awards that were granted to directors as additional retainer for their services do not include any cash credit entitlement. These director restricted stock grants are subject to forfeiture in the event that the recipient of the grant does not continue in service as a director of the Company through December 5th of the year after grant or does not satisfy certain meeting attendance requirements, at which time they generally vest   100 percent  . For measuring compensation costs, restricted stock awards are valued based upon the market value of the common shares on the date of grant.  During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company granted awards of   180    and   102   shares of restricted stock, respectively.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company granted awards of   32,430    and   33,480   shares of restricted stock, respectively.  Total unvested restricted stock awards at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were   66,943   and   34,513  , respectively. 
    
  The following table presents expense recorded for restricted stock and cash entitlements as well as the related tax information for the periods presented: 

Unrecognized expense associated with the restricted stock grants and cash entitlements totaled   $1,257   and   $1,808   as of September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
    
  The Company maintains an Employee Stock Purchase Plan whereby eligible employees have the option to purchase the Company s common stock at a discount. The purchase price of the shares under this Plan has been set at   95%   of the fair market value of the Company s common stock as of the last day of the plan year. The plan provided for the purchase of up to   500,000   shares of common stock, which the Company may obtain by purchases on the open market or from private sources, or by issuing authorized but unissued common shares. Funding for the purchase of common stock is from employee and Company contributions.

  NOTE 9 - Equity Plans and Equity Based Compensation (continued) 

The Employee Stock Purchase Plan is not considered compensatory.  There was   $82   expense recorded for the employee stock purchase plan during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016.  There was   $22   expense recorded for the employee stock purchase plan during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015.  There was   no   unrecognized compensation expense as of September 30, 2016 and 2015 for the Employee Stock Purchase Plan. 

NOTE 10   Fair Value 
    
  Fair value is the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. There are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair values: 
    
  Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the entity has the ability to access as of the measurement date. 
    
  Level 2: Significant other observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. 
    
  Level 3: Significant unobservable inputs that reflect a reporting entity s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. 
    
  The Company used the following methods and significant assumptions to estimate the fair value of each type of financial instrument: 
    
  Investment Securities:   The fair values for investment securities are determined by quoted market prices, if available (Level 1). For securities where quoted prices are not available, fair values are calculated based on market prices of similar securities (Level 2). For securities where quoted prices or market prices of similar securities are not available, fair values are calculated using discounted cash flows or other market indicators (Level 3). Level 3 pricing is obtained from a third-party based upon similar trades that are not traded frequently without adjustment by the Company. At September 30, 2016, the Company held   $8.0 million   in Level 3 securities which consist of   $7.7 million   of non-rated Obligations of State and Political Subdivisions and   $353 thousand   of equity securities that are not actively traded. Absent the credit rating, significant assumptions must be made such that the credit risk input becomes an unobservable input and thus these securities are reported by the Company in a Level 3 classification. 
    
  Derivatives:   The fair values of derivatives are based on valuation models using observable market data as of the measurement date (Level 2). 
    
  Impaired Loans:   Fair values for impaired collateral dependent loans are generally based on appraisals obtained from licensed real estate appraisers and in certain circumstances consideration of offers obtained to purchase properties prior to foreclosure. Appraisals for commercial real estate generally use three methods to derive value: cost, sales or market comparison and income approach. The cost method bases value in the cost to replace the current property. Value of market comparison approach evaluates the sales price of similar properties in the same market area. The income approach considers net operating income generated by the property and an investor's required return. Adjustments are routinely made in the appraisal process by the independent appraisers to adjust for differences between the comparable sales and income data available. Comparable sales adjustments are based on known sales prices of similar type and similar use properties and duration of time that the property has been on the market to sell. Such adjustments made in the appraisal process are typically significant and result in a Level 3 classification of the inputs for determining fair value. 
    
  Appraisals for both collateral-dependent impaired loans and other real estate owned are performed by certified general appraisers (for commercial properties) or certified residential appraisers (for residential properties) whose qualifications and licenses have been reviewed and verified by the Company. Once received, a member of the Company s Risk Management Area reviews the assumptions and approaches utilized in the appraisal. In determining the value of impaired collateral dependent loans and other real estate owned, significant unobservable inputs may be used which include: physical condition of comparable properties sold, net operating income generated by the property and investor rates of return.

  NOTE 10 - Fair Value (continued) 

Other Real Estate:   Nonrecurring adjustments to certain commercial and residential real estate properties classified as other real estate (ORE) are measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value, less costs to sell. Fair values are generally based on third party appraisals of the property utilizing similar techniques as discussed above for Impaired Loans, resulting in a Level 3 classification. In cases where the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, less costs to sell, impairment loss is recognized. 
    
  Loans Held-for-Sale:   The fair values of loans held for sale are determined by using quoted prices for similar assets, adjusted for specific attributes of that loan resulting in a Level 2 classification. 
    
  Assets and Liabilities Measured on a Recurring Basis 
    
  Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, including financial assets and liabilities for which the Company has elected the fair value option, are summarized below:

  NOTE 10 - Fair Value (continued) 

The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of the Company s financial instruments not previously presented are provided in the tables below for the periods ending September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. Not all of the Company s assets and liabilities are considered financial instruments, and therefore are not included in the tables. Because no active market exists for a significant portion of the Company s financial instruments, fair value estimates were based on subjective judgments, and therefore cannot be determined with precision. 

Cash and Short-term Investments: 
  The carrying amount of cash and short-term investments approximate fair values and are classified as Level 1 or Level 2. 
    
  Securities Held-to-Maturity: 
  The fair values for investment securities are determined by quoted market prices, if available (Level 1). For securities where quoted prices are not available, fair values are calculated based on market prices of similar securities (Level 2). 
    
  FHLB Stock and Other Restricted Stock: 
  It is not practical to determine the fair values of FHLB stock and other restricted stock due to restrictions placed on their transferability.

  NOTE 10 - Fair Value (continued) 

Loans: 
  Fair values of loans, excluding loans held for sale and collateral dependent impaired loans carried at fair value, are estimated as follows: For variable rate loans that reprice frequently and with no significant change in credit risk, fair values are based on carrying values resulting in a Level 3 classification. Fair values for other loans are estimated using discounted cash flow analysis, using interest rates currently being offered for loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit quality resulting in a Level 3 classification. Impaired loans are valued as described previously. The methods utilized to estimate fair value of loans do not necessarily represent an exit price. 
    
  Accrued Interest Receivable: 
  The carrying amount of accrued interest approximates fair value resulting in a Level 2 or Level 3 classification consistent with the asset they are associated with. 
    
  Deposits: 
  The fair values disclosed for demand deposits (e.g., interest and non-interest checking, savings and certain types of money market accounts) are, by definition, equal to the amount payable on demand at the reporting date (i.e., their carrying amount) resulting in a Level 1 classification. Fair values for fixed rate time deposits are estimated using a discounted cash flows calculation that applies interest rates currently being offered on certificates to a schedule of aggregated expected monthly maturities on time deposits resulting in a Level 2 classification.  
    
  Short-term Borrowings: 
  The carrying amounts of federal funds purchased, borrowings under repurchase agreements, and other short-term borrowings, generally maturing within ninety days, approximate their fair values resulting in a Level 2 classification. 
    
  Long-term Debt: 
  The fair values of the Company s long-term borrowings are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses based on the current borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements resulting in a Level 2 classification.  
    
  The fair values of the Company s subordinated debentures are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses based on the current borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements resulting in a Level 3 classification.  
    
  Accrued Interest Payable: 
  The carrying amount of accrued interest approximates fair value resulting in a Level 2 or Level 3 classification consistent with the liability they are associated with.

The acquisition was accomplished by the merger of River Valley into German American Bancorp, Inc., immediately followed by the merger of River Valley Financial Bank into German American Bancorp, Inc.'s bank subsidiary, German American Bancorp.  River Valley Financial Bank operated   14   banking offices in Southeast Indiana and   1   banking office in Northern Kentucky.  River Valley's consolidated assets and equity (unaudited) as of February 29, 2016 totaled   $516.3 million   and   $56.6 million  , respectively.  The Company accounted for the transaction under the acquisition method of accounting which means that the acquired assets and liabilities were recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition.  The fair value estimates included in these financial statements are based on preliminary valuations.  The Company does not expect material variances from these estimates and expects that final valuation estimates will be completed during the year ending December 31, 2016. 
    
  In accordance with ASC 805, the Company has expensed approximately   $4.3 million   of direct acquisition costs and recorded   $33.1 million   of goodwill and   $2.6 million   of intangible assets.  The intangible assets are related to core deposits and are being amortized over   8   years.  For tax purposes, goodwill totaling   $33.1 million   is non-deductible but will be evaluated annually for impairment.  The following table summarizes the fair value of the total consideration transferred as a part of the River Valley acquisition as well as the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the effective date of the transaction. 

Under the terms of the merger agreement, the Company issued approximately   1,942,000   shares of its common stock to the former shareholders of River Valley.  Each River Valley common shareholder of record at the effective time of the merger became entitled to receive   0.770   shares of common stock of the Company for each of their former shares of River Valley common stock.

  NOTE 12 - Business Combination (continued) 

In connection with the closing of the merger, the Company paid to River Valley's shareholders of record at the close of business on February 29, 2016, cash consideration of   $9.90   per River Valley share (an aggregate of   $24,975   to shareholders) and the Company paid approximately   $395   to persons who held options to purchase River Valley common stock (all of which rights were cancelled at the effective time of the merger and were not assumed by the Company). 
    
  This acquisition was consistent with the Company s strategy to build a regional presence in Southern Indiana.  The acquisition offers the Company the opportunity to increase profitability by introducing existing products and services to the acquired customer base as well as add new customers in the expanded region. 
    
  The fair value of net assets acquired includes fair value adjustments to certain receivables that were not considered impaired as of the acquisition date.  The fair value adjustments were determined using discounted cash flows.  However, the Company believes that all contractual cash flows related to these financial instruments will be collected.  As such, these receivables were not considered impaired at the acquisition date and were not subject to the guidance relating to purchased credit impaired loans, which are loans that have shown evidence of credit deterioration since origination.  Receivables acquired that were not subject to these requirements include non-impaired loans and customer receivables with a fair value of   $309.0 million   and unpaid principle of   $316.4 million   on the date of acquisition. 
    
  The following table presents unaudited pro forma information as if the acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2015 after giving effect to certain adjustments.  The unaudited pro forma information for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 includes adjustments for interest income on loans and securities acquired, amortization of intangibles arising from the transaction, interest expense on deposits and borrowings acquired, and the related income tax effects.  The unaudited pro forma financial information is not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred had the transaction been effected on the assumed date. 

The above pro forma financial information includes approximately   $429   of net income and   $3,043   of total revenue related to the operations of River Valley during the third quarter of 2016 and   $3,187   of net income and   $12,561   of total revenue related to the

operations of River Valley for the nine months ended 2016.  The above pro forma financial information related to 2016 excludes non-recurring merger costs that totaled   $189   and   $4,318   on a pre-tax basis for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively.  The above pro forma financial information excludes the River Valley provision for loan loss recognized during the three and nine months ended 2016 and 2015.  Under acquisition accounting treatment, loans are recorded at fair value which includes a credit risk component, and therefore the provision for loan loss recognized during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 was presumed to not be necessary.  

NOTE 13 - Newly Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the "FASB") issued an update (ASU No. 2014-09 Revenue From Contracts With Customers) creating FASB Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.  The guidance in this update affects any entity that either enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into contracts for the transfer of nonfinancial assets unless those contracts are within the scope of other standards (for example, insurance contracts or lease contracts).  The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The guidance provides steps to follow to achieve the core principle. An entity should disclose sufficient information to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The amendments in this update become effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this new accounting standard on the Company's consolidated results of operations and financial condition. 
    
  In January 2016, the FASB issued update ASU No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.  The amendments in this update are as follows:  (1) require equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income; (2) simplify the impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values by requiring a qualitative assessment to identify impairment; (3) eliminate the requirement to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet; (4) require entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes; (5) require an entity to present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk when the entity has elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments; (6) require separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset (that is, securities or loans and receivables) on the balance sheet or the accompanying notes to the financial statements; and (7) clarify that an entity should evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset related to available-for-sale securities in combination with the entity's other deferred tax assets.  These amendments are effective for annual reporting periods and interim periods within those annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this new accounting standard on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued its new lease accounting guidance in ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). Under the new guidance, lessees will be required to recognize the following for all leases, with the exception of short-term leases, at the commencement date: a lease liability, which is a lessee s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis; and a right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee s right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. Under the new guidance, lessor accounting is largely unchanged. The amendments in this update become effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018.    The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this new accounting standard on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In June 2016, the FASB issued new accounting guidance in ASU No. 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (Topic 326).  The main objective of the update is to provide financial statement users with more decision-useful information about the expected credit losses on financial instruments and other commitments to extend credit held by a reporting entity at each reporting date.  To achieve this objective, the amendments in this update replace the incurred loss impairment methodology in current GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to form credit loss estimates.  The amendments in this update become effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this new accounting standard on the Company's consolidated financial statements.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
    
  GERMAN AMERICAN BANCORP, INC. 
  MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF 
  FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
    
  German American Bancorp, Inc., is a NASDAQ-traded (symbol: GABC) financial services holding company based in Jasper, Indiana.  German American Bancorp, Inc., through its banking subsidiary German American Bancorp, operates 52 banking offices in 19 contiguous southern Indiana counties and one northern Kentucky county.  The Company also owns an investment brokerage subsidiary (German American Investment Services, Inc.) and a full line property and casualty insurance agency (German American Insurance, Inc.). 
    
  Throughout this Management s Discussion and Analysis, as elsewhere in this Report, when we use the term  Company,  we will usually be referring to the business and affairs (financial and otherwise) of German American Bancorp, Inc. and its subsidiaries and affiliates as a whole.  Occasionally, we will refer to the term  parent company  or  holding company  when we mean to refer to only German American Bancorp, Inc. 
    
  This section presents an analysis of the consolidated financial condition of the Company as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 and the consolidated results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  This discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and other financial data presented elsewhere herein and with the financial statements and other financial data, as well as the Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

MANAGEMENT OVERVIEW 
    
  This updated discussion should be read in conjunction with the Management Overview that was included in our Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and in the Company's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2016 and June 30, 2016. 
    
  On March 1, 2016, the Company completed its acquisition of River Valley  Bancorp ("River Valley") and its subsidiaries, including River Valley Financial Bank.  This acquisition was consistent with the Company's strategy to build a regional presence in Southern Indiana.  The acquisition offers the Company the opportunity to increase profitability by introducing existing products and services to the acquired customer base as well as add new customers in the expanded region.  The acquisition is discussed in more detail in Note 12 (Business Combination) of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Report. 
    
  Net income for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 totaled $10,185,000, or $0.67 per diluted share, an increase of $2,464,000, or 16% on a per share basis, from the quarter ended September 30, 2015 net income of $7,721,000, or $0.58 per diluted share.  The operating results for the third quarter of 2016 were enhanced by the inclusion of the operations of River Valley. 
    
  On a year-to-date basis, 2016 earnings improved $2,767,000, or 12%, to $25,119,000 as compared to $22,352,000 for the first nine months of 2015.  On a per share basis, net income totaled $1.70 per diluted share during the first nine months of 2016 representing a 1% increase from the $1.69 per diluted share for the first nine months of 2015.  The first nine months of 2016 included seven months of operations of River Valley and was significantly impacted by merger related charges associated with the closing of the River Valley transaction effective March 1, 2016.  The merger related charges totaled approximately $4,318,000, or $2,724,000 on an after-tax basis, which represented approximately $0.18 per share during the first nine months of 2016.  

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES 
    
  The financial condition and results of operations for the Company presented in the Consolidated Financial Statements, accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and selected financial data appearing elsewhere within this Report, are, to a large degree, dependent upon the Company s accounting policies. The selection of and application of these policies involve estimates, judgments, and uncertainties that are subject to change. The critical accounting policies and estimates that the Company has determined to be the most susceptible to change in the near term relate to the determination of the allowance for loan losses, the valuation of securities available for sale and income tax expense. 

38 

Allowance for Loan Losses 
    
  The Company maintains an allowance for loan losses to cover probable incurred credit losses at the balance sheet date. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. Allocations of the allowance may be made for specific loans, but the entire allowance is available for any loan that, in management s judgment, should be charged-off. A provision for loan losses is charged to operations based on management s periodic evaluation of the necessary allowance balance. Evaluations are conducted at least quarterly and more often if deemed necessary. The ultimate recovery of all loans is susceptible to future market factors beyond the Company s control. 
    
  The Company has an established process to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. The determination of the allowance is inherently subjective, as it requires significant estimates, including the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans, estimated losses on other classified loans and pools of homogeneous loans, and consideration of past loan loss experience, the nature and volume of the portfolio, information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values, economic conditions, and other factors, all of which may be susceptible to significant change. The allowance consists of two components of allocations, specific and general. These two components represent the total allowance for loan losses deemed adequate to cover losses inherent in the loan portfolio. 
    
  Commercial and agricultural loans are subject to a standardized grading process administered by an internal loan review function. The need for specific reserves is considered for credits identified as impaired when: (a) the customer s cash flow or net worth appears insufficient to repay the loan; (b) the loan has been criticized in a regulatory examination; (c) the loan is on non-accrual; or (d) other reasons where the ultimate collectability of the loan is in question, or the loan characteristics require special monitoring. Specific allowances are established in cases where management has identified significant conditions or circumstances related to an individual credit that we believe indicates the loan is impaired. 
    
  Specific allocations on impaired loans are determined by comparing the loan balance to the present value of expected cash flows or expected collateral proceeds. Allocations are also applied to categories of loans not considered individually impaired but for which the rate of loss is expected to be greater than historical averages, including non-performing consumer or residential real estate loans. Such allocations are based on past loss experience and information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values. 
    
  General allocations are made for commercial and agricultural loans that are graded as substandard based on migration analysis techniques to determine historical average losses for similar types of loans.  General allocations are also made for other pools of loans, including non-classified loans, homogeneous portfolios of consumer and residential real estate loans, and loans within certain industry categories believed to present unique risk of loss. General allocations of the allowance are primarily made based on historical averages for loan losses for these portfolios, judgmentally adjusted for economic, external and internal factors and portfolio trends.  Economic factors include evaluating changes in international, national, regional and local economic and business conditions that affect the collectability of the loan portfolio.   Internal factors include evaluating changes in lending policies and procedures; changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio; and changes in experience, ability and depth of lending management and staff.   In setting our external and internal factors we also consider the overall level of the allowance for loan losses to total loans; our allowance coverage as compared to similar size bank holding companies; and regulatory requirements. 
    
  Due to the imprecise nature of estimating the allowance for loan losses, the Company s allowance for loan losses includes a minor unallocated component. The unallocated component of the allowance for loan losses incorporates the Company s judgmental determination of inherent losses that may not be fully reflected in other allocations, including factors such as economic uncertainties, lending staff quality, industry trends impacting specific portfolio segments, and broad portfolio quality trends.  Therefore, the ratio of allocated to unallocated components within the total allowance may fluctuate from period to period. 
    
  Securities Valuation 
    
  Securities available-for-sale are carried at fair value, with unrealized holding gains and losses reported separately in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. The Company obtains market values from a third party on a monthly basis in order to adjust the securities to fair value. Equity securities that do not have readily determinable fair values are carried at cost. Additionally, when securities are deemed to be other than temporarily impaired, a charge will be recorded through earnings; therefore, future changes in the fair value of securities could have a significant impact on the Company s operating results. In determining whether a market value decline is other than temporary, management considers the reason for the decline, the extent of the decline, the duration of the decline and whether the Company intends to sell or believes it will be required to sell the securities prior to recovery.  As of September 30, 2016, gross unrealized gains on the securities available-for-sale portfolio totaled approximately $19,432,000 and gross unrealized losses totaled approximately $577,000.   
  
   39 

Income Tax Expense 
    
  Income tax expense involves estimates related to the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets and loss contingencies related to exposure from tax examinations presumed to occur. 
    
  A valuation allowance reduces deferred tax assets to the amount management believes is more likely than not to be realized. In evaluating the realization of deferred tax assets, management considers the likelihood that sufficient taxable income of appropriate character will be generated within carry-back and carry-forward periods, including consideration of available tax planning strategies. Tax-related loss contingencies, including assessments arising from tax examinations and tax strategies, are recorded as liabilities when the likelihood of loss is probable and an amount or range of loss can be reasonably estimated. In considering the likelihood of loss, management considers the nature of the contingency, the progress of any examination or related protest or appeal, the views of legal counsel and other advisors, experience of the Company or other enterprises in similar matters, if any, and management s intended response to any assessment. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
    
  Net Income: 
    
  Net income for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 totaled $10,185,000, or $0.67 per diluted share, an increase of $2,464,000, or 16% on a per share basis, from the quarter ended September 30, 2015 net income of $7,721,000, or $0.58 per diluted share.  The operating results for the third quarter of 2016 were enhanced by the inclusion of the operations of River Valley. 
    
  On a year-to-date basis, 2016 earnings improved $2,767,000, or 12%, to $25,119,000 as compared to $22,352,000 for the first nine months of 2015.  On a per share basis, net income totaled $1.70 per diluted share during the first nine months of 2016 representing a 1% increase from the $1.69 per diluted share for the first nine months of 2015.  The first nine months of 2016 included seven months of operations of River Valley and was significantly impacted by merger related charges associated with the closing of the River Valley transaction effective March 1, 2016.  The merger related charges totaled approximately $4,318,000, or $2,724,000 on an after-tax basis, which represented approximately $0.18 per share during the first nine months of 2016.  
    
  Net Interest Income: 
    
  Net interest income is the Company s single largest source of earnings, and represents the difference between interest and fees realized on earning assets, less interest paid on deposits and borrowed funds.  Several factors contribute to the determination of net interest income and net interest margin, including the volume and mix of earning assets, interest rates, and income taxes.  Many factors affecting net interest income are subject to control by management policies and actions.  Factors beyond the control of management include the general level of credit and deposit demand, Federal Reserve Board monetary policy, and changes in tax laws. 

40 

The following table summarizes net interest income (on a tax-equivalent basis). For tax-equivalent adjustments, an effective tax rate of 35% was used for all periods presented   (1)   . 

(1)   
    Effective tax rates were determined as though interest earned on the Company s investments in municipal bonds and loans was fully taxable. 
               (2)   
    Loans held-for-sale and non-accruing loans have been included in average loans. 
       
  Net interest income increased $5,701,000, or 30% (an increase of $5,972,000 or 30% on a tax-equivalent basis), for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 compared with the same quarter of 2015. The increased level of net interest income during the third quarter of 2016 compared with the third quarter of 2015 was primarily driven by a higher level of earning assets resulting from the acquisition of River Valley and from organic loan growth.   
    
  The net interest margin represents tax-equivalent net interest income expressed as a percentage of average earning assets. The tax equivalent net interest margin was 3.75% for the third quarter of 2016 compared to 3.67% during the third quarter of 2015.  The tax equivalent yield on earning assets totaled 4.07% during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 compared to 3.96% in the same period of 2015, while the cost of funds (expressed as a percentage of average earning assets) totaled 0.32% during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 compared to 0.29% in the same period of 2015. 
    
  The increase in the net interest margin during the third quarter of 2016 was primarily attributable to an increase in the amount of accretion of loan discounts on acquired loans combined with an increased loan yield stemming largely from the addition of the River Valley loan portfolio partially offset by a higher cost of funds.  Accretion of loan discounts on acquired loans contributed approximately 9 basis points to the net interest margin on an annualized basis in the third quarter of 2016 and 4 basis points in the third quarter of 2015.  The increase in accretion in the third quarter of 2016 was largely attributable to the loans acquired in the River Valley transaction. 

41 

The following table summarizes net interest income (on a tax-equivalent basis). For tax-equivalent adjustments, an effective tax rate of 35% was used for all periods presented   (1)   . 

(1)   
    Effective tax rates were determined as though interest earned on the Company s investments in municipal bonds and loans was fully taxable. 
               (2)   
    Loans held-for-sale and non-accruing loans have been included in average loans. 
       
  Net interest income increased $13,901,000, or 25% (an increase of $14,692,000 or 25% on a tax-equivalent basis), for the nine  months ended September 30, 2016 compared with the same period of 2015. The increased level of net interest income during 2016 compared with 2015 was driven primarily by a higher level of earning assets resulting from the acquisition of River Valley and from organic loan growth, which excludes the purchased River Valley loan portfolio. 
    
  The tax equivalent net interest margin was 3.75% for the first nine months of 2016 compared to 3.70% during the same period of 2015.  The tax equivalent yield on earning assets totaled 4.07% during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 3.98% in the same period of 2015, while the cost of funds (expressed as a percentage of average earning assets) totaled 0.32% during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 0.28% in the same period of 2015. 
    
  The increase in the net interest margin during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was primarily attributable to an increase in the amount of accretion of loan discounts on acquired loans combined with an increased loan yield stemming largely from the addition of the River Valley loan portfolio and a securities portfolio mix shift to a higher percentage of total securities in non-taxable securities rather than in taxable securities, partially offset by a higher cost of funds.  Accretion of loan discounts on acquired loans contributed approximately 13 basis points to the net interest margin on an annualized basis in the first nine months of 2016 and 5 basis points in the same period of 2015.  The increase in accretion in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was largely attributable to loans acquired in the River Valley merger transaction.The increase in the cost of funds was largely attributable to the increase in short-term market interest rates that occurred late in the fourth quarter of 2015 and to the addition of the River Valley deposit portfolio. 
  
   42 

Provision for Loan Losses: 
    
  The Company provides for loan losses through regular provisions to the allowance for loan losses.  The provision is affected by net charge-offs on loans and changes in specific and general allocations of the allowance.  During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded no provision for loan losses compared to a negative provision for loan losses of $500,000 in the third quarter of 2015.  The provision for loan losses totaled $1,200,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared with no provision during the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  During the first nine months of 2016, the provision for loan loss represented approximately 9 basis points of average loans on an annualized basis.  The increased level of provision during the first nine months of 2016 was done in accordance with the Company's standard methodology for determining the adequacy of its allowance for loan loss and was largely related to an increased level of allowance for loan loss that has been allocated to the Company's agricultural loan portfolio. 
    
  Net charge-offs totaled $150,000 or 3 basis points on an annualized basis of average loans outstanding during the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared with a net recovery of $12,000 during the same period of 2015.  The Company realized net charge-offs of $484,000 or 3 basis points on an annualized basis of average loans outstanding during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared with net charge-offs of $159,000 or 1 basis point on an annualized basis of average loans outstanding during the same period of 2015. 
    
  The provision for loan losses made during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was made at a level deemed necessary by management to absorb changes in estimated, probable incurred losses in the loan portfolio.  A detailed evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is completed quarterly by management, the results of which are used to determine provision for loan losses.  Management estimates the allowance balance required using past loan loss experience, the nature and volume of the portfolio, information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values, economic conditions, and other factors.   
    
  Non-interest Income: 
    
  During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, non-interest income totaled $8,384,000, an increase of $627,000, or 8%, compared with the third quarter of 2015.  The increase during the third quarter of 2016 was largely attributable to the the acquisition of River Valley and an increase in the level of gains on the sale of securities.  The third quarter of 2016 included a full quarter of River Valley operations while third quarter of 2015 had no operations of River Valley included. 

(1)   n/m = not meaningful 
    
  Other operating income declined $611,000, or 29%, during the third quarter of 2016 compared with the third quarter of 2015.The decline in the third quarter of 2016 compared with the third quarter of 2015 was attributable to the donation of a building and accompanying real estate to an economic development foundation in one of the Company's market areas that resulted in a net gain on the disposition of fixed assets of approximately $1.4 million, partially mitigated by increased swap transaction fees with loan customers.  
    
  The Company realized gains on sales of securities during the third quarter of quarter of 2016 of $458,000 related to the sale of $35.6 million of securities compared with no sales of securities during the third quarter of 2015. 

43 

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, non-interest income totaled $23,656,000, an increase of $2,636,000, or 13%, compared with the first nine months of 2015.  The increase during nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with 2015 was largely the result of the acquisition of River Valley and an increase in the level of gains on the sale of securities.  The nine months ended September 30, 2016 included seven months of River Valley operations while the same period of 2015 had no operations of River Valley included. 

The Company realized gains on sales of securities during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 of $1,426,000 related to the sale of $77.1 million of securities compared with a net gain on the sale of securities of $725,000 in the same period of 2015 related to the sale of $18.3 million of securities. 
    
  Non-interest Expense: 
    
  During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, non-interest expense totaled $18,653,000, an increase of $1,687,000, or 10%, compared with the third quarter of 2015.  The majority of the increase in operating expenses during the third quarter of 2016 compared to the third quarter of 2015 were related to the operating costs of River Valley.  The third quarter of 2016 included a full quarter of River Valley operations while the third quarter of 2015 had no operations of River Valley included. 

Advertising and promotion declined $1,511,000, or 69%, during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 compared with the third quarter of 2015.  The decline in advertising and promotion during the third quarter of 2016 compared with the third quarter of 2015 was related to the recognition of a $1,750,000 contribution expense during the third quarter of 2015 in connection with the donation of a building and accompanying real estate to an economic development foundation in one of the Company's market areas. 
    
  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, non-interest expense totaled $57,232,000, an increase of $11,118,000, or 24%, compared with the first nine months of 2015.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded costs related to the River Valley merger transaction that totaled $4,318,000.  The majority of the remainder of the increase in operating expenses during the first nine months of 2016 compared with the same period of 2015 were related to the operating costs of River Valley.  The nine months ended September 30, 2016 included seven months of River Valley operations while 2015 had no operations of River Valley included. 
  
   44 

Salaries and benefits increased $6,275,000, or 24%, in the first nine months of 2016 compared with same period of 2015.  Included in the increase in 2016 was $1,934,000 of merger costs related to the settlement of various employment and benefit arrangements.  The remainder of the increase was primarily related to a higher number of full-time equivalent employees stemming from the acquisition of River Valley. 
    
  Occupancy, furniture and equipment expense increased $1,180,000, or 23%, in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with the same period of 2015.  This increase was related to the operation of River Valley's 15 branch network during 2016. 
    
  Data processing fees increased $1,999,000, or 77%, in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with the same period of 2015.  Included in the increase in the first half of 2016 was $1,288,000 of merger costs related to the consolidation of various data processing and information systems.  
    
  Professional fees increased $802,000, or 39%, in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with the same period of 2015.  Included in the increase in 2016 was $770,000 of merger related costs. 
    
  Advertising and promotion declined $1,265,000, or 40%, during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The decline in advertising and promotion during 2016 compared with 2015 was related to the recognition of a $1,750,000 contribution expense during 2015 in connection with the donation of a building and accompanying real estate to an economic development foundation in one of the Company's market areas. 
    
  Other operating expenses increased $1,767,000, or 32%, in the first nine months of 2016 compared with same period of 2015.  Included in the increase in 2016 was $284,000 of merger related costs.  The inclusion of River Valley's operations was the primary driver of the remainder of the increase. 
    
  Income Taxes: 
    
  The Company s effective income tax rate was 28.7% and 23.9%, respectively, during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  The Company s effective income tax rate was 28.7% and 27.9%, respectively, during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  The effective tax rate in all periods presented was lower than the blended statutory rate resulting primarily from the Company s tax-exempt investment income on securities, loans and company-owned life insurance, income tax credits generated from affordable housing projects, and income generated by subsidiaries domiciled in a state with no state or local income tax. 

FINANCIAL CONDITION 
    
  Total assets for the Company increased to $2.980 billion at September 30, 2016, representing an increase of $605.8 million compared with December 31, 2015.  This increase was largely attributable to the acquisition of River Valley and its banking subsidiary, River Valley Financial Bank, effective March 1, 2016.  River Valley's total assets as of the effective date of the merger totaled approximately $516.3 million.  
    
  September 30, 2016 total loans increased $438.0 million compared with year-end 2015.  At the time of acquisition, the fair value of loans acquired from from River Valley totaled $317.8 million which contributed significantly to the overall loan portfolio growth.  

45 

Total loans from the Company's existing branch network, excluding the River Valley branch network, grew by approximately $123.9 million, or 11% on an annualized basis,  during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with year-end 2015 total loans.  Included in this 2016 loan growth, excluding River Valley, was an increase of approximately $97.1 million, or 12% on annualized basis, of commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans while agricultural loans increased approximately $11.1 million, or 6% on an annualized basis.  Retail loans which include home equity, consumer and residential loans, excluding River Valley, grew by approximately  $15.7 million, or 7% on an annualized basis, during the first nine months of 2016. 

The following table indicates the breakdown of the allowance for loan losses for the periods indicated (dollars in thousands): 

The Company s allowance for loan losses totaled $15.2 million at September 30, 2016 compared to $14.4 million at December 31, 2015 representing an increase of $716,000, or 7% on an annualized basis.  As of September 30, 2016, compared with year-end 2015, the overall allowance for loan and lease losses was increased in the agricultural sector primarily as a result of qualitative considerations for current economic conditions and trends which included a decline in the aggregate debt service coverage ratios for agricultural borrowers and a decline in per acre values of crop production real estate.  Partially mitigating this increase was the repayment of a single non-accrual commercial real estate credit during the third quarter of 2016 that had a specific allocation assigned prior to repayment. 
     
  The total allowance for loan losses represented 0.76% of period-end loans at September 30, 2016 compared with 0.92% of period-end loans at December 31, 2015.  The decline in the allowance for loan loss as a percent of total loans was the result of the acquisition of River Valley.  Under acquisition accounting treatment, loans acquired are recorded at fair value which includes a credit risk component, and therefore the allowance on loans acquired is not carried over from the seller.  The Company held a discount on acquired loans of $11.1 million as of September 30, 2016 and $3.0 million at December 31, 2015.  

46 

The following is an analysis of the Company s non-performing assets at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

The following tables present non-accrual loans and loans past due 90 days or more still on accrual by class of loans: 

Non-performing assets totaled $5.5 million, or 0.18% of total assets at September 30, 2016 compared to $3.5 million, or 0.15% of total assets at December 31, 2015. Non-performing loans totaled $5.1 million, or 0.25% of total loans at September 30, 2016 compared to $3.3 million, or 0.21% of total loans at December 31, 2015. The increase in non-performing assets and non-performing loans during the 2016 was primarily attributable to the merger transaction with River Valley which included $2.8 million of non-accrual loans and $0.2 million of loans greater than 90 days past due and still accruing at September 30, 2016. 
    
  Loan impairment is reported when repayment under the terms of the loan is not expected.  If a loan is impaired, a portion of the allowance is specifically allocated so that the loan is reported net, at the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan s existing rate, or at the fair value of collateral if repayment is expected solely from the collateral. Commercial and industrial loans, commercial real estate loans, and agricultural loans are evaluated individually for impairment. Smaller balance homogeneous loans are evaluated for impairment in total. Such loans include real estate loans secured by one-to-four family residences and loans to individuals for household, family and other personal expenditures. Individually evaluated loans on non-accrual are generally considered impaired. Impaired loans, or portions thereof, are charged off when deemed uncollectible. 
    
  Total deposits increased $503.3 million as of September 30, 2016 compared with December 31, 2015 total deposits.  The increase during 2016 was largely attributable to the acquisition of River Valley which had total deposits as of the closing date of the merger of approximately $405.4 million. 

47 

Capital Resources: 
    
  As of September 30, 2016, shareholders  equity increased by $88.7 million to $341.0 million compared with $252.3 million at year-end 2015.  The increase in shareholders' equity was largely attributable to the issuance of the Company's common shares in the acquisition of River Valley.  Approximately 1,942,000 shares were issued to River Valley shareholders resulting in an increase to shareholders' equity of $62.2 million.  The increase in shareholders' equity was also attributable to an increase of $17.2 million in retained earnings and an increase of $8.3 million in accumulated other comprehensive income primarily related to the increase in value of the Company's available-for-sale securities portfolio.  Shareholders  equity represented 11.4% of total assets at September 30, 2016 and 10.6% of total assets at December 31, 2015.  Shareholders  equity included $56.8 million of goodwill and other intangible assets at September 30, 2016 compared to $21.8 million of goodwill and other intangible assets at December 31, 2015.  The increase in goodwill and other intangible assets was attributable to the acquisition of River Valley. 
    
  Federal banking regulations provide guidelines for determining the capital adequacy of bank holding companies and banks. These guidelines provide for a more narrow definition of core capital and assign a measure of risk to the various categories of assets. The Company is required to maintain minimum levels of capital in proportion to total risk-weighted assets and off-balance sheet exposures. 
    
  As of January 1, 2015, the Company and its subsidiary bank adopted the new Basel III regulatory capital framework.  The adoption of this new framework modified the regulatory capital calculations, minimum capital levels and well-capitalized thresholds and added the new Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio.  Additionally, under the new rules, in order to avoid limitations on capital distributions, including dividend payments, the Company will be required to maintain a capital conservation buffer above the adequately capitalized regulatory capital ratios.  The capital conservation buffer is being phased in from 0.00% in 2015 to 2.50% in 2019.  For September 30, 2016, the capital conservation buffer is 0.625%.  At September 30, 2016, the capital levels for the Company and its subsidiary bank remained well in excess of of the minimum amounts needed for capital adequacy purposes and the bank's capital levels met the necessary requirements to be considered well-capitalized. 
    
  The table below presents the Company s consolidated and the subsidiary bank's capital ratios under regulatory guidelines: 

Under the the final rules provided for by Basel III, accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI") was to be included in a banking organization's Common Equity Tier 1 capital.  The final rules allowed community banks to make a one-time election not to include these additional components of AOCI in regulatory capital and instead use the existing treatment under the general risk-based capital rules that excludes most AOCI components from regulatory capital.  The opt-out election was to be made in the first  regulatory filings (call report and FRY-9) that were made after the banking organizations became subject to the final rules.  The Company elected to opt-out and continue the existing treatment of AOCI for regulatory capital purposes.

Liquidity: 
    
  The Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows details the elements of changes in the Company s consolidated cash and cash equivalents. Total cash and cash equivalents increased $2.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 ending at $54.8 million.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, operating activities resulted in net cash inflows of $32.8 million.  Investing activities resulted in net cash outflows of $76.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  Financing activities resulted in net cash inflows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 of $46.1 million. 
    
  The parent company is a corporation separate and distinct from its bank and other subsidiaries.  The Company uses funds at the parent-company level to pay dividends to its shareholders, to acquire or make other investments in other businesses or their securities or assets, to repurchase its stock from time to time, and for other general corporate purposes including debt service. The parent company does not have access at the parent-company level to the deposits and certain other sources of funds that are available to its bank subsidiary to support its operations.  Instead, the parent company has historically derived most of its revenues from dividends paid to the parent company by its bank subsidiary.  The Company s banking subsidiary is subject to statutory restrictions on its ability to pay dividends to the parent company.  The parent company has in recent years supplemented the dividends received from its subsidiaries with borrowings.  As of September 30, 2016, the parent company had approximately $12.5 million of cash and cash equivalents available to meet its cash flow needs.

  Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and the Company undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the forward-looking statement is made. 
    
  Readers are cautioned that, by their nature, all forward-looking statements are based on assumptions and are subject to risks, uncertainties, and other factors. Actual results may differ materially and adversely from the expectations of the Company that are expressed or implied by any forward-looking statement. The discussions in this Item 2 list some of the factors that could cause the Company s actual results to vary materially from those expressed or implied by any forward-looking statements. Other risks, uncertainties, and factors that could cause the Company s actual results to vary materially from those expressed or implied by any forward-looking statement include the unknown future direction of interest rates and the timing and magnitude of any changes in interest rates; changes in competitive conditions; the introduction, withdrawal, success and timing of asset/liability management strategies or of mergers and acquisitions and other business initiatives and strategies; changes in customer borrowing, repayment, investment and deposit practices; changes in fiscal, monetary and tax policies; changes in financial and capital markets; deterioration in general economic conditions, either nationally or locally, resulting in, among other things, credit quality deterioration; capital management activities, including possible future sales of new securities, or possible repurchases or redemptions by the Company of outstanding debt or equity securities; risks of expansion through acquisitions and mergers, such as unexpected credit quality problems of the acquired loans or other assets, unexpected attrition of the customer base of the acquired institution or branches, and difficulties in integration of the acquired operations; factors driving impairment charges on investments; the impact, extent and timing of technological changes; potential cyber-attacks, information security breaches and other criminal activities; litigation liabilities, including related costs, expenses, settlements and judgments, or the outcome of matters before regulatory agencies, whether pending or commencing in the future; actions of the Federal Reserve Board; changes in accounting principles and interpretations; potential increases of federal deposit insurance premium expense, and possible future special assessments of FDIC premiums, either industry wide or specific to the Company s banking subsidiary; actions of the regulatory authorities under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and other possible legislative and regulatory actions and reforms; and the continued availability of earnings and excess capital sufficient for the lawful and prudent declaration and payment of cash dividends. Such statements reflect our views with respect to future events and are subject  
  
   49 

to these and other risks, uncertainties and assumptions relating to the operations, results of operations, growth strategy and liquidity of the Company. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. 
    
  Investors should consider these risks, uncertainties, and other factors, in addition to those mentioned by the Company in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for its fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, and other SEC filings from time to time, when considering any forward-looking statement. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
    
  The Company s exposure to market risk is reviewed on a regular basis by the Asset/Liability Committee and Boards of Directors of the parent company and its subsidiary bank.  Primary market risks which impact the Company s operations are liquidity risk and interest rate risk. 
    
  The liquidity of the parent company is dependent upon the receipt of dividends from its subsidiary bank, which is subject to certain regulatory limitations.  The Bank s source of funding is predominately core deposits, maturities of securities, repayments of loan principal and interest, federal funds purchased, securities sold under agreements to repurchase and borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank. 
    
  The Company monitors interest rate risk by the use of computer simulation modeling to estimate the potential impact on its net interest income under various interest rate scenarios, and by estimating its static interest rate sensitivity position. Another method by which the Company s interest rate risk position can be estimated is by computing estimated changes in its net portfolio value ( NPV ).  This method estimates interest rate risk exposure from movements in interest rates by using interest rate sensitivity analysis to determine the change in the NPV of discounted cash flows from assets and liabilities.  NPV represents the market value of portfolio equity and is equal to the estimated market value of assets minus the estimated market value of liabilities.  
    
  Computations for measuring both net interest income and NPV are based on a number of assumptions, including the relative levels of market interest rates and prepayments in mortgage loans and certain types of investments.  These computations do not contemplate any actions management may undertake in response to changes in interest rates, and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results.  In addition, certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of computing both net interest income and NPV.  Should interest rates remain or decrease below current levels, the proportion of adjustable rate loans could decrease in future periods due to refinancing activity.  In the event of an interest rate change, prepayment levels would likely be different from those assumed in the modeling.  Lastly, the ability of many borrowers to repay their adjustable rate debt may decline during a rising interest rate environment. 
    
  The Company from time to time utilizes derivatives to manage interest rate risk.  Management continuously evaluates the merits of such interest rate risk products but does not anticipate the use of such products to become a major part of the Company s risk management strategy. 
    
  The table below provides an assessment of the risk to net interest income over the next 12 months in the event of a sudden and sustained 1% and 2% increase and decrease in prevailing interest rates (dollars in thousands). 
    
  Interest Rate Sensitivity as of September 30, 2016 - Net Interest Income 

The above table is a measurement of the Company s net interest income at risk, assuming a static balance sheet as of September 30, 2016 and instantaneous parallel changes in interest rates.  The Company also monitors interest rate risk under other scenarios including a more gradual movement in market interest rates.  This type of scenario can at times produce different modeling results in measuring interest rate risk sensitivity.

This Item 3 includes forward-looking statements.  See  Forward-looking Statements and Associated Risks  included in Part I, Item 2 of this Report for a discussion of certain factors that could cause the Company s actual exposure to market risk to vary materially from that expressed or implied above.  These factors include possible changes in economic conditions; interest rate fluctuations, competitive product and pricing pressures within the Company s markets; and equity and fixed income market fluctuations.  Actual experience may also vary materially to the extent that the Company s assumptions described above prove to be inaccurate. 

Item 4.  Controls and Procedures 
    
  As of September 30, 2016, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of its principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures. Based on this evaluation, the Company s principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were, as of that date, effective in timely alerting them to material information required to be included in the Company s periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. There are inherent limitations to the effectiveness of systems of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective systems of disclosure controls and procedures can provide only reasonable assurances of achieving their control objectives. 
    
  There was no change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Company s third fiscal quarter of 2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
