Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
   
  Business Overview 
  Healthcare Realty Trust Incorporated (the "Company") is a real estate investment trust ("REIT") that integrates owning, managing, financing and developing income-producing real estate properties associated primarily with the delivery of outpatient healthcare services throughout the United States.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had investments of approximately   $3.5 billion   in   202   real estate properties located in   29   states totaling approximately   14.5 million   square feet.  The Company provided leasing and property management services to approximately   10.1 million   square feet nationwide. 
    
  Basis of Presentation 
  The Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X.  They do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements.  However, except as disclosed herein, management believes there has been no material change in the information disclosed in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .  All material intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. 
    
  This interim financial information should be read in conjunction with the financial statements included in this report and in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .  Management believes that all adjustments of a normal, recurring nature considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included.  In addition, the interim financial information does not necessarily represent or indicate what the operating results will be for the year ending   December 31, 2016   for many reasons including, but not limited to, acquisitions, dispositions, capital financing transactions, changes in interest rates and the effects of other trends, risks and uncertainties. 
    
  Use of Estimates in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements 
  Preparation of the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Actual results may differ from those estimates. 
    
  New Accounting Pronouncements 
  Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09 and No. 2015-14 
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2014-09, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers," a comprehensive new revenue recognition standard that supersedes most existing revenue recognition guidance, including sales of real estate.  This standard's core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers goods or services to customers in amounts that reflect the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services.  However, leasing contracts, representing the major source of the Company's revenues, are not within the scope of the new standard and will continue to be accounted for under other standards. 
    
  In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, "Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606); Deferral of the Effective Date."  This standard is effective for the Company for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017 with early adoption permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that year. The Company is currently evaluating the impact from the adoption of this new standard on the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes.

Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-03 
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, "Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs."  This standard required debt issuance costs to be reported in the balance sheet as a direct reduction from the face amount of the note to which it is directly related.  In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-15, "Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of 
  Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements," which allowed entities to defer and present debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements as assets regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement.  The Company adopted this standard as of January 1, 2016.  As a result of the adoption, all deferred financing costs, excluding costs related to the unsecured revolving credit facility, were reclassified to Notes and bonds payable.  Unsecured revolving credit facility costs remain classified as an asset and will continue to be amortized over the remaining term. 
    
  The guidance requires retrospective adoption for all prior periods presented.  The following table represents the previously reported balances and reclassified balances for the impacted line items of the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of   December 31, 2015  : 

Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-16 
  In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, "Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments."  This standard requires adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period after a business combination to be recognized in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined.  The adjustments recognized in the current period include the effects on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects as a result of the change to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date.  The Company adopted this standard effective as of January 1, 2016.  The adoption of this standard had no impact on the Company's consolidated financial position or cash flows. 
    
  Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, "Leases."  For lessees, the new standard establishes a right-of-use (ROU) model that requires a lessee to record a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months.  Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement.  For lessors, the new standard requires a lessor to classify leases as either sales-type, finance or operating.  A lease will be treated as a sale if it transfers all of the risks and rewards, as well as control of the underlying asset, to the lessee.  If risks and rewards are conveyed without the transfer of control, the lease is treated as financing.  If the lessor doesn't convey risks and rewards or control, an operating lease results.   
    
  The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessors for sales-type, direct financing, and operating existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain practical expedients available.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact from the adoption of this new standard on the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes.

Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, "Compensation - Stock Compensation; Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting."  This update was issued as part of the simplification initiative.  The areas of simplification relevant to the Company include the following: 
             
    Forfeitures - an entity can make an entity-wide accounting policy election to either estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest or account for forfeitures when they occur. 
                
    Minimum statutory tax withholding requirements - the threshold to qualify for equity classification permits withholding up to the maximum statutory tax rates in the applicable jurisdiction. 
                
    Classification of employee taxes paid on the statement of cash flows when an employer withholds shares for tax-withholding purposes - cash paid by an employer when directly withholding shares for tax-withholding purposes should be classified as a financing activity. 
     This standard is effective for the Company for annual and interim periods beginning on January 1, 2017 with early adoption permitted.  The Company adopted this standard effective January 1, 2016.  There was no impact to the Company's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements resulting from the adoption of this standard. 
    
  Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-15 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, "Statement of Cash Flows; Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments."  This update clarifies whether the following items should be classified as operating, investing or financing in the statement of cash flows: (i) debt prepayments and extinguishment costs, (ii) settlement of zero-coupon debt, (iii) settlement of contingent consideration, (iv) insurance proceeds, (v) settlement of corporate-owned life insurance and bank-owned life insurance policies, (vi) distributions from equity method investees, (vii) beneficial interest in securitization transactions and (viii) receipts and payments with aspects of more than one class of cash flows. 
    
  This standard is effective for the Company for annual and interim periods beginning on January 1, 2018 on a retrospective transition method to each period presented.  The Company does not expect an impact to the Company's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements resulting from the adoption of this standard.

  On   July 29, 2016  , the Company entered into an amendment to its unsecured credit facility due 2017 (the "Unsecured Credit Facility") that extended the maturity date from April 2017 to   July 2020  , reduced the spread over LIBOR that the Company pays for borrowing, and revised financial covenants to provide the Company with increased flexibility.  Amounts outstanding under the Unsecured Credit Facility bear interest at LIBOR plus an applicable margin rate. The margin rate, which depends on the Company's credit ratings, ranges from   0.83%   to   1.55%   (currently at   1.00%  ). In addition, the Company pays a facility fee per annum on the aggregate amount of commitments ranging from   0.13%   to   0.30%   (currently at   0.20%  ). In connection with the amendment, the Company paid upfront fees to the lenders and other costs of approximately   $4.4 million  , which will be amortized over the term of the Unsecured Credit Facility.  As of September 30, 2016, the Company had an outstanding principal balance of   $81.0 million   under the Unsecured Credit Facility and had a remaining borrowing capacity of   $619.0 million  . 
    
  On July 29, 2016, the Company also entered into an amendment to the Unsecured Term Loan. This amendment was for the purpose of conforming the financial covenants in the Unsecured Term Loan to those in the amendment to the Unsecured Credit Facility. The amendment did not impact the maturity date or cost of borrowing under the Unsecured Term Loan.

On September 1, 2016, the Company repaid in full a mortgage note payable bearing interest at a rate of   6.01%   with outstanding principal of   $15.7 million  .  The mortgage note encumbered a   70,623   square foot medical office building located in the state of Washington. 

Note 4. Derivative Financial Instruments 
  Risk Management Objective of Using Derivatives 
  In addition to operational risks which arise in the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to economic risks such as interest rate, liquidity and credit risk.  In certain situations, the Company may enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swap and interest rate cap agreements to manage interest rate risk exposure arising from variable rate debt transactions that result in the receipt or payment of future known and uncertain cash amounts, the value of which are determined by interest rates.  The Company's objective in using interest rate derivatives is to manage its exposure to interest rate movements on its variable rate debt. 
    
  Cash Flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk 
  Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable-rate amounts from a counterparty in exchange for the Company making fixed-rate payments over the life of the agreements without changing the underlying notional amount.  
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company did not have any outstanding interest rate derivatives that were designated as cash flow hedges of interest rate risk. 
  The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as, and that qualify as, cash flow hedges is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss ( OCI ) and is reclassified into earnings as interest expense in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings.  The effective portion of the Company s interest rate swaps that was recorded in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016    and   2015   respectively, was as follows:

Note 8. Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
  The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instrument for which it is practical to estimate that value. 
    
  Cash and cash equivalents -    The carrying amount approximates fair value. 
    
  Borrowings under the Unsecured Credit Facility and Unsecured Term Loan -    The carrying amount approximates fair value because the borrowings are based on variable market interest rates. 
    
  Senior unsecured notes payable -    The fair value of notes and bonds payable is estimated using cash flow analyses, based on the Company s current interest rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements. 
    
  Mortgage notes payable -    The fair value is estimated using cash flow analyses, based on the Company s current interest rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements.

  The purpose of this Management's Discussion and Analysis of FInancial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD A") is to provide an understanding of the Company's consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows by focusing on the changes in certain key measures from year to year.  MD A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, the Company's Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes.  MD A is organized in the following sections: 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
                
    Trends and Matters Impacting Operating Results 
                
    Results of Operations 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Sources and Uses of Cash 
  The Company s primary sources of cash include rent receipts from its real estate portfolio based on contractual arrangements with its tenants, sponsors and borrowers, borrowings under the Company's Unsecured Credit Facility, proceeds from the sales of real estate properties and proceeds from public or private debt or equity offerings.    
    
  The Company expects to continue to meet its liquidity needs, including funding additional investments, paying dividends, and funding debt service through cash on hand, cash flows from operations, and the cash flow sources described above. The Company had unencumbered real estate assets with a gross book value of approximately   $3.3 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , of which a portion could serve as collateral for secured mortgage financing. The Company believes that its liquidity and sources of capital are adequate to satisfy its cash requirements. The Company cannot, however, be certain that these sources of funds will be available at a time and upon terms acceptable to the Company in sufficient amounts to meet its liquidity needs.   
    
  Investing Activities  
  Cash flows used in investing activities for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were approximately   $241.0 million  .  Below is a summary of the significant investing activities.

Four   of these properties are located on hospital campuses and   one   is adjacent (meaning   0.25   miles or less from the hospital campus) to a hospital campus. 
                
    The Company funded approximately   $36.2 million   at its development and redevelopment properties. 
                
    Other items funded during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   include the following:

     Table of Contents  

On   July 29, 2016  , the Company entered into an amendment to its Unsecured Credit Facility that extended the maturity date from April 2017 to   July 2020  , reduced the spread over LIBOR that the Company pays for borrowing, and revised financial covenants to provide the Company with increased flexibility.  Amounts outstanding under the Unsecured Credit Facility bear interest at LIBOR plus an applicable margin rate. The margin rate, which depends on the Company's credit ratings, ranges from   0.83%   to   1.55%   (currently at   1.00%  ). In addition, the Company pays a facility fee per annum on the aggregate amount of commitments ranging from   0.13%   to   0.30%   (currently at   0.20%  ). In connection with the amendment, the Company paid upfront fees to the lenders and other costs of approximately   $4.4 million   which will be amortized over the term of the Unsecured Credit Facility.  During the third quarter of 2016, the Company had a daily average of $17.7 million outstanding on the Unsecured Credit Facility.  As of September 30, 2016, the Company had   $81.0 million   in borrowings outstanding under the Unsecured Credit Facility and had a remaining borrowing capacity of   $619.0 million  . 
    
  On July 29, 2016, the Company also entered into an amendment to the Unsecured Term Loan.

The amendment did not impact the maturity date or cost of borrowing under the Unsecured Term Loan.  
  On September 1, 2016, the Company repaid in full a mortgage note payable bearing interest at a rate of    6.01%   with outstanding principal of   $15.7 million  .  The mortgage note encumbered a   70,623   square foot medical office building located in the state of Washington. 
    
  Common Stock Issuances 
  On February 19, 2016, the Company entered into sales agreements with   five   investment banks to allow sales under its at-the-market equity offering program of up to   10,000,000   shares of common stock.  A previous sales agreement with   one   investment bank was terminated effective February 17, 2016.  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company sold a total of   4,795,601   shares of common stock, including   664,298   shares of common stock under the previous sales agreement.  The sales generated   $144.6 million   in net proceeds at prices ranging from   $28.31   to   $33.66   per share (weighted average of   $30.61   per share). No shares were sold under this program during the third quarter of 2016.   The Company has   5,868,697   authorized shares remaining available to be sold under the current sales agreements as of   October 28, 2016  . 
    
  On   July 5, 2016,   the Company issued   9,200,000   shares of common stock, par value   $0.01   per share, at   $33.13   per share in an underwritten public offering pursuant to the Company's existing effective registration statement.  The net proceeds of the offering, after offering expenses, were approximately   $304.6 million  .  A portion of the proceeds were used to repay indebtedness and fund  investment activity. 
    
  Operating Activities  
  Cash flows provided by operating activities decreased from   $113.3 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $102.4 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  This decrease includes the $19.6 million payment of the pension benefit obligation in connection with the termination of the Executive Retirement Plan.  See Note 7 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.  Other items impacting cash flows from operations include, but are not limited to, cash generated from property operations, interest payments and the timing related to the payment of invoices and other expenses and receipts of tenant rent. 
  The Company may, from time to time, sell additional properties and redeploy cash from property sales and mortgage repayments into new investments.  To the extent revenues related to the properties being sold and the mortgages being repaid exceed income from these new investments, the Company's results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. 
    
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  The Company has no off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on the Company s financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

Trends and Matters Impacting Operating Results 
  Management monitors factors and trends important to the Company and the REIT industry to gauge the potential impact on the operations of the Company.  In addition to the matters discussed in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , below are some of the factors and trends that management believes may impact future operations of the Company. 
    
  Expiring Leases  
  The Company expects that approximately 15% to 20% of the leases in its multi-tenanted portfolio will expire each year in the ordinary course of business.  There are 447 leases totaling 1.4 million square feet in the Company's multi-tenant portfolio that have expired or will expire during   2016  .  Approximately 90% of the leases expiring in   2016   are located in buildings on or adjacent to hospital campuses, are distributed throughout the portfolio, and are not concentrated with any one tenant, health system or market area.  The Company typically expects to retain 75% to 90% of multi-tenant property tenants upon expiration, and the retention ratio for the first   nine   months of the year has been within this range. 
    
  Two single-tenant net leases expired during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  One tenant entered into a new 11-year lease agreement.  The other lease was not renewed, but a new tenant signed a 20-year lease. The Company expects these new lease agreements to result in a decrease in rental income of approximately   $0.5 million   in 2016, of which   $0.1 million   was realized in the second quarter of 2016,   $0.2 million   was realized in the third quarter of 2016 and   $0.2 million   is expected to be realized in the fourth quarter of 2016.  The Company does not have any other single-tenant net leases that expire by their terms in 2016. 
    
  The Company received notice in October 2016 from LifeCare Management Services that it plans to close a 78,731 square foot, long term acute care hospital in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania that it leases from the Company.   The closure is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2016. The single tenant net lease for the facility is scheduled to expire in June 2022, though the Company does not expect to collect rent after October 1, 2016. Assuming no future rental income from the property, the Company expects a quarterly decrease in rental income beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016 of $0.5 million.  The Company is working to sell or lease the property to another health care provider.  
  Property Operating Agreement Expirations 
  Five   of the Company s owned real estate properties as of   December 31, 2015   were covered under property operating agreements between the Company and a sponsoring health system.  These agreements contractually obligate the sponsoring health system to provide to the Company a minimum return on the Company s investment in the property in exchange for the right to be involved in the operating decisions of the property, including tenancy.  If the minimum return is not achieved through normal operations of the property, the Company calculates and accrues to property lease guaranty revenue any shortfalls due from the sponsoring health systems under the terms of the property operating agreement.  Of these five agreements, one agreement expired in April 2016, and two more agreements expired on September 30, 2016.  As a result of these 2016 expirations, quarterly property lease guaranty revenue was reduced $0.1 million beginning in April 2016 and a total of $0.6 million beginning in October 2016.  The remaining   two   agreements will expire in January 2017 and February 2019, respectively, and each is expected to decrease property lease guaranty revenue by   $0.2 million   per quarter thereafter. 
    
  Operating Expenses 
  The Company has historically experienced increases in property taxes throughout its portfolio as a result of increasing assessments and tax rates levied across the country.  The Company continues its efforts to appeal property tax increases and manage the impact of the increases.  In addition, the Company has historically incurred variability in portfolio utilities expense based on seasonality, with the first and third quarters usually reflecting greater amounts.  The effects of these operating expense increases are mitigated in leases that have provisions for operating expense reimbursement.  As of   September 30, 2016  , leases for 85% of the Company's multi-tenant leased square footage allow for some recovery of operating expenses, with 54% allowing recovery of all expenses.

Purchase Options 
  In July 2016, the Company received notice from the ground lessor of a medical office building in Kansas City, Kansas of its intent to purchase the property pursuant to a purchase option contained in the ground lease.  This property was sold in October 2016.  The Company's net investment in the building was $7.2 million at   September 30, 2016  .  The sales price for the building was approximately   $15.1 million   and the Company expects to recognize a   $7.6 million   gain on the disposal, net of straight-line rent receivables and other assets.  
    
  Additional information about the Company's unexercised purchase options and the amount and basis for determination of the purchase price is detailed in the table below (dollars in thousands): 

_____ 
  (1)  The purchase option price includes a fair market value component that is determined by an appraisal process.  
  (2)  Includes properties with stated purchase prices or prices based on fixed capitalization rates.  These properties have purchase prices that are on average 13% greater than the Company's current gross investment. 
    
  Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
  Management believes that net income, as defined by GAAP, is the most appropriate earnings measurement.  However, management considers certain non-GAAP financial measures to be useful supplemental measures of the Company's operating performance.  A non-GAAP financial measure is generally defined as one that purports to measure historical or future financial performance, financial position or cash flows, but excludes or includes amounts that would not be so adjusted in the most comparable GAAP measure.  Set forth below are descriptions of the non-GAAP financial measures management considers relevant to the Company's business and useful to investors, as well as reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. 
    
  The non-GAAP financial measures presented herein are not necessarily identical to those presented by other real estate companies due to the fact that not all real estate companies use the same definitions.  These measures should not be considered as alternatives to net income (determined in accordance with GAAP), as indicators of the Company's financial performance, or as alternatives to cash flow from operating activities (determined in accordance with GAAP) as measures of the Company's liquidity, nor are these measures necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of the Company's needs.  Management believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of the Company's consolidated historical operating results, these measures should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented in the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements and other financial data included elsewhere in this report. 
    
  Funds from Operations 
  Funds from operations ( FFO ) and FFO per share are operating performance measures adopted by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT ).  NAREIT defines FFO as the most commonly accepted and reported measure of a REIT s operating performance equal to  net income (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of property, plus depreciation and amortization related to real estate properties, leasing commission amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.   The Company follows the NAREIT definition in calculating and presenting FFO and FFO per share.   

21 

     Table of Contents  

Management believes FFO and FFO per share to be supplemental measures of a REIT s performance because they provide an understanding of the operating performance of the Company s properties without giving effect to certain significant non-cash items, primarily depreciation and amortization expense.  Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time.  However, real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions.  The Company believes that by excluding the effect of depreciation, amortization and gains or losses from sales of real estate, all of which are based on historical costs and which may be of limited relevance in evaluating current performance, FFO and FFO per share can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods.  The Company reports FFO and FFO per share because these measures are observed by management to also be the predominant measures used by the REIT industry and by industry analysts to evaluate REITs and because FFO per share is consistently reported, discussed, and compared by research analysts in their notes and publications about REITs.  For these reasons, management has deemed it appropriate to disclose and discuss FFO and FFO per share.  However, FFO does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with GAAP and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs.  FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income attributable to common stockholders as an indicator of the Company s operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of liquidity. 
    
  FFO for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same periods in   2015   was primarily impacted by the various acquisitions and dispositions during the period, the effects of capital market transactions and the results of operations of the portfolio from period to period. FFO for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   was negatively impacted by $28.0 million, or $0.28 per common share, as a result of the extinguishment of debt and $5.3 million, or $0.05 per common share, as a result of the termination of the Executive Retirement Plan.   
    
  The table below reconciles net income to FFO for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  :

Same Store Net Operating Income 
  Net operating income ("NOI") and same store NOI are non-GAAP historical financial measures of performance.  Management considers same store NOI a supplemental performance measure because it allows investors, analysts and Company management to measure unlevered property-level operating results.  The Company defines NOI as operating revenues (property operating revenue, single-tenant net lease revenue, and property lease guaranty revenue) less property operating expenses related specifically to the property portfolio.  NOI excludes straight-line rent, general and administrative expenses, interest expense, depreciation and amortization, gains and losses from property sales, property management fees and other revenues and expenses not specifically related to the property portfolio.  Same store NOI is historical and not necessarily indicative of future results. 
    
  The following table reflects the Company's same store NOI for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  

Properties included in the same store analysis are stabilized properties that have been included in operations and were consistently reported as leased and stabilized properties for the duration of the year-over-year comparison period presented.  Accordingly, properties that were recently acquired or disposed of, properties classified as held for sale, and properties in stabilization or conversion from stabilization are excluded from the same store analysis.  In addition, the Company excludes properties that meet any of the following Company-defined criteria to be included in the reposition property group: 

Properties having less than 60% occupancy that is expected to last at least two quarters; 
                
    Properties that experience a loss of occupancy over 30% in a single quarter; 
                
    Properties with negative net operating income that is expected to last at least two quarters; or 
                
    Condemnation. 
       
  Any recently acquired property will be included in the same store pool once the Company has owned the property for eight full quarters.  Development properties will be included in the same store pool eight full quarters after substantial completion.  Any property included in the reposition property group will be included in the same store analysis once occupancy has increased to 60% or greater with positive net operating income and has remained at that level for eight full quarters.

              b.

              5. 
    The registrant s other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant s auditors and the audit committee of the registrant s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions): 
              a. 
    All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and 
              b. 
    Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting.
