1.   
       BASIS OF PRESENTATION    

The interim financial statements
of CytoSorbents Corporation (the  Company ,  we  or  our ) have been prepared in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). In the opinion of
management, the Company has made all necessary adjustments, which include normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair
statement of the Company s financial position and results of operations for the interim periods presented. Certain
information and disclosures normally included in the annual financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have
been condensed or omitted. These interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial
statements and accompanying notes for the year ended December  31, 2015 included in the Company s Annual Report on
Form 10-K, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 9, 2016. The results for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for a full year, any other
interim periods or any future year or period. 

The accompanying consolidated financial statements
have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the
normal course of business. 

As of September 30, 2016, the Company had an
accumulated deficit of $(140,050,118), which included net losses of $(7,524,260) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and
$(6,130,065) for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The Company s losses have resulted principally from costs incurred
in the research and development of the Company s polymer technology and selling, general and administrative expenses. The
Company intends to continue to conduct significant additional research, development, and clinical study activities which, together
with expenses incurred for the establishment of manufacturing arrangements and a marketing and distribution presence and other
selling, general and administrative expenses, are expected to result in continuing operating losses for the foreseeable future.
The amount of future losses and when, if ever, the Company will achieve profitability is uncertain. The Company s ability
to achieve profitability will depend, among other things, on successfully completing the development of the Company s technology
and commercial products, obtaining additional requisite regulatory approvals in markets not covered by the CE Mark previously received
and for potential label extensions of the Company s current CE Mark, establishing manufacturing and sales and marketing arrangements
with third parties, and raising sufficient funds to finance the Company s activities. No assurance can be given that the
Company s product development efforts will be successful, that the Company s current CE Mark will enable the Company
to achieve profitability, that additional regulatory approvals in other countries will be obtained, that any of the Company s
products will be manufactured at a competitive cost and will be of acceptable quality, or that the Company will be able to achieve
profitability or that profitability, if achieved, can be sustained. These matters raise substantial doubt about the Company s
ability to continue as a going concern. These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the outcome
of this uncertainty. 

2.   
       PRINCIPAL BUSINESS ACTIVITY AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES    

Nature of Business  

The Company is a leader in critical care
immunotherapy commercializing its CytoSorb blood purification technology to reduce deadly uncontrolled inflammation in
hospitalized patients around the world, with the goal of preventing or treating multiple organ failure in life-threatening
illnesses. The Company, through its subsidiary CytoSorbents Medical Inc. (formerly known as CytoSorbents, Inc.), is engaged
in the research, development and commercialization of medical devices with its blood purification technology platform which
incorporates a proprietary adsorbent, porous polymer technology. The Company, through its European subsidiary, CytoSorbents
Europe GmbH, conducts sales and marketing related operations for the CytoSorb device. In March 2016, the Company formed
CytoSorbents Switzerland GmbH, a wholly-owned subsidiary of CytoSorbents Europe GmbH. This subsidiary, which began operations
during the second quarter of 2016, provides marketing and direct sale services in Switzerland. CytoSorb ,  the
Company s flagship product, is approved in the European Union (EU), and is marketed and distributed in forty countries
around the world as a safe and effective extracorporeal cytokine adsorber, designed to reduce the
 cytokine storm  that could otherwise cause massive inflammation, organ failure and death in common critical
illnesses such as sepsis, burn injury, trauma, lung injury, and pancreatitis. CytoSorb   is also being used during and
after cardiac surgery to remove inflammatory mediators, such as cytokines and free hemoglobin, which can lead to
post-operative complications, including multiple organ failure. The Company received CE Mark approval for its CytoSorb device
in March 2011. 

The technology is based upon biocompatible,
highly porous polymer sorbent beads that can actively remove toxic substances from blood and other bodily fluids by pore capture
and surface absorption. The Company has numerous products under development based upon this unique blood purification technology,
which is protected by 32 issued U.S. patents and multiple patent applications pending both in the United States and internationally,
including HemoDefend, ContrastSorb, DrugSorb, and others. The Company s intellectual property consists of composition of
matter, materials, method of production systems incorporating the technology, and multiple medical uses with expiration dates ranging
from approximately 1 to 10 years. The Company has patents expiring at various dates through 2026 that relate to the current technology.
The patents expiring in the next twelve months relate to technology no longer utilized by the Company. Accordingly, management
believes that any expiring patents will not have a significant impact on our ongoing business. 

Stock Market Listing  

On December 17, 2014 the Company s common
stock, par value $0.001 per share (the  Common Stock ) was approved for listing on the NASDAQ Capital Market (NASDAQ),
and it began trading on NASDAQ on December 23, 2014 under the symbol  CTSO . Previously, the Company s Common
Stock traded in the over-the-counter-market on the OTC Bulletin Board. 

Basis of Consolidation and Foreign Currency
Translation  

The consolidated financial statements include
the accounts of the parent, CytoSorbents Corporation, and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, CytoSorbents Medical, Inc. and CytoSorbents
Europe GmbH. In addition, the financial statements include CytoSorbents Switzerland GmbH, a wholly owned subsidiary of CytoSorbents
Europe GmbH. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. 

Translation gains and losses resulting from
the process of remeasuring into the U.S. dollar, the foreign currency financial statements of CytoSorbents Europe GmbH, for which
the U.S. dollar is the functional currency, are included in operations. Foreign currency transaction gain amounted to $73,445 and
$70,993 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Foreign currency transaction gain/(loss) included
in net loss amounted to $176,096 and $(315,594) for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company
translates assets and liabilities of the European subsidiaries, whose functional currency is their local currency, at the exchange
rate in effect at the balance sheet date. The Company translates revenue and expenses at the daily average exchange rates. The
Company includes accumulated net translation adjustments in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as a component of stockholder s
equity. 

Cash and Cash Equivalents  

The Company considers   all highly liquid
investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. 

Short-Term Investments  

Short-term investments include certificates
of deposit with original maturities of greater than three months. The cost of the certificates of deposit approximates fair value.
The Company classifies these investments as held-to-maturity securities in accordance with the provisions of ASC-320-10. 

Grants and Accounts Receivable  

Grants receivable represent amounts due from
U.S. government agencies and are included in Grants and Accounts Receivable. 

Accounts receivable are unsecured, non-interest
bearing customer obligations due under normal trade terms. The Company sells its devices to various hospitals and distributors.
The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of customers  financial condition. Management reviews accounts receivable
periodically to determine collectability. Balances that are determined to be uncollectible are written off to the allowance for
doubtful accounts. The allowance for doubtful accounts contains a general accrual for estimated bad debts and amounted to $7,318
and $3,275 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 

Inventories  

Inventories are valued at the lower of cost
or market. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company s inventory was comprised of finished goods, which amounted
to $556,340 and $382,099, respectively; work in process which amounted to $451,614 and $758,562, respectively; and raw materials,
which amounted to $43,694 and $50,020, respectively. Devices used in clinical trials or for research and development purposes are
removed from inventory and charged to research and development expenses at the time of their use.  

Property and Equipment  

Property and equipment are recorded at cost
less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation of property and equipment is provided for by the straight-line method over the estimated
useful lives of the related assets. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of their economic useful lives or the
term of the related leases. Gains and losses on depreciable assets retired or sold are recognized in the statements of operations
in the year of disposal. Repairs and maintenance expenditures are expensed as incurred. 

Patents  

Legal costs incurred to establish and successfully
defend patents are capitalized. When patents are issued, capitalized costs are amortized on the straight-line method over the related
patent term. In the event a patent is abandoned, the net book value of the patent is written off. 

Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets  

The Company assesses the impairment of patents
and other long-lived assets under accounting standards for the impairment or disposal of long-lived assets whenever events or changes
in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. For long-lived assets to be held and used, the Company
recognizes an impairment loss only if its carrying amount is not recoverable through its undiscounted cash flows and measures the
impairment loss based on the difference between the carrying amount and fair value. 

Warrant Liability  

The Company recognizes the fair value of the
warrants as of the date of the warrant grant using the binomial lattice valuation model. At each subsequent reporting date, the
Company again measures the fair value of the warrants, and records a change to the warrant liability as appropriate, and the change
is reported in the statement of operations. 

Revenue Recognition  

Product Sales : Revenues from sales of
products are recognized at the time when title and risk of loss passes to the customer. Recognition of revenue also requires reasonable
assurance of collection of sales proceeds and completion of all performance obligations. 

Grant Revenue  :  Revenue from grant
income is based on contractual agreements. Certain agreements provide for reimbursement of costs, while other agreements provide
for reimbursement of costs and an overhead margin. Revenues are recognized when milestones have been achieved and revenues have
been earned. Costs are recorded as incurred. Costs subject to reimbursement by these grants have been reflected as costs of revenue. 

Research and Development  

All research and development costs, payments
to laboratories and research consultants and costs of clinical trials and studies are expensed when incurred. 

Advertising Expenses  

Advertising expenses are charged to activities
when incurred. Advertising expenses amounted to approximately $28,000 and $84,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015, respectively, and approximately $153,000 and $200,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively,
and are included in selling, general, and administrative expenses on the consolidated statement of operations. 

Income Taxes  

Income taxes are accounted for under the asset
and liability method prescribed by accounting standards for accounting for income taxes. Deferred income taxes are recorded for
temporary differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets
and liabilities reflect the tax rates expected to be in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse.
A valuation allowance is provided if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.
Under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, the net operating losses generated prior to the previously completed reverse merger
may be limited due to the change in ownership. Additionally, net operating losses generated subsequent to the reverse merger may
be limited in the event of changes in ownership. 

The Company follows accounting standards associated
with uncertain tax positions. The Company had no unrecognized tax benefits at September 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015. The Company
files tax returns in the U.S. federal and state jurisdictions. The Company currently has no open years prior to December 31, 2012
and has no income tax related penalties or interest for the periods presented in these financial statements. 

The Company utilizes the Technology Business
Tax Certificate Transfer Program to sell a portion of its New Jersey Net Operating Loss carry forwards to an industrial company. 

CytoSorbents Europe GmbH annually files a corporate
tax return, VAT return and a trade tax return in Germany and Switzerland. 

Use of Estimates  

The preparation of financial statements in
conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Significant
estimates in these financials are the valuation of options granted, and valuation methods used to determine the fair value of the
warrant liability. 

Concentration of Credit Risk  

The Company maintains cash balances, at times,
with financial institutions in excess of amounts insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Management monitors the
soundness of these institutions in an effort to minimize its collection risk of these balances. 

As of September 30, 2016, two distributors
accounted for approximately 31% of outstanding grant and accounts receivable. At December 31, 2015, three distributors accounted
for approximately 48% of outstanding grant and accounts receivable. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, one direct customer
accounted for approximately 11% of the Company s total revenue. No other agency, distributor, or direct customer represented
more than 10% of the Company s revenue. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, approximately 16% of revenues were
from one U.S. government grant agency. No other agency, distributor, or direct customer represented more than 10% of the Company s
revenue. For the three months ended September 30, 2016, one direct customer accounted for approximately 11% of the Company s
total revenue. No other agency, distributor, or direct customer represented more than 10% of the Company s revenue. For the
three months ended September 30, 2015, no agency, distributor, or direct customer represented more than 10% of the Company s
revenue. 

Financial Instruments  

The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents,
short-term investments, accounts payable, notes payable, and other debt obligations approximate their fair values due to their
short-term nature. 

Net Loss Per Common Share  

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing
loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings
per common share is computed using the treasury stock method on the basis of the weighted-average number of shares of common stock
plus the dilutive effect of potential common shares outstanding during the period. Dilutive potential common shares include outstanding
warrants, stock options and restricted shares. The computation of diluted earnings per share does not assume conversion, exercise
or contingent exercise of securities that would have an anti-dilutive effect on earnings (See Note 7). 

Stock-Based Compensation  

The Company accounts for its stock-based compensation
under the recognition requirements of accounting standards for accounting for stock-based compensation, for employees and directors
whereby each option granted is valued at fair market value on the date of grant. Under these accounting standards, the fair value
of each option is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Company values its performance
based stock awards based on the market price of the Company s common stock on the date of the award. 

The Company also follows the guidance of accounting
standards for accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring, or in conjunction with selling,
goods or services for equity instruments issued to consultants. 

Effects of Recent Accounting Pronouncements  

In August 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (FASB) issued ASU No. 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40). ASU 2014-15
requires all entities to evaluate for the existence of conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity s
ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the issuance date of the financial statements.  The amendments
in this update are effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter.
Early application is permitted.  The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the updated guidance. The Company will
adopt the provisions of ASU 2014-15 for its fiscal year beginning January 1, 2017. Adoption of ASU 2014-15 will impact certain
of the Company s footnote disclosures related to liquidity. 

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,  Revenue
with Contracts from Customers.  ASU 2014-09 supersedes the current revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific
guidance. The ASU introduces a five-step model to achieve its core principal of the entity recognizing revenue to depict the transfer
of goods or services to customers at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange
for those goods and services. In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14 which deferred the effective date by one year. Accordingly,
the updated guidance is effective for public entities for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and early
adoption is permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period beginning after December 31, 2016. The Company
has evaluated the impact of the updated guidance and has determined that the adoption of ASU 2014-09 will not have a significant
impact on its consolidated financial statements. 

In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03,
 Interest-Imputation of Interest.  ASU 2015-03 requires that debit issuances costs and debt discounts and premiums
to be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the debt liability. The updated guidance
is effective for the fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company
has adopted the provisions of this ASU during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11,
 Inventory: Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory.  ASU 2015-11 clarifies current guidance regarding the valuation
of inventory. ASU 2015-11 requires that inventory be measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value. This ASU does not apply
to inventory that is measured using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) or the retail inventory method. The updated guidance is effective
for public entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2017. The Company has evaluated the impact of the updated guidance and has determined that the adoption of ASU 2015-11
will not have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,
 Leases (Topic 842) . ASU 2016-02 outlines reporting requirements for Lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and
corresponding liability on the balance sheet for all leases covering a period of greater than 12 months. The liability is to be
measured as the present value of the future minimum lease payments, plus any initial direct costs. The minimum payments are discounted
using the rate implicit in the lease, or, if not known, the lessee s incremental borrowing rate. The updated guidance is
effective for public entities for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2018. The Company has evaluated the impact of the updated
guidance and has determined that the adoption of ASU 2016-02 will not have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08
 Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net). 
The amendments in this Update affect the guidance in Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers
(Topic 606), which is discussed above and is not yet effective. The effective date and transition requirements for the amendments
in this Update are the same as the effective date and transition requirements of Update 2015-14, also discussed above. The Company
has evaluated the impact of the updated guidance and has determined that the adoption of ASU 2016-08 will not have a significant
impact on its consolidated financial statements. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,
 Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.  
 The areas for simplification in this Update involve several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions,
including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement
of cash flows. The updated guidance is effective for public entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company
has evaluated the impact of the updated guidance and has determined that the adoption of ASU 2016-09 will not have a significant
impact on its consolidated financial statements. 

In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10
 Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing.  The amendments in this
Update affect entities with transactions included within the scope of Topic 606. The scope of that Topic includes entities that
enter into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services (that are an output of the entity s ordinary activities)
in exchange for consideration. The effective date and transition requirements for the amendments in this Update are the same as
the effective date and transition requirements of Update 2015-14, which is discussed above. The Company has evaluated the impact
of the updated guidance and has determined that the adoption of ASU 2016-10 will not have a significant impact on its consolidated
financial statements. 

In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12,  Revenue
from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), Narrow Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients.  The amendments in ASU 2016-12
affect only the narrow aspects of Topic 606 that are outlined in ASU 2016-12. The effective date and transition requirements for
the amendments in this Update are the same as the effective date and transition requirements of Update 2015-14, which is discussed
above. The Company has evaluated the impact of the updated guidance and has determined that the adoption of ASU 2016-12 will not
have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements. 

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,
 Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (a consensus of the Emerging Issues Task Force).  The amendments
in this update relate to eight specific types of cash receipts and cash payments which current GAAP either is unclear or does not
include specific guidance on the cash flow classification issues.   The
amendments in this Update are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim
periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. If an entity early adopts
the amendments in an interim period, any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that
interim period. An entity that elects early adoption   must adopt
all of the amendments in the same period. The Company will adopt the provisions of this ASU for its fiscal year beginning January
1, 2017. The adoption of ASU 2016-15 will not have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements.

Controlled Equity Offering  

On November 4, 2015,
the Company entered into a Controlled Equity Offering SM  Sales Agreement (the  Sales Agreement ) with Cantor
Fitzgerald and Co., as agent ( Cantor ), pursuant to which the Company may offer to sell, from time to time through
Cantor, shares of the Company s Common Ctock, having an aggregate offering price of up to $25,000,000 (the  Shares )
Any Shares offered and sold will be issued pursuant to the Company s shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (Registration
No. 333-205806), and the related prospectus previously declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC )
on July 29, 2015 (the  Registration Statement ), as supplemented by a prospectus supplement, dated November 4, 2015,
which the Company filed with the SEC pursuant to Rule 424(b)(5) under the Securities Act. 

Under the Sales Agreement,
Cantor may sell Shares by any method permitted by law and deemed to be an  at the market offering  as defined in Rule
415 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, including sales made directly on The NASDAQ Capital Market, on any
existing trading market for the Common Stock or to or through a market maker. In addition, under the Sales Agreement, Cantor may
sell the Shares by any other method permitted by law, including in privately negotiated transactions. The Company may instruct
Cantor not to sell Shares if the sales cannot be effected at or above the price designated by the Company from time to time. 

The Company is not
obligated to make any sales of Shares under the Sales Agreement, and if it elects to make any sales, the Company can set a minimum
sales price for the Shares. The offering of Shares pursuant to the Sales Agreement will terminate upon the earlier of (a) the sale
of all the shares subject to the Sales Agreement and (b) the termination of the Sales Agreement by Cantor or the Company, as permitted
therein. Since it was established on November 4, 2015 through September 30, 2016, the Company sold 28,880 shares at an average
selling price of $8.02 per share, generating net proceeds of approximately $225,000 under the Sales Agreement. There were no sales

The Company pays a
commission rate of 3.0% of the aggregate gross proceeds from each sale of Shares and has agreed to provide Cantor with customary
indemnification and contribution rights. The Company has also reimbursed Cantor $50,000 for certain specified expenses in connection
with entering into the Sales Agreement. 

The Company intends
to use the net proceeds raised through  at the market  sales for research and development activities, which include
the funding of additional clinical studies and costs of obtaining regulatory approvals in countries not covered by the CE Mark,
capital expenditures and other costs necessary to expand production capacity, support of various sales and marketing efforts, product
development and general working capital purposes.   

January 14, 2015
Public Offering  

On January 14, 2015,
the Company closed an underwritten public offering ( Offering ) consisting of 1,250,000 shares of Common Stock at a
price of $8.25 per share for an aggregate price of $10,312,500. The Company received net proceeds from the Offering of approximately
$9,409,000. The net proceeds received by the Company from the Offering are being used to fund clinical studies, expand production
capacity, support various sales and marketing efforts, product development and general working capital purposes.  

The Company conducted
the Offering pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-199762), which was declared effective by the SEC on
January 8, 2015. The Company filed a final prospectus on January 9, 2015, disclosing the final terms of the Offering. 

In connection with
the Offering, on January 8, 2015, the Company entered into underwriting agreements with Brean Capital, LLC and H.C. Wainwright
  Co., LLC ( Representatives ), who acted as book-running managers and as representatives of the underwriters in
the Offering. 

In connection
with the successful completion of the Offering, the underwriters received aggregate discounts and commissions of 6% of the gross
proceeds of the sale of the shares in the Offering. In addition, the Company agreed to issue warrants to the Representatives ( Representatives 
Warrants ) that allow for the purchase of 30,000 shares of the Company s Common Stock. The Representative Warrants
had a fair value of approximately $30,000 on the date of the closing. The Representatives  Warrants are exercisable at any
time for a period of five years, commencing on the date of the effectiveness of the registration statement, at a price per share
equal to 120% of the public offering price per share of the Common Stock in the Offering. The Company also agreed to reimburse
the underwriters for actual out-of-pocket expenses related to the Offering, which amounted to approximately $85,000. The Company
also granted the Representatives a right of first refusal to participate in any subsequent offering or placement of the Company s
securities that takes place within nine months following the effective date of the registration statement. 

Stock-Based Compensation  

Stock Options:  

Total share-based employee, director, and consultant
compensation for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 amounted to approximately $124,000 and $114,000
and $599,000 and $260,000, respectively. These amounts are included in the statement of operations under the captions research
and development ($29,000 and $45,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and $121,000 and $79,000 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015) and selling, general and administrative ($95,000 and $69,000 for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015, and $478,000 and $181,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015). 

The summary of the stock option activity for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is as follows: 

The fair value of each stock option was estimated
using the Black Scholes pricing model which takes into account as of the grant date the exercise price (ranging from $3.67 to $6.07
per share) and expected life of the stock option (10 years), the current price of the underlying stock and its expected volatility
(ranging from 66.8% to 68.7%), expected dividends (-0-%) on the stock and the risk free interest rate (1.24% to 1.81%) for the
term of the stock option. 

The aggregate intrinsic value is calculated
at the difference between the market value as of September 30, 2016 of $6.40 and the exercise price of the shares. 

The summary of the status of the Company s non-vested options
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is as follows: 

As of September 30, 2016, the Company had approximately
$399,000 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options, which will be amortized over a weighted average period
of approximately nine months. In April 2015, the Board of Directors granted options to purchase 566,000 shares of Common Stock
to the Company s employees which options would only vest upon achievement of certain specific, predetermined milestones related
to 2015 operating performance.  The grant date fair value of these unvested options amounted to approximately
$1,388,000. On June 7, 2016, based upon the finalization of its review of the Company s progress to meeting the predetermined
milestones, the Board of Directors determined that 72,400 of these options would immediately vest. Accordingly, a $241,000 charge
related to these options has been recorded in the consolidated statements of operations for the nine months ended September 30,
2016.   

In addition, on June 7, 2016, the Board of
Directors granted options to purchase 900,100 shares of Common Stock to the Company s employees which will vest upon the
achievement of certain specific, predetermined milestones related to the Company s 2016 operations. The grant date fair value
of these unvested options amounted to approximately $2,437,000. Due to uncertainty over whether these options will vest, which
only occurs if the Company meets the predetermined milestones, no charge for these options has been recorded in the consolidated
statements of operations for three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016. 

In April 2015, the Board of Directors also
granted 960,000 restricted stock units, valued at $7,747,200, to Company employees and 240,000 restricted stock units, valued at
$1,936,000, to the members of the Board of Directors, which will only vest upon a Change in Control of the Company, as defined
in the Company s 2014 Long-Term Incentive Plan (a  Change in Control ). Of these restricted stock units granted
to Company employees in April 2015, 75,000 have been forfeited. In June 2016, the Board of Directors granted an additional 414,000
restricted stock units to Company employees, valued at $1,941,660 at the time of issuance, which will only vest upon a Change in
Control, bringing the total amount of restricted stock units outstanding to 1,539,000. Due to the uncertainty over whether these
restricted stock units will vest, which only happens upon a Change in Control, no charge for these restricted stock units has been
recorded in the consolidated statement of operations for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016. 

Performance Based Stock Awards:  

Pursuant to a review of the compensation of
the senior management of the Company, on June 7, 2016, the Board of Directors granted 80,000 restricted stock units to certain
senior managers of the Company. These awards were valued at $375,200 at the date of issuance, based upon the market price of the
Company s Common Stock at the date of the grant, and vest one third on the date of the grant, one third on the first anniversary
of the date of the grant, and one third on the second anniversary of the date of the grant. These awards are charged to expense
at their fair value on each vesting date. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded a charge of approximately
$125,000 related to the vested portion of these restricted stock unit awards. The following table outlines the restricted stock
unit activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2016: 

Warrants:  

As of September 30, 2016, the Company has the
following warrants to purchase common stock outstanding: 

4.   
       WARRANT LIABILITY    

In connection with its March 11, 2014 offering,
the Company issued warrants to purchase 816,000 shares of Common Stock. The Company recognizes these warrants as liabilities at
their fair value on the date of grant, then measures the fair value of the warrants on each reporting date, and records a change
to the warrant liability as appropriate. The warrants have certain pricing provisions which apply if the Company sells or issues
common stock or Common Stock equivalents at a price that is less than the exercise price of the warrants, over the life of the
warrants, excluding certain exempt issuances. 

The Company recognized an initial warrant liability
for the warrants issued in connection with the offering completed in March 2014. The initial warrant liability recognized on the
related warrants totaled $862,920, which was based on the March 11, 2014 five-day weighted average closing price per share of the
Company s Common Stock of $6.00. On September 30, 2016 and 2015, the closing price per share of Common Stock was $6.40 and
$6.41, respectively. Due to fluctuations in the market value of the Company s Common Stock from June 30, 2016 to September
30, 2016, the Company recorded an increase in the fair market value of the warrant liability of $494,596 during the three months
ended September 30, 2016. Due to the fluctuations in the market value of the Company s Common Stock from December 31, 2015
through September 30, 2016, the Company recorded an increase in the fair value of the warrant liability of $666,815 during the
nine months ended September 30, 2016. Due to fluctuations in the market value of the Company s Common Stock from June 30,
2015 to September 30, 2015, the Company recorded a increase in the fair market value of the warrant liability of $771,328 during
the three months ended September 30, 2015. Due to the fluctuations in the market value of the Company s Common Stock from
December 31, 2014 through September 30, 2015, the Company recorded a decrease in the fair value of the warrant liability of $817,578
during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

The assumptions used in connection with the
valuation of warrants issued utilizing the binomial lattice valuation model were as follows:

Loan and Security Agreement:  

On June 30, 2016 (the  Closing Date ),
the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary CytoSorbents Medical, Inc. (together, the  Borrower ), entered into a Loan
and Security Agreement (the  Loan and Security Agreement ) with Bridge Bank, a division of Western Alliance Bank, (the
 Bank ), pursuant to which the Bank agreed to loan up to an aggregate of $10 million to the Company, to be disbursed
in two equal tranches of $5 million (the first tranche, the  Term A Loan , the second tranche, the  Term B Loan ,
and the Term A Loan and Term B Loan together, the  Term Loans ). The Company received the proceeds of the Term A Loan
on June 30, 2016. The proceeds from the Term Loans will be used for working capital purposes and to fund general business requirements
in accordance with the terms of the Loan and Security Agreement. Outstanding balances on the Term Loans bear interest at the thirty
(30) day US dollar LIBOR rate reported in the Wall Street Journal plus 7.75%, adjusted monthly. This rate was 8.24% at September
30, 2016. 

On the Closing Date, the Company was required
to pay a non-refundable closing fee of $50,000 and expenses incurred by the Bank related to the Loan and Security Agreement of
$24,000. In addition, the Company incurred legal expenses related to the Loan and Security Agreement of $44,833. These costs, which
total $118,833, have been presented as a direct deduction from the proceeds of the loan on the consolidated balance sheet in accordance
with the provisions of ASC 850. These costs are being amortized over the loan period as a charge to interest expense. For the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded interest expense amounting to $7,427 related to these costs. After
accounting for the various costs outlined above, the effective interest rate on the Term A Loan was 10.0% as of June 30, 2016.
Commencing on the first calendar day of the calendar month after a Term Loan is made, the Company shall make monthly payments of
interest only during the term of each Term Loan. Commencing on August 1, 2017, if the Term B Loan is not made, the Company shall
make equal monthly payments of principal of $138,889, together with accrued and unpaid interest. Commencing on February 1, 2018,
subject to certain conditions as outlined in the Loan and Security Agreement, if the Term B Loan is made, which is at the Company s
discretion, the Company shall make equal monthly payments of principal of $333,333, together with accrued and unpaid interest.
In either event, all unpaid principal and accrued and unpaid interest shall be due and payable in full on July 1, 2020. In addition,
the Loan and Security Agreement requires the Company to pay a non-refundable final fee equal to 2.5% of the principal amount of
each Term Loan funded upon the earlier of the (i) July 1, 2020 maturity date or (ii) termination of the Term Loan via acceleration
or prepayment. This final fee is being accrued and charged to interest expense over the term of the loan. For the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recorded interest expense of $7,813 related to the final fee. The Term Loans
shall be evidenced by one or more secured promissory notes issued to the Bank by the Company. If the Company elects to prepay the
Term Loan(s) pursuant to the terms of the Loan and Security Agreement, it will owe a prepayment fee to the Bank, as follows: (1)
for a prepayment made on or after the funding date of a Term Loan through and including the first anniversary of such funding date,
an amount equal to 2.0% of the principal amount of such Term Loan prepaid; (2) for a prepayment made after the first anniversary
of the funding date of a Term Loan through and including the second anniversary of such funding date, an amount equal to 1.5% of
the principal amount of such Term Loan prepaid; and (3) for a prepayment made after the second anniversary of the funding date
of a Term Loan through June 30, 2020, an amount equal to 1.0% of the principal amount of such Term Loan prepaid. 

Events of default which may cause repayment
of the Term Loans to be accelerated include, among other customary events of default, (1) non-payment of any obligation when
due, (2) the failure to perform any obligation required under the Loan and Security Agreement and to cure such default within
a reasonable time frame, (3) the occurrence of a Material Adverse Event (as defined in the Loan and Security Agreement), (4) the
attachment or seizure of a material portion of the Borrower s assets if such attachment or seizure is not released, discharged
or rescinded within 10 days, and (5) if the Borrower becomes insolvent or starts an insolvency proceeding or if an insolvency proceeding
is brought by a third party against the Borrower and such proceeding is not dismissed or stayed within 30 days. The Loan and Security
Agreement includes customary loan conditions, Borrower representations and warranties, Borrower affirmative covenants and Borrower
negative covenants for secured transactions of this type. 

The Company s and CytoSorbents Medical,
Inc. s obligations under the Loan and Security Agreement are joint and severable. The obligations under the Loan and Security
Agreement are secured by a first priority security interest in favor of the Bank with respect to the Company s Shares and
the Borrower s Collateral, which definition excludes the Borrower s intellectual property and other customary exceptions. 

Success Fee Letter:   

In connection with the Loan and Security Agreement,
the Borrower simultaneously entered into a Success Fee Letter (the  Letter ) with the Bank. Pursuant to the Letter,
the Borrower shall pay to the Bank a success fee in the amount equal to 6.37% of the funded amount of the Term Loans (the  Success
Fee ) upon the first occurrence of any of the following events (each a  Liquidity Event ): (a) a sale or other
disposition by the Borrower of all or substantially all of its assets; (b) a merger or consolidation of the Borrower into or with
another person or entity, where the holders of the Borrower s outstanding voting equity securities as of immediately prior
to such merger or consolidation hold less than a majority of the issued and outstanding voting equity securities of the successor
or surviving person or entity as of immediately following the consummation of such merger or consolidation; (c) a transaction or
a series of related transactions in which any  person  or  group  (within the meaning of Section 13(d)
and 14(d)(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act )) becomes the  beneficial
owner  (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of a sufficient number of shares of all
classes of stock then outstanding of the Borrower ordinarily entitled to vote in the election of directors, empowering such  person 
or  group  to elect a majority of the Board of Directors of the Borrower, who did not have such power before such transaction;
or (d) the closing price per share for the Company s Common Stock on the NASDAQ Capital Market being $8.00 (after giving
effect to any stock splits or consolidations effected after the date hereof) or more for five successive business days. 

If the Success Fee
is due pursuant to a Liquidity Event described in clause (d) of the definition thereof, the Company may elect, in lieu of paying
the Success Fee in cash, to issue and sell to the Bank, in exchange for the Success Fee, such number of shares of the Company s
Common Stock as would be equal to the quotient (calculated by rounding up the nearest whole number) obtained by dividing (a) the
Success Fee by (b) the volume weighted average price per share of the Company s Common Stock for the same five successive
business days on which the closing price per share of the Company s Common Stock caused the Success Fee to become payable.
The Bank s right to receive the Success Fee and the Borrower s obligation to pay such Success Fee terminate on June
30, 2021, and shall survive the termination of the Loan and Security Agreement and any prepayment of the Term Loans.

Overview   

This discussion of our financial condition
and the results of operations should be read together with the financial statements, including the notes contained elsewhere in
this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and the financial statements, including the notes thereto, contained in our Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, as filed with the SEC on March 9, 2016. 

We are a leader in critical care immunotherapy
commercializing our CytoSorb blood purification technology to reduce deadly uncontrolled inflammation in hospitalized patients
around the world, with the goal of preventing or treating multiple organ failure in life-threatening illnesses. The technology
is based upon biocompatible, highly porous polymer sorbent beads that are capable of extracting unwanted substances from blood
and other bodily fluids. The technology is protected by 32 issued U.S. patents with multiple applications pending both in the U.S.
and internationally. Our intellectual property consists of composition of matter, materials, methods of production, systems incorporating
the technology and multiple medical uses with expiration dates ranging from approximately one to 10 years. The Company has patents
expiring at various dates through 2026 that relate to the current technology. The patents expiring in the next twelve months relate
to technology no longer utilized by the Company. Accordingly, management believes that any expiring patents will not have a significant
impact on our ongoing business. 

In March 2011, our flagship product, CytoSorb,
an extracorporeal cytokine filter indicated for use in clinical situations where cytokines are elevated, received CE mark approval.
The CE Mark demonstrates that a conformity assessment has been carried out and the product complies with the Medical Devices Directive
93/42/EEC in the EU. The goal of CytoSorb is to prevent or treat organ failure by reducing cytokine storm and the potentially deadly
systemic inflammatory response syndrome in diseases such as sepsis, trauma, burn injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome, pancreatitis,
liver failure, and many others. Organ failure is the leading cause of death in the intensive care unit, and remains a major unmet
medical need, with little more than supportive care therapy (e.g., mechanical ventilation, dialysis, vasopressors, fluid support,
etc.) as treatment options. By potentially preventing or treating organ failure, CytoSorb may improve clinical outcome, including
survival, while reducing the need for costly intensive care unit treatment, thereby potentially saving significant healthcare costs. 

Our CE Mark enables CytoSorb to be sold throughout
all 28 countries of the EU and the countries in the European Economic Area. In addition, many countries outside the EU accept CE
Mark approval for medical devices, but may also require registration with or without additional clinical studies. The broad approved
indication enables CytoSorb to be used  on-label  in diseases where cytokines are elevated including, but not limited
to, critical illnesses such as those mentioned above, autoimmune disease flares, cancer cachexia, cytokine release syndrome, and
many other conditions where cytokine-induced inflammation plays a detrimental role. 

As part of the CE Mark approval process, we
completed our randomized, controlled, European Sepsis Trial amongst 14 trial sites in Germany in 2011, with enrollment of 100 patients
with sepsis and respiratory failure. The trial established that CytoSorb was safe in this critically-ill population, and clearance
measurement across the device showed that it was able to broadly clear key cytokines in the blood of these patients. We plan to
conduct larger, prospective studies in septic patients in the future to confirm the European Sepsis Trial findings. 

In addition to CE Mark approval, we also achieved
ISO 13485:2003 Full Quality Systems certification, an internationally recognized quality standard designed to ensure that medical
device manufacturers have the necessary comprehensive management systems in place to safely design, develop, manufacture and distribute
medical devices in the EU. We manufacture CytoSorb at our manufacturing facilities in New Jersey for sale in the EU andin countries
that recognize EU approval. We also established a reimbursement path for CytoSorb in Germany and Austria. 

From September 2011 through June 2012, we began
a controlled market release of CytoSorb in select geographic territories in Germany with the primary goal of preparing for commercialization
of CytoSorb in Germany in terms of manufacturing, reimbursement, logistics, infrastructure, marketing, contacts, and other key
issues. 

In late June 2012, following the establishment
of our European subsidiary, CytoSorbents Europe GmbH, we began the commercial launch of CytoSorb in Germany with the hiring of
Dr. Christian Steiner as Vice President of Sales and Marketing and three additional sales representatives who joined us and completed
their sales training in the third quarter of 2012. The fourth quarter of 2012 represented the first full quarter of direct sales
with the four-person sales team in place. During this period, we expanded our direct sales efforts to include both Austria and
Switzerland. At the end of 2015, we had hundreds of Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs) in our commercialized territories worldwide in critical
care, cardiac surgery, and blood purification who were either using CytoSorb or supporting its use in clinical practice or clinical
trials. 

In March 2016, we established CytoSorbents
Switzerland GmbH, a wholly-owned subsidiary of CytoSorbents Europe GmbH, to conduct marketing and direct sales in Switzerland.
This subsidiary began operations during the second quarter of 2016. 

As of November 1, 2016, our sales force includes
12 direct sales people, one contract sales person and 12 sales support staff. 

We have complemented our direct sales efforts
with sales to distributors and/or corporate partners. In 2013, we reached agreements with distributors in the United Kingdom, Ireland,
Turkey, Russia, and the Netherlands. In 2014, we announced distribution of CytoSorb in the Middle East, including Saudi Arabia,
the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, and Oman (the Gulf Cooperative Council (GCC)) and Yemen, Iraq, and Jordan through
an exclusive agreement with Techno Orbits, and we entered into an exclusive agreement with Smart Medical Solutions S.R.L., to distribute
CytoSorb for critical care applications in Romania and the neighboring Republic of Moldova.  In 2015, we announced exclusive
distribution agreements with Aferetica SRL to distribute CytoSorb in Italy, AlphaMedix Ltd. to distribute CytoSorb in Israel, TekMed
Pty Ltd. to distribute CytoSorb in Australia and New Zealand, and Hoang Long Pharma to distribute CytoSorb in Vietnam. In June
2016, we announced an exclusive distribution agreement with Palex Medical SA to distribute CytoSorb in Spain and Portugal. In September
2016, we announced an exclusive agreement with Armaghan Salamat Kish Group (Arsak) to distribute CytoSorb in Iran. In October 2016,
we announced an exclusive agreement with Foxx Medical Chile SpA to distribute CytoSorb in Chile. 

We have been working to expand the number and
scope of our strategic partnerships. In September 2013, we entered into a strategic partnership with Biocon, Ltd., India s
largest biotech company, with an initial distribution agreement for India and select emerging markets, under which Biocon has the
exclusive commercialization rights for CytoSorb initially focused on sepsis. In September 2014, the Biocon partnership was expanded
to include all critical care applications and cardiac surgery. In addition, Biocon committed to higher minimum purchases of CytoSorb
to maintain distribution exclusivity and to conduct and publish results from multiple investigator-initiated studies and patient
case studies. 

In December 2014, we entered into a multi-country
strategic partnership with Fresenius Medical Care AG   CO KGaA to commercialize the CytoSorb therapy. Under the terms of the
agreement, Fresenius Medical Care has exclusive rights to distribute CytoSorb for critical care applications in France, Poland,
Sweden, Denmark, Norway, and Finland. The partnership will allow Fresenius Medical Care to offer an innovative and easy to use
blood purification therapy for removing cytokines in patients that are treated in the intensive care unit.  To promote the
success of CytoSorb, Fresenius will also engage in the ongoing clinical development of the product. This includes the support and
publication of a number of small case series and patient case reports as well as the potential for future larger, clinical collaborations. 

In September 2016, we entered into a multi-country
strategic partnership with Terumo Cardiovascular Group to commercialize CytoSorb for cardiac surgery applications. Under the terms
of the agreement, Terumo has exclusive rights to distribute the CytoSorb cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) procedure pack for intra-operative
use during cardiac surgery in France, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Finland and Iceland. 

We are currently evaluating other potential
distributor and strategic partner networks in other major countries where we are approved to market the device. 

Concurrent with our commercialization plans,
we intend to conduct or support additional clinical studies in sepsis, cardiac surgery, and other critical care diseases to generate
additional clinical data to expend the scope of clinical experience for marketing purposes, to increase the number of treated patients,
and to support potential future publications. We have completed a single arm, dose ranging trial in Germany amongst several clinical
trial sites to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CytoSorb when used 24 hours per day for seven days, each day with a new device,
and are conducting final statistical analysis of the data. Patients are being stratified for age, cytokine levels, and co-morbid
illnesses in this matched pairs analysis. 

In addition, we now have more than 55 investigator-initiated
studies in various stages, with five completed, 19 in process, and six ready to enroll. These trials, which are funded and supported
by well-known university hospitals and KOLs, are designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CytoSorb in a variety of different
clinical applications, such as the treatment of sepsis, cardiac surgery, trauma, and many other indications, and if successful,
are anticipated to be integral in helping to drive additional usage and adoption of CytoSorb. 

In February 2015, the FDA approved our Investigational
Device Exemption (IDE) application to commence a planned U.S. cardiac surgery feasibility study called REFRESH I (REduction of
FREe Hemoglobin) amongst 20 patients and three U.S. clinical sites. The FDA subsequently approved an amendment to the protocol,
expanding the trial to be a 40 patient randomized controlled study (20 treatment, 20 control) in eight clinical centers. REFRESH
I represents the first part of a larger clinical trial strategy intended to support the approval of CytoSorb in the U.S. for intra-operative
use during cardiac surgery. 

The study is designed to evaluate the safety
of CytoSorb when used intra-operatively in a heart-lung machine to reduce plasma free hemoglobin and cytokines in patients undergoing
complex cardiac surgery.  The length, complexity and invasiveness of these procedures cause hemolysis and inflammation, leading
to high levels of plasma free hemoglobin, cytokines, activated complement, and other substances.  These inflammatory mediators
directly correlate with the incidence of serious post-operative complications such as kidney injury and failure.  The goal
of CytoSorb is to actively remove these inflammatory and toxic substances as they are being generated during the surgery and reduce
complications. As of September 30, 2016, enrollment was complete with 46 patients and with a target of approximately 40 patients
who had completed all aspects of the study. 

The primary safety and efficacy endpoints of
the study were the assessment of serious device related adverse events and the change in plasma free hemoglobin levels, respectively.
 On October 5, 2016, the Company announced positive top-line safety data. In addition, following a detailed review of all
reported adverse events in a total of 46 enrolled patients, the independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) found no safety
concerns related to the CytoSorb device, achieving the primary safety endpoint of the trial and fulfilling a key requisite to move
forward with a larger, definitive pivotal study.  In addition, the therapy was well-tolerated and technically feasible, implementing
easily into the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit without the need for an additional external blood pump.  This study represents
the first randomized controlled trial demonstrating the safety of intra-operative CytoSorb use in patients undergoing high risk
cardiac operations. 

The data on plasma free hemoglobin are pending
review by the cardiac surgery advisory board and trial investigators.  Once the analysis of these data and all relevant data
from the trial is finalized, the Company plans to discuss the results with the FDA in anticipation of filing an investigational
device exemption (IDE) application to initiate a pivotal REFRESH 2 trial in early 2017. The Company also plans to submit these
data for formal scientific presentation and future publication. 

The market focus of CytoSorb is prevention
or treatment of organ failure in life-threatening conditions, including commonly seen illnesses in the intensive care unit such
as infection and sepsis, trauma, burn injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and others. Severe sepsis and septic
shock, a potentially life-threatening systemic inflammatory response to a serious infection, accounts for approximately 10% to
20% of all ICU admissions and is one of the largest target markets for CytoSorb. Sepsis is a major unmet medical need with no approved
products in the U.S. or Europe to treat it. As with other critical care illnesses, multiple organ failure is the primary cause
of death in sepsis. When used with standard of care therapy, that includes antibiotics, the goal of CytoSorb in sepsis is to reduce
the excessive levels of cytokines and other inflammatory toxins, to help reduce the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS)
response and either prevent or treat organ failure. 

We intend to conduct or support additional
clinical studies in sepsis, cardiac surgery, and other critical care diseases where CytoSorb could be used, such as ARDS, trauma,
severe burn injury, acute pancreatitis, and other acute conditions that may benefit by the reductions of cytokines in the bloodstream.
Some examples include the prevention of post-operative complications of cardiac surgery (cardiopulmonary bypass surgery) and damage
to organs for transplant prior to organ harvest. We intend to generate additional clinical data to expand the scope of clinical
experience for marketing purposes, to increase the number of treated patients, and to support potential future publications. 

Our proprietary hemocompatible porous polymer
bead technology forms the basis of a broad technology portfolio. Some of our products include: 

CytoSorb   an extracorporeal hemoperfusion cartridge approved in the EU for cytokine removal, with the goal of reducing SIRS and preventing or treating organ failure.   

HemoDefend   a development-stage blood purification technology designed to remove contaminants in blood transfusion products. The goal of HemoDefend is to reduce transfusion reactions and improve the safety of transfused blood products.   

ContrastSorb   a development-stage extracorporeal hemoperfusion cartridge designed to remove IV contrast from the blood of high risk patients undergoing CT imaging with contrast, or interventional radiology procedures such as cardiac catheterization. The goal of ContrastSorb is to prevent contrast-induced nephropathy.   

DrugSorb   a development-stage extracorporeal hemoperfusion cartridge designed to remove toxic chemicals from the blood (e.g., drug overdose, high dose regional chemotherapy).   

Potassium Binder   a development-stage
        extracorporeal hemoperfusion cartridge designed to treat severe hyperkalemia by reducing excessive concentrations of potassium
        in the blood. 

CytoSorb XL   a next generation development-stage extracorporeal hemoperfusion cartridge combining endotoxin (LPS) reduction with reduction of a broad range of cytokines, toxins, and other inflammatory mediators with the goal of reducing SIRS and preventing or treating organ failure.   

BetaSorb   a development-stage extracorporeal hemoperfusion cartridge designed to remove mid-molecular weight toxins, such as  b  2-microglobulin, that standard high-flux dialysis cannot remove effectively. The goal of BetaSorb is to improve the efficacy of dialysis or hemofiltration.   

We have been successful in obtaining technology
development contracts from agencies in the U.S. Department of Defense, including Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA),
the U.S. Army, and the U.S. Air Force. 

In July 2016, we were awarded a Phase I Small
Business Innovation Research (SBIR) contract for its development program entitled  Investigation of a sorbent-based potassium
adsorber for the treatment of hyperkalemia induced by traumatic injury and acute kidney injury in austere conditions . The
objective of this Phase I project is to develop two novel and distinct treatment options for life-threatening hyperkalemia. This
work is being funded by the U.S. Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity (USAMRAA) under contract W81XWH-16-C-0080 and provides
for maximum funding of approximately $150,000. 

In June 2016, we were awarded a Phase I Small

technology for pRBC transfusions. The University of Dartmouth collaborated with us as a subcontractor on the project, entitled
 Elimination of blood contaminants from pRBCs using HemoDefend hemocompatible porous polymer beads.  The overall goal
of this program is to reduce the risk of potential side effects of blood transfusions, and help to extend the useful life of pRBCs.
Our performance under this contract has been completed. 

In June 2013, we announced that the U.S. Air
Force will fund a 30 patient, single site, randomized controlled human pilot study in the United States amongst trauma patients
with rhabdomyolysis. The primary endpoint is myoglobin removal. The FDA approved our IDE application for this study and we also
received ethics committee approval, allowing the study to commence. However, because of the stringency of our inclusion criteria,
and because of the patient mix seen at our single center, we have experienced difficulty in enrolling patients. We have subsequently
modified one of the key inclusion criteria and have expanded the number of clinical trial sites to three in a revised protocol. 

In September 2012, we were awarded a Phase
II SBIR contract by the U.S. Army Medical Research and Material Command to evaluate our technology for the treatment of trauma
and burn injury in large animal models. In 2013, we finalized the Phase II SBIR contract which provided for a maximum funding of
approximately $803,000 with the granting agency. This work is supported by the U.S. Army Medical Research and Material Command
under an amendment to Contract W81XWH-12-C-0038. In June 2016, this contract was further amended to increase the maximum funding
by $443,000 to approximately $1,246,000. As of September 30, 2016, we received approximately $892,000 in funding under this contract
and have approximately $354,000 remaining under this contract. 

In August 2012, we were awarded a $3.8 million,
five-year contract by DARPA for our  Dialysis-Like Therapeutics  (DLT), program to treat sepsis. DARPA has been instrumental
in funding many of the major technological and medical advances since its inception in 1958, including development of the Internet,
development of GPS, and robotic surgery. The DLT program in sepsis seeks to develop a therapeutic blood purification device that
is capable of identifying the cause of sepsis (e.g., cytokines, toxins, pathogens, activated cells) and remove these substances
in an intelligent, automated, and efficient manner. Our contract is for advanced technology development of our hemocompatible porous
polymer technologies to remove cytokines and a number of pathogen and biowarfare toxins from blood. We are in Year 5 of the program
and are currently working with the systems integrator, Battelle Laboratories, and its subcontractor NxStage Medical, who are responsible
for integrating the technology developed by us and others into a final medical device design prototype, and evaluating this device
in septic animals and eventually in human clinical trials in sepsis. Our work is supported by DARPA and SSC Pacific under Contract
No. N66001-12-C-4199. In June 2016, this contract was amended to change the maximum funding to approximately $3,825,000. As of
September 30, 2016, we have received approximately $3,696,000 in funding under this contract and have approximately $129,000 remaining

Results of Operations  

Comparison for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015:   

Revenues:    

Revenue from product sales was approximately
$2,143,000 in the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to approximately $1,071,000 in the three months ended September
30, 2015, an increase of approximately $1,072,000, or 100%. This increase was largely driven by an increase in direct sales from
both new customers and repeat orders from existing customers, along with an increase in distributor sales. 

Grant income was approximately $269,000 for
the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to approximately $272,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015,
a decrease of approximately $3,000, or 1%. 

As a result of the increase in product sales,
for the three months ended September 30, 2016, we generated total revenue of approximately $2,412,000, as compared to total revenue
of approximately $1,344,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of approximately $1,068,000, or 79%. 

Cost of Revenue:   

For the three months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015, cost of revenue was approximately $964,000 and $639,000, respectively, an increase of approximately $325,000. Product
cost of revenues increased approximately $283,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three months
ended September 30, 2015 due to increased sales. Product gross margins increased to approximately 68% for the three months ended
September 30, 2016, as compared to approximately 63% for the three months ended September 30, 2015 due to a favorable mix of sales
prices. Grant income related expenses decreased by approximately $50,000 during the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared
to the three months ended September 30, 2015. 

Research and Development Expenses   :  

For the three months ended September 30, 2016,
research and development expenses were approximately $1,172,000, as compared to research and development expenses of approximately
$866,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of approximately $306,000. This increase was due to an increase
in costs related to the various clinical studies, primarily due to our REFRESH 1 trial costs, of approximately $386,000 and a decrease
in direct labor and other costs being deployed toward grant-funded activities of approximately $50,000, which had the effect of
increasing the amount of our non-reimbursable research and development costs. These increases were offset by decreases in patent
related costs of approximately $13,000, decreases in non-grant related supplies of approximately $72,000 and decreases in other
research and development costs of approximately $45,000. 

Legal, Financial and Other Consulting Expense:   

Legal, financial and other consulting
expenses were approximately $279,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to approximately $289,000 for
the three months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of approximately $10,000. This decrease was due to a decrease in
employment agency fees of approximately $58,000 relating to 2015 fees incurred from the hiring of senior level
personnel that did not recur in 2016 and a decrease in legal fees of approximately $25,000. This decrease was offset by an
increase in accounting fees of approximately $20,000 due to fees incurred related to the audit of our internal controls as
required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and an increase in consulting fees of approximately $53,000. 

Selling, General and Administrative Expense:   

Selling, general and administrative expenses
were approximately $2,141,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to approximately $1,700,000 for the three
months ending September 30, 2015, an increase of approximately $441,000. This increase was due to an increase in salaries and related
costs of approximately $348,000 resulting from headcount additions, commissions, and personnel related costs, an increase in royalty
expenses of approximately $73,000 due to the increase in sales, an increase in travel and entertainment costs and other expenses
of approximately $50,000 due to the increased activity and an increase in stock-based compensation of approximately $25,000 due
to the number of employees receiving options during the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three months ended
September 30, 2015. These increases were offset by a decrease in stock exchange listing and stock transfer fees of approximately
$15,000 which were incurred in connection with our public offering in 2015 that did not recur in 2016, a decrease in public relations
fees of approximately $17,000 and decreases in other general and administrative costs of approximately $23,000. 

Interest Income (Expense):   

For the three months ended September 30, 2016,
interest expense amounted to approximately $117,000 as compared to interest income of approximately $3,000 for the three months
ended September 30, 2015. This increase in expense of approximately $120,000 is directly related to interest expense incurred and
amortization of loan acquisition costs related to the Company s financing facility with Bridge Bank on which $5,000,000 was
drawn on June 30, 2016. 

Gain (Loss) on Foreign Currency Transactions:   

For the three months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015, the gain on foreign currency transactions was approximately $73,000 and $71,000, respectively. The gain for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 is directly related to the increase in the exchange rate of the Euro at September 30, 2016 as compared
to June 30, 2016. The exchange rate of the Euro to the U.S. dollar was $1.12 per Euro at September 30, 2016 as compared to $1.11
per Euro at June 30, 2016. The gain for the three months ended September 30, 2015 is directly related to the increase in the exchange
rate of the Euro at September 30, 2015 as compared to June 30, 2015. The exchange rate of the Euro to the U.S. dollar was $1.12
per Euro at September 30, 2015 as compared to $1.11 per Euro at June 30, 2015.  

Change in Warrant Liability:   

We recognize warrants as liabilities at their
fair value on the date of the grant because of price adjustment provisions in the warrants, then measure the fair value of the
warrants on each reporting date, and record a change to the warrant liability as appropriate. The change in warrant liability resulted
in other expense of approximately $495,000 and $771,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The
change in warrant liability was a result of the change in the fair value of the warrant liability from June 30, 2016 to September
30, 2016 and from June 30, 2015 to September 30, 2015. See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for details related
to the calculation of the fair value of the warrant liability. 

Comparison for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015:   

Revenues:    

Revenue from product sales was approximately
$5,593,000 in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to approximately $2,548,000 in the nine months ended September
30, 2015, an increase of approximately $3,045,000, or 120%. This increase was largely driven by an increase in direct sales from
both new customers and repeat orders from existing customers, along with an increase in distributor sales. 

Grant income was approximately $851,000 for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to approximately $470,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, an
increase of approximately $381,000, or 81%. This increase was a result of revenue recognized from new grants and billable milestones
achieved on existing grants. 

As a result of the increases in both product
sales and grant income, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we generated total revenue of approximately $6,444,000, as
compared to total revenue of approximately $3,031,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of approximately
$3,413,000, or 113%. 

Cost of Revenue:   

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015, cost of revenue was approximately $2,657,000 and $1,409,000, respectively, an increase of approximately $1,248,000. Product
cost of revenues increased approximately $917,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the nine months
ended September 30, 2015 due to increased sales. Product gross margins were approximately 66% for the nine months ended September
30, 2016, as compared to approximately 62% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 due to a favorable mix of sales prices.
Grant income related expenses increased due to direct labor and other costs being deployed toward grant-funded activities, an increase
of approximately $239,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

Research and Development Expenses   :  

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
research and development expenses were approximately $3,120,000, as compared to research and development expenses of approximately
$2,619,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of approximately $501,000. This increase was due to an increase
in costs related to the various clinical studies, primarily due to our REFRESH 1 trial costs, of approximately $883,000. The increase
was offset by an increase in direct labor and other costs being deployed toward grant-funded activities of approximately $239,000,
which had the effect of decreasing the amount of our non-reimbursable research and development costs, decreases in patent related
costs of approximately $95,000, decreases in non-grant related supplies of approximately $41,000 and decreases in other research
and development costs of approximately $7,000. 

Legal, Financial and Other Consulting
Expense:   

Legal, financial and other consulting expenses
were approximately $853,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to approximately $802,000 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015. The increase of approximately $51,000 was due to an increase in accounting and auditing fees of approximately
$81,000 due to fees incurred related to the audit of our internal controls as required by The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and increases
in consulting fees of approximately $81,000. These increases were offset by a decrease in employment agency fees of approximately
$111,000 related to fees incurred in 2015 related to the hiring of senior level personnel that did not recur in 2016. 

Selling, General and Administrative Expense:   

Selling, general and administrative expenses
were approximately $6,736,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to approximately $4,842,000 for the nine
months ending September 30, 2015, an increase of $1,894,000. The increase in selling, general, and administrative expenses was
due to an increase in salaries, commissions and related costs of approximately $1,095,000 due to headcount additions and personnel
related costs, an increase in royalty expenses of approximately $211,000 due to the increase in sales, additional sales and marketing
costs, which include advertising, and conferences of approximately $125,000, an increase in travel and entertainment and other
costs of approximately $126,000 due to the increased volume and an increase in stock-based compensation of approximately $422,000
due to 2015 milestone options awarded to the Company s employees and restricted stock units awarded to the Company s
executive staff during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. These increases were offset by a decrease in stock exchange listing
and stock transfer fees of approximately $35,000 related to fees incurred in 2015 related to our public offering that did not recur
in 2016 and a decrease in public relations fees of approximately $50,000. 

Interest Income (Expense):   

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
interest expense amounted to approximately $112,000 as compared to interest income of approximately $9,000 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015. This increase in expense of approximately $121,000 is directly related to interest expense incurred and
amortization of loan acquisition costs related to the Company s financing facility with Bridge Bank on which $5,000,000 was
drawn on June 30, 2016. 

Gain (Loss) on Foreign Currency Transactions:   

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
the gain on foreign currency transactions was approximately $176,000, as compared to a loss of approximately $316,000 for the nine
months ended September 30, 2015. The 2016 gain is directly related to the increase in the exchange rate of the Euro at September
30, 2016 as compared to December 31, 2015. The exchange rate of the Euro to the U.S. dollar was $1.12 per Euro at September 30,
2016 as compared to $1.08 per Euro at December 31, 2015. The 2015 loss is directly related to the decrease in the exchange rate
of the Euro at September 30, 2015 as compared to December 31, 2014. The exchange rate of the Euro to the U.S. dollar was $1.12
per Euro at September 30, 2015, as compared to $1.22 per Euro at December 31, 2014. 

Change in Warrant Liability:   

We recognize warrants as liabilities at their
fair value on the date of the grant because of price adjustment provisions in the warrants, then measure the fair value of the
warrants on each reporting date, and record a change to the warrant liability as appropriate. The change in warrant liability resulted
in other expense of approximately $667,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, and other income of approximately $818,000
for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The change in warrant liability was a result of the change in the fair value of the
warrant liability from December 31, 2015 to September 30, 2016 and from December 31, 2014 to September 30, 2015. See Note 4 to
the consolidated financial statements for details related to the calculation of the fair value of the warrant liability. 

History of Operating Losses:   

We have experienced substantial operating losses
since inception. As of September 30, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $140,050,000 which included losses of
approximately $7,524,000 and $6,130,000 for the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Historically,
losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in the research and development of our polymer technology, clinical studies,
and general and administrative expenses. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

Since inception, our operations have been primarily
financed through the private placement of debt and equity securities. At September 30, 2016, we had current assets of approximately
$9,053,000 including cash on hand of approximately $6,375,000, and current liabilities of approximately $4,999,000. We do not have
sufficient cash to fund our operations for the next twelve months. We will need to raise additional capital to fully fund our operations,
including our planned clinical trials in the United States and/or Germany. In addition, we will require additional capital to support
our sales and marketing efforts, to fund clinical studies, to expand our production capacity, to further develop our products,
and for general working capital purposes. We are evaluating a broad range of financing options. 

Contractual Obligations   

In June 2016, the Company entered into an amended
and restated Fourteenth Amendment to Lease Agreement with Princeton Corporate Plaza, LLC (the Landlord), which extended the term
of the Company s lease for its corporate headquarters and manufacturing facility through May 31, 2018 and, effective August
1, 2016, increases the Company s space to approximately 12,900 square feet and the Company s rent obligation to $24,756
per month. In return, the Landlord has agreed to make certain improvements to the property. The lease amendment also provides the
Company with an option to extend the term of the lease for an additional one year period through May 31, 2019 upon certain conditions. 

In September 2016, the Company entered into
a five year lease agreement with Klimik GmbH for 600 square meters of office and warehouse space for its wholly-owned subsidiary
CytoSorbents Europe GmbH. The lease, which commenced on September 1, 2016, has a rent obligation of $6,664 per month. The lease
expires on August 31, 2021. The lease also provides the Company with an option to extend the term of the lease for an additional
five year period through August 31, 2026. 

The following table summarizes our obligations with regard to our
contractual obligations as of September 30, 2016, and the expected timing of maturities of those contractual obligations. 

Off-balance Sheet Arrangements  

We have no off-balance sheet arrangements. 

Going Concern  

The accompanying consolidated financial statements
have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the
normal course of business. We do not have adequate funding for more than the next 12 months of operations. We will have to raise
additional capital to fund our future operations. 

As of September 30, 2016, we had an accumulated
deficit of approximately $140,050,000, which included net losses of approximately $7,524,000 for the nine months ended September
30, 2016, and $6,130,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. In part due to these losses, our audited consolidated financial
statements were prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern, and the auditors  report on those financial statements
expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our losses have resulted principally from costs incurred
in the research and development of our polymer technology and selling, general and administrative expenses. We intend to continue
to conduct significant additional research, development, and clinical study activities which, together with expenses incurred for
the establishment of manufacturing arrangements and a marketing and distribution presence, and other selling, general and administrative
expenses, are expected to result in continuing operating losses for the foreseeable future. The amount of future losses and when,
if ever, we will achieve profitability are uncertain. Our ability to achieve profitability will depend, among other things, on
continued adoption and usage of our products in the market, successfully completing the development of our technology and commercial
products, obtaining additional regulatory approvals in markets not covered by the CE Mark and for potential label extensions of
our current CE Mark, satisfactory reimbursement in key territories, establishing manufacturing and sales and marketing arrangements
with third parties, and raising sufficient funds to finance our activities. No assurance can be given that our product development
efforts will be successful, that our current CE Mark will enable us to achieve profitability, that additional regulatory approvals
in other countries will be obtained, that reimbursement will be available or satisfactory, that any of our products will be manufactured
at a competitive cost and will be of acceptable quality, or that the we will be able to achieve profitability or that profitability,
if achieved, can be sustained. These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the outcome of
this uncertainty. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
Risk.  

We are exposed to certain market risks in the
ordinary course of business. These risks result primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. In
addition, international operations are subject to risks related to differing economic conditions, changes in political climate,
differing tax structures and other regulations and restrictions. 

To date we have not utilized derivative financial
instruments or derivative commodity instruments. We do not expect to employ these or other strategies to hedge market risk in the
foreseeable future. Cash is held in checking, savings, and money market funds, which are subject to minimal credit and market risk.
We divide sales among both dollars and euros. In addition, should sales decline due to foreign currency changes, expenses related
to our European subsidiary would also decline. Both of these produce a natural currency hedge. We believe that the market risks
associated with these financial instruments are immaterial, although there can be no guarantee that these market risks will be
immaterial to us. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures  

We maintain disclosure
controls and procedures designed to ensure information required to be disclosed in our reports filed under the Exchange Act is
recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Disclosure
controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed
under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial
Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Our management, with
the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls
and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act ) as of the end of the period covered by this
report. Based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls
and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report are functioning effectively to provide reasonable assurance that
the information required to be disclosed by us in reports filed under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management,
including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosures.
A controls system, no matter how well designed and operated, cannot provide absolute assurance that the objectives of the controls
system are met, and no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if
any, within a company have been detected. 

No change in our internal
control over financial reporting occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2016 that has materially affected, or is
reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION  

Item 1. Legal Proceedings  

We are from time to time subject to claims
and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. We intend to defend vigorously against any future claims and litigation.
We and our subsidiaries are not currently a party to any legal proceedings. 

Item 1A. Risk Factors  

Described below are various risks and uncertainties
that may affect our business. These risks and uncertainties are not the only ones we face. You should recognize that other significant
risks and uncertainties may arise in the future, which we cannot foresee at this time. Also, the risks that we now foresee might
affect us to a greater or different degree than expected. Certain risks and uncertainties, including ones that we currently deem
immaterial or that are similar to those faced by other companies in our industry or business in general, may also affect our business.
If any of the risks described below actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially
and adversely affected.    

Risks Related to our Business and Industry  

We have a history of losses and expect
to incur substantial future losses, and the report of our auditor on our consolidated financial statements expresses substantial
doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern  . 

We have experienced substantial operating losses
since inception. As of September 30, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $140,050,000, which included net losses
of approximately $7,524,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and $6,130,000 for the nine months ended September 30,
2015. In part due to these losses, our audited consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming we will continue as
a going concern, and the auditors  report on those financial statements express substantial doubt about our ability to continue
as a going concern. Our losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in the research and development of our polymer technology
and general and administrative expenses. We intend to conduct significant additional research, development, and clinical study
activities which, together with expenses incurred for the establishment of manufacturing arrangements and a marketing and distribution
presence and other general and administrative expenses, are expected to result in continuing operating losses for the foreseeable
future. The amount of future losses and when, if ever, we will achieve profitability are uncertain. Our ability to achieve profitability
will depend, among other things, on continued adoption and usage of our products in the market ,obtaining additional regulatory
approvals in markets not covered by the CE Mark, establishing sales and marketing arrangements with third parties, satisfactory
reimbursement in key territories, and raising sufficient funds to finance our activities. No assurance can be given that our product
development efforts will be successful, that our current CE Mark will enable us to achieve profitability, that additional regulatory
approvals in other countries will be obtained, that any of our products will be manufactured at a competitive cost and will be
of acceptable quality, that reimbursement will be available or satisfactory, that we will be able to achieve profitability or that
profitability, if achieved, can be sustained, or our ability to raise additional capital when needed or on terms acceptable to
us. Our failure with respect to any or all of the matters would have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results,
financial condition and prospects. 

We will require additional capital in
the future to fund our operations.    

As of September 30, 2016, we had current assets
of approximately $9,053,000, including cash on hand of approximately $6,375,000 and current liabilities of approximately $4,999,000.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, our cash burn was approximately $6.6 million. Our current and historical cash burn
is not necessarily indicative of our future use of cash and cash equivalents. 

We will require additional financing in the
future in order to complete additional clinical studies and to support the commercialization of our proposed products. There can
be no assurance that we will be successful in our capital raising efforts. Our long-term capital requirements are expected to depend
on many factors, including: 

continued progress and cost of our research and development programs;   

progress with pre-clinical studies and clinical studies;   

the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory clearance in other countries and/or for other
indications;   

costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending and enforcing patent claims;   

costs of developing sales, marketing and distribution channels;   

market acceptance and reimbursement of our products; and   

cost for training physicians and other health care personnel.   

We have a $100 million shelf registration in
effect with the SEC which enables us to raise up to $100 million in equity financing. We entered into a Controlled Equity Offering SM 
Sales Agreement with Cantor Fitzgerald   Co. in November 2015 for the offer and sale of up to an aggregate of $25,000,000 of
shares of our common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the Common Stock ). In addition, we entered into a Loan and Security
Agreement with Bridge Bank, a division of Western Alliance Bank, to provide up to an aggregate of $10,000,000 to the Company. We
expect we will require additional financing, and should the financing we require be unavailable or on terms unacceptable to us
when we require it, the consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition
and prospects. 

In addition, in the event that additional funds
are obtained through arrangements with collaborative partners or other sources, we may have to relinquish economic and/or proprietary
rights to some of our technologies or products under development that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize by ourselves. 

Although historically we have been a
research and development company, we are in the process of commercializing our products. There can be no assurance that we will
be successful in developing and expanding commercial operations or balancing our research and development activities with our commercialization
activities   .  

We have historically been engaged primarily
in research and development activities and have generated limited revenues to date. With the launch of our CytoSorb product in
the EU and abroad, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully manage the balance of our research and development
operations with our planned commercial enterprise. Potential investors should be aware of the problems, delays, expenses and difficulties
frequently encountered by an enterprise in balancing development, which include unanticipated problems relating to testing, product
registration, regulatory compliance and manufacturing, with commercialization, which includes problems with market adoption, reimbursement,
marketing problems and additional costs. Our products and product candidates will require significant additional research and testing,
and we will need to overcome significant regulatory burdens prior to commercialization in other countries, such as the U.S., and
for ongoing compliance for our CE Mark. We will also need to raise significant additional funds to complete additional clinical
studies and obtain regulatory approvals in other countries before we can begin selling our products in markets not covered by our
CE Mark. In addition, we may be required to spend significant funds on building out our commercial operations. There can be no
assurance that after the expenditure of substantial funds and efforts, we will successfully develop and commercialize any products,
generate any significant revenues or ever achieve and maintain a substantial level of sales of our products.  

If users of our products are unable
to obtain adequate reimbursement from third-party payers, or if reimbursement is not available in specific countries, or if new
restrictive legislation is adopted, market acceptance of our products may be limited and we may not achieve anticipated revenues.   

The continuing efforts of government and
insurance companies, health maintenance organizations and other payers of healthcare costs to contain or reduce costs of health
care may affect our future revenues and profitability, the future revenues and profitability of our potential customers, suppliers
and collaborative partners, and the availability of capital. For example, in certain foreign markets, pricing or profitability
of medical devices is subject to government control. In the United States, given recent federal and state government initiatives
directed at lowering the total cost of health care, the U.S. Congress and state legislatures will likely continue to focus on health
care reform, the cost of medical devices and on the reform of the Medicare and Medicaid systems. While we cannot predict whether
any such legislative or regulatory proposals will be adopted, the announcement or adoption of these proposals could materially
harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

Our ability to commercialize our products
will depend in part on the extent to which appropriate reimbursement levels for the cost of our products and related treatment
are obtained by governmental authorities, private health insurers and other organizations, such as health maintenance organizations
(HMOs). Third-party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical care. Also, the trend toward managed health
care in the United States and the concurrent growth of organizations such as HMOs, which could control or significantly influence
the purchase of health care services and medical devices, as well as legislative proposals to reform health care or reduce government
insurance programs, may all result in lower prices for our products. The cost containment measures that health care payers and
providers are instituting and the effect of any health care reform could materially harm our ability to operate profitably. 

Outside of the United States, reimbursement
systems vary significantly by country. Many foreign markets often have a combination of government-managed and privately-managed
healthcare systems that govern reimbursement for medical devices and related procedures. Socialized medicine is common in the EU,
and reimbursement and the pricing of medical devices is often subject to governmental control. Application for reimbursement, subsequent
approvals, if any, and pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after a device has been CE
marked. Private insurance has similar challenges. CytoSorb is currently reimbursed in Germany under government-funded insurance,
and in other countries may be covered under the diagnosis related group (DRG), or  lump sum payment  reimbursement,
or other generalized reimbursement for acute care medical products. We are continuously working to obtain or improve upon the type
and amount of reimbursement available to us in countries where CytoSorb is available, and as we attempt to move from an existing
reimbursement platform to a new reimbursement platform, we may experience interruptions and/or reductions in the amount available
for reimbursement. Because of this, there can be no assurance that new reimbursement will be obtained or that existing reimbursement
will continue or that such reimbursement will be sufficient to adequately cover the cost of the device or treatment. As a result,
our future revenues, profitability and access to capital may be negatively affected by any interruption or reduction in amounts
of reimbursement. We plan to seek reimbursement for our product in other EU and non-EU countries to help further adoption. There
can be no assurance when, or if, this additional reimbursement might be approved. 

We depend upon key personnel who
may terminate their employment with us at any time.   

As of November 1, 2016 we have 66 full-time
employees and several temporary employees. Our success will depend to a significant degree upon the continued services of our key
management team and advisors, including, Dr. Phillip Chan, our Chief Executive Officer; Kathleen P. Bloch, our Chief Financial
Officer; Vincent Capponi, our Chief Operating Officer and Dr. Robert Bartlett, our Chief Medical Officer, who works with us on
a consulting basis. Although these individuals have long-term employment and consulting agreements, there can be no assurance that
key management personnel or other members of our management team and advisors will continue to provide services to us. In addition,
our success will depend on our ability to attract and retain other highly skilled personnel. We may be unable to recruit such personnel
on a timely basis, if at all. Management and other employees may voluntarily terminate their employment with us at any time. The
loss of services of key personnel, or the inability to attract and retain additional qualified personnel, could result in delays
in development or approval of our products, loss of sales and diversion of management resources.  

Our Chief Medical Officer works with
us on a consulting basis.   

Our Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Robert Bartlett,
works with us on a consulting basis. Because of the part time nature of his consulting agreement, Dr. Bartlett may not always be
available to provide us with his services when needed by us in a timely manner. 

Acceptance of our medical devices
in the marketplace is uncertain, and failure to achieve market acceptance will prevent or delay our ability to generate revenues.   

Our future financial performance will depend,
at least in part, upon the introduction and customer acceptance of our products. Even with CE Mark approval for our CytoSorb device
as a cytokine filter, our products and product candidates may not achieve market acceptance in the countries that recognize and
accept the CE Mark. Additional approvals from other regulatory authorities (such as the FDA) will be required before we can market
our device in countries not covered by the CE Mark. There is no guarantee that we will be able to achieve additional regulatory
approvals, and even if we do, our products may not achieve market acceptance in the countries covered by such approvals. The degree
of market acceptance will depend upon a number of factors, including: 

the receipt of regulatory clearance of marketing claims for the uses that we are developing;   

the establishment and demonstration of the advantages, safety and efficacy of our polymer technology;   

pricing and reimbursement policies of government and third-party payers such as insurance companies, health maintenance organizations and other health plan administrators;   

our ability to attract corporate partners, including medical device companies, to assist in commercializing our products; and   

our ability to effectively market our products.   

Physicians, patients, payers or the medical
community in general may be unwilling to accept, utilize or recommend any of our products. Approval of our CytoSorb device as a
cytokine filter as well as the data we have gathered in our clinical studies to support device usage in this indication may not
be sufficient for market acceptance in the medical community. We may also need to conduct additional clinical studies to gather
additional data for marketing purposes. If we are unable to obtain regulatory approval or commercialize and market our products
when planned, we may not achieve any market acceptance or generate revenue. 

If we are unable to obtain and maintain
patent protection for our products and product candidates, or if the scope of the patent protection obtained is not sufficiently
broad, our competitors could develop and commercialize products and product candidates similar or identical to ours, and our ability
to successfully commercialize our products and product candidates may be adversely affected.   

Our commercial success will depend, in
part, on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection in the United States and other countries with respect to our products
and product candidates. We seek to protect our proprietary position by filing patent applications in the United States and abroad
related to our products and product candidates that are important to our business. We cannot be certain that patents will be issued
or granted with respect to applications that are currently pending or that we apply for in the future with respect to one or more
of our products and product candidates, or that issued or granted patents will not later be found to be invalid and/or unenforceable. 

The patent prosecution process is expensive
and time-consuming, and we may not be able to file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable
cost or in a timely manner. It is also possible that we will fail to identify patentable aspects of our research and development
output before it is too late to obtain patent protection. Although we enter into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements
with parties who have access to patentable aspects of our research and development output, such as our employees, distribution
partners, consultants, advisors and other third parties, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose such output
before a patent application is filed, thereby jeopardizing our ability to seek patent protection. 

The patent position of medical device companies
generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions and has in recent years been the subject of much litigation.
As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our patent rights are highly uncertain. Our
pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued, and even if issued, the patents may not meaningfully
protect our products or product candidates, effectively prevent competitors and third parties from commercializing competitive
products or otherwise provide us with any competitive advantage. Our competitors or other third parties may be able to circumvent
our patents by developing similar or alternative products in a non-infringing manner. 

Changes in the patent laws, implementing
regulations or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States and other countries may also diminish the value of our patents
or narrow the scope of our patent protection.  The laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent
as the laws of the United States, and many companies have encountered significant difficulties in protecting and defending such
rights in foreign jurisdictions. 

We cannot be certain that our patents and
patent rights will be effective in protecting our products, product candidates and technologies. In addition, certain of our
existing patents expire over the next one to 10 years. Failure to protect such assets may have a material adverse effect on our
business, operations, financial condition and prospects.  

We may face litigation from third
parties claiming that our products infringe on their intellectual property rights, or seek to challenge the validity of our patents.   

Our future success is also dependent in
part on the strength of our intellectual property, trade secrets and know-how, which have been developed from years of research
and development. In addition to the  Purolite  litigation discussed below, we may be exposed to additional future litigation
by third parties seeking to challenge the validity of our rights based on claims that our technologies, products or activities
infringe the intellectual property rights of others or are invalid, or that we have misappropriated the trade secrets of others. 

Since our inception, we have sought to
contract with large, established manufacturers to supply commercial quantities of our adsorbent polymers. As a result, we have
disclosed, under confidentiality agreements, various aspects of our technology with potential manufacturers. We believe that these
disclosures, while necessary for our business, have resulted in the attempt by potential suppliers to improperly assert ownership
claims to our technology in an attempt to gain an advantage in negotiating manufacturing rights. 

We have previously engaged in discussions
with the Brotech Corporation and its affiliate, Purolite International, Inc. (collectively referred to as Purolite), which had
demonstrated a strong interest in being our polymer manufacturer. For a period of time beginning in December 1998, Purolite engaged
in efforts to develop and optimize the manufacturing process needed to produce our polymer products on a commercial scale. However,
the parties eventually decided not to proceed. In 2003, Purolite filed a lawsuit against us asserting, among other things, co-ownership
and co-inventorship of certain of our patents. On September 1, 2006, the United States District Court for the Eastern District
of Pennsylvania approved a Stipulated Order and Settlement Agreement under which we and Purolite agreed to the settlement of the
action. The Settlement Agreement provides us with the exclusive right to use our patented technology and proprietary know how relating
to adsorbent polymers for a period of 18 years. Under the terms of the Settlement Agreement, we have agreed to pay Purolite royalties
of 2.5% to 5% on the sale of certain of our products if and when those products are sold commercially. 

Several years ago we engaged in discussions
with the Dow Chemical Company, which had indicated a strong interest in being our polymer manufacturer. After a Dow representative
on our Advisory Board resigned, Dow filed and received several patents naming our former Advisory Board member as an inventor.
In management s view, the Dow patents improperly incorporate our technology and should not have been granted to Dow. The
existence of these Dow patents could result in a potential dispute with Dow in the future. In the event such a dispute arises,
we may be forced to spend significant time and resources to defending our position. There can be no assurances that such efforts
will be successful and not have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects. 

The expiration or loss of patent protection may adversely
affect our future revenues and operating earnings.    

We rely on patent, trademark, trade secret
and other intellectual property protection in the discovery, development, manufacturing, and sale of our products and product candidates.
In particular, patent protection is important in the development and eventual commercialization of our products and product candidates.
Patents covering our products and product candidates normally provide market exclusivity, which is important in order for our products
and product candidates to become profitable. 

Certain of our patents will expire in the
next one to ten years. While we are seeking additional patent coverage which may protect the technology underlying these patents,
there can be no assurances that such additional patent protection will be granted, or if granted, that these patents will not be
infringed upon or otherwise held enforceable. Even if we are successful in obtaining a patent, patents have a limited lifespan.
In the United States, the natural expiration of a utility patent typically is generally 20 years after it is filed. Various extensions
may be available; however, the life of a patent, and the protection it affords, is limited. Without patent protection for our products
and product candidates, we may be open to competition from generic versions of such methods and devices. 

We have commenced the process of
seeking regulatory approvals of our products and product candidates, but the approval process involves lengthy and costly clinical
studies and is, in large part, not in our control. The failure to obtain government approvals, internationally or domestically,
for our products and product candidates, or to comply with ongoing governmental regulations could prevent, delay or limit introduction
or sale of our products and result in the failure to achieve revenues or maintain our operations.   

CytoSorb has already achieved EU regulatory
approval under the CE Mark and the Medical Devices Directive. It is manufactured at our manufacturing facility in New Jersey under
ISO 13485 Full Quality Systems certification. The manufacturing and marketing of our products will be subject to extensive and
rigorous government regulation in the European market, the U.S., in various states and in other foreign countries. In the U.S.
and other countries, the process of obtaining and maintaining required regulatory approvals is lengthy, expensive, and uncertain.
There can be no assurance that we will ever obtain the necessary additional approvals to sell our products in the United States
or other non EU countries. Even if we do ultimately receive FDA approval for any of our products, we will be subject to extensive
ongoing regulation. While we have received approval from our Notified Body to apply the CE Mark to our CytoSorb device, we will
be subject to extensive ongoing regulation and auditing requirements to maintain the CE Mark.  

Our products will be subject to international
regulation as medical devices under the Medical Devices Directive. In Europe, which we expect to provide the initial market for
our products, the Notified Body and Competent Authority govern, where applicable, development, clinical studies, labeling, manufacturing,
registration, notification, clearance or approval, marketing, distribution, record keeping, and reporting requirements for medical
devices. Different regulatory requirements may apply to our products depending on how they are categorized by the Notified Body
under these laws. Current international regulations classify our CytoSorb device as a Class IIb device. Even though we have received
CE Mark certification of the CytoSorb device, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to comply with the required
annual auditing requirements or other international regulatory requirements that may be applicable. In addition, there can be no
assurance that government regulations applicable to our products or the interpretation of those regulations will not change. The
extent of potentially adverse government regulation that might arise from future legislation or administrative action cannot be
predicted. There can be no assurances that reimbursement will be granted or that additional clinical data will be required to establish
reimbursement. 

We have conducted limited clinical
studies of our CytoSorb device. Clinical and pre-clinical data is susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit
or prevent additional regulatory clearances.   

To date, we have conducted limited clinical
studies on our CytoSorb product. There can be no assurance that we will successfully complete additional clinical studies necessary
to receive additional regulatory approvals in markets not covered by the CE Mark. While studies conducted by us and others have
produced results we believe to be encouraging and indicative of the potential efficacy of our products and technology, data already
obtained, or in the future obtained, from pre-clinical studies and clinical studies do not necessarily predict the results that
will be obtained from later pre-clinical studies and clinical studies. Moreover, pre-clinical and clinical data are susceptible
to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent additional regulatory approvals. A number of companies in the medical
device and pharmaceutical industries have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical studies, even after promising results
in earlier studies. The failure to adequately demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of an intended product under development
could delay or prevent regulatory clearance of the device, resulting in delays to commercialization, and could materially harm
our business. Even though we have received approval to apply the CE Mark to our CytoSorb device as a cytokine filter, there can
be no assurance that we will be able to receive approval for other potential applications of CytoSorb, or that we will receive
regulatory clearance from other targeted regions or countries. 

We rely extensively on research and
testing facilities at various universities and institutions, which could adversely affect us should we lose access to those facilities.   

Although we have our own research laboratories
and clinical facilities, we collaborate with numerous institutions, universities and commercial entities to conduct research and
studies of our products. We currently maintain a good working relationship with these parties. However, should the situation change,
the cost and time to establish or locate alternative research and development facilities could be substantial and delay gaining
CE Mark for other potential applications of our products, our other product candidates or technologies, and/or FDA approval and
commercializing our products. 

We are and will be exposed to product
liability risks, and clinical and preclinical liability risks, which could place a substantial financial burden upon us should
we be sued.   

Our business exposes us to potential product
liability and other liability risks that are inherent in the testing, manufacturing and marketing of medical devices. We cannot
be sure that claims will not be asserted against us. A successful liability claim or series of claims brought against us could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 

We cannot give assurances that we will
be able to continue to obtain or maintain adequate product liability insurance on acceptable terms, if at all, or that such insurance
will provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. Claims or losses in excess of any product liability insurance coverage
that we may obtain could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  

Certain university and other relationships
are important to our business and may potentially result in conflicts of interests.   

Dr. John Kellum and others are critical
care advisors and consultants of ours and are associated with institutions such as the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.
Their association with these institutions may currently or in the future involve conflicting interests in the event they or these
institutions enter into consulting or other arrangements with competitors of ours. 

We have limited manufacturing experience,
and once our products are approved, we may not be able to manufacture sufficient quantities at an acceptable cost, or without shut-downs
or delays.   

In March 2011, we received approval from
our Notified Body to apply the CE Mark to our CytoSorb device for commercial sale as a cytokine filter. We also achieved ISO 13485:2003
Full Quality Systems certification, an internationally recognized quality standard designed to ensure that medical device manufacturers
have the necessary comprehensive management systems in place to safely design, develop, manufacture and distribute medical devices
in the EU. We manufacture CytoSorb at our manufacturing facilities in New Jersey for sale in the EU and for additional clinical
studies. Manufacturers and manufacturers  facilities are required to comply with extensive FDA requirements, including ensuring
that quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP).  As such, we are
subject to continual review and periodic inspections to assess compliance with cGMP as required by our International notified body
and those FDA regulations governing companies that export medical products for sale outside the United States.  Accordingly,
we must continue to expend time, money and effort in all areas of regulatory compliance, including manufacturing, production and
quality control. We have limited experience in establishing, supervising and conducting commercial manufacturing. If we or the
third-party manufacturers of our products fail to adequately establish, supervise and conduct all aspects of the manufacturing
processes, we may not be able to commercialize our products. 

While we currently believe we have established
sufficient production capacity to supply potential near term demand for the CytoSorb device, we will need to scale up and increase
our manufacturing capabilities in the future. No assurance can be given that we will be able to successfully scale up our manufacturing
capabilities or that we will have sufficient financial or technical resources to do so on a timely basis or at all. 

Due to our limited marketing, sales
and distribution experience, we may be unsuccessful in our efforts to sell our products.   

We expect to enter into agreements with
third parties for the commercial marketing, and distribution of our products. There can be no assurance that parties we may engage
to market and distribute our products will: 

satisfy their financial or contractual obligations to us;   

adequately market our products; or   

not offer, design, manufacture or promote competing products.   

If for any reason any party we engage is
unable or chooses not to perform its obligations under our marketing and distribution agreement, we would experience delays in
product sales and incur increased costs, which would harm our business and financial results. 

Our results of operations can be
significantly affected by foreign currency fluctuations and regulations.   

A significant portion of our revenues is
currently derived in the local currencies of the foreign jurisdictions in which our products are sold. Accordingly, we are subject
to risks relating to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. In the future, and especially as we further expand our sales efforts
in international markets, our customers will increasingly make payments in non-U.S. currencies. Fluctuations in foreign currency
exchange rates could affect our revenues, operating costs and operating margins. In addition, currency devaluation can result in
a loss to us if we hold deposits of that currency. We cannot predict the effect of future exchange rate fluctuations
on our operating results. 

If we are unable to convince physicians
and other health care providers as to the benefits of our products, we may incur delays or additional expense in our attempt to
establish market acceptance.   

Broad use of our products may require physicians
and other health care providers to be informed about our products and their intended benefits. The time and cost of such an educational
process may be substantial. Inability to successfully carry out this education process may adversely affect market acceptance of
our products. We may be unable to educate physicians regarding our products in sufficient numbers or in a timely manner to achieve
our marketing plans or to achieve product acceptance. Any delay in physician education may materially delay or reduce demand for
our products. In addition, we may expend significant funds towards physician education before any acceptance or demand for our
products is created, if at all. 

The market for our products is rapidly
changing and competitive, and new devices and drugs, which may be developed by others, could impair our ability to maintain and
grow our business and remain competitive.   

The medical device and pharmaceutical industries
are subject to rapid and substantial technological change. Developments by others may render our technologies and products noncompetitive
or obsolete. We also may be unable to keep pace with technological developments and other market factors. Technological competition
from medical device, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, universities, governmental entities and others diversifying into
the field is intense and is expected to increase. Many of these entities have significantly greater research and development capabilities
and budgets than we do, as well as substantially more marketing, manufacturing, financial and managerial resources. These entities
represent significant competition for us.  

Our business could be harmed by adverse
economic conditions in Germany, our primary geographical market, or by economic and/or political instability in the EU
caused by Brexit, or other factors.   

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we derived a majority of our net
product sales from sales in Germany.  Despite modest European and global growth, there are many economic and political issues
that could negatively impact the health of Germany s economy, the broader EU economy, and the world economy overall.
Examples include the uncertainty over the United Kingdom s intent to leave the EU, also known as  Brexit , economic instability in a number of EU member countries, and changes in the political leadership in the EU and United
States. Germany and other European countries face additional risks to their local economies, some of which include the impact
of foreign exchange fluctuations, unemployment, tightening of monetary policy, the economic burden of immigration, diminished
liquidity and reliance on debt, the rising cost of healthcare, and other factors. In addition, the German government,
insurance companies, health maintenance organizations and other payers of healthcare costs continue to focus on healthcare
reform and containment of healthcare costs. We cannot predict whether Germany s economy will continue to grow or
decline consistent with the overall global economy, which decline would negatively impact the demand for medical devices
and healthcare technologies generally and lead to reduced spending on the products we provide. In addition, continued
healthcare cost containment efforts may result in lower prices and a reduction or elimination of reimbursement for our
products. Due to the concentration of our product sales in this country, any of the foregoing may have a negative impact on
our revenues, business operations and financial condition. 

Our business may be negatively affected
if the United States and/or the countries in which we sell our products participate in wars, military actions or are otherwise
the target of international terrorism.   

Involvement in a war or other military
action or international acts of terrorism may cause significant disruption to commerce throughout the world. To the extent that
such disruptions result in (i) delays or cancellations of customer orders, (ii) a general decrease in consumer spending on healthcare
technology, (iii) our inability to effectively market and distribute our products globally or (iv) our inability to access capital
markets, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. We are unable to predict whether acts
of international terrorism or the involvement in a war or other military actions by the United States and/or the countries in which
we sell our products will result in any long-term commercial disruptions or if such involvement or responses will have any long-term
material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. 

We could be adversely affected
by violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws.   

We are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices
Act (FCPA), which generally prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making payments to non-U.S. government officials
for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or securing any other improper advantage. We are also subject to anti-bribery
laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Although we have policies and procedures designed to ensure that we, our employees
and our agents comply with the FCPA and other anti-bribery laws, there is no assurance that such policies or procedures will protect
us against liability under the FCPA or other laws for actions taken by our agents, employees and intermediaries with respect to
our business or any businesses that we acquire. We do business in a number of countries in which FCPA violations have recently
been enforced. Failure to comply with the FCPA, other anti-bribery laws or other laws governing the conduct of business with foreign
government entities, including local laws, could disrupt our business and lead to severe criminal and civil penalties, including
imprisonment, criminal and civil fines, loss of our export licenses, suspension of our ability to do business with the federal
government, denial of government reimbursement for our products and/or exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs.
Other remedial measures could include further changes or enhancements to our procedures, policies, and controls and potential personnel
changes and/or disciplinary actions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results
of operations and liquidity. We could also be adversely affected by any allegation that we violated such laws. 

Cyberattacks and other security breaches could compromise
our proprietary and confidential information which could harm our business and reputation.   

In the ordinary course of our business,
we generate, collect and store proprietary information, including intellectual property and business information. The secure storage,
maintenance, and transmission of and access to this information is important to our operations and reputation. Computer hackers
may attempt to penetrate our computer systems and, if successful, misappropriate our proprietary and confidential information including
e-mails and other electronic communications. In addition, an employee, contractor, or other third-party with whom we do business
may attempt to obtain such information, and may purposefully or inadvertently cause a breach involving such information. While
we have certain safeguards in place to reduce the risk of and detect cyber-attacks, our information technology networks and infrastructure
may be vulnerable to unpermitted access by hackers or other breaches, or employee error or malfeasance. Any such compromise of
our data security and access to, or public disclosure or loss of, confidential business or proprietary information could disrupt
our operations, damage our reputation, provide our competitors with valuable information, and subject us to additional costs which
could adversely affect our business. 

Risks Connected to Our Securities  

The price of our Common Stock has
been highly volatile due to factors that will continue to affect the price of our stock.   

On December 3, 2014, we effected a twenty-five-for-one
(25:1) reverse split of our Common Stock. Immediately after the reverse stock split, on December 3, 2014 we changed our state of
incorporation from the State of Nevada to the State of Delaware pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated December 3,
2014, whereby we merged with and into our recently formed, wholly-owned Delaware subsidiary. On December 17, 2014, we received
approval for up-listing to The NASDAQ Capital Market and our Common Stock began trading on The NASDAQ Capital Market on December
23, 2014. Our Common Stock closed as high as $6.47 and as low as $3.21 per share between January 1, 2016 and September 30, 2016
on The NASDAQ Capital Market. On November 3, 2016 the closing price of our Common Stock, as reported on The NASDAQ Capital Market,
was $5.30. Historically, medical device company securities such as our Common Stock have experienced extreme price fluctuations.
Some of the factors leading to this volatility include, but are not limited to: 

fluctuations in our operating results;   

announcements of product releases by us or our competitors;   

announcements of acquisitions and/or partnerships by us or our competitors; and   

general market conditions.   

Although shares of our Common Stock currently
trade on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol  CTSO , there is no assurance that our stock will not continue
to be volatile while listed on NASDAQ in the future. 

Directors, executive officers and
principal stockholders own a significant percentage of the shares of Common Stock, which will limit your ability to influence corporate
matters.   

Our directors, executive officers and principal
stockholders together beneficially own a significant percentage of the voting control of the Common Stock on a fully diluted basis.
Accordingly, these stockholders could have a significant influence over the outcome of any corporate transaction or other matter
submitted to stockholders for approval, including mergers, consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets
and also could prevent or cause a change in control. The interests of these stockholders may differ from the interests of our other
stockholders. Third parties may be discouraged from making a tender offer or bid to acquire us because of this concentration of
ownership. 

Our Board of Directors may, without
stockholder approval, issue and fix the terms of shares of preferred stock and issue additional shares of Common Stock adversely
affecting the rights of holders of our Common Stock.   

On December 3, 2014, we effected a twenty-five-for-one
(25:1) reverse split of our Common Stock. Immediately after the reverse stock split, on December 3, 2014 we changed our state of
incorporation from the State of Nevada to the State of Delaware pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated December 3,
2014, whereby we merged with and into our recently formed, wholly-owned Delaware subsidiary. Pursuant to the Agreement and Plan
of Merger effecting the merger, we adopted the certificate of incorporation, as amended and restated, and bylaws of our Delaware
subsidiary as our certificate of incorporation and bylaws at effective time of the merger. As a result, our certificate of incorporation,
as amended and restated, authorizes the issuance of up to 5,000,000 shares of  blank check  preferred stock, with such
designation rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by the Board of Directors. Currently, our certificate
of incorporation, as amended and restated, which was effective December 3, 2014, authorizes the issuance of up to 50,000,000 shares
of Common Stock, of which approximately 24,531,000 shares remain available for issuance and may be issued by us without stockholder
approval. 

Anti-takeover provisions in our charter
documents and under Delaware law could prevent or delay transactions that our stockholders may favor and may prevent stockholders
from changing the direction of our business or our management.   

After giving effect to our merger into
our wholly-owned Delaware subsidiary, provisions of our certificate of incorporation, as amended and restated, and bylaws may discourage,
delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that our stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which you might
otherwise receive a premium for your shares, and may also frustrate or prevent any attempt by stockholders to change the direction
or management of us. For example, these provisions: 

authorize the issuance of  blank check  preferred stock without any need for action
by stockholders;  

eliminate the ability of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders;  

prohibit stockholder action by written consent; and  

establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or
for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings.   

Compliance with changing corporate governance and public
disclosure regulations may result in additional expense.   

Keeping abreast of, and in compliance with,
changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
of 2002, new SEC regulations will require an increased amount of management attention and external resources. In addition, prior
to the merger, our current management team was not subject to these laws and regulations, as we were a private corporation. We
intend to continue to invest all reasonably necessary resources to comply with evolving standards, which may result in increased
general and administrative expense and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance
activities. 

Our Common Stock is thinly traded
on The NASDAQ Capital Market exchange and no assurances can be made about stock performance, liquidity, or maintenance of our NASDAQ
listing.   

Prior to December 23, 2014, our Common
Stock was quoted on the OTCQB, which provided significantly less liquidity than a securities exchange (such as the New York Stock
Exchange or the Nasdaq Stock Market). On December 17, 2014, our Common Stock was approved for trading on The NASDAQ Capital Market
(NASDAQ). Beginning on December 23, 2014, our Common Stock began trading on NASDAQ under the symbol  CTSO.  Although
currently listed on NASDAQ, there can be no assurance that we will continue to meet NASDAQ s minimum listing requirements
or that of any other national exchange. In addition, there can be no assurances that a liquid market will be created for our common
stock. If we are unable to maintain listing on The NASDAQ or if a liquid market for our Common Stock does not develop, our Common
Stock may remain thinly traded. 

Future sales of our Common Stock
may cause our share price to fall.   

In November 2015, we entered into a sales
agreement with Cantor Fitzgerald   Co. to offer shares of our Common Stock from time to time through  at-the-market 
offerings, pursuant to which we offer and sell shares of our Common Stock for an aggregate offering price of up to $25 million.
We are not obligated to make or continue to make any sale of shares of our Common Stock under the  at-the-market  offerings.
Although any sale of securities pursuant to the  at-the-market  offerings will result in a concomitant increase in
cash for each share sold, it may result in shareholder dilution and may cause our share price to fall.

  PURSUANT TO EXCHANGE ACT RULE 13a-14(a)/15d-14(a)  

  AS ADOPTED PURSUANT TO SECTION 302 OF  

  THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002  

I, Phillip P. Chan, certify that: 

1.   
      I have reviewed this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q of CytoSorbents Corporation;    

2.   
      Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report;    

3.   
      Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report;    

4.   
      The registrant s other certifying officer and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13-a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have:
