  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

Note 1.     Nature of Operations and Basis of Presentation    
  General Motors Company (sometimes referred to in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as we, our, us, ourselves, the Company, General Motors or GM) designs, builds and sells cars, trucks, crossovers and automobile parts worldwide. We also provide automotive financing services through General Motors Financial Company, Inc. (GM Financial). We analyze the results of our business through the following segments: GM North America (GMNA), GM Europe (GME), GM International Operations (GMIO), GM South America (GMSA) and GM Financial. Nonsegment operations are classified as Corporate. Corporate includes certain centrally recorded income and costs, such as interest, income taxes and corporate expenditures and certain nonsegment specific revenues and expenses. 
    
  The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for interim financial information. Accordingly they do not include all of the information and notes required by U.S. GAAP for complete financial statements. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include all adjustments, which consist of normal recurring adjustments and transactions or events discretely impacting the interim periods, considered necessary by management to fairly state our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. The operating results for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for any other interim period or for the full year. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our 2015 Form 10-K. Except for per share amounts or as otherwise specified, dollar amounts presented within tables are stated in millions. 
    
  Effective January 1, 2016 we retrospectively adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, which requires all deferred tax assets and liabilities to be classified as non-current. As a result current Deferred income taxes and Accrued liabilities decreased by   $8.6 billion   and   $249 million   and non-current Deferred income taxes increased by   $8.4 billion   at December 31, 2015 in our condensed consolidated balance sheets. 
    
  In February 2016 ASU 2016-02, Leases (ASU 2016-02) was issued which requires the lessee to recognize most leases on the balance sheet thereby resulting in the recognition of lease assets and liabilities for those leases currently classified as operating leases. The accounting for leases where we are the lessor is largely unchanged. ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018 with early adoption permitted. We are currently assessing the impact ASU 2016-02 will have on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In June 2016 ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments   Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (ASU 2016-13), was issued that requires entities to use a Current Expected Credit Loss model which is a new impairment model based on expected losses rather than incurred losses. Under this model, an entity would recognize an impairment allowance equal to its current estimate of all contractual cash flows that the entity does not expect to collect from financial assets measured at amortized cost. The entity's estimate would consider relevant information about past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts, which will result in recognition of lifetime expected credit losses by GM Financial upon loan origination. ASU 2016-13 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019 with early adoption permitted for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. We are currently assessing the impact ASU 2016-13 will have on our consolidated financial statements. 

Note 2.     Acquisition of Business    
  On   May 12, 2016   we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of Cruise Automation, Inc. (Cruise), an autonomous vehicle technology company, to further accelerate our development of autonomous vehicles. The deal consideration at closing was   $581 million  , of which   $291 million   was paid in cash and approximately   $290 million   was paid through the issuance of new common stock. The fair value of the common stock issued was determined based on the closing price of our common stock on May 12, 2016. In conjunction with the acquisition, we entered into other agreements that will result in future costs contingent upon the continued employment of key individuals and additional performance-based awards contingent upon the achievement of specific technology and commercialization milestones. 
    
  Of the total consideration,   $130 million   was allocated to intangible assets, primarily in-process research and development with an indefinite life until fully developed and commercialized,   $39 million   was allocated to deferred tax liabilities, net of other assets, and   $490 million   was allocated to non-tax-deductible goodwill in GMNA primarily related to the synergies expected to arise as a result of the acquisition.

The results of operations associated with this acquisition were not significant to our condensed consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, pro forma financial information is not presented. We have included the financial results of Cruise in our condensed consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. 

Note 3.     Marketable Securities 
  The following table summarizes the fair value, which approximates cost, of cash equivalents and marketable securities: 

Marketable securities classified as cash equivalents totaled   $8.3 billion   and   $7.5 billion   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   and consisted of corporate debt, sovereign debt and money market funds. Sales proceeds from investments classified as available-for-sale and sold prior to maturity were   $1.6 billion   and   $1.1 billion   in the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   and   $5.8 billion   and   $7.0 billion   in the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . Net unrealized gains and losses on trading securities were insignificant in the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015. 

Note 4.     GM Financial Receivables      

GM Financial estimates the fair value of retail finance receivables using observable and unobservable inputs within a cash flow model, a Level 3 input. The inputs reflect assumptions regarding expected prepayments, deferrals, delinquencies, recoveries and charge-offs of the loans within the portfolio. The cash flow model produces an estimated amortization schedule of the finance receivables which is the basis for the calculation of the series of cash flows that derive the fair value of the portfolio. The series of cash flows is calculated and discounted using a weighted-average cost of capital or current interest rates. The weighted-average cost of capital uses unobservable debt and equity percentages, an unobservable cost of equity and an observable cost of debt based on companies with a similar credit rating and maturity profile as the portfolio. Macroeconomic factors could affect the credit performance of the portfolio and therefore could potentially affect the assumptions used in GM Financial's cash flow model. A

  GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    (Continued) 

substantial majority of GM Financial's commercial finance receivables have variable interest rates and maturities of   one year   or less. Therefore, the carrying amount is considered to be a reasonable estimate of fair value using Level 2 inputs. 

The activity for the allowance for commercial loan losses was insignificant in the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
    
  Retail Finance Receivables    GM Financial uses proprietary scoring systems in its underwriting process that measure the credit quality of retail finance receivables using several factors, such as credit bureau information, consumer credit risk scores (e.g. FICO scores or its equivalent) and contract characteristics. In addition to GM Financial's proprietary scoring systems, GM Financial considers other individual consumer factors such as employment history, financial stability and capacity to pay. Subsequent to origination GM Financial reviews the credit quality of retail receivables based on customer payment activity. In North America, while we historically focused on consumers with lower than prime credit scores, we have expanded our prime lending programs. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  ,   51%   and   60%   of the retail finance receivables in North America were from consumers with sub-prime credit scores, which are defined as FICO scores or its equivalent of less than   620   at the time of loan origination. At the time of loan origination, substantially all of GM Financial's international consumers have the equivalent of prime credit scores. 
    
  An account is considered delinquent if a substantial portion of a scheduled payment has not been received by the date such payment was contractually due. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   the accrual of finance charge income had been suspended on delinquent retail finance receivables with contractual amounts due of   $816 million   and   $778 million  . The following table summarizes the contractual amount of delinquent contracts, which was not significantly different than the recorded investment of the retail finance receivables: 

At   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015 retail finance receivables classified as troubled debt restructurings and individually evaluated for impairment were   $1.8 billion   and   $1.6 billion   and the allowance for loan losses included   $256 million   and   $220 million   of specific allowances on these receivables. 
    
  Commercial Finance Receivables    GM Financial's commercial finance receivables consist of dealer financings, primarily for inventory purchases. A proprietary model is used to assign a risk rating to each dealer. A credit review of each dealer is performed at least annually, and if necessary, the dealer's risk rating is adjusted on the basis of the review. Dealers in Group VI are subject to additional restrictions on funding, up to suspension of lines of credit and liquidation of assets. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   the commercial finance receivables on non-accrual status were insignificant. The following table summarizes the credit risk profile by dealer risk rating of commercial finance receivables:

Note 5.   Inventories   

Note 6.     Equity in Net Assets of Nonconsolidated Affiliates    

There have been   no   significant ownership changes in our Automotive China joint ventures (Automotive China JVs) since   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Dividends received from our nonconsolidated affiliates were insignificant and   $315 million   in the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015 and   $2.0 billion   and   $1.7 billion   in the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015. At   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015 we had undistributed earnings of   $1.8 billion   and   $2.2 billion   related to our nonconsolidated affiliates. 

Note 7.     Variable Interest Entities    
  GM Financial uses special purpose entities (SPEs) that are considered variable interest entities (VIEs) to issue variable funding notes to third party bank-sponsored warehouse facilities or asset-backed securities to investors in securitization transactions. The debt issued by these VIEs is backed by finance receivables and leasing related assets transferred by GM Financial to the VIEs (Securitized Assets). GM Financial determined that it is the primary beneficiary of the SPEs because: (1) the servicing responsibilities for the Securitized Assets give GM Financial the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the performance of the VIEs; and (2) the variable interests in the VIEs give GM Financial the obligation to absorb losses and the right to receive residual returns that could potentially be significant. The assets serve as the sole source of repayment for the debt issued by these entities. Investors in the notes issued by the VIEs do not have recourse to GM Financial or its other assets, with the exception of customary representation and warranty repurchase provisions and indemnities that GM Financial provides as the servicer. GM Financial is not required and does not currently intend to provide additional financial support to these SPEs. While

  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    (Continued) 

these subsidiaries are included in GM Financial's condensed consolidated financial statements, they are separate legal entities and their assets are legally owned by them and are not available to GM Financial's creditors. The following table summarizes the assets and liabilities related to GM Financial's consolidated VIEs: 

GM Financial recognizes finance charge, leased vehicle and fee income on the Securitized Assets and interest expense on the secured debt issued in a securitization transaction and records a provision for loan losses to recognize probable loan losses inherent in the finance receivables. 

Note 8.     Automotive and GM Financial Debt      

The fair value of automotive debt measured utilizing Level 1 inputs was based on quoted prices in active markets for identical instruments that a market participant can access at the measurement date. The fair value of automotive debt measured utilizing Level 2 inputs was based on a discounted cash flow model using observable inputs. This model utilizes observable inputs such as contractual repayment terms and benchmark yield curves, plus a spread based on our senior unsecured notes that is intended to represent our nonperformance risk. We obtain the benchmark yield curves and yields on unsecured notes from independent sources that are widely used in the financial industry. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 the fair value of automotive debt exceeded its carrying amount due primarily to a decrease in bond yields compared to yields at the time of issuance.    
    
  In February 2016 we issued   $2.0 billion   in aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes comprising   $1.25 billion   of   6.60%   notes due in   2036   and   $750 million   of   6.75%   notes due in   2046  . These notes contain terms and covenants customary of these types of securities including limitations on the amount of certain secured debt we may incur. The net proceeds from the issuance of these senior unsecured notes were used to fund discretionary contributions to our U.S. hourly pension plan as described in   Note 10  . 
    
  In May 2016 we amended and restated our   two   primary revolving credit facilities, increasing our aggregate borrowing capacity from   $12.5 billion   to   $14.5 billion  . These facilities consist of a   three  -year,   $4.0 billion   facility and a   five  -year,   $10.5 billion   facility. Both facilities are available to us as well as certain wholly-owned subsidiaries, including GM Financial. The three-year,   $4.0 billion   facility allows for borrowings in U.S. Dollars and other currencies and includes a GM Financial borrowing sub-limit of   $1.0 billion   and a letter of credit sub-facility of   $1.0 billion  . The five-year,   $10.5 billion   facility allows for borrowings in U.S. Dollars and other currencies and includes a GM Financial borrowing sub-limit of   $3.0 billion   and a letter of credit sub-limit of   $500 million  .  
    
  The revolving credit facilities require us to maintain at least   $4.0 billion   in global liquidity and at least   $2.0 billion   in U.S. liquidity. If we fail to maintain an investment grade corporate rating from at least   two   of the following credit rating agencies: Fitch Ratings (Fitch), Moody's Investor Service (Moody's) and Standard   Poor's (S P), certain subsidiaries of ours will be required to provide guarantees under the terms of the revolving credit facilities. Interest rates on obligations under the revolving credit facilities are based on prevailing annual interest rates for Eurodollar loans or an alternative base rate, plus an applicable margin.

  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    (Continued) 

The fair value of GM Financial debt measured utilizing Level 2 inputs was based on quoted market prices for identical instruments and if unavailable, quoted market prices of similar instruments. For debt that has terms of one year or less or has been priced within the last six months, the carrying amount or par value is considered to be a reasonable estimate of fair value. The fair value of GM Financial debt measured utilizing Level 3 inputs was based on the discounted future net cash flows expected to be settled using current risk-adjusted rates.  
    
  Secured debt consists of revolving credit facilities and securitization notes payable. Most of the secured debt was issued by VIEs and is repayable only from proceeds related to the underlying pledged Securitized Assets. Refer to   Note 7   for additional information on GM Financial's involvement with VIEs. In the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   GM Financial issued securitization notes payable of   $11.8 billion   and entered into new or renewed credit facilities with a total net additional borrowing capacity of   $3.1 billion  , which had substantially the same terms as existing debt. 
    
  Unsecured debt consists of senior notes, credit facilities, retail customer deposits and other unsecured debt. In March 2016 GM Financial issued   $2.75 billion   in aggregate principal amount of senior notes comprising   $1.5 billion   of   4.20%   notes due in   March 2021   and   $1.25 billion   of   5.25%   notes due in   March 2026  . In May 2016 GM Financial issued   $3.0 billion   in aggregate principal amount of senior notes comprising   $1.4 billion   of   2.40%   notes due in   May 2019  ,   $1.2 billion   of   3.70%   notes due in   May 2023   and   $400 million   of floating rate notes due in   May 2019  . Also in May 2016 GM Financial issued Euro   500 million   of   1.168%   term notes due in   May 2020  . In July 2016 GM Financial issued   $2.0 billion   of   3.20%   senior notes due in   July 2021  . In September 2016 GM Financial issued Euro   750 million   of   0.955%   term notes due in   September 2023  . In October 2016 GM Financial issued   $1.75 billion   in aggregate principal amount of senior notes comprising   $750 million   of   2.35%   notes due in   October 2019  ,   $750 million   of   4.00%   notes due in   October 2026   and   $250 million   of floating rate notes due in   October 2019  . Each of these notes contain terms and covenants including limitations on GM Financial's ability to incur certain liens. 
    
  GM Financial accepts deposits from retail banking customers in Germany. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   the outstanding balance of these deposits was   $1.9 billion   and   $1.3 billion  , of which   41%   and   44%   were overnight deposits.

Effective January 2016 the discount rate used to determine the service cost and interest cost for our pension and other postretirement benefits (OPEB) plans was based on individual annual yield curve rates. This refinement is considered a change in estimate and has been applied prospectively. The use of the individual annual yield curve rates has reduced the service cost and interest cost by   $192 million   and   $577 million   in the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , which will be offset in the actuarial gains and losses upon the next remeasurement of the plans' obligations.  
    
  We made discretionary contributions to our U.S. hourly pension plan of   $2.0 billion   in the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  . These discretionary contributions were funded with the net proceeds from the issuance of the automotive senior unsecured notes described in   Note 8  .  
    
  The curtailment charges recorded in the nine months ended   September 30, 2015   were due primarily to the General Motors of Canada Company (GM Canada) hourly pension plan that was remeasured as a result of a voluntary separation program.  

Note 11.     Commitments and Contingencies    
  Litigation-Related Liability and Tax Administrative Matters    In the normal course of business, we are named from time to time as a defendant in various legal actions, including arbitrations, class actions and other litigation, that arise in connection with our business as a global company. We identify below the material individual proceedings and investigations in connection with which we believe a material loss is reasonably possible or probable. We accrue for matters when we believe that losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   accruals were   $1.3 billion   and   $1.2 billion   and were recorded in Accrued liabilities and Other liabilities. In many proceedings, it is inherently difficult to determine whether any loss is probable or even reasonably possible or to estimate the size or range of the possible loss. Accordingly an adverse outcome from such proceedings could exceed the amounts accrued by an amount that could be material to our financial position, results of operations or cash flows in any particular reporting period.  
    
  Proceedings Related to Ignition Switch Recall and Other Recalls    In 2014 we announced various recalls relating to safety, customer satisfaction and other matters. Those recalls included recalls to repair ignition switches that could under certain circumstances unintentionally move from the  run  position to the  accessory  or  off  position with a corresponding loss of power, which could in turn prevent airbags from deploying in the event of a crash.

Through   October 19, 2016   we were aware of   100   putative class actions pending against GM in various federal and state trial courts in the U.S. and   17   putative class actions pending in various Provincial Courts in Canada alleging that consumers who purchased or leased vehicles manufactured by GM or General Motors Corporation had been economically harmed by one or more of the recalls announced in 2014 and/or the underlying vehicle conditions associated with those recalls (economic-loss cases). In general, these economic-loss cases seek recovery for purported compensatory damages, such as alleged benefit-of-the-bargain damage or damages related to alleged diminution in value of the vehicles, as well as punitive damages, injunctive relief and other relief. There are also   two   civil actions brought by state governmental entities relating to the 2014 recalls that seek injunctive relief as well as civil penalties and attorneys' fees for alleged violations of state laws. 
    
  Through   October 19, 2016   we were aware of   286   actions pending in various federal and state trial courts in the U.S. and   18   actions pending in various Provincial Courts in Canada alleging injury or death as a result of defects that may be the subject of recalls announced in 2014 (personal injury cases). In general, these personal injury cases seek recovery for purported compensatory damages, punitive damages and other relief. 
    
  Since June 2014 the United States Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (JPML) has issued orders from time to time directing that certain pending economic-loss and personal injury federal lawsuits involving faulty or allegedly faulty ignition switches or other defects that may be related to the recalls announced in 2014 be transferred to, and consolidated in, a single federal court, the Southern District of New York (the multidistrict litigation). Through   October 19, 2016   the JPML has transferred   306   pending cases to, and consolidated them with, the multidistrict litigation. At the court's suggestion, the parties to the multidistrict litigation engage from time to time in discussions of possible mechanisms to resolve pending litigation. Since September 17, 2015 we have reached various agreements with certain personal injury claimants regarding possible settlement of their claims.  
    
  In order to facilitate the resolution of the multidistrict litigation, the Southern District of New York (the district court) scheduled   six   cases involving personal injury for bellwether trials in 2016 (i.e., trials designed to be representative of the group of personal injury cases in the multidistrict litigation). Through   October 19, 2016     two   of the cases set for bellwether trials were dismissed with prejudice by the plaintiffs. In a   third   bellwether trial, a jury returned a verdict finding that GM was not liable to the plaintiffs. In the remaining   three   federal cases set for bellwether trials in 2016, GM and the plaintiffs entered into confidential settlement agreements to resolve those cases prior to trial. The district court has scheduled additional personal injury bellwether trials for 2017 and 2018. In addition to the federal bellwether trials, a Texas state court administering a Texas state court multidistrict litigation scheduled   two   bellwether trials in August and September 2016. In the first case, tried in August 2016, a jury returned a verdict finding that GM was not liable to the plaintiffs. In the second case, the Texas state court granted summary judgment to GM and dismissed plaintiff's case before the trial commenced. Each bellwether trial will be tried on its facts and the result of any subsequent bellwether trial may be different from the earlier bellwether trials.  
    
  On July 15, 2016 the district court overseeing the federal multidistrict litigation issued a ruling on GM's motion to dismiss plaintiffs' complaint seeking damages for alleged economic losses relating to the ignition switch and other recalls by GM in 2014. The district court granted GM's motion in part and denied it in part. The district court dismissed plaintiffs' claims brought under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization Act, and those brought by any plaintiff whose vehicle was not allegedly defective when sold. The district court also rejected plaintiffs' broadest theory of damages   that plaintiffs could seek recovery for alleged reduction in the value of their vehicles due to damage to GM's reputation and brand as a result of the ignition switch matter. The district court also held that plaintiffs did not have a common basis for their claims across all defects and models to proceed as a single class, and that the remaining claims may have to proceed individually or in subclasses of vehicles affected by a common defect. Further, the district court held that the named plaintiffs may assert claims only on behalf of owners of the same vehicle models that they themselves purchased (or leased) or models with sufficiently similar defects, and that it will not specify the specific permissible class claims until the class-certification stage. Finally, the district court granted GM's motion to dismiss with respect to certain state law claims but denied it as to other state law claims. The court held that the viability of state law claims will depend on each state's specific laws and plaintiffs' specific factual allegations. While the ruling is limited to post-bankruptcy claims, we believe the district court's legal holdings rejecting plaintiffs' broadest damages theory and dismissing certain other claims should apply to similarly limit plaintiffs' pre-bankruptcy claims. On September 15, 2016, plaintiffs filed a Fourth Amended Consolidated Complaint, amending their economic loss claims. 
    
  Because many plaintiffs in the actions described in the above paragraphs are suing over the conduct of General Motors Corporation or vehicles manufactured by that entity for liabilities not expressly assumed by GM, we moved to enforce the terms of the July 2009 Sale Order and Injunction (2009 Sale Order) issued by the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (Bankruptcy Court) to preclude claims from being asserted against us for, among other things, personal injuries based on pre-sale accidents, any economic-loss claims based on acts or conduct of General Motors Corporation and claims asserting successor

liability for obligations owed by General Motors Corporation (successor liability claims). On April 15, 2015 the Bankruptcy Court issued a decision precluding claims against us based upon pre-sale accidents, claims based upon the acts or conduct by General Motors Corporation and successor liability claims, except for claims asserting liabilities that had been expressly assumed by us in the July 2009 Sale Agreement, and claims that could be asserted against us only if they were otherwise viable and arose solely out of our own independent post-closing acts and did not in any way rely on acts or conduct by General Motors Corporation. Plaintiffs appealed the Bankruptcy Court s decision and we cross appealed with respect to certain issues to preserve our rights.  
    
  On July 13, 2016 a three judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (Second Circuit) issued a decision and judgment affirming in part, reversing in part, and vacating portions of the Bankruptcy Court's April 15, 2015 decision and subsequent judgment. Among other things, the Second Circuit held that the 2009 Sale Order could not be enforced to bar claims against GM asserted by either plaintiffs who purchased used vehicles after the sale closing or against purchasers who asserted claims relating to the ignition switch defect, including pre-closing personal injury claims and economic loss claims. The Second Circuit also vacated that portion of the Bankruptcy Court judgment enforcing the 2009 Sale Order against plaintiffs with pre-sale claims based on defects other than the ignition switch and remanded that issue to the Bankruptcy Court for further proceedings. The Second Circuit denied our request for an en banc review of the panel's decision and judgment and we now intend to appeal the Second Circuit's decision to the United States Supreme Court. In 2014, GM voluntarily established the Ignition Switch Recall Compensation Program, administered by an independent administrator, which provided compensation for individuals who suffered personal injuries resulting from the ignition switch defect, both before and after bankruptcy. As a result, certain pre-closing personal injury claims relating to the ignition switch defect were resolved through this program. Refer to the Ignition Switch Recall Compensation Program section below for a discussion of the payments made under this program through September 30, 2016.  
    
  In addition on December 4, 2015 the Bankruptcy Court issued a judgment regarding certain issues, including the extent to which punitive damages could be asserted against GM based on claims in connection with vehicles manufactured by General Motors Corporation, for which GM assumed liability in the 2009 Sale Agreement. Various groups of plaintiffs have appealed that decision to the district court overseeing the multidistrict litigation. 
    
  In the putative shareholder class action filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan (Eastern District) on behalf of purchasers of our common stock from November 17, 2010 to July 24, 2014 (Shareholder Class Action), the lead plaintiff, the New York State Teachers' Retirement System alleged that GM and several current and former officers and employees made material misstatements and omissions relating to problems with the ignition switch and other matters in SEC filings and other public statements.  
    
  On February 11, 2016 the Delaware Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal of   four   consolidated shareholder derivative actions that had been pending in the Delaware Chancery Court. In light of the Delaware Supreme Court s decision, proceedings have resumed in the   two   consolidated shareholder derivative actions in the Eastern District that had been stayed pending disposition of the Delaware cases and the Eastern District is now considering our motion to dismiss in those actions. In early 2016 an additional shareholder derivative action was filed in the Eastern District against certain current and former GM directors and officers making similar allegations to the   two   other shareholder derivative actions that are pending in the Eastern District. This most recent derivative action has been transferred to the same judge handling those   two   other shareholder derivative actions.   Two   derivative actions filed in the Circuit Court of Wayne County, Michigan, have been consolidated and remain stayed pending disposition of the federal derivative actions. 
    
  In connection with the 2014 recalls, various investigations, inquiries and complaints have been received from the United States Attorney s Office for the Southern District of New York (the Office), Congress, the SEC, Transport Canada and   50   state attorneys general. In connection with the foregoing we have received subpoenas and requests for additional information and we have participated in discussions with various governmental authorities. We have not received inquiries from the committees in Congress for a substantial period of time and are unaware of any further action they may take. On June 3, 2015 we received notice of an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) concerning certified pre-owned vehicle advertising where dealers had certified vehicles that allegedly needed recall repairs. On January 28, 2016 the FTC published a proposed consent agreement for public comment. The public comment period has closed; the matter remains pending before the FTC. We believe we are cooperating fully with all pending requests for information in ongoing investigations. Such matters could in the future result in the imposition of material damages, fines, civil consent orders, civil and criminal penalties or other remedies. 
    
  As described more specifically below, we have resolved, partially or totally, several matters relating to the recalls announced in 2014, including the recognition of additional liabilities for such matters.

First, with regard to the investigation by the Office, on September 16, 2015 we entered into a Deferred Prosecution Agreement (the DPA) with the Office regarding its investigation of the events leading up to certain recalls regarding faulty ignition switches. Under the DPA we have paid the United States   $900 million   as a financial penalty, and we agreed to retain an independent monitor to review and assess our policies, practices or procedures related to statements about motor vehicle safety, the provision of information to those responsible for recall decisions, recall processes and addressing known defects in certified pre-owned vehicles. In addition, the Office agreed to recommend to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (Southern District) that prosecution of GM on the two-count information filed in the Southern District be deferred for   three years  . The Office also agreed that if we are in compliance with all of our obligations under the DPA, the Office will, within   30 days   after the expiration of the period of deferral (including any extensions thereto), seek dismissal with prejudice of the two-count information filed against GM. For a further description of the terms and conditions of the DPA refer to Note 15 of our 2015 Form 10-K. 
    
   Second, on May 23, 2016 the district court entered a judgment approving a class-wide settlement of the Shareholder Class Action described above for   $300 million  .   One   significant shareholder opted out of the settlement prior to approval and   one   shareholder has filed an appeal of the decision approving the settlement. 
    
  Third, on September 17, 2015 we announced we had reached a memorandum of understanding regarding a   $275 million   settlement that could potentially cover approximately   1,400   personal injury claimants who have lawsuits pending in the multidistrict litigation or who have otherwise asserted claims related to the ignition switch recall or certain other recalls announced in 2014. In December 2015 the court overseeing the multidistrict litigation established a qualified settlement fund and appointed a special master to administer certain facets of the settlement pursuant to the terms of the memorandum of understanding. The special master commenced his work in the three months ended December 31, 2015 and his work continues.  
    
  The total amount accrued at   September 30, 2016   for the remaining investigations, claims and/or lawsuits relating to the ignition switch recalls and other related recalls represents a combination of our best single point estimates where determinable and, where no such single point estimate is determinable, our estimate of the low end of the range of probable loss with regard to such matters, if that is determinable. We believe it is probable that we will incur additional liabilities beyond what has already been accrued with regard to at least a portion of the remaining matters, whether through settlement or judgment; however, we are currently unable to estimate an overall amount or range of loss because these matters involve significant uncertainties. The uncertainties include the legal theory or the nature of the investigations, claims and/or lawsuits, the complexity of the facts, the lack of documentation available to us with respect to particular cases or groups of cases, the results of any investigation or litigation and the timing of resolution of the investigation or litigations, including any appeals, and further proceedings following the Second Circuit's July 13 decision and the district court's July 15 decision. We will continue to consider resolution of pending matters involving ignition switch recalls and other recalls where it makes sense to do so. 
    
  GM Canada Dealers' Claim    On February 12, 2010 a claim was filed in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice against GM Canada on behalf of a purported class of over   200   former GM Canada dealers (the Plaintiff Dealers) which had entered into wind-down agreements with GM Canada. In May 2009 in the context of the global restructuring of GM's business and the possibility that GM Canada might be required to initiate insolvency proceedings, GM Canada offered the Plaintiff Dealers the wind-down agreements to assist with their exit from the GM Canada dealer network and to facilitate winding down their operations in an orderly fashion. The Plaintiff Dealers allege that their Dealer Sales and Service Agreements were wrongly terminated by GM Canada and that GM Canada failed to comply with certain disclosure obligations, breached its statutory duty of fair dealing and unlawfully interfered with the Plaintiff Dealers' statutory right to associate in an attempt to coerce the Plaintiff Dealers into accepting the wind-down agreements. The Plaintiff Dealers seek damages and assert that the wind-down agreements are rescindable. The Plaintiff Dealers' initial pleading makes reference to a claim  not exceeding    750 million   Canadian Dollars, without explanation of any specific measure of damages. On March 1, 2011 the court approved certification of a class for the purpose of deciding a number of specifically defined issues. A number of former dealers opted out of participation in the litigation, leaving   181   dealers in the certified class. On July 8, 2015 the Ontario Superior Court dismissed the Plaintiff Dealers  claim against GM Canada. The court also dismissed GM Canada s counterclaim against the Plaintiff Dealers for repayment of the wind-down payments made to them by GM Canada as well as for other relief. All parties have filed notices of appeal. The appeals and cross appeals are scheduled to be heard by the Ontario Court of Appeal in January 2017. 
    
  GM Korea Wage Litigation    Commencing on or about September 29, 2010 current and former hourly employees of GM Korea Company (GM Korea) filed   eight   separate group actions in the Incheon District Court in Incheon, Korea. The cases, which in aggregate involve more than   10,000   employees, allege that GM Korea failed to include bonuses and certain allowances in its calculation of Ordinary Wages due under the Presidential Decree of the Korean Labor Standards Act. On November 23, 2012 the  
  
    14

  NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    (Continued) 

Seoul High Court (an intermediate level appellate court) affirmed a decision of the Incheon District Court in a case involving   five   GM Korea employees which was contrary to GM Korea's position. GM Korea appealed to the Supreme Court of the Republic of Korea (Supreme Court). On May 29, 2014 the Supreme Court remanded the case to the Seoul High Court for consideration consistent with earlier Supreme Court precedent holding that while fixed bonuses should be included in the calculation of Ordinary Wages, claims for retroactive application of this rule would be barred under certain circumstances. On reconsideration, the Seoul High Court held in GM Korea s favor on October 30, 2015, after which the plaintiffs appealed to the Supreme Court. In July 2014 GM Korea and its labor union also agreed to include bonuses and certain allowances in Ordinary Wages retroactive to March 1, 2014. Therefore our accrual related to these cases was reclassified from a contingent liability to the Pensions liability. We estimate our reasonably possible loss in excess of amounts accrued to be   604 billion   South Korean Won (equivalent to   $551 million  ) at   September 30, 2016  , which relates to periods before March 1, 2014. We are also party to litigation with current and former salaried employees over allegations relating to Ordinary Wages regulation. On November 26 and 27, 2015 the Supreme Court remanded   two   salary cases to the Seoul High Court for a review of the merits. Both the scope of claims asserted and GM Korea's assessment of any or all of the individual claim elements may change if new information becomes available. These cases are currently pending before various courts in Korea. 
    
  Other Litigation-Related Liability and Tax Administrative Matters    Various other legal actions, governmental investigations, claims and proceedings are pending against us including matters arising out of alleged product defects; employment-related matters; governmental regulations relating to product and workplace safety, emissions and fuel economy; product warranties; financial services; dealer, supplier and other contractual relationships; government regulations relating to payments to foreign companies; government regulations relating to competition issues; tax-related matters not subject to Accounting Standards Codification 740, Income Taxes (indirect tax-related matters); and environmental matters. 
    
  Indirect tax-related matters are being litigated globally pertaining to value added taxes, customs, duties, sales, property taxes and other non-income tax related tax exposures. The various non-U.S. labor-related matters include claims from current and former employees related to alleged unpaid wage, benefit, severance and other compensation matters. Certain South American administrative proceedings are indirect tax-related and may require that we deposit funds in escrow or provide an alternative form of security which may range from   $300 million   to   $700 million   at   September 30, 2016  . Some of the matters may involve compensatory, punitive or other treble damage claims, environmental remediation programs or sanctions that, if granted, could require us to pay damages or make other expenditures in amounts that could not be reasonably estimated at   September 30, 2016  . We believe that appropriate accruals have been established for losses that are probable and can be reasonably estimated. For indirect tax-related matters we estimate our reasonably possible loss in excess of amounts accrued to be up to approximately   $1.0 billion   at   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Takata Matters    On May 4, 2016 the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA) issued an amended     consent order requiring Takata Corporation (Takata) to file defect information reports (DIRs) for previously unrecalled front airbag inflators that contain an ammonium nitrate-based propellant without a moisture absorbing desiccant on a multi-year, risk-based schedule through 2019 impacting tens of millions of vehicles produced by numerous automotive manufacturers. NHTSA concluded that the likely root cause of the rupturing of the airbag inflators is a function of time, temperature cycling and environmental moisture. On May 16, 2016 Takata issued its first DIR in connection with the amended consent order. Its next DIR is due to be filed on December 31, 2016. 
    
  Although we do not believe there is a safety defect at this time in any GM vehicles within the scope of the Takata DIR, in cooperation with NHTSA we filed a Preliminary DIR on May 27, 2016, updated as of June 13, 2016, covering   2.5 million   of certain of our GMT900 vehicles, which are full-size pick-up trucks and sport utility vehicles (SUVs). As a result of discussions with NHTSA and as described in the Preliminary DIR, GM believes it will have an opportunity to prove to NHTSA that the inflators in these vehicles do not and will not pose an unreasonable risk to safety. We believe these vehicles are currently performing as designed and ongoing testing continues to support the belief that the vehicles' unique design and integration mitigates against inflator degradation. We presently believe that the results of further testing and analysis will continue to demonstrate that the vehicles do not present an unreasonable risk to safety and that no repair will ultimately be required.  
    
  Based, in part, on the results of our testing, analysis and data to date, on September 2, 2016, we filed a petition with NHTSA to delay inclusion of GMT900 vehicles in the Takata DIR equipment schedule from December 31, 2016 until December 31, 2017. We believe that this timeline will permit us to complete our testing of the relevant non-desiccated Takata inflators in GMT900 vehicles.

Accordingly,   no   provision has been made for any repair associated with our vehicles subject to the Preliminary DIR and amended consent order. However, in the event we are ultimately obligated to repair the inflators in these vehicles, we estimate a reasonably possible cost of up to   $320 million   for the   2.5 million   vehicles subject to the Preliminary DIR and an additional   $550 million   for up to   4.3 million   vehicles subject to future Takata DIRs under the amended consent order.    
    
  On July 28, 2016, a putative class action was filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey claiming that numerous 2003 - 2011 model year GM vehicles are defective because they are equipped with Takata airbags and alleging, among other things, fraud and breach of warranty. The complaint seeks nationwide class certification or, alternatively, certification of various state classes, damages, costs and fees. At this early stage of the proceedings, we are unable to provide an evaluation of the likelihood that a loss will be incurred or an estimate of the amounts or range of possible loss. 
    
  Product Liability    With respect to product liability claims (other than claims relating to the ignition switch recalls discussed previously) involving our and General Motors Corporation products, we believe that any judgment against us for actual damages will be adequately covered by our recorded accruals and, where applicable, excess liability insurance coverage. In addition we indemnify dealers for certain product liability related claims including products sold by General Motors Corporation's dealers. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   liabilities of   $683 million   and   $712 million   were recorded in Accrued liabilities and Other liabilities for the expected cost of all known product liability claims plus an estimate of the expected cost for product liability claims that have already been incurred and are expected to be filed in the future for which we are self-insured. In light of vehicle recalls in recent years it is reasonably possible that our accruals for product liability claims may increase in future periods in material amounts, although we cannot estimate a reasonable range of incremental loss based on currently available information.  
    
  Ignition Switch Recall Compensation Program    In the three months ended June 30, 2014 we created a compensation program (the Program) for accident victims who died or suffered physical injury (or for their families) as a result of a faulty ignition switch related to the   2.6 million   vehicles recalled in the three months ended March 31, 2014. The Program is being administered by an independent administrator and accepted claims for review from August 1, 2014 through January 31, 2015. The Program completed its claims review process in the three months ended September 30, 2015, but continues to process acceptances that require court approval and resolve liens related to accepted claims. Accident victims (or their families) that accept a payment under the Program agree to settle all claims against GM related to the accident. The following table summarizes the activity for the Program: 

Guarantees    We enter into indemnification agreements for liability claims involving products manufactured primarily by certain joint ventures. We also provide vehicle repurchase guarantees and payment guarantees on commercial loans outstanding with third parties such as dealers. These guarantees terminate in years ranging from 2016 to 2030, upon the occurrence of specific events or are ongoing. We believe that the related potential costs incurred are adequately covered and our recorded accruals are insignificant. The maximum liability, calculated as future undiscounted payments, was   $4.4 billion   and   $2.6 billion   for these guarantees at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the majority of which relate to the indemnification agreements. 
    
  In some instances certain assets of the party whose debt or performance we have guaranteed may offset, to some degree, the amount of certain guarantees. Our payables to the party whose debt or performance we have guaranteed may also reduce the amount of certain guarantees. If vehicles are required to be repurchased under vehicle repurchase obligations, the total exposure would be reduced to the extent vehicles are able to be resold to another dealer.  
    
  We periodically enter into agreements that incorporate indemnification provisions in the normal course of business. It is not possible to estimate our maximum exposure under these indemnifications or guarantees due to the conditional nature of these obligations. Insignificant amounts have been recorded for such obligations as the majority of them are not probable or estimable at this time and the fair value of the guarantees at issuance was insignificant.

For interim income tax reporting we estimate our annual effective tax rate and apply it to our year to date ordinary income (loss). Tax jurisdictions with a projected or year to date loss for which a tax benefit cannot be realized are excluded. The tax effects of unusual or infrequently occurring items, including changes in judgment about valuation allowances and effects of changes in tax laws or rates, are reported in the interim period in which they occur. We have open tax years from   2006   to   2015   with various significant tax jurisdictions. 
    
  In the three months ended   September 30, 2016   income tax expense of   $776 million   primarily resulted from tax expense attributable to entities included in our effective tax rate calculation of   $1.2 billion  , partially offset by tax benefits related to foreign currency losses and other items. In the three months ended   September 30, 2015   income tax expense of   $165 million   resulted from tax expense attributable to entities included in our effective tax rate calculation of   $608 million  , partially offset by net favorable discrete adjustments related to tax settlements, a valuation allowance reversal and other items. 
    
  In the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   income tax expense of   $2.2 billion   primarily resulted from tax expense attributable to entities included in our effective tax rate calculation of   $3.2 billion  , partially offset by tax benefits related to foreign currency losses and other items, tax audit settlements and deductions taken for stock investments in non-U.S. affiliates. In the nine months ended   September 30, 2015   income tax expense of   $1.3 billion   resulted from tax expense attributable to entities included in our effective tax rate calculation of   $1.9 billion  , partially offset by net favorable discrete adjustments related to tax settlements, a valuation allowance reversal and other items. 
    
  The   $900 million   charge recorded in the three months ended   September 30, 2015   for the financial penalty under the DPA was not deductible for income tax purposes. Refer to   Note 11   for additional information on the DPA. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016   we had   $34.4 billion   of net deferred tax assets consisting of: (1) net operating losses and income tax credits; (2) capitalized research expenditures; and (3) other timing differences that are available to offset future income tax liabilities, partially offset by valuation allowances. The net operating losses and income tax credits include U.S. operating loss and tax credit carryforward deferred tax assets of   $8.3 billion   of which   $8.0 billion   expire by 2036 if not utilized and   $300 million   can be carried forward indefinitely; and Non-U.S operating loss and tax credit carryforward deferred tax assets of   $5.9 billion   of which   $1.4 billion   expire by 2036 if not utilized and   $4.5 billion   can be carried forward indefinitely.  

Note 13.     Restructuring and Other Initiatives    
  We have executed various restructuring and other initiatives and we plan to execute additional initiatives in the future, if necessary, in order to align manufacturing capacity and other costs with prevailing global automotive production and to improve the utilization of remaining facilities. To the extent these programs involve voluntary separations, no liabilities are generally recorded until offers to employees are accepted. If employees are involuntarily terminated, a liability is generally recorded at the communication date. Related charges are recorded in Automotive cost of sales and Automotive selling, general and administrative expense. The following tables summarize the reserves and charges related to restructuring and other initiatives, including postemployment benefit reserves and charges, by segment:  

________ 
     
  In the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   restructuring and other initiatives related primarily to: (1) charges of   $240 million   in the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   in GMNA related to the cash severance incentive program to qualified U.S. hourly employees under our 2015 labor agreement with the International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agriculture Implement Workers of America (UAW); and (2) separation and other programs in Australia, Korea and India and the withdrawal of the Chevrolet brand from Europe. Restructuring costs incurred were insignificant and   $94 million   for the three and nine months

ended September 30, 2016. Collectively these programs had a total cost since inception of   $789 million   and affected a total of approximately   4,550   employees in GMIO through September 30, 2016. We expect to complete these programs in GMIO in 2017 and incur additional related restructuring and other charges of approximately   $70 million  .  
    
  In the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2015   restructuring and other initiatives related primarily to: (1) our exit of Russia for which we recorded total pre-tax charges of   $450 million   in GME and GMIO in the nine months ended   September 30, 2015  , of which   $112 million   is reflected in the table above; and (2) separation and other programs in Australia, Korea, Thailand and Indonesia and the withdrawal of the Chevrolet brand from Europe. Restructuring costs incurred were insignificant and   $149 million   for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015. Collectively, these programs had a total cost since inception of   $663 million   in GMIO through   September 30, 2015  .  

Note 14.     Stockholders' Equity 
  We have   2.0 billion   shares of preferred stock and   5.0 billion   shares of common stock authorized for issuance. At   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015 we had   1.5 billion   shares of common stock issued and outstanding. In the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015 we purchased   48 million   and   85 million   shares of our outstanding common stock for   $1.5 billion   and   $2.9 billion   as part of the common stock repurchase program announced in March 2015, which our Board of Directors increased and extended in January 2016. Our total dividends paid on common stock were   $585 million   and   $563 million   in the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   and   $1.8 billion   and   $1.6 billion   in the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
    
  In July 2009 we issued   two   tranches of warrants, each to acquire   136 million   shares of our common stock, to Motors Liquidation Company (MLC) which have all been distributed to creditors of General Motors Corporation (Old GM) and to the Motors Liquidation Company General Unsecured Creditors (GUC) Trust by MLC. The first tranche of MLC warrants had an exercise price of   $10.00   per share and all unexercised warrants expired   July 10, 2016  . The second tranche of MLC warrants is exercisable at any time prior to   July 10, 2019   at an exercise price of   $18.33   per share. At September 30, 2016 and 2015, the number of warrants outstanding was   45 million   and   121 million  . 
    
  The following table summarizes the significant components of Accumulated other comprehensive loss:

Note 15.     Earnings Per Share    
  Basic and diluted earnings per share are computed by dividing Net income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average common shares outstanding in the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by giving effect to all potentially dilutive securities that are outstanding. 

In the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   stock options to purchase   26 million   shares were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the stock options would have had an antidilutive effect. In the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2015   warrants to purchase   46 million   shares were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the warrants would have had an antidilutive effect. The warrants expired December 31, 2015.  

Note 16.     Segment Reporting    
    
  We analyze the results of our business through the following segments: GMNA, GME, GMIO, GMSA and GM Financial. The chief operating decision maker evaluates the operating results and performance of our automotive segments through earnings before interest and income taxes-adjusted, which is presented net of noncontrolling interests. The chief operating decision maker evaluates GM Financial through earnings before income taxes-adjusted because interest income and interest expense are part of operating results when assessing and measuring the operational and financial performance of the segment. Each segment has a manager responsible for executing our strategies. Our automotive manufacturing operations are integrated within the segments, benefit from broad-based trade agreements and are subject to regulatory requirements. While not all vehicles within a segment are individually profitable on a fully allocated cost basis, those vehicles attract customers to dealer showrooms and help maintain sales volumes for other, more profitable vehicles and contribute towards meeting required fuel efficiency standards. As a result of these and other factors, we do not manage our business on an individual brand or vehicle basis. 
    
  Substantially all of the cars, trucks, crossovers and automobile parts produced are marketed through retail dealers in North America and through distributors and dealers outside of North America, the substantial majority of which are independently owned. In addition to the products sold to dealers for consumer retail sales, cars, trucks and crossovers are also sold to fleet customers, including daily rental car companies, commercial fleet customers, leasing companies and governments. Fleet sales are completed through the dealer network and in some cases directly with fleet customers. Retail and fleet customers can obtain a wide range of after-sale vehicle services and products through the dealer network, such as maintenance, light repairs, collision repairs, vehicle accessories and extended service warranties.  
    
  GMNA primarily meets the demands of customers in North America with vehicles developed, manufactured and/or marketed under the Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet and GMC brands. The demands of customers outside North America are primarily met with vehicles developed, manufactured and/or marketed under the Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet, GMC, Holden, Opel and Vauxhall brands. We also have equity ownership stakes directly or indirectly in entities through various regional subsidiaries, primarily in Asia. These companies design, manufacture and/or market vehicles under the Baojun, Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet, Jiefang and Wuling brands. 
    
  Our automotive operations' interest income and interest expense are recorded centrally in Corporate. Corporate assets consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and intercompany balances. All intersegment balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The following tables summarize key financial information by segment:

Item 2.     Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 

Basis of Presentation    This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD A) should be read in conjunction with the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements and the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our 2015 Form 10-K. 
    
  Forward-looking statements in this MD A are not guarantees of future performance and may involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Refer to the "Forward-Looking Statements" section of this MD A and the "Risk Factors" section of our 2015 Form 10-K for a discussion of these risks and uncertainties. Except for per share amounts or as otherwise specified, dollar amounts presented within tables are stated in millions. 

Non-GAAP Measures    Our non-GAAP measures include earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT)-adjusted, presented net of noncontrolling interests, earnings per share (EPS)-diluted-adjusted, return on invested capital-adjusted (ROIC-adjusted) and  
  
    21 

Table of Contents  
  GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES 

adjusted automotive free cash flow. Our calculation of these non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences between companies in the method of calculation. As a result, the use of these non-GAAP measures has limitations and should not be considered superior to, in isolation from, or as a substitute for, related U.S. GAAP measures.  
    
  These non-GAAP measures allow management and investors to view operating trends, perform analytical comparisons and benchmark performance between periods and among geographic regions to understand operating performance without regard to items we do not consider a component of our core operating performance. Furthermore, these non-GAAP measures allow investors the opportunity to measure and monitor our performance against our externally communicated targets and evaluate the investment decisions being made by management to improve ROIC-adjusted. Management uses these measures in its financial, investment and operational decision-making processes, for internal reporting and as part of its forecasting and budgeting processes. Further, our Board of Directors uses these and other measures as key metrics to determine management performance under our performance-based compensation plans. For these reasons we believe these non-GAAP measures are useful for our investors.  
    
  EBIT-adjusted is used by management and can be used by investors to review our consolidated operating results because it excludes automotive interest income, automotive interest expense and income taxes as well as certain additional adjustments that are not considered part of our core operations. Examples of adjustments to EBIT include but are not limited to impairment charges related to goodwill, impairment charges on long-lived assets and other exit costs resulting from strategic shifts in our operations or discrete market and business conditions; costs arising from the ignition switch recall and related legal matters; and certain currency devaluations associated with hyperinflationary economies. For EBIT-adjusted and our other non-GAAP measures, once we have made an adjustment in the current period for an item, we will also adjust the related non-GAAP measure in any future periods in which there is an impact from the item. Refer to   Note 16   to our condensed consolidated financial statements for our reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to the most directly comparable financial measure under U.S. GAAP, Net income attributable to common stockholders. 
    
  EPS-diluted-adjusted is used by management and can be used by investors to review our consolidated diluted earnings per share results on a consistent basis. EPS-diluted-adjusted is calculated as net income attributable to common stockholders-diluted less certain adjustments noted above for EBIT-adjusted and gains or losses on the extinguishment of debt obligations on an after-tax basis as well as certain income tax adjustments divided by weighted-average common shares outstanding-diluted. Examples of income tax adjustments include the establishment or reversal of significant deferred tax asset valuation allowances. 
    
  ROIC-adjusted is used by management and can be used by investors to review our investment and capital allocation decisions. We define ROIC-adjusted as EBIT-adjusted for the trailing four quarters divided by average net assets, which is considered to be the average equity balances adjusted for average automotive debt and interest liabilities, exclusive of capital leases; average automotive net pension and OPEB liabilities; and average automotive net income tax assets during the same period. 
    
  Adjusted automotive free cash flow is used by management and can be used by investors to review the liquidity of our automotive operations and to measure and monitor our performance against our capital allocation framework and evaluate our automotive liquidity against the substantial cash requirements of our automotive operations. We measure adjusted automotive free cash flow as automotive cash flow from operations less capital expenditures adjusted for management actions, primarily related to strengthening our balance sheet, such as prepayments of debt and discretionary contributions to employee benefit plans. Refer to the  Liquidity and Capital Resources  section of this MD A for our reconciliation of Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities under U.S. GAAP to this non-GAAP measure.

    The tax effect of each adjustment is determined based on the tax laws and valuation allowance status of the jurisdiction in which the adjustment relates. 
              (b) 
    These adjustments were excluded as the tax benefits resulted from our decisions to restructure our Holden operations and withdraw our Chevrolet brand from Europe, which were each considered adjustments to EBIT in prior periods.

________ 
           (a) 
    These adjustments were excluded because of the unique events associated with the ignition switch recall. These events included the creation of the ignition switch recall compensation program, as well as various investigations, inquiries, and complaints from various constituents. 
              (b) 
    These adjustments were excluded because of the significant restructuring of our Thailand operations and the strategic actions taken to focus on the production of pick-up trucks and SUVs. 
              (c) 
    This adjustment was excluded because of the devaluation of the Venezuela Bolivar Fuerte (BsF), our inability to transact at the Complementary System of Foreign Currency Administration (SICAD) rate to obtain U.S. Dollars and the market restrictions imposed by the Venezuelan government. 
              (d) 
    These adjustments were excluded because of our decision to exit the Russia market as a result of a strategic shift in our operations. The costs primarily consisted of sales incentives, dealer restructuring and other contract cancellation costs, and asset impairments. 

Overview    Our strategic plan includes several major initiatives that we anticipate will help us achieve our goal of 9% to 10% margins on an EBIT-adjusted basis (EBIT-adjusted margins, calculated as EBIT-adjusted divided by Net sales and revenue) by early next decade: earn customers for life by delivering great products to our customers, leading the industry in quality and safety and improving the customer ownership experience; lead in technology and innovation, including OnStar 4G LTE and connected car, alternative propulsion, urban mobility including ride- and car-sharing through Maven and our investment in Lyft, active safety features and autonomous vehicles; grow our brands, particularly the Cadillac brand in the U.S. and China and the Chevrolet brand globally; continue our growth in China; continue the growth of GM Financial into our full captive automotive financing company; and deliver core operating efficiencies.

For the year ending December 31, 2016 we expect to continue to generate strong consolidated financial results including improved EBIT-adjusted and EBIT-adjusted margins and EPS-diluted-adjusted of between $5.50 and $6.00. Based on our anticipated strong business results for the second half of the year, we expect full-year EPS-diluted-adjusted to be at the high end of the range. The following table reconciles expected diluted earnings per common share under U.S. GAAP to expected EPS-diluted-adjusted: 

________ 
           (a) 
    Includes the adjustments disclosed in Note 16 to our condensed consolidated financial statements and does not consider the potential future impact of adjustments. 
              (b) 
    The tax effect of each adjustment is determined based on the tax laws and valuation allowance status of the jurisdiction in which the adjustment relates. 
       
  Our overall financial targets include expected improvement of consolidated EBIT-adjusted margins to 9% to 10% by early next decade; expected total annual operational and functional cost savings of $5.5 billion by 2018 compared to 2014 costs, which will more than offset our incremental investments in brand building, engineering and technology as we launch new products in 2016 and beyond; expected average annual adjusted automotive free cash flow of approximately $6 billion to $7 billion from 2016 to 2018; expected continued consolidated ROIC-adjusted of 20% plus; and execution of our capital allocation strategy as described below.

GMNA    In the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   industry sales to retail and fleet customers were 16.3 million units representing a 1.7% increase compared to the corresponding period in 2015 due to strong consumer demand driven by credit availability, low interest rates and low fuel prices.  
    
  In the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   our vehicle sales in the U.S., our largest market in North America, totaled   2.2 million   units for market share of   16.6%  , representing a decrease of   0.6   percentage points compared to the corresponding period in 2015. The decrease in our U.S. market share was driven by lower fleet market share due to a planned reduction in rental deliveries, partially offset by higher retail market share. U.S. retail sales, generally more profitable than fleet sales, generated an increase of   0.5   percentage points in market share, primarily driven by Chevrolet.  
    
  In the year ending December 31, 2016 we expect an EBIT-adjusted margin of approximately 10% on continued strength of U.S. industry light vehicle sales, cost performance and new product launches. Based on our current cost structure, we continue to estimate GMNA s breakeven point at the U.S. industry level to be in the range of   10.0   -   11.0 million   units. 
    
  In September 2016 we entered into a collectively bargained labor agreement with Unifor for certain hourly employees in Canada. The agreement was ratified without disruption to our operations. 
    
  GME    As a result of moderate economic growth across Europe (excluding Russia) automotive industry sales to retail and fleet customers continued improving in the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   with industry sales to retail and fleet customers of 14.2 million units representing a 7.0% increase compared to the corresponding period in 2015.

Our European operations are benefiting from this trend and vehicle sales continue to show signs of improvement underscored by further improvement in our Opel and Vauxhall retail vehicle sales of 0.9 million units for market share of   5.9%   in the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   consistent with the corresponding period in 2015. We continue to implement various strategic actions to strengthen our operations and increase our competitiveness. 
    
  We have made substantial progress towards our intention to break even by taking advantage of a recovering industry, cost optimization and the benefits of our Astra and Corsa launches, resulting in positive EBIT-adjusted in the first half of the year. However in June 2016 the U.K. completed its referendum on continued membership in the European Union voting to leave. Despite the referendum we were on track to break even for the year, as evidenced by our performance through the first nine months. The result of the referendum has adversely impacted the British Pound and the uncertainty has put strain on the U.K. automotive industry. If current post referendum market conditions are sustained throughout the remainder of 2016, we believe it could have an adverse impact of up to   $0.4 billion   to the second half of 2016 of which approximately   $0.1 billion   is reflected in our third quarter results. 
    
  The German Ministry of Transportation and the Kraftfahrt-Bundesamt have requested the participation of a number of automotive manufacturers, including our German subsidiary, in continuing discussions on emissions control issues and have also requested, from time to time, written responses from our subsidiary on the subject. Our German subsidiary has participated in these discussions and has provided the requested responses to inquiries concerning nitrogen oxide emission control systems of its diesel engines. In light of the foregoing, there could be further inquiries about nitrogen oxide and/or CO   2    emissions. These requests may lead to increased testing and re-testing of our vehicles and analysis of their emissions control systems, which could lead to increased costs, penalties, negative publicity or reputational impact, and additional vehicles may be subject to recall activity if regulators determine that emission levels and required regulatory compliance should be based on either a wider spectrum of driving conditions for future testing parameters or stricter or novel interpretations and consequent enforcement of existing requirements. No assurance can be given that the ultimate outcome of any potential investigations or increased testing resulting from this scrutiny would not materially and adversely affect us. 
    
  GMIO    Since the second quarter of 2015 we have been experiencing pricing pressures in China, increasing competition and a complex regulatory environment. Despite these pressures, in the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   China industry sales were 19.5 million units, representing an increase of 12.1% compared to the corresponding period in 2015. In the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   our China wholesale volumes increased by 4.4% compared to the corresponding period in 2015. Our market share decreased to 13.8%, down 1.0 percentage point as our volume growth was less than that of the industry. Strong growth in Cadillac, Buick and Baojun passenger vehicles, including SUVs, were partially offset by lower Chevrolet sales because of model changeover and lower Wuling sales because of a continued segment shift away from mini commercial vehicles. In the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   our Automotive China JVs generated equity income of $1.4 billion and margins of 9.3%. We expect industry growth and continuation of pricing pressures of approximately 5%, which will continue to pressure margins, in 2016. We continue to expect an increase in vehicle sales driven by new launches and expect to sustain strong China equity income and margins by focusing on vehicle mix improvements, cost improvements and efficiencies and downstream performance optimization.  
    
  Lack of political stability, low commodity prices and foreign exchange volatility, among other factors, negatively impacted the overall automotive industry in the rest of Asia Pacific, Africa and the Middle East and led to industry sales of 14.1 million units, representing a decrease of   2.7%   in the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the corresponding period in 2015. In the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   our retail sales totaled   0.5 million   units leading to a market share of   3.5%  , representing a decrease of 0.6 percentage points compared to the corresponding period in 2015. The decrease in retail sales volumes was due primarily to overall industry volume declines, foreign currency availability and economic challenges in the Middle East, Egypt and South Africa. 
    
  To address the significant industry, market share, pricing and foreign exchange pressures in the region, we continue to focus on product portfolio enhancements, manufacturing footprint rationalization, increased local sourcing of parts, cost structure reductions, as well as brand and dealer network improvements which we expect to favorably impact the region over the medium term. As we continue to assess our performance throughout the region, additional restructuring and rationalization actions may be required and may have a material impact on our results of operations. 
    
  GMSA      The South American automotive industry continues to be challenged by weak economic conditions and lack of consumer confidence. Industry sales to retail and fleet customers were   2.7 million   units in the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   representing a 14.9% decrease compared to the corresponding period in 2015. In the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   our  
  
    26

vehicle sales in Brazil, our largest market in South America, totaled   0.2 million   units for market share of 16.3%, representing an increase of 1.5 percentage points compared to the corresponding period in 2015 primarily driven by Chevrolet Onix sales. 
    
  We continue to monitor economic conditions in South America and believe that adverse economic conditions and their effects on the automotive industry will likely continue. While we continue to take actions to address these challenges, no assurance can be provided that such efforts will prevent material future losses, asset impairments or other charges. 
    
  During the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   we continued to consolidate our Venezuelan subsidiaries. Our Venezuelan subsidiaries may require additional financial support, which, at this time, we have not made a decision to provide. If a determination is made in the future that we no longer maintain control we may incur a charge based on exchange rates at   September 30, 2016   of less than   $0.1 billion  . 
    
  Corporate      In connection with our capital allocation framework, as detailed in the "Liquidity and Capital Resources" section of MD A in our 2015 Form 10-K, we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized a program to purchase up to $5 billion of our common stock before the end of 2016, which we completed one quarter ahead of schedule in the three months ended September 30, 2016. In January 2016 we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized the purchase of up to an additional $4 billion of our common stock (an aggregate total of $9 billion) before the end of 2017. Through   October 21, 2016   we had purchased an aggregate of   150 million   shares of our outstanding common stock under our common stock repurchase program for   $5.0 billion  . Also, in January 2016 we announced an increase of our quarterly common stock dividend to $0.38 per share effective in the first quarter of 2016. 
    
  The Ignition Switch Recall has led to various inquiries, investigations, subpoenas, requests for information and complaints from Congress, the SEC, Transport Canada and   50   state attorneys general. In addition these and other recalls have resulted in a number of claims and lawsuits. Such lawsuits and investigations could in the future result in the imposition of material damages, fines, civil consent orders, civil and criminal penalties or other remedies. Refer to   Note 11   to our condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
    
  Takata Matters    On May 4, 2016 NHTSA issued an amended consent order requiring Takata to file DIRs for previously unrecalled front airbag inflators that contain an ammonium nitrate-based propellant without a moisture absorbing desiccant on a multi-year, risk-based schedule through 2019 impacting tens of millions of vehicles produced by numerous automotive manufacturers. NHTSA concluded that the likely root cause of the rupturing of the airbag inflators is a function of time, temperature cycling and environmental moisture. On May 16, 2016 Takata issued its first DIR in connection with the amended consent order. Its next DIR is due to be filed on December 31, 2016. 
    
  Although we do not believe there is a safety defect at this time in any GM vehicles within the scope of the Takata DIR, in cooperation with NHTSA we filed a Preliminary DIR on May 27, 2016, updated as of June 13, 2016, covering   2.5 million   of certain of our GMT900 vehicles, which are full-size pick-up trucks and SUVs. As a result of discussions with NHTSA and as described in the Preliminary DIR, GM believes it will have an opportunity to prove to NHTSA that the inflators in these vehicles do not and will not pose an unreasonable risk to safety. We believe these vehicles are currently performing as designed and ongoing testing continues to support the belief that the vehicles' unique design and integration mitigates against inflator degradation. For example, the airbag inflators used in the vehicles are a variant engineered specifically for our vehicles, and include features such as greater venting, unique propellant wafer configurations, and machined steel end caps. The inflators are packaged in the instrument panel in such a way as to minimize exposure to moisture from the climate control system. Also, these vehicles have features that minimize the maximum temperature to which the inflator will be exposed, such as larger interior volumes and standard solar absorbing windshields and side glass. Further, our field deployment data contains no reports of inflator rupture in these vehicles during the estimated 55,000 field deployments that have occurred in these vehicles since the start of production or in the ballistic testing of inflators recovered from vehicles in the field. We presently believe that the results of further testing and analysis will continue to demonstrate that the vehicles do not present an unreasonable risk to safety and that no repair will ultimately be required. 
    
  Based, in part, on the results of our testing, analysis and data to date, on September 2, 2016, we filed a petition with NHTSA to delay inclusion of GMT900 vehicles in the Takata DIR equipment schedule from December 31, 2016 until December 31, 2017. We believe that this timeline will permit us to complete our testing of the relevant non-desiccated Takata inflators in GMT900 vehicles.  
    
  Accordingly, no provision has been made for any repair associated with our vehicles subject to the Preliminary DIR and amended consent order. However, in the event we are ultimately obligated to repair the inflators in these vehicles, we estimate a reasonably  
  
    27

possible cost of up to   $320 million   for the   2.5 million   vehicles subject to the Preliminary DIR and an additional   $550 million   for up to   4.3 million   vehicles subject to future Takata DIRs under the amended consent order. 
    
  On July 28, 2016, a putative class action was filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey claiming that numerous 2003 - 2011 model year GM vehicles are defective because they are equipped with Takata airbags and alleging, among other things, fraud and breach of warranty. The complaint seeks nationwide class certification or, alternatively, certification of various state classes, damages, costs and fees. At this early stage of the proceedings, we are unable to provide an evaluation of the likelihood that a loss will be incurred or an estimate of the amounts or range of possible loss. 

Vehicle Sales    We present both wholesale and retail vehicle sales data to assist in the analysis of our revenue and our market share. We do not currently export vehicles to Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Sudan or Syria. Accordingly these countries are excluded from industry sales data and corresponding calculations of our market share.  
    
  Wholesale vehicle sales data, which represents sales directly to dealers and others, is the measure that correlates to our revenue from the sale of vehicles, which is the largest component of Automotive net sales and revenue. Wholesale vehicle sales exclude  
  vehicles produced by joint ventures. In the nine months ended   September 30, 2016     46.1%   of our wholesale vehicle sales volume was generated outside the U.S. The following table summarizes total wholesale vehicle sales of new vehicles by automotive segment (vehicles in thousands):  

Retail vehicle sales data, which represents sales to end customers based upon the good faith estimates of management, including fleets, does not correlate directly to the revenue we recognize during the period. However retail vehicle sales data is indicative of the underlying demand for our vehicles. Market share information is based primarily on retail vehicle sales volume. In countries where retail vehicle sales data is not readily available other data sources, such as wholesale or forecast volumes, are used to estimate retail vehicle sales to end customers.  
    
  Retail vehicle sales data includes all sales by joint ventures on a total vehicle basis, not based on the percentage of ownership in the joint venture. Certain joint venture agreements in China allow for the contractual right to report vehicle sales of non-GM trademarked vehicles by those joint ventures. Retail vehicle sales data includes vehicles used by dealers under courtesy transportation programs and vehicles sold through the dealer registration channel primarily in Europe. This sales channel consists primarily of dealer demonstrator, loaner and self-registered vehicles which are not eligible to be sold as new vehicles after being registered by dealers. Certain fleet sales that are accounted for as operating leases are included in retail vehicle sales at the time of delivery to daily rental car companies. The following table summarizes total industry retail sales, or estimated sales where retail sales volume is not available, of vehicles and our related competitive position by geographic region (vehicles in thousands):

    Our China sales include the Automotive China JVs SAIC General Motors Sales Co., Ltd. (SGMS), SAIC GM Wuling Automobile Co., Ltd. (SGMW) and FAW-GM Light Duty Commercial Vehicle Co., Ltd. (FAW-GM). End customer data is not readily available for the industry; therefore, wholesale volumes were used for Industry, GM and Market Share. Our retail sales in China were 908 and 774 in the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   and 2,718 and 2,493 in the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
       
  In the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   we estimate we had the largest market share in North America and South America, the number four market share in the Asia/Pacific, Middle East and Africa region and the number eight market share in Europe.  
    
  The sales and market share data provided in the table above includes both fleet vehicle sales and sales to retail customers. Certain fleet transactions, particularly sales to daily rental car companies, are generally less profitable than sales to retail customers. A significant portion of the sales to daily rental car companies are recorded as operating leases under U.S. GAAP with no recognition of revenue at the date of initial delivery due to guaranteed repurchase obligations.

GM Financial Summary and Outlook    GM Financial has expanded its leasing, near prime and prime lending programs in North America; therefore, leasing and prime lending have become an increasingly large percentage of the originations and retail portfolio balance. In the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015 GM Financial's revenue primarily consisted of leased vehicle income of 60.7% and 39.9%, retail finance charge income of 31.5% and 49.0% and commercial finance charge income of 4.7% and 6.6%. We believe that offering a comprehensive suite of financing products will generate incremental sales of our vehicles, drive incremental GM Financial earnings and help support our sales throughout various economic cycles.     In the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   GM Financial's retail penetration in North America grew to approximately 33%, up from approximately 28% in the corresponding period in 2015. 

Consolidated Results    We review changes in our results of operations under five categories: volume, mix, price, cost and other. Volume measures the impact of changes in wholesale vehicle volumes driven by industry volume, market share and changes in dealer stock levels. Mix measures the impact of changes to the regional portfolio due to product, model, trim, country and option penetration in current year wholesale vehicle volumes. Price measures the impact of changes related to Manufacturer s Suggested Retail Price and various sales allowances. Cost includes primarily: (1) material and freight; (2) manufacturing, engineering, advertising, administrative and selling and policy and warranty expense; and (3) non-vehicle related activity. Other includes primarily foreign exchange and non-vehicle related automotive revenues as well as equity income or loss from our nonconsolidated affiliates.

Liquidity and Capital Resources    We believe that our current level of cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and availability under our revolving credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs. We expect to have substantial cash requirements going forward which we plan to fund through total available liquidity and cash flows generated from operations. We also maintain access to the capital markets and may issue debt or equity securities from time to time, which may provide an additional source of liquidity. Our future uses of cash, which may vary from time to time based on market conditions and other factors, are focused on three objectives: (1) reinvest in our business; (2) maintain an investment-grade balance sheet; and (3) return cash to stockholders. Our known future material uses of cash include, among other possible demands: (1) capital expenditures of approximately   $9 billion   annually as well as payments for engineering and product development activities; (2) payments associated with previously announced vehicle recalls, the settlements of the multidistrict litigation and any other recall-related contingencies; (3) payments to service debt and other long-term obligations, including discretionary and mandatory contributions to our pension plans; (4) payments for previously announced restructuring activities; (5) dividend payments on our common stock that are declared by our Board of Directors; and (6) payments to purchase shares of our common stock under programs authorized by our Board of Directors. 
    
  Our liquidity plans are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those described in the "Forward-Looking Statements" section of this MD A and the  Risk Factors  section of our 2015 Form 10-K, some of which are outside of our control.  
    
  We continue to monitor and evaluate opportunities to strengthen our competitive position over the long term while maintaining an investment-grade balance sheet. These actions may include opportunistic payments to reduce our long-term obligations as well as the possibility of acquisitions, dispositions, investments with joint venture partners and strategic alliances that we believe would generate significant advantages and substantially strengthen our business. These actions may negatively impact our liquidity in the short term. 
    
  Management's capital allocation framework includes a combined cash and marketable securities balance target of $20 billion and plans to reinvest in the business at an average target ROIC-adjusted rate of 20% or greater. In connection with this framework we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized a program to purchase up to $5 billion of our common stock before the

end of 2016, which we completed one quarter ahead of schedule in the three months ended September 30, 2016. In January 2016 we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized the purchase of up to an additional $4 billion of our common stock (an aggregate total of $9 billion) before the end of 2017. Also, in January 2016 we announced an increase of our quarterly common stock dividend to $0.38 per share effective in the three months ended March 31, 2016. Through   October 21, 2016   we had purchased an aggregate of   150 million   shares of our outstanding common stock under our common stock repurchase program for   $5.0 billion  . 
    
  In February 2016 we issued   $2.0 billion   in aggregate principal amount of automotive senior unsecured notes and used the entire net proceeds to fund discretionary contributions to our U.S. hourly pension plan in the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   to improve its funded status. Refer to   Note 8   to our condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information on the senior unsecured notes. 
    
  In May 2016 we amended our two primary revolving credit facilities, increasing our aggregate borrowing capacity from   $12.5 billion   to   $14.5 billion  . These facilities consist of a three-year,   $4.0 billion   facility and a five-year,   $10.5 billion   facility. Both facilities are available to us as well as certain wholly-owned subsidiaries, including GM Financial. The three-year,   $4.0 billion   facility allows for borrowings in U.S. Dollars and other currencies and includes a GM Financial borrowing sub-limit of   $1.0 billion   and a letter of credit sub-facility of   $1.0 billion  . The five-year,   $10.5 billion   facility allows for borrowings in U.S. Dollars and other currencies and includes a GM Financial borrowing sub-limit of   $3.0 billion   and a letter of credit sub-limit of   $500 million  . 

Automotive Liquidity    Total available liquidity includes cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and funds available under credit facilities. The amount of available liquidity is subject to intra-month and seasonal fluctuations and includes balances held by various business units and subsidiaries worldwide that are needed to fund their operations. There have been no significant changes in the management of our liquidity, including the allocation of our available liquidity, the composition of our portfolio and our investment guidelines since December 31, 2015. Refer to the  Liquidity and Capital Resources  section of MD A in our 2015 Form 10-K. 
    
  We use credit facilities as a mechanism to provide additional flexibility in managing our global liquidity. The total size of our credit facilities was   $14.6 billion   at   September 30, 2016   and   $12.6 billion   at December 31, 2015, which consisted principally of our two primary revolving credit facilities. We did not have any borrowings against our primary facilities, but had letters of credit outstanding under our sub-facility of   $0.6 billion   at   September 30, 2016  . GM Financial had access to our revolving credit facilities at   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015 but did not borrow against them. We had intercompany loans from GM Financial of   $0.8 billion   and   $0.4 billion   at   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, which consisted primarily of amounts used to fund company vehicles and for commercial loans to dealers we consolidate. At   September 30, 2016   GM Financial had borrowed   $0.4 billion   from us in connection with the funding commitments under the support agreement entered into in September 2014, which is expected to be repaid during the fourth quarter of 2016.

Automotive Cash Flow (Dollars in Billions) 

In the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   the change in Pension and OPEB activities was due primarily to discretionary contributions of $2.0 billion made to our U.S. hourly pension plan. The change in Working capital was due primarily to increased accounts payable due to increased production volumes. The changes in Equipment on operating leases and Accrued liabilities and other liabilities were due primarily to the reduction of units delivered to rental car companies. The change in Income taxes was due primarily to an increase in pre-tax income. The change in Other was related primarily to foreign currency remeasurements. 

In the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   the change in Acquisitions and liquidations of marketable securities, net was due primarily to the rebalancing of our investment portfolio between marketable securities and cash and cash equivalents as part of liquidity management in the normal course of business.

Status of Credit Ratings   We receive ratings from four independent credit rating agencies: DBRS Limited, Fitch, Moody's and S P. In February 2016 Moody's revised their outlook to Positive from Stable. In March 2016 DBRS Limited upgraded our corporate rating and revolving credit facilities rating to BBB from BBB (low) and revised their outlook to Stable from Positive. In April 2016 S P revised their outlook to Positive from Stable. In June 2016 Fitch revised their outlook to Positive from Stable. Ratings on the amended and restated revolving credit facilities are unchanged. 

Automotive Financing   GM Financial Liquidity    GM Financial's primary sources of cash are finance charge income, leasing income and proceeds from the sale of terminated leased vehicles, servicing fees, net distributions from secured debt facilities, including securitizations, secured and unsecured borrowings and collections and recoveries on finance receivables. GM Financial's primary uses of cash are purchases of retail finance receivables and leased vehicles, the funding of commercial finance receivables, repayment of secured and unsecured debt, funding credit enhancement requirements in connection with securitizations and secured debt facilities, operating expenses and interest costs. GM Financial continues to monitor and evaluate opportunities to optimize its liquidity position and the mix of its debt. The following table summarizes GM Financial's available liquidity (dollars in billions):  

In the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   available liquidity increased due primarily to: (1) additional capacity on new and renewed secured credit facilities; and (2) increased borrowing capacity resulting from the issuance of unsecured debt and increased retail deposits. 
    
  As previously mentioned GM Financial has the ability to borrow up to   $1.0 billion   against our three-year,   $4.0 billion   revolving credit facility and up to   $3.0 billion   against our five-year,   $10.5 billion   revolving credit facility.

Critical Accounting Estimates    The condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which requires the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses in the periods presented. We believe the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and the resulting balances are reasonable; however, due to the inherent uncertainties in developing estimates, actual results could differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustments to these balances in future periods. The critical accounting estimates that affect the condensed consolidated financial statements and the judgments and assumptions used are consistent with those described in the MD A section in our 2015 Form 10-K. 

Forward-Looking Statements    In this report and in reports we subsequently file and have previously filed with the SEC on Forms 10-K and 10-Q and file or furnish on Form 8-K, and in related comments by our management, we use words like  anticipate,   appears,   approximately,   believe,   continue,   could,   designed,   effect,   estimate,   evaluate,   expect,   forecast,   goal,   initiative,   intend,   may,   objective,   outlook,   plan,   potential,   priorities,   project,   pursue,   seek,   will,   should,   target,   when,   would,  or the negative of any of those words or similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements that represent our current judgment about possible future events. In making these statements we rely on assumptions and analyses based on our experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments as well as other factors we consider appropriate under the circumstances. We believe these judgments are reasonable, but these statements are not guarantees of any events or financial results, and our actual results may differ materially due to a variety of important factors, both positive and negative. These factors, which may be revised or supplemented in subsequent reports on SEC Forms 10-Q and 8-K, include, among others: (1) our ability to maintain profitability over the long-term, including our ability to fund and introduce new and improved vehicle models that are able to attract a sufficient number of consumers; (2) the success of our full-size pick-up trucks and SUVs; (3) global automobile market sales volume, which can be volatile; (4) the results of our joint ventures, which we cannot operate solely for our benefit and over which we may have limited control; (5) our ability to realize production efficiencies and to achieve reductions in costs as we implement operating effectiveness initiatives throughout our automotive operations; (6) our ability to maintain quality control over our vehicles and avoid material vehicle recalls and the cost and effect on our reputation and products; (7) our ability to maintain adequate liquidity and financing sources including as required to fund our new technology; (8) our ability to realize successful vehicle applications of new technology and our ability to deliver new products, services and customer experiences in response to new participants in the automotive industry; (9) volatility in the price of oil; (10) the ability of our suppliers to deliver parts, systems and components without disruption and at such times to allow us to meet production schedules; (11) risks associated with our manufacturing facilities around the world; (12) our ability to manage the distribution channels for our products; (13) our ability to successfully restructure our operations in various countries; (14) the continued availability of wholesale and retail financing in markets in which we operate to support the sale of our vehicles, which is dependent on those entities' ability to obtain funding and their continued willingness to provide financing; (15) changes in economic conditions, commodity prices, housing prices, foreign currency exchange rates or political stability in the markets in which we operate; (16) significant changes in the competitive environment, including the effect of competition and excess manufacturing capacity in our markets, on our pricing policies or use of incentives and the introduction of new and improved

vehicle models by our competitors; (17) significant changes in economic, political, regulatory and market conditions in the countries in which we operate, particularly China, with the effect of competition from new market entrants and in the United Kingdom with passage of a referendum to discontinue membership in the European Union; (18) changes in existing, or the adoption of new, laws, regulations, policies or other activities of governments, agencies and similar organizations, particularly laws, regulations and policies relating to vehicle safety including recalls, and including such actions that may affect the production, licensing, distribution or sale of our products, the cost thereof or applicable tax rates; (19) stricter or novel interpretations and consequent enforcement of existing laws, regulations and policies; (20) costs and risks associated with litigation and government investigations including the potential imposition of damages, substantial fines, civil lawsuits and criminal penalties, interruptions of business, modification of business practices, equitable remedies and other sanctions against us in connection with various legal proceedings and investigations relating to our various recalls; (21) our ability to comply with the terms of the DPA; (22) our ability to manage risks related to security breaches and other disruptions to our vehicles, information technology networks and systems; (23) significant increases in our pension expense or projected pension contributions resulting from changes in the value of plan assets, the discount rate applied to value the pension liabilities or mortality or other assumption changes; (24) our continued ability to develop captive financing capability through GM Financial; and (25) changes in accounting principles, or their application or interpretation, and our ability to make estimates and the assumptions underlying the estimates, which could have an effect on earnings. 
    
  We caution readers not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update publicly or otherwise revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or other factors that affect the subject of these statements, except where we are expressly required to do so by law.
