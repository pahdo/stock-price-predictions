SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
    
  This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and its exhibits contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Forward-looking statements relate to expectations, beliefs, projections, future plans and strategies, anticipated events or trends and similar expressions concerning matters that are not historical facts. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by the use of forward-looking terminology such as  may,   will,   should,   expects,   intends,   plans,   anticipates,   believes,   estimates,   predicts,  or  potential  or the negative of these words and phrases or similar words or phrases which are predictions of or indicate future events or trends and which do not relate solely to historical matters. You can also identify forward-looking statements by discussions of strategy, plans or intentions. Examples of forward-looking statements include statements about our projected operating results, our ability to successfully lease and operate acquired properties, including turnover rates, projected operating costs, estimates relating to our ability to make distributions to our stockholders in the future, market trends in our industry, real estate values and prices, and the general economy. 
    
  The forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report reflect our current views about future events and are subject to numerous known and unknown risks, uncertainties, assumptions and changes in circumstances that may cause our actual results to differ significantly from those expressed or implied in any forward-looking statement. We are not able to predict all of the factors that may affect future results. We caution you therefore against relying on any of these forward-looking statements. They are neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees or assurances of future performance. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements include national, international, regional or local economic, business, competitive, market and regulatory conditions and the following: 

Those factors described in the discussion on risk factors in Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 (and any updates to those risk factors included in Part II, Item 1A,  Risk Factors,  in this Quarterly Report), Part I, Item 2,  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  and Part I, Item 3, "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk" in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and other risks and uncertainties detailed in this and our other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission; 

Our ability to successfully employ a new and untested business model in a new industry with no proven track record; 

Poor performance of the properties acquired in the Portfolio Acquisition (defined below); 

Increases in interest rates and interest rate volatility and our failure to effectively hedge against potential interest rate changes, which may be impacted by international events such as the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union, commonly referred to as "Brexit";  

Real estate appreciation or depreciation in our markets and the supply of single-family homes in our markets; 

General economic conditions in our markets, such as changes in employment and household earnings and expenses or the reversal of population, employment, or homeownership trends in our markets that could affect the demand for rental housing; 

Our ability to maintain high occupancy rates and to attract and retain qualified residents in light of increased competition in the leasing market for quality residents and the relatively short duration of our leases; 

Our ability to maintain rents at levels that are sufficient to keep pace with rising costs of operations; 

Lease defaults by our residents; 

Our ability to contain renovation, maintenance, turnover, marketing, and other operating costs for our properties; 

Our ability to continue to build our operational expertise and to establish our platform and processes related to residential management; 

Our dependence on key personnel to carry out our business and investment strategies and our ability to hire and retain skilled managerial, investment, financial, and operational personnel; 

1 

     Table of Contents     

The performance of third-party vendors and service providers, including third-party management professionals, maintenance providers, leasing agents, and property managers; 

Our ability to obtain additional capital or debt financing to expand our portfolio of single-family properties and our ability to repay our debt, including borrowings under our revolving credit facility and securitization loan and to meet our other obligations under our revolving credit facility and securitization loan; 

Competition from other investors in identifying and acquiring single-family properties that meet our underwriting criteria and leasing such properties to qualified residents; 

The availability of additional properties that meet our criteria and our ability to purchase such properties on favorable terms; 

The accuracy of assumptions in determining whether a particular property meets our investment criteria, including assumptions related to estimated time of possession and estimated renovation costs and time frames, annual operating costs, market rental rates and potential rent amounts, time from purchase to leasing, and resident default rates; 

Our ability to accurately estimate the time and expense required to possess, renovate, repair, upgrade, and rent properties and to keep them maintained in rentable condition, and the existence of unforeseen defects and problems that require extensive renovation and capital expenditures; 

The concentration of our investments in single-family properties which subject us to risks inherent in investments in a single type of property and seasonal fluctuations in rental demand; 

The concentration of our properties in our markets, which increases the risk of adverse changes in our operating results if there were adverse developments in local economic conditions or the demand for single-family rental homes or natural disasters in these markets; and 

Failure to qualify as a REIT or to remain qualified as a REIT, which will subject us to federal income tax at regular corporate rates and could subject us to a substantial tax liability. 
       
  The forward-looking statements in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q represent our views as of the date of this Quarterly Report. We anticipate that subsequent events and developments will cause our views to change. However, while we may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we have no current intention of doing so except to the extent required by applicable laws. You should, therefore, not rely on these forward-looking statements as representing our views as of any date subsequent to the date of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.

  NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) 
  Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 
  (amounts in thousands, except share data and property counts) 

Note 1.  Organization and Operations 
    
  Silver Bay Realty Trust Corp. ("Silver Bay" or the "Company") is a Maryland corporation that focuses on the acquisition, renovation, leasing and management of single-family properties in select markets in the United States. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company owned   8,837   single-family properties for rental purposes in Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia  ,   Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina and Texas, excluding properties reflected as assets held for sale on its condensed consolidated balance sheets.  
    
  In connection with its initial public offering in 2012, the Company restructured its ownership to conduct its business through a traditional umbrella partnership in which substantially all of its assets are held by, and its operations are conducted through, Silver Bay Operating Partnership L.P. (the "Operating Partnership"), a Delaware limited partnership. This structure is commonly referred to as an "UPREIT". The Company's wholly owned subsidiary, Silver Bay Management LLC, is the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company owned, through a combination of direct and indirect interests,   94.1%   of the partnership interests in the Operating Partnership.   
    
  The Company has elected to be treated as a real estate investment trust ("REIT") for U.S. federal tax purposes, commencing with, and in connection with the filing of its federal tax return for, its taxable year ended December 31, 2012. As a REIT, the Company will generally not be subject to federal income tax on the taxable income that it distributes to its stockholders. If the Company fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, it will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates. Even if it qualifies for taxation as a REIT, the Company may be subject to some federal, state and local taxes on its income or property. In addition, the income of any taxable REIT subsidiary ("TRS") that the Company owns will be subject to taxation at regular corporate rates. 
    
  During 2015, the Company acquired a portfolio of   2,461   properties from The American Home Real Estate Investment Trust, Inc. (the "Portfolio Acquisition"). The Portfolio Acquisition was substantially completed on April 1, 2015 with an aggregate purchase price of   $263,000  . The Portfolio Acquisition was financed using proceeds obtained under the Company's revolving credit facility, which was amended and restated on February 18, 2015 to increase the borrowing capacity to   $400,000   from   $200,000  . The properties acquired in the Portfolio Acquisition are primarily located in Atlanta, GA, Charlotte, NC, Tampa, FL and Orlando, FL. 

Note 2.  Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies 
    
  Consolidation and Basis of Presentation 
    
  The interim unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). Certain information and note disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), have been condensed or omitted according to such SEC rules and regulations. Management believes, however, that the disclosures included in these interim condensed consolidated financial statements are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . In the opinion of management, all normal and recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly the financial condition of the Company at   September 30, 2016   and results of operations for all periods presented have been made. The results of operations for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   may not be indicative of the results for a full year.    
    
  The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, the Operating Partnership and its consolidated subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The Company consolidates real estate partnerships and other entities that are not variable interest entities ("VIE") when it owns, directly or indirectly, a majority voting interest in the entity or is otherwise able to control the entity. The Company consolidates VIEs in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 810,   Consolidation  , if the primary beneficiary of the VIE as determined by its power to direct the VIEs activities and the obligation to absorb its losses or the right to receive its benefits, which are potentially significant to the VIE. Ownership interests in certain consolidated subsidiaries of the Company held by

  (amounts in thousands, except share data and property counts) 

outside parties are included in noncontrolling interest within the condensed consolidated financial statements. The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. 
    
  Use of Estimates 
    
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions regarding future events that may affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The Company s estimates are inherently subjective in nature and actual results could differ from these estimates. 
    
  Reclassifications 
    
  Certain reclassifications have been made to amounts in prior period financial statements to conform to current period presentation. These reclassifications have not changed the previously reported results of operations or stockholders' equity.  
    
  Escrow Deposits 
    
  Escrow deposits include cash held in reserve at financial institutions, as required by the Company's debt agreements described in Note 4, refundable earnest money deposits associated with the acquisition described in Note 3, and money held at financial institutions for cash flow hedge collateral.  
    
  Income Taxes 
    
  The Company intends to operate and to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") and intends to comply with the requirements of the Code relating to REITs. The Company has TRSs where certain investments may be made and activities conducted that may have otherwise been subject to the prohibited transactions tax or may not be favorably treated for purposes of complying with the various requirements for REIT qualification. The income and 
  losses within the TRSs are subject to federal, state, and local income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. The Company recognized income tax expense of   $424   and   $1,102   in the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to   $48   and   $147   in the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively, primarily related to income taxes on net gain on disposition of real estate in the TRS entities.    
    
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  Under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the "JOBS Act"), the Company meets the definition of an  emerging growth company.  The Company has irrevocably elected to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised U.S. accounting standards pursuant to Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act. As a result, the Company will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. The Company will cease to be an "emerging growth company" under the JOBS Act on December 31, 2017. 
    
  The Company considers the applicability and impact of all accounting standard updates ("ASUs"). ASUs not listed below were assessed and determined to be either not applicable or are expected to have minimal impact on the Company's consolidated financial position or results of operations. 
    
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers  , which creates a new Topic, Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606. The standard is principle-based and provides a five-step model to determine when and how revenue is recognized. The core principle is that a company should recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This standard is effective for interim or annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and allows for either full retrospective or modified retrospective adoption. Early adoption of this standard is only allowed as of the original effective date, annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of Topic 606 will have on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02,   Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis.   This update is intended to improve targeted areas of consolidation guidance by simplifying the consolidation evaluation process, and by placing more emphasis on risk of loss when determining a controlling financial interest. The Company adopted ASU 2015-02 during the

  (amounts in thousands, except share data and property counts) 

quarter ended March 31, 2016.     Based on the Company's review and subsequent analysis of its legal entities structure, the Company concluded that the Operating Partnership is a VIE as the limited partners of the Operating Partnership do not have substantive kick-out rights. As the general partner and controlling owner of   94.1%   of the Operating Partnership, the Company will continue to consolidate the Operating Partnership under this new guidance. 
    
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03,   Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.   The amendments in this ASU require that debt     issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with the original issue discount, rather than as an asset. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by the amendments in this ASU and will continue to be reported as interest expense. This guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015. The Company adopted this ASU as of January 1, 2016 and as a result of the retrospective adoption of this guidance, deferred financing costs, net of amortization of   $6,441   and   $8,139   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, are netted against the carrying values of the securitization loan. Previously, these costs were recorded as part of deferred financing costs,     net on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.     Additionally, in accordance with ASU 2015-15,   Interest-Imputation of Interest: Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements,   issued in August 2015, the Company will continue to present debt issuance costs related to its revolving credit facility as an asset within other assets on the condensed consolidated balance sheets and amortize them ratably over the term of the related facility. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases  , which will require lessees to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for the rights and obligations created by all leases with terms of more than one year. Lessor accounting will remain similar to lessor accounting under previous GAAP, while aligning with the FASB's new revenue recognition guidance. The guidance will be effective for the Company for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and for interim periods within those annual periods, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this ASU will have on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  . The amendments in this ASU include multiple provisions intended to simplify various aspects of the accounting for share-based payments. The guidance will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and for interim reporting periods within those annual periods, with early adoption permitted. The Company does not anticipate the adoption of this ASU will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.  
    
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,   Financial Instruments - Credit Losses, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments  , which changes how companies will measure credit losses for certain financial assets. This guidance requires an entity to estimate its expected credit losses and record an allowance based on this estimate so that it is presented at the net amount expected to be collected on the financial asset. The guidance will be effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019 and interim periods within that reporting period with early adoption permitted beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within that reporting period. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this ASU will have on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  , which clarifies how certain cash receipts and cash payments should be presented and classified on the statement of cash flow. The guidance will be effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods within that reporting period. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this ASU will have on its consolidated financial statements. 

Note 3. Investments in Real Estate 
    
  Acquisition of Properties 
    
  On October 1, 2016, the Company completed the acquisition of a portfolio of   322   homes located in its core markets. The aggregate purchase price for the acquisition was   $41,455   which was primarily financed using proceeds obtained under the Company s revolving credit facility. In order to complete the transaction on October 1, 2016, the Company placed   $39,675   in earnest money deposit with a third party escrow agent as of   September 30, 2016  . The homes are located in Atlanta, GA, Tampa, FL and Orlando, FL.

Securitization Loan 
    
  On August 12, 2014, the Company completed a securitization transaction (the "Securitization Transaction") in which a newly-formed special purpose entity (the "Borrower") entered into a loan with a third-party lender for   $312,667   represented by a promissory note (the "Securitization Loan"). The Borrower is wholly-owned by another special purpose entity (the "Equity Owner"), and the Equity Owner is wholly-owned by the Operating Partnership. The Borrower and Equity Owner are separate legal entities, but continue to be reported in the Company s condensed consolidated financial statements. 
    
  The Securitization Loan provides for monthly payments at a blended rate equal to the one-month LIBOR plus   1.84%   and a monthly servicing fee of   0.1355%   (excluding the amortization of the original issue discount and deferred financing costs). The Securitization Loan has a blended effective rate of one-month LIBOR plus   1.94%  , including the amortization of the original issue discount, plus monthly servicing fees of   0.1355%  . The Securitization Loan was issued at a discount of   $1,503  , which will be accreted and recognized to interest expense through the fully extended maturity date of September 9, 2019. In the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company incurred gross interest expense of   $1,917   and   $5,611  , respectively, excluding amortization of the discount, deferred financing costs and other fees. In the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , the Company incurred gross interest expense of   $1,706   and   $5,081  , respectively, excluding amortization of the discount, deferred financing costs and other fees. As of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, the loan had a weighted-average interest rate of   2.50%   and   2.30%  , respectively, which is inclusive of the monthly servicing fees, but excludes amortization of the original issue discount, deferred financing costs and interest rate cap accretion.  
    
  During the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company paid down   $910   and   $6,866  , respectively, on the Securitization Loan to effect the release of certain properties from the first priority mortgages securing the Securitization Loan, including certain properties sold from the Southeast Florida and Houston, TX markets as described in Note 3. 
       
  The Securitization Loan had an initial term of   two   years, with   three  ,   12  -month extension options, resulting in a fully extended maturity date of September 9, 2019. The Borrower may execute the extension options provided there is no event of default under the Securitization Loan, the Borrower obtains a replacement interest rate cap agreement in a form reasonably acceptable to the lender and the Borrower complies with the other terms set forth in the loan agreement. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company executed the   first     12  -month extension option.  
       
  As part of the Securitization Transaction, the Securitization Loan (including the related promissory note) was transferred by the third-party lender to one of the Company's subsidiaries and subsequently deposited into a REMIC trust in exchange for pass-through certificates. The pass-through certificates represent the entire beneficial interest in the trust and were sold to investors in a private offering through the placement agents retained for the transaction for gross proceeds of   $311,164  , net of the original issue discount of   $1,503  .  
    
  All amounts outstanding under the Securitization Loan are secured by first priority mortgages on the securitization properties (the "Securitization Properties"), a pool of approximately   3,000   properties, in addition to the equity interests in, and certain assets of, the Borrower. The amounts outstanding under the Securitization Loan and certain obligations contained therein are guaranteed by the Operating Partnership only in the case of certain bad acts (including bankruptcy) as outlined in the transaction documents. As long as the Securitization Loan is outstanding, the assets of the Borrower and Equity Owner are not available to satisfy the debts and obligations of the Company or its other consolidated subsidiaries and the liabilities of the Borrower and Equity Owner are not liabilities of the Company (excluding, for this purpose, the Borrower and Equity Owner) or its other consolidated subsidiaries. The Company is permitted to receive distributions from the Borrower out of unrestricted cash as long as the Borrower is current with all payments and in compliance with all other obligations under the Securitization Loan. 
    
  The Securitization Loan provides for the restriction of cash whereby the Company must set aside funds for payment of real estate taxes, capital expenditures and other reserves associated with the Securitization Properties. There is also a cash management account controlled by the lender for the collection of all rents and cash generated by the Borrower's properties. In the event of default, the lender may apply funds, as the lender elects, from the cash management account, foreclose on its security interests, appoint a new property manager, and in limited circumstances, enforce the Company's guaranty. As of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, the Company had   $6,060   and   $5,139  , respectively, included in escrow deposits associated with the required reserves on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.

  (amounts in thousands, except share data and property counts) 

The Securitization Loan does not contractually restrict the Company's ability to pay dividends but certain covenants contained therein may limit the amount of cash available for distribution. The Securitization Loan documents require the Company to maintain certain covenants, including a minimum debt yield on the Securitization Properties, and contain customary events of default for a loan of this type, including payment defaults, covenant defaults, breaches of representations and warranties, bankruptcy and insolvency, judgments and cross-default with certain other indebtedness. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company believes it was in compliance with all financial covenants under the Securitization Loan.  
    
  Revolving Credit Facility 
    
  Certain of the Company's subsidiaries have a revolving credit facility (the "revolving credit facility") with a syndicate of banks. On February 18, 2015, the Company amended and restated the revolving credit facility to increase the borrowing capacity to   $400,000   from   $200,000   and subsequently amended the revolving credit facility to address certain interest calculation mechanics. As amended, the revolving credit facility bears interest at a varying rate of three-month LIBOR plus   3.0%  , subject to a LIBOR floor of   0.00%  . Prior to the amendment, the revolving credit facility bore interest at varying rates of three-month LIBOR plus   3.50%   subject to a LIBOR floor of   0.50%  , payable monthly. The Company is also required to pay a monthly fee on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility at a rate of   0.50%   per annum when the balance outstanding is less than   $200,000  , or   0.30%   per annum when the balance outstanding is equal to or greater than   $200,000  . As part of the amendment, the term of the revolving credit facility was extended to February 18, 2018 and the advance rate for borrowings was increased to   65%   from   55%  . The advance rate is based on the aggregate value of the eligible properties, which value is calculated as the lesser of (a) the third-party broker price opinion value or (b) the original purchase price plus certain renovation and other capitalized costs of the properties. The Company used proceeds from the revolving credit facility to fund the Portfolio Acquisition and other acquisitions of properties as referenced in Note 3. The remaining proceeds were used for working capital and other corporate purposes, including the acquisition, financing and renovation of properties. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  ,   $364,130   and   $326,472  , respectively, was outstanding under the revolving credit facility. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the interest rate on the revolving credit facility was   3.89%   and   3.68%  , respectively, inclusive of the unused fee. In the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company incurred   $3,225   and   $9,374  , respectively, in gross interest expense on the revolving credit facility, excluding amortization of deferred financing costs and interest rate cap accretion. In the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , the Company incurred   $2,989   and   $6,898  , respectively, in gross interest expense on the revolving credit facility, excluding amortization of deferred financing costs and before the effect of capitalizing interest related to property renovations.  
    
  All amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility are collateralized by the equity interests and assets of certain of the Company s subsidiaries (the "Pledged Subsidiaries"), which exclude the owners of the Securitization Properties. The amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility and certain obligations contained therein are guaranteed by the Company and the Operating Partnership only in the case of certain bad acts (including bankruptcy) and up to   $20,000   for completion of certain property renovations, as outlined in the credit documents. As of   September 30, 2016   there were approximately   5,680   properties pledged as collateral under the revolving credit facility. 
    
  The Pledged Subsidiaries are separate legal entities, but continue to be reported in the Company s consolidated financial statements. As long as the revolving credit facility is outstanding, the assets of the Pledged Subsidiaries are not available to satisfy the other debts and obligations of the Pledged Subsidiaries or the Company. However, the Company is permitted to receive distributions from the Pledged Subsidiaries as long as the Company and the Pledged Subsidiaries are current with all payments and in compliance with all other obligations under the revolving credit facility. 
    
  The revolving credit facility provides for the restriction of cash whereby the Company must set aside funds for payment of insurance, real estate taxes and certain property operating and maintenance expenses associated with properties in the Pledged Subsidiaries' portfolios. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had   $17,848   and   $10,101  , respectively, included in escrow deposits associated with the required reserves.  
    
  The revolving credit facility does not contractually restrict the Company s ability to pay dividends but certain covenants contained therein may limit the amount of cash available for distribution. For example, in the final year of the revolving credit facility, all cash generated by the properties in the Pledged Subsidiaries must be used to pay down the principal amount outstanding under the revolving credit facility. The revolving credit facility agreement requires the Company to meet certain quarterly financial tests pertaining to net worth, total liquidity, debt yield and debt service coverage ratios. The

Company must maintain total liquidity of   $25,000   and a net worth of at least   $125,000  , as determined in accordance with the revolving credit facility agreement. The revolving credit facility also contains customary events of default for a facility of this type, including payment defaults, covenant defaults, breaches of representations and warranties, bankruptcy and insolvency, judgments, change of control and cross-default with certain other indebtedness.  The Company believes it was in compliance with all financial covenants under the revolving credit facility as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Deferred Financing Costs  
    
  Costs incurred in the placement of the Company s debt are being amortized using the straight-line method, which approximates the effective interest method, over the terms of the related debt. Amortization of deferred financing costs is recorded as interest expense in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.      
    
  In connection with its Securitization Loan, the Company incurred deferred financing costs of   $17   and   $460  , for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The costs are being amortized through September 9, 2019, the fully extended maturity date of the Securitization Loan. In conjunction with the paydown of the Securitization Loan related to the sale of the Houston, TX portfolio, the Company wrote off   $174   in deferred financing costs for both the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , which has been included in net gain on disposition of real estate in the condensed consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. 
    
  In connection with its revolving credit facility, the Company incurred deferred financing costs of   $105   and   $5,323  , for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  
    
  Interest Expense 
    
    The following table presents the Company's total interest expense for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

(1) 
    Includes the Securitization Loan's monthly servicing fees. 
              (2) 
    Includes monitoring service fees and interest related to the Company's designated derivative financial instruments (see Note 8). 
              (3) 
    The Company capitalizes interest for properties undergoing renovation activities and purchased subsequent to the Company obtaining debt in May 2013. 
       
  Derivative Financial Instruments  
    
    The variable rate of interest on the Company's debt exposes the Company to interest rate risk. Currently, the Company uses interest rate cap agreements and interest rate swap transactions (collectively  Hedging Derivatives ) to manage this interest rate risk. These instruments are carried at fair value in the Company s financial statements (see Note 8). Changes in the fair value of the designated portion of the Company's Hedging Derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting are recognized through other comprehensive income (loss) (see Note 8). 
    
  Non-designated hedges are derivatives that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting or for which the Company did not elect to designate as accounting hedges. The Company does not enter into derivative transactions for speculative or trading purposes, but may enter into derivatives to manage the economic risk of changes in interest rates.

The following table summarizes the consolidated derivative positions at   September 30, 2016  : 

(2) 
    For interest rate caps, represents the weighted average interest rate on the hedged debt as of   September 30, 2016  . 
              (3) 
    For interest rate caps, represents the capped interest rate, which is inclusive of the monthly servicing fees, but excludes amortization of the original issue discount, deferred financing costs and interest rate cap accretion.  
              (4) 
    The swap transactions are structured with a fixed rate that steps up over the   three  -year term locking in the forward LIBOR curve at the time of execution. This structure resulted in an average effective rate of   2.77%   over the   three  -year term.  
       
  In July 2016, the Company entered into   one   interest rate cap agreement at LIBOR of   3.1085%   with a notional amount of   $104,367   and a termination date of September 15, 2017 to hedge interest rate risk associated with its Securitization Loan. The Company determined that the interest rate cap agreement qualified for hedge accounting and, therefore, designated the derivative as a cash flow hedge. The interest rate cap agreement was subsequently de-designated as noted below. 
    
  In August 2016, the Company, through its Operating Partnership, entered into interest rate swap transactions with   two   counterparties (the  Swaps ). The Company entered into the Swaps to effectively fix the interest rate on   $296,000   of the Company s floating rate indebtedness under the Securitization Loan for   three years  . The Swaps have an effective date and maturity date as reflected in the table below. From each respective effective date through the corresponding maturity date, the Company will be required to make monthly fixed rate payments at the fixed swap rate and on the notional amounts reflected in the table below, while the counterparty will be obligated to make monthly floating rate payments to the Company based on one-month LIBOR and referencing the same notional amount. The Company determined that the Swaps qualified for hedge accounting and designated the derivatives as cash flow hedges. Concurrently, the Company de-designated   three   interest rate cap agreements also associated with the Securitization Loan and will reclassify the balance of deferred losses of   $1,390   in accumulated other comprehensive loss to earnings over the remaining life of the associated interest rate cap agreements. 

In connection with the financing of the October 1, 2016 acquisition (see Note 3), effective September 29, 2016, the Company modified an existing interest rate cap agreement originally entered into on March 31, 2015 to increase the notional amount from   $266,100   to   $287,100   to hedge interest rate risk associated with its revolving credit facility. The Company determined that the interest rate cap agreement qualified for hedge accounting and, therefore, continued its designation of the derivative as a cash flow hedge. 
    
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company paid   $30   and   $2,250  , respectively, in connection with the purchase of interest rate cap agreements which are included in other assets on the condensed consolidated balance sheets and recorded at fair value (see Note 8).

Note 5.  Equity Incentive Plan 
       
  Restated 2012 Equity Incentive Plan       
    
  On December 4, 2012, the Company adopted an equity incentive plan (the "2012 Plan") which provides incentive compensation to attract and retain qualified directors, officers, advisors, consultants and other personnel of the Company. The 2012 Plan provides for grants of restricted common stock, phantom shares, dividend equivalent rights and other equity-based awards, originally subject to a ceiling of   921,053   shares available for issuance under the 2012 Plan. The 2012 Plan allows for the Company s board of directors to expand the types of awards available under the 2012 Plan to include long term incentive plan units in the future. If an award granted under the 2012 Plan expires or terminates, the shares subject to any portion of the award that expires or terminates without having been exercised or paid, as the case may be, will again become available for the issuance of future awards.   No   award may be granted under the 2012 Plan to any person who, assuming payment of all awards held by such person, would own or be deemed to own more than   9.8%   of the outstanding shares of the Company s common stock. 
    
  On February 9, 2016 the Company's board of directors approved the amendment and restatement of the 2012 Plan (the "Restated 2012 Plan"), which was approved by stockholders on May 17, 2016. The amendment and restatement of the 2012 Plan increased the number of shares available for issuance by   1,500,000   shares and made certain other changes. Unless previously terminated by the Company's board of directors, no new award may be granted under the Restated 2012 Plan after February 9, 2026. 
    
  Restricted Stock Awards 
    
    On May 17, 2016, the Company awarded each of its   four   independent directors an equity retainer in the form of an award of   3,432   shares of restricted stock, with each award having a fair market value of   $50  . On August 2, 2016, the Company appointed a new independent director to the Company's Board of Directors. The independent director was awarded an equity retainer in the form of an award of   2,179   shares of restricted stock with a fair market value of   $39   based upon a prorated calculation of the annual equity retainer. In addition, the Company accepted the resignation from   one   independent director on the Company's Board of Directors effective August 31, 2016. In connection with this resignation, the Board of Directors accelerated the vesting of   997   shares of restricted stock held by such director. Annual equity retainers for such independent directors will vest as to all of such shares on the earlier of (i) the   one   year anniversary of the date of grant and (ii) the date immediately preceding the date of the Company's next annual meeting of stockholders, subject, in each case, to the independent director's continued service to the Company through the vesting date.  
    
  Performance Stock Units  
       
  On June 21, 2016, the Company granted performance stock units ("PSUs") under the Restated 2012 Plan to its newly-named permanent Chief Executive Officer. The award was based on a target number of   60,000   PSUs. Each PSU represents the potential to receive Silver Bay common stock based on the extent to which specified performance targets are met during the   36  -month performance period, which begins on the grant date. The number of shares of Silver Bay common stock to be earned as of the vesting date for each PSU increases and decreases based on Silver Bay's total stockholder return (stock price appreciation plus dividends) ("TSR").

  NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (unaudited) 
  Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 
  (amounts in thousands, except share data and property counts) 

Fifty percent of the award will vest based on the Company's annualized TSR during the performance period on an absolute (i.e., non-relative) basis (the "Absolute TSR PSUs"). Subject to continued employment until the end of the performance period, the number of shares of common stock eligible to be received will be determined by multiplying fifty percent of the target number of PSUs by the TSR Multiplier determined in accordance with the following table: 

(1) 
    To the extent the Company's annualized TSR falls between two discrete points, linear interpolation will be used to determine the TSR Multiplier. 
       
  The remaining fifty percent of the award will vest based on the Company's TSR during the performance period relative to a peer group index (the "Relative TSR PSUs") comprised initially of those companies in the Apartment and Single Family Home subsectors of the FTSE NAREIT All REIT Index (the "Index") with equal weighting provided to each subsector in constructing the peer group index. Subject to continued employment until the end of the performance period, the number of shares of common stock eligible to be received will be determined by multiplying fifty percent of the target number of PSUs by the TSR Multiplier determined in accordance with the following table:  
    
                   TSR Relative to Peer Group 
      
    TSR Multiplier    (1)  
      Underperform index by 6 percentage points 
      
     % 
      Underperform index by 3 percentage points 
      
    50% 
      Outperform index by 3 percentage points 
      
    100% 
      Outperform index by 6 percentage points 
      
    200% 

(1) 
    To the extent the Company's TSR performance compared to the Index TSR falls between two discrete points, linear interpolation will be used to determine the TSR Multiplier. 
       
  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the payout of any Relative TSR PSU will be capped at   110%   if the Absolute PSU TSR during the performance period is negative. Additionally, each PSU contains   one   dividend equivalent right, which is equal to the cash dividend that would have been paid on the PSU had the PSU been an issued and outstanding common share on the record date for the dividend and is payable in additional shares if the market and service conditions are met.  
    
  The Company utilized a Monte-Carlo simulation to calculate the weighted-average grant date fair value of   $12.84   per unit for the Absolute TSR PSUs and a weighted-average grant date fair value of   $18.68   per unit for the Relative TSR PSUs, for a total estimated compensation expense of   $946   over the   36  -month performance period, using the following assumptions:  

(1) 
    Expected volatility is based on the Company s historical stock price volatility over the last   three years   using daily data points.  
              (2) 
    An assumed dividend yield of   0%   is the mathematical equivalent to the reinvestment of dividends, which is consistent with the TSR definition described above.

Note 7.  Earnings (Loss) Per Share 
    
  The following table presents a reconciliation of net loss attributable to common stockholders and shares used in calculating basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share ("EPS") for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  :   

A total of   2,231,511   common units not owned by the Company were outstanding for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , but have been excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS as their inclusion would not be dilutive. In addition,   253,801   and   88,487   performance stock units have been excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively, as their market conditions had been met, however, their inclusion would not be dilutive. During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  ,   no   performance stock units have been excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS as their market conditions had not been met. 

Note 8.  Derivative and Other Fair Value Instruments 
    
  Codification Topic   Fair Value Measurement   ( ASC 820 ) established a three level valuation hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurements. The valuation hierarchy is based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date. A financial instrument s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The three levels are defined as follows: 
    
  Level 1   Inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. 
  Level 2   Inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument. 
  Level 3   Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement. 
    
  Recurring Fair Value 
    
  The Company uses Hedging Derivatives to manage its exposure to interest rate risk (refer to Note 4) and in conjunction with certain variable rate secured debt to satisfy lender requirements. The Hedging Derivates are valued using models developed by the respective counterparty that use as their basis readily observable market parameters (such as forward yield curves).

As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , there was   $1,646   and   $1,613  , respectively, in deferred losses in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to Hedging Derivatives. The Company expects to recognize   $411   in interest expense during the twelve months ending September 30, 2017, pertaining to the designated interest rate cap agreements, which will be reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive loss in accordance with the amortization schedules established upon designation of the interest rate caps as cash flow hedges. Interest expense pertaining to the interest rate swap transactions will be recognized as incurred.  
    
  Nonrecurring Fair Value 
    
  For long-lived assets to be disposed of, an impairment loss is recognized when the estimated fair value of the asset, less the estimated cost to sell, is less than the carrying amount of the asset at the time the Company has determined to sell the asset. Assets held for sale are valued based on comparable sales data, less estimates of third-party broker commissions, which are gathered from the markets. These impairment measurements constitute nonrecurring fair value measures under ASC 820 and the inputs are characterized as Level 2.  
    
  Fair Value of  Other Financial Instruments 
    
  In accordance with ASC 820, the Company is required to disclose the fair value of financial instruments, both assets and liabilities recognized and not recognized in the condensed consolidated balance sheets, for which fair value can be estimated.  The following describes the Company s methods for estimating the fair value for financial instruments. Descriptions are not provided for those items that have zero balances as of   September 30, 2016  .  
             
    Cash, escrow deposits, resident prepaid rent and security deposits, resident rent receivable (included in other assets), accounts payable, and accrued expenses have carrying values which approximate fair value because of the short-term nature of these instruments. The Company categorizes the fair value measurement of these assets and liabilities as Level 1. 
                
    The Company s revolving credit facility has a floating interest rate based on an index plus a spread and the credit spread is consistent with those demanded in the market for facilities with similar risk and maturities. Accordingly, the interest rate on this borrowing is at market, and thus, the carrying value of the debt approximates fair value as of   September 30, 2016  . The Company categorizes the fair value measurement of this liability as Level 2. 
                
    The fair value of the Company's Securitization Loan was $  301,440   as of   September 30, 2016  , based on an average of market quotations. The Company categorizes the fair value measurement of this liability as Level 2. 
                
    The Company s   10%   cumulative redeemable preferred stock had a fair value which approximates its liquidation value at   September 30, 2016  . The Company categorizes the fair value measurement of this instrument as Level 2. 

Note 9.  Commitments and Contingencies  
    
  Concentrations 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , approximately   59%   of the Company s properties were located in Atlanta, GA, Phoenix, AZ, and Tampa, FL, which exposes the Company to greater economic risks than if the Company owned a more geographically dispersed portfolio.

Resident Security Deposits 
    
    As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   $12,784   in resident security deposits. Security deposits are refundable, net of any outstanding charges and fees, upon expiration of the underlying lease. 
    
  Earnest deposits 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had refundable earnest deposits for property purchases of   $39,685   and   $0  , respectively. However, not all of these properties are certain to be acquired because properties may fall out of escrow through the closing process for various reasons. 
    
  Legal and Regulatory 
    
    From time to time, the Company is subject to potential liability under laws and government regulations and various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of the Company's business. Liabilities are established for legal claims when payments associated with the claims become probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. The actual costs of resolving legal claims may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts established for those claims. Based on information currently available, management is not aware of any legal or regulatory claims that would have a material adverse effect on the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements, and therefore   no   accrual has been recorded as of   September 30, 2016  .

Item 2.  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
    
  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. This Quarterly Report, including the following Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, contains forward-looking statements regarding future events or trends that should be read in conjunction with the factors described under  Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements  included in this Quarterly Report. In addition, our actual results could differ materially from those projected in such forward-looking statements as a result of the factors discussed under  Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements  as well as the risk factors described in Part I, Item 1A, "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 and any updates to those risk factors included in Part II, Item 1A,  Risk Factors,  of this Quarterly Report. 

Overview 
    
  We are an internally-managed Maryland corporation that focuses on the acquisition, renovation, leasing, and management of single-family properties in select markets in the United States. Our objective is to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns for our stockholders over the long term through dividends and capital appreciation. We generate virtually all of our revenue by leasing our portfolio of single-family properties. As of   September 30, 2016  , we owned   8,837   single-family properties for rental purposes in Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina and Texas, excluding properties reflected as assets held for sale on our condensed consolidated balance sheets.  
    
  We have elected to be treated as a real estate investment trust ("REIT") for U.S. federal tax purposes, commencing with, and in connection with the filing of our federal tax return for, our taxable year ended December 31, 2012. As a REIT, we generally are not subject to federal income tax on the taxable income that we distribute to our stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates. Even if we continue to qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to some federal, state and local taxes on our income or property. In addition, the income of our taxable REIT subsidiaries ("TRS") is subject to taxation at regular corporate rates. 
    
  Silver Bay Realty Trust Corp. was incorporated in Maryland in June 2012. Silver Bay Realty Trust Corp. conducts its business and owns all of its properties through Silver Bay Operating Partnership L.P. (the "Operating Partnership"), a Delaware limited partnership. Silver Bay Realty Trust Corp. s wholly owned subsidiary, Silver Bay Management LLC (the "General Partner") is the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership. Silver Bay Realty Trust Corp. has no material assets or liabilities other than its investment in the Operating Partnership. As of   September 30, 2016  , Silver Bay Realty Trust Corp. owned, through a combination of direct and indirect interests,   94.1%   of the partnership interests in the Operating Partnership. Except as otherwise required by the context, references to the  Company,   Silver Bay,   we,   us  and  our  refer collectively to Silver Bay Realty Trust Corp., the Operating Partnership and the direct and indirect subsidiaries of each. 
    
  During 2015, we acquired a portfolio of 2,461 properties from The American Home Real Estate Investment Trust, Inc.(the "Portfolio Acquisition"). The Portfolio Acquisition was substantially completed on April 1, 2015 with an aggregate purchase price of $263.0 million. The Portfolio Acquisition was financed using proceeds obtained under our revolving credit facility, which was amended and restated on February 18, 2015 to increase the borrowing capacity to $400.0 million from $200.0 million. The properties acquired in the Portfolio Acquisition are primarily located in Atlanta, GA, Charlotte, NC, Tampa, FL and Orlando, FL.

Property Portfolio 
    
  Our investments in real estate consist of single-family properties located in select markets. As of   September 30, 2016  , we owned   8,837   single-family properties in the following markets: 

(1) 
    Properties reflected in this table exclude properties recorded as assets held for sale on our condensed consolidated balance sheets and any properties previously acquired in purchases that have been subsequently rescinded or vacated. 
              (2) 
    Aggregate investment in real estate includes all capitalized costs, determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"), incurred through   September 30, 2016   for the acquisition, stabilization, and significant post-stabilization renovation of properties, including land, building, possession costs and renovation costs. Aggregate investment in real estate includes   $20.2 million   in capital improvements, incurred from our formation through   September 30, 2016  , made to properties that had been previously renovated, but does not include accumulated depreciation.     
               (4) 
    Charlotte market includes properties in South Carolina due to their proximity to Charlotte, North Carolina.  
              (5) 
    Northern California market currently consists of Contra Costa, Napa and Solano counties. 
              (6) 
    Southeast Florida market currently consists of Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties. 

Factors likely to affect Silver Bay's Results of Operations 
    
  Our results of operations and financial condition will be affected by numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control. Some of the key factors we expect to impact our results of operations and financial condition include our pace and costs of acquisitions, the time and costs required to stabilize a newly-acquired property and convert the same to rental use, the age of our properties, rental rates, the varying costs of internal and external property management, seasonality, occupancy levels, rates of resident turnover, home price appreciation, changes in homeownership rates, changes in homeowners  association fees and real estate taxes, changes in insurance costs, expenses incurred in the maintenance and turnover of our properties, resident defaults, our expense ratios and our capital structure. Certain of these factors are described in greater detail below. 

Acquisitions and Dispositions 
    
  Our ability to identify and acquire single-family properties that meet our investment criteria will be affected by home prices in our markets, the inventory of properties available through our acquisition channels, competition for our target assets, and our capital available for investment. Acquisitions may be financed from various sources, including proceeds from the sale of equity securities, retained cash flow, debt financings, securitizations, or the issuance of common units in the Operating Partnership. Availability of financing from such sources on acceptable terms will greatly impact our pace of acquisitions, as  
  
   24 

     Table of Contents     

will any preference we may then have for portfolio acquisitions, which are inherently less predictable than purchases through other channels. As of September 30, 2016, we had   322   properties under contract that were purchased on October 1, 2016 for   $41.5 million  . 
    
  We periodically sell properties after determining the property or related market no longer fit our portfolio and may sell properties when we view market conditions are favorable given other potential uses of capital. To date, our disposition activity has been limited. As of September 30, 2016, we had   116   properties reflected as assets held for sale on our balance sheet. As of September 30, 2016, we had 46 properties under contract to sell with an aggregate contractual sales price of $9.4 million. There are no assurances we will close on the sales of these properties.   
    
  During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we sold   66   and   181   properties, respectively, primarily in our Southeast Florida and Southern California markets for total gross proceeds of   $11.3 million   and   $28.7 million  , respectively, for a net gain on disposition of real estate of   $2.4 million   and   $6.2 million  , respectively. During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , we sold   150   and   173   properties, respectively, primarily in the Houston, TX market for total gross proceeds of    $18.4 million   and   $21.1 million  , respectively, for a net gain on disposition of real estate of   $2.1 million   and   $2.3 million  , respectively.  

Stabilization, Renovation and Leasing 
    
  Before an acquired property becomes an income producing asset, we must possess, renovate, market and lease the property. We refer to this process as property stabilization. We consider a property stabilized at the earlier of (i) its first authorized occupancy or (ii) 90 days after the renovations for such property are complete regardless of whether the property is leased. Properties acquired with in-place leases are considered stabilized even though such properties may require future renovation to meet our standards and may have existing residents who would not otherwise meet our resident screening requirements. The time to stabilize a newly acquired property can vary significantly among properties for several reasons, including the property s acquisition channel, the age and condition of the property, whether the property was vacant when acquired, local demand for our properties, our marketing techniques, and the size of our available inventory of rent ready properties.  
    
  The following table summarizes the occupancy status of our properties as of   September 30, 2016  :  

(1) 
    Average monthly rent for occupied properties was calculated as the average of the contracted monthly rent for all occupied properties as of   September 30, 2016   and reflects rent concessions amortized over the life of the related lease. 
              (2) 
    Average remaining lease term assumes a remaining term of 30 days for leases in month-to-month status.   
       
  The aggregate portfolio occupancy rate increased to   96.8%   as of   September 30, 2016   compared to   94.9%   as of   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  ,   713   properties turned over compared to 744 in the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . This turnover number includes move-outs, evictions and lease breaks on our stabilized portfolio. Quarterly turnover for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was   8.1%   compared to   8.2%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . Quarterly turnover represents the number of properties turned over in the period divided by the number of  
  
   25 

     Table of Contents     

properties in stabilized status at period-end. The total number of properties with lease expirations in the three months ended   September 30, 2016   was   2,372  , including properties with month-to-month occupancy in the period. Of these properties,   497   properties turned over, resulting in a retention rate of   79.0%   compared to a retention rate of   77.5%   during the three months ended   September 30, 2015  .  
    
  The following is a summary of our turnover percentage, by quarter, for the trailing twelve-month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

(1) 
    Quarterly turnover percentage represents the number of properties turned over in each respective period divided by the number of properties in stabilized status as of each respective period-end. 
          
  Same-Home Properties.   We refer to our Same-Home properties as those properties (1) that we had stabilized and for which we had completed the initial renovation as of January 1, 2015 and (2) that we held in operations throughout the full periods presented in both 2015 and 2016. Same-Home properties exclude properties classified as held for sale and properties taken out of service as a result of a casualty loss. We consider a property stabilized at the earlier of (1) its first authorized occupancy or (2) 90 days after the renovations for such property are complete, regardless of whether the property is leased. Properties acquired with in-place leases are considered stabilized even though such properties require a future initial renovation to meet our standards and may have existing residents who would not otherwise meet our resident screening requirements.  
       
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   5,876   properties included in Same-Home properties in the following markets: 

(1) 
    Average monthly rent for occupied properties was calculated as the average of the contracted monthly rent for all occupied properties as of   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and reflects rent concessions amortized over the life of the related lease.

Reconciliations of NOI and Same-Home NOI to net loss prepared in accordance with GAAP are found in this Item 2 under the headings "  Non-GAAP Financial Performance Measures  ".

  Comparison of the   Three and Nine   Months Ended   September 30, 2016   and the   Three and Nine   Months Ended   September 30, 2015    
    
  Revenue 
    
  We earn revenue primarily from rents collected from residents under lease agreements for our single-family properties. These include short-term leases that we enter into directly with our residents, which generally have a term of one year. The most important drivers of revenue (aside from portfolio growth) are rental and occupancy rates. Our revenue may be affected by macroeconomic, local and property level factors, including market conditions, seasonality, resident defaults or vacancies, timing of renovation activities and occupancy of properties and timing to re-lease vacant properties.

Total revenue increased   $0.9 million   and   $11.1 million  , or   3.1%   and   13.4%  , respectively, in the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the prior year periods. We owned   8,837   properties as of   September 30, 2016   as compared to   9,074   properties as of   September 30, 2015   with aggregate occupancy rates of   96.8%   and   94.9%  , respectively. Our average monthly rent for occupied properties in our portfolio increased to   $1,202   as of   September 30, 2016   from   $1,159   as of   September 30, 2015  . We calculate average monthly rent for a period as the average of the contracted monthly rent for all occupied properties as of the end of such period, net of the concessions amortized over the life of the related lease. The increase in revenue for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   over the prior year period was primarily due to increases in our rental rates and occupancy rate, partially offset by a decrease in portfolio size. The increase in revenue for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   over the prior year period was primarily due to an increase in the number of occupied homes during the period driven by consummation of the Portfolio Acquisition on April 1, 2015 and to a lesser extent increases in our rental rates and occupancy rate.  
    
  Total revenue from Same-Home properties increased   $1.1 million   and   $3.4 million  , or   5.4%   and   5.5%  , respectively, in the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the prior year periods. This increase was due primarily to the increases in average monthly rent and aggregate occupancy. Average monthly rent for occupied properties in our Same-Home portfolio increased to   $1,262   as of   September 30, 2016   compared to   $1,214   as of   September 30, 2015  . The average rent for the Same-Home portfolio is higher than our aggregate portfolio due to property mix as a result of the Portfolio Acquisition. Same-Home occupancy increased to   97.0%   as of   September 30, 2016   compared to   95.6%   as of   September 30, 2015  .  
    
  Expenses 
    
  Property Operating Expenses.   Property operating expenses include property operating and maintenance, real estate taxes, homeowners' association fees, and property management. Included in property operating and maintenance are repairs and maintenance expenses associated with resident turnover, property insurance, bad debt and utilities and landscape maintenance on market ready properties not occupied. Real estate taxes are expensed once a property is placed in service. As of   September 30, 2016  , we internally managed   94.4%   of our portfolio, which represented all of our markets other than Las Vegas and Tucson where we use third-party managers.    
    
  Property operating expenses for the entire portfolio was consistent in the three months ended   September 30, 2016   over the prior year period. As a percentage of revenue, property operating expenses decreased   1.7   percentage points primarily due to an increased revenue base. Property operating expenses for the entire portfolio increased   $2.8 million  , or   7.5%   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   over the prior year period primarily as a result of the significant increase in the number of properties owned and in-service during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , due to the Portfolio Acquisition, and the resulting increases in expenses for turnover, repairs and maintenance, real estate taxes, and property management. As a percentage of revenue, property operating expenses decreased   2.4   percentage points in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   over the prior year period, primarily due to efficiencies of scale reflected in our property management expense calculated as a percentage of revenue.  
    
  Property operating expenses for the Same-Home properties increased   $0.2 million  , or   2.3%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , and stemmed primarily from an increase in real estate taxes partially offset by decreases in property management and property operating and maintenance. Property operating expenses for the Same-Home properties increased   $0.5 million  , or   1.7%   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   primarily as a result of an increase in real estate taxes and property operating and maintenance partially offset by a decrease in property management. 
    
  Depreciation and Amortization  . Depreciation and amortization includes depreciation on real estate assets placed in-service and amortization of deferred lease fees and in-place leases. Depreciation and amortization increased   $0.2 million   and   $2.9 million  , or   1.9%   and   11.4%  , respectively, in the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , over the prior year periods. The increase in the three months ended   September 30, 2016   is primarily as a result of capital improvements for renovation and post-renovation activities. The increase in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   stemmed primarily from the significant increase in the number of properties owned and in-service during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , due to the consummation of Portfolio Acquisition on April 1, 2015, as compared to the prior year period. 
    
  Portfolio Acquisition Expense.   Portfolio acquisition expense represents transaction costs incurred when acquiring properties that meet the definition of a business under the guidance codified in Codification Topic,   Business Combinations   ("ASC 805"), which must be expensed when incurred rather than capitalized into the basis of each property.  
    
  We incurred   $0.1 million   in portfolio acquisition expense in both the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   resulting from acquisitions during and subsequent to the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . We incurred   $0.1  
  
   28 

     Table of Contents     

million   and   $2.0 million  , respectively, in portfolio acquisition expense associated with the Portfolio Acquisition in the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  
    
  General and Administrative  . General and administrative includes those costs related to being a public company and expenses associated with our corporate and administrative functions. General and administrative expense decreased   $0.4 million   and   $0.8 million  , or   10.5%   and   6.9%  , respectively, in the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , over the prior year periods primarily related to expense management and timing of certain items. 
    
  Share-based Compensation.   Share-based compensation expense includes costs associated with our restricted stock awards to our board of directors and certain employees and our performance stock unit awards to certain members of management.   
    
  Share-based compensation expense decreased   $0.1 million   and increased   $0.1 million  , respectively, in the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   over the prior year periods. The decrease in the three months ended   September 30, 2016   over the prior year period is primarily the result of forfeited performance stock unit shares during the period. The increase over the prior period for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   over the prior year period is primarily due to the issuance of 127,648 shares of restricted stock made in February 2016, which will vest on the first anniversary of the grant date, as long as such individual is an employee on the vesting date, subject to earlier acceleration pursuant to their terms.  
    
  Severance and Other.   Severance and other consists primarily of executive severance and related costs for certain employees that have departed. 
    
  Interest Expense.   Interest expense includes interest incurred on the outstanding balance of our debt, an unused line fee on the undrawn amount of the revolving credit facility, debt service costs, amortization of deferred financing fees, net of certain amounts capitalized for properties undergoing renovation activities and interest expense associated with the interest rate swap transactions.  
    
  The following table presents total interest expense for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

(1) 
    Includes the Securitization Loan's monthly servicing fees. 
              (2) 
    Includes monitoring service fees and interest related to our designated derivative financial instruments (see Note 8). 
              (3) 
    We capitalize interest for properties undergoing renovation activities and purchased subsequent to obtaining debt in May 2013. 
       
   Interest expense increased   $0.6 million   and   $3.8 million  , respectively, in the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , over the prior year periods. The increase in interest expense for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   over the prior year period is due to higher average interest rates and an increase in losses reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss into income associated with our designated interest rate cap agreements. The increase for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   over the prior year period is primarily attributed to a higher average outstanding balance of debt in the revolving credit facility related to financing the Portfolio Acquisition in April 2015 in addition to higher average interest rates and an increase in losses reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss into income associated with our designated interest rate cap agreements. 
    
  Total Other Income.   Total other income consists of activities related to our sales of investments in real estate as well as adjustments on derivative financial instruments, net. Total other income decreased   $0.2 million   and increased   $2.3 million  , respectively, in the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , over the prior year periods. The increase in total other income during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   is primarily due to an increase in the net gain on disposition of real estate related to certain properties of   $6.2 million  , partially offset by an increase in operating costs of assets held for sale.

Income Tax Expense, Net.   We intend to operate and to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") and intend to comply with the requirements of the Code relating to REITs. We have TRSs where certain investments may be made and activities conducted that may have otherwise been subject to the prohibited transactions tax or may not be favorably treated for purposes of complying with the various requirements for REIT qualification. The income and 
  losses within the TRSs are subject to federal, state, and local income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. We recognized income tax expense of   $0.4 million   and   $1.1 million  , respectively, in the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $48 thousand   and   $0.1 million  , respectively in the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase in income tax expense is primarily related to income taxes on net gain on disposition of real estate in the TRS entities.    

Critical Accounting Policies 
    
  The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make certain judgments and assumptions, based on information available at the time of our preparation of the financial statements, in determining accounting estimates used in preparation of the financial statements.   
    
  Accounting estimates are considered critical if the estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made and if different estimates reasonably could have been used in the reporting period or changes in the accounting estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period that would have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
           
  Our critical accounting policies are those related to: 
             
    Revenue recognition;  
                
    Investments in real estate; 
                
    Impairment of real estate; 
                
    Income taxes; and 
                
    Derivative instruments 
       
  Our critical accounting policies are described in Item 7,   Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  , of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. The critical accounting policies used in preparing our interim 2016 condensed consolidated financial statements are the same as those described in our Annual Report. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  Under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the "JOBS Act") we meet the definition of an  emerging growth company.  We have irrevocably elected to opt out of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised U.S. accounting standards pursuant to Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act. As a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. We will cease to be an "emerging growth company" under the JOBS Act on December 31, 2017. 
    
  We consider the applicability and impact of all accounting standard updates ("ASUs"). ASUs not listed below were assessed and determined to be either not applicable or are expected to have minimal impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. 
    
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers  , which creates a new Topic, Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606. The standard is principle-based and provides a five-step model to determine when and how revenue is recognized. The core principle is that a company should recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This standard is effective for interim or annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and allows for either full retrospective or modified retrospective adoption. Early adoption of this standard is only allowed as of the original effective date, annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of Topic 606 will have on our consolidated financial statements.

In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02,   Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis.   This update is intended to improve targeted areas of consolidation guidance by simplifying the consolidation evaluation process, and by placing more emphasis on risk of loss when determining a controlling financial interest. We adopted ASU 2015-02 during the quarter ended March 31, 2016. Based on our review and subsequent analysis of our legal entities structure, we concluded that the Operating Partnership is a variable interest entity as the limited partners of the Operating Partnership do not have substantive kick-out rights. As the general partner and controlling owner of approximately   94.1%   of the Operating Partnership, we will continue to consolidate the Operating Partnership under this new guidance.  
    
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03,   Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.   The amendments in this ASU require that debt     issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with the original issue discount, rather than as an asset. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by the amendments in this ASU and will continue to be reported as interest expense. This guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015. We adopted this ASU as of January 1, 2016 and as a result of the retrospective adoption of this guidance, deferred financing costs, net of amortization of   $6.4 million   and   $8.1 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, are netted against the carrying values of the Securitization Loan. Previously, these costs were recorded as part of deferred financing costs,     net on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.     Additionally, in accordance with ASU 2015-15,   Interest-Imputation of Interest: Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements,   issued in August 2015, we will continue to present debt issuance costs related to our revolving credit facility as an asset within other assets on the condensed consolidated balance sheets and amortize them ratably over the term of the related facility. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases  , which will require lessees to recognize assets and liabilities on the balance sheet for the rights and obligations created by all leases with terms of more than one year. Lessor accounting will remain similar to lessor accounting under previous GAAP, while aligning with the FASB's new revenue recognition guidance. The guidance will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and for interim periods within those annual periods, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this ASU will have on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  . The amendments in this ASU include multiple provisions intended to simplify various aspects of the accounting for share-based payments. The guidance will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and for interim reporting periods within those annual periods, with early adoption permitted. We do not anticipate the adoption of this ASU will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.  
    
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,   Financial Instruments - Credit Losses, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments  , which changes how companies will measure credit losses for certain financial assets. This guidance requires an entity to estimate its expected credit losses and record an allowance based on this estimate so that it is presented at the net amount expected to be collected on the financial asset. The guidance will be effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019 and interim periods within that reporting period with early adoption permitted beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within that reporting period. We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this ASU will have on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  , which clarifies how certain cash receipts and cash payments should be presented and classified on the statement of cash flow. The guidance will be effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods within that reporting period. We are currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this ASU will have on our consolidated financial statements. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  
    
  Liquidity is a measure of our ability to meet potential cash requirements, fund and maintain our assets and operations, make interest payments and make distributions to our stockholders. Our liquidity, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive and other factors that are beyond our control. Our near-term liquidity requirements consist primarily of acquiring and renovating certain properties, maintaining properties, funding our operations, and making interest payments and distributions to our stockholders. 

31 

     Table of Contents     

Our liquidity and capital resources as of   September 30, 2016   consisted of cash of   $37.3 million  , escrow deposits of   $65.6 million  , which consists of cash held in reserve at financial institutions as required by our debt agreements of   $23.9 million   and earnest money deposits for property purchases of   $39.7 million  , and   $35.9 million   in additional borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility.  
    
  We believe our cash flows from operations together with current cash and funds available under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund the anticipated needs of our operations, including the acquisitions and renovations of certain properties in   2016  . We may also opportunistically utilize the capital markets to raise additional capital, including through the issuance of debt and equity securities (including the issuance of common units in the Operating Partnership) and securitizations, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to access adequate liquidity sources on favorable terms or at all. 
    
  Securitization Loan 
    
  On August 12, 2014, we completed a securitization transaction (the "Securitization Transaction") in which a newly-formed special purpose entity (the "Borrower") entered into a loan with a third-party lender for   $312.7 million   represented by a promissory note (the "Securitization Loan"). The Borrower is wholly owned by another special purpose entity (the "Equity Owner"), and the Equity Owner is wholly-owned by the Operating Partnership. The Borrower and Equity Owner are separate legal entities, but continue to be reported on our condensed consolidated financial statements.  
    
  During the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we paid down   $0.9 million   and   $6.9 million  , respectively, on the Securitization Loan to effect the release of certain properties from the first priority mortgages securing the Securitization Loan, including certain properties sold in the Southeast Florida and Houston, TX markets. 
    
  The Securitization Loan had an initial term of two years with three, 12-month extension options, resulting in a fully extended maturity date of September 9, 2019 and provides for monthly payments at a blended rate equal to the one-month LIBOR plus   1.84%   and a monthly servicing fee of   0.1355%   (excluding the amortization of the original issue discount and deferred financing costs). The Securitization Loan has a blended effective rate of one-month LIBOR plus   1.94%  , including the amortization of the original issue discount, plus monthly servicing fees of   0.1355%  . The Securitization Loan was issued at a discount of   $1.5 million  , which will be accreted and recognized to interest expense through the fully extended maturity date of September 9, 2019. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we executed the   first     12  -month extension option.  
    
  As part of the Securitization Transaction, the Securitization Loan (including the related promissory note) was transferred by the third-party lender to one of the our subsidiaries and subsequently deposited into a REMIC trust in exchange for pass-through certificates. The pass-through certificates represent the entire beneficial interest in the trust and were sold to investors in a private offering through the placement agents retained for the transaction for gross proceeds of   $311.2 million  , net of the original issue discount of   $1.5 million  .   
    
  All amounts outstanding under the Securitization Loan are secured by first priority mortgages on the Securitization Properties, a pool of approximately   3,000   properties, in addition to the equity interests in, and certain assets of, the Borrower. The amounts outstanding under the Securitization Loan and certain obligations contained therein are guaranteed by the Operating Partnership only in the case of certain bad acts (including bankruptcy) as outlined in the transaction documents.  
    
  The Securitization Loan does not contractually restrict our ability to pay dividends but certain covenants contained therein may limit the amount of cash available for distribution. The Securitization Loan documents require us to maintain certain covenants, including a minimum debt yield on the Securitization Properties, and contain customary events of default for a facility of this type, including payment defaults, covenant defaults, breaches of representations and warranties, bankruptcy and insolvency, judgments, change of control and cross-default with certain other indebtedness. We believe we were in compliance with all financial covenants under the Securitization Loan as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Revolving Credit Facility 
    
  Certain of our subsidiaries have a revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks. On February 18, 2015, we amended and restated the revolving credit facility to increase the borrowing capacity to $400.0 million from $200.0 million and subsequently amended the revolving credit facility to address certain interest calculation mechanics. As amended, the revolving credit facility bears interest at a varying rate of three-month LIBOR plus 3.0%, subject to a LIBOR floor of 0.0%, payable monthly. Prior to the amendment, the revolving credit facility bore interest at varying rate of three-month LIBOR plus 3.5% subject to a LIBOR floor of 0.5%. We are also required to pay a monthly fee on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility at a rate of 0.5% per annum when the balance outstanding is less than $200.0 million or 0.3% per annum when the  
  
   32 

     Table of Contents     

balance outstanding is equal to or greater than $200.0 million. As part of the amendment, the term on the revolving credit facility was extended to February 18, 2018 and the advance rate for borrowings was increased to   65%   from   55%  . The advance rate is based on the aggregate value of the eligible properties, which value is calculated as the lesser of (a) the third-party broker price opinion value or (b) the original purchase price plus certain renovation and other capitalized costs of the properties. We used the revolving credit facility to fund the Portfolio Acquisition and other acquisitions of properties in 2016. The remaining proceeds were used for working capital and other corporate purposes, including the acquisition, financing and renovation of properties. At   September 30, 2016  , there was   $364.1 million   outstanding under the facility and   $35.9 million   in borrowing capacity.   
    
  All amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility are collateralized by the equity interests and assets of certain of our subsidiaries (the "Pledged Subsidiaries"), which exclude the owners of the Securitization Properties. The amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility and certain obligations contained therein are guaranteed by Silver Bay Realty Trust Corp. and the Operating Partnership only in the case of certain bad acts (including bankruptcy) and up to $20.0 million for completion of certain property renovations, as outlined in the credit documents. As of   September 30, 2016  , there were approximately   5,680   properties pledged as collateral under the revolving credit facility. 
    
  The revolving credit facility does not contractually restrict our ability to pay dividends but certain covenants contained therein may limit the amount of cash available for distribution. For example, in the final year of the revolving credit facility, all cash generated by the properties in the Pledged Subsidiaries must be used to pay down the principal amount outstanding under the revolving credit facility. The revolving credit facility agreement requires us to meet certain quarterly financial tests pertaining to net worth, total liquidity, debt yield and debt service coverage ratios and contain customary events of default for a facility of this type, including payment defaults, covenant defaults, breaches of representations and warranties, bankruptcy and insolvency, judgments, change of control and cross-default with certain other indebtedness. We must maintain total liquidity of $25.0 million and a net worth of at least $125.0 million, in each case as determined in accordance with our revolving credit facility. We believe we were in compliance with all financial covenants under the revolving credit facility as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Derivative Financial Instruments 
    
  Our objective in using derivative instruments is to manage our exposure to interest rate movements impacting interest expense on our borrowings. We use interest rate cap agreements and interest rate swap transactions to hedge the variable cash flows associated with our existing variable-rate loans and revolving credit facilities (see Note 4 and Note 8 to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for a detailed description of our hedging derivatives). 
    
  Operating Activities 
    
  Net cash provided by operating activities in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $24.2 million   compared to net cash provided by operating activities of   $23.1 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase in our operating cash flows during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the prior period was primarily due to our experiencing the increased cash flow from the Portfolio Acquisition for the full nine months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to just six months during the same period in   2015   offset by a change in escrow deposits.  
     
  Investing Activities  
    
    Our net cash related to investing activities is generally used to fund acquisitions and capital expenditures and is offset by proceeds from the disposition of real estate. Net cash used in investing activities in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   of   $24.2 million   was driven by   $39.7 million   in earnest deposits for the purchase of   322   properties that closed on October 1, 2016 partially offset by   $28.7 million   in proceeds from the disposition of real estate from the sale of   181   properties primarily in our Southeast Florida and Southern California markets. In addition, we used   $11.6 million   for capital improvements of which   $5.6 million   was attributable to our initial renovation of properties, which includes properties purchased in a portfolio purchase that have been renovated for the first time, and   $6.0 million   was attributable to capital improvements to properties that had been previously renovated.  
    
  The average renovation cost per property was approximately   $28,100   or   25.1%   of the purchase price for all properties placed in service since we commenced operations through   September 30, 2016  , including properties acquired with an in-place lease but excluding properties acquired from entities managed by Provident Real Estate Advisors LLC and The American Home Real Estate Investment Trust. These renovation costs included capitalized expenditures for renovations, real estate taxes, homeowners  association dues, interest, costs required to gain possession of the property and other capitalized expenditures until the property is ready for its intended use.

Net cash used in investing activities in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   was   $271.4 million   and was largely driven by the Portfolio Acquisition. We used   $272.7 million   for property acquisitions and another   $20.7 million   on capital improvements, of which   $15.1 million   was attributable to our initial renovation of properties, which includes properties purchased in a portfolio purchase that were renovated for the first time, and   $5.6 million   was attributable to capital improvements to properties that had been previously renovated.  
    
  The acquisition of properties involves payments beyond the purchase price, including payments for property inspections, closing costs, title insurance, transfer taxes, recording fees, broker commissions, and real estate taxes or homeowners  association dues in arrears, along with capitalized interest on properties purchased since we obtained debt in May 2013. Typically, these costs are capitalized as components of the purchase price of the acquired asset unless the property was purchased with an existing lease. We also make significant capital expenditures to renovate and maintain our properties to Silver Bay standards. Our ultimate success depends in part on our ability to make prudent, cost-effective decisions measured over the long term with respect to these expenditures.  
    
  Financing Activities 
    
  Our net cash related to financing activities is generally affected by any borrowings and capital activities net of any dividends and distributions paid to our common shareholders and holders of non-controlling interests. Net cash provided by financing activities in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $8.2 million   and was attributable to the proceeds from the revolving credit facility of   $47.8 million  , primarily to fund the acquisition of properties on October 1, 2016, partially offset by dividends paid of   $14.8 million  , repurchases and retirement of our common stock of   $11.8 million   and repayment on our revolving credit facility of   $10.2 million  . 
    
  Net cash provided by financing activities in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   was   $239.5 million   and was primarily attributable to proceeds from the revolving credit facility of   $282.0 million   to fund the Portfolio Acquisition, partially offset by repurchases and retirement of our common stock of   $12.3 million  , dividends paid of   $10.4 million  , payments on our Securitization Loan of   $6.9 million  , deferred financing costs of   $5.8 million  , payments on our revolving credit facility of   $4.8 million   and purchases of interest rate caps of   $2.3 million  . 
    
  Payment Obligations 
    
  We have an obligation to pay dividends on our outstanding 10% cumulative redeemable preferred stock with a $1.0 million aggregate liquidation preference in preference to dividends paid on our common stock. 
    
  We have elected to be treated as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a REIT, under U.S. federal income tax law we are required to distribute annually at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains, and to pay tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that we annually distribute less than 100% of our REIT taxable income. Subject to the requirements of the Maryland General Corporation Law, we intend to pay quarterly dividends to our stockholders, if and to the extent authorized by our board of directors. On   September 22, 2016  , our board of directors declared   $4.9 million   in common stock dividends and common unit distributions, which were paid on   October 14, 2016  . 
    
  The 2,231,511 common units issued by the Operating Partnership in connection with the internalization of our former advisory manager may be redeemed for cash or, at our election, a number of our common shares on a one-for-one basis. To the extent that we redeem the common units for cash, our liquidity will decrease. As of   September 30, 2016  , none of the common units had been redeemed. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
    
  We have no obligations, assets or liabilities which would be considered off-balance sheet arrangements. We have not participated in transactions that create relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements.

Aggregate Contractual Obligations  
    
  The following table summarizes the effect on our liquidity and cash flows from certain contractual obligations, as of   September 30, 2016   (amounts in thousands):  

(1) 
    Reflects accepted offers on property purchase agreements. Not all of these properties, which are under contract to close in the future, are certain to be acquired as properties may fall out of escrow through the closing process for various reasons. 
              (2) 
    Includes estimated interest payments on the respective debt and derivative agreements based on amounts outstanding as of   September 30, 2016   and rates in effect as of such date. The revolving credit facility has a maturity date of February 18, 2018. The Securitization Loan had an initial maturity date of September 9, 2016 and three, 12-month extension options, of which the first 12-month extension has been exercised, resulting in a fully extended maturity date of September 9, 2019; this analysis assumes our exercise of the three extension options, which is management's intent.    
              (3) 
    Includes operating leases for corporate and market offices. 

Non-GAAP Financial Performance Measures  
    
  In addition to our net loss which is presented in accordance with GAAP, we also present certain supplemental non-GAAP performance measures. These measures are not to be considered more relevant or accurate than the performance measures presented in accordance with GAAP. In compliance with applicable rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), our non-GAAP measures are reconciled to net loss, the most directly comparable GAAP performance measure. As with other non-GAAP performance measures, neither the SEC nor any other regulatory body has passed judgment on these non-GAAP performance measures. 
    
  Net Operating Income and Same-Home Net Operating Income 
    
  We define net operating income ("NOI") as total revenue less property operating and maintenance, real estate taxes, homeowners  association fees, and property management expenses. NOI excludes depreciation and amortization, portfolio acquisition expense, general and administrative expenses, share-based compensation, severance and other, interest expense, net gain on disposition of real estate, adjustments for derivative instruments, net, income tax expense, net and other non-comparable items as applicable. We consider NOI to be a meaningful financial measure when considered with the financial statements determined in accordance with GAAP. We believe NOI is helpful to investors in understanding the core performance of our real estate operations without regard to items excluded from the calculation of such measure, which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon accounting methods, book value of assets, capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired, among other factors.  
    
  We believe Same-Home NOI is a useful measure of performance because the population of properties in this analysis is consistent from period to period, thereby eliminating the effects of changes in the composition of the portfolio. 

35 

     Table of Contents     

The following is a reconciliation of our NOI and Same-Home NOI to net loss as determined in accordance with GAAP for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   (amounts in thousands): 

Neither NOI nor Same-Home NOI should be considered an alternative to net loss or net cash flows from operating activities, as determined in accordance with GAAP, as indications of our performance or as measures of liquidity. Although we use these non-GAAP measures for comparability in assessing our performance against other REITs, not all REITs compute these non-GAAP measures in the same manner.  Accordingly, there can be no assurance that our basis for computing these non-GAAP measures is comparable with that of other REITs. 

Funds From Operations and Core Funds From Operations  
    
  Funds from operations ("FFO") is a non-GAAP financial measure that we believe, when considered with the financial statements determined in accordance with GAAP, is helpful to investors in understanding our performance because it captures features particular to real estate performance by recognizing that real estate generally appreciates over time or maintains residual value to a much greater extent than do other depreciable assets. The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") defines FFO as net income (loss), computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains or losses from sales of, and impairment losses recognized with respect to, depreciable property, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated on the same basis to determine FFO.  
    
    Core funds from operations ("Core FFO") is a non-GAAP financial measure that we use as a supplemental measure of our performance. We believe that Core FFO is further helpful to investors as it provides a more consistent measurement of our performance across reporting periods by removing the impact of certain items that are not comparable from period to period. We adjust FFO for expensed acquisition fees and costs, share-based compensation, severance and other, adjustments for derivative instruments, net, income tax expense on disposition of real estate, and certain other non-cash or non-comparable costs to arrive at Core FFO.  

36 

     Table of Contents     

FFO and Core FFO should not be considered alternatives to net income (loss) or net cash flows from operating activities, as determined in accordance with GAAP, as indications of our performance or as measures of liquidity. These non-GAAP measures are not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund future cash needs. In addition, although we use these non-GAAP measures for comparability in assessing our performance against other REITs, not all REITs compute these non-GAAP measures in the same manner. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that our basis for computing these non-GAAP measures is comparable with that of other REITs. This is due in part to the differences in capitalization policies used by different companies and the significant effect these capitalization policies have on FFO and Core FFO. Real estate costs incurred in connection with real estate operations which are accounted for as capital improvements are added to the carrying value of the property and depreciated over time, whereas real estate costs that are expenses are accounted for as a current period expense. This impacts FFO and Core FFO because costs that are accounted for as expenses reduce FFO and Core FFO. Conversely, real estate costs associated with assets that are capitalized and then subsequently depreciated are excluded from the calculation of FFO and Core FFO. 
    
  FFO and Core FFO are calculated on a gross basis and, as such, do not reflect adjustments for the noncontrolling interests - Operating Partnership.     

37 

     Table of Contents     

The following table sets forth a reconciliation of our net loss as determined in accordance with GAAP and our calculations of FFO and Core FFO for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . Also presented is information regarding the weighted-average number of shares of our common stock and common units of the Operating Partnership outstanding and the effect of dilutive securities attributable to certain performance-based stock awards used for the computation of FFO and Core FFO per share (amounts in thousands, except share and per share amounts):  

(1) 
    Portfolio acquisition expense represents transaction costs incurred when acquiring properties that meet the definition of a business under the guidance codified in ASC 805, which must be expensed when incurred rather than capitalized into the basis of each property. 
              (2) 
    Non-comparable costs from prior periods. 
              (3) 
    Represents the weighted average of common shares and common units in the Operating Partnership outstanding for the periods presented.  
              (4) 
    Includes the effect of dilutive securities attributable to certain stock based awards meeting market conditions during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .

Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  
    
  Market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates. Our future revenue, cash flows and fair values relevant to certain financial instruments are dependent upon prevailing market interest rates. Our Securitization Loan and revolving credit facility have variable rates of interest. We are therefore most vulnerable to changes in short-term LIBOR interest rates. To mitigate this risk, we use derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps and interest rate caps in an effort to reduce the variability of earnings caused by changes in the interest rates we pay on our debt. 
    
  These derivative transactions are entered into solely for risk management purposes, not for investment purposes. When undertaken, these derivative instruments likely will expose us to certain risks such as price and interest rate fluctuations, timing risk, volatility risk, credit risk, counterparty risk and changes in the liquidity of markets. Therefore, although we expect to transact in these derivative instruments purely for risk management, they may not adequately protect us from fluctuations in our financing interest rate obligations. 
    
  We currently borrow funds at variable rates using secured financings. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had recorded   $668.2 million   of variable rate debt outstanding, of which   $296.0 million   was effectively converted to fixed rate through swap contracts and   $372.2 million   was protected by interest rate caps. If the weighted-average interest rate on this variable rate debt had been one percentage point higher the annual interest expense would increase by $3.7 million. If the weighted-average interest rate on this variable rate debt had been one percentage point lower the annual interest expense would decrease by $3.2 million. These amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our debt. This analysis does not consider the effects of the changes in overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment and assumes no changes in our financial structure. 
    
  We cannot predict with certainty the effect of adverse changes in interest rates on our Securitization Loan and 
  revolving credit facility and, therefore, our exposure to market risk, nor can we provide any assurance that long-term debt will 
  be available at advantageous pricing. Consequently, future results may differ materially from the estimated adverse changes 
  discussed above. 
    
  For discussion of our borrowing activity in the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , see Item 2, "Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources  in Part I of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  

Item 4.       Controls and Procedures 
    
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
    
  Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), as of   September 30, 2016  . Based on such evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that, as of the end of such period, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. We continue to review and document our disclosure controls and procedures, including our internal controls over financial reporting, and may from time to time make changes aimed at enhancing their effectiveness and to ensure that our systems evolve with our business. 
    
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
    
  There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

Re:    Separation Agreement and Release 
    
  Dear Christine: 
    
  As we have discussed with you, your employment with Silver Bay Property Corp. ( Silver Bay ) will terminate effective September 29, 2016.  Pursuant to the Severance and Change in Control Agreement among you, Silver Bay Property Corp., and Silver Bay Realty Trust Corp., dated January 21, 2016 (the  Severance Agreement ), Silver Bay Property Corp. is willing to provide you with the separation pay and benefits described in the Severance Agreement in exchange for your agreement to the terms and conditions of this Separation Agreement and Release ( Agreement ).   
    
  By your signature below, you agree to the following terms and conditions: 
    
  1.      End of Employment  . 
       
  a.    Your employment with Silver Bay (and any all related entities) ended effective September 29, 2016 (the  Separation Date ).  If you are an officer of Silver Bay or any related entities, effective upon the Separation Date you resign all such positions, and you agree to execute any and all documents necessary or helpful to effectuate such resignation(s). 
    
  b.    Upon your receipt of (i) your final paycheck, which includes payment for services for the final payroll period through the Separation Date, and (ii) reimbursement for unreimbursed business expenses incurred by you on or before the Separation Date which are reimbursable under Silver Bay s business expense reimbursement policies (provided, however,  that you must provide Silver Bay with receipts and supporting documents for such expenses within 45 days of the Separation Date in order to be reimbursed), you will have received all wages and payments owed to you by virtue of your employment or termination thereof. 
    
  c.    Upon your receipt of payment in the amount of $8,087.21, less applicable payroll taxes, deductions, and withholding, which represents payment for 67.29 hours of accrued and unused vacation at your regular rate, you will have received all benefits owed to you by virtue of your employment or termination thereof. 
    
  d.    The COBRA period for continuation of your insurance coverage under Silver Bay s group plans will begin on the first day of the month immediately following the Separation  

Date.  Information regarding your right to elect COBRA coverage will be sent to you via separate letter. 
    
  e.    During your employment with Silver Bay, you were granted various restricted stock pursuant to Silver Bay Realty Trust Corp. s 2012 Equity Incentive Plan.  As of the Separation Date you were (i) vested in 24,086 time-based-share units, (ii) unvested in 11,157 time-based-vesting share units, (iii) vested in 0 performance-based-vesting share units, and (iv) unvested in 25,000 performance-based-vesting share units.  Effective upon the Separation Date, Silver Bay will accelerate the vesting of the unvested 11,157 time-based-vesting share units of restricted stock in Silver Bay.  By accelerating the vesting of your unvested shares of restricted stock, you may be subject to adverse tax consequences, including receipt of additional ordinary income, which will be subject to payroll taxes, deductions, and withholding.  The 25,000 unvested performance-based-vesting share units will automatically terminate and be canceled on the Separation Date, and you hereby fully and forever waive and release any and all right to such terminated and canceled restricted shares. 
    
  f.    You are not eligible for any other payments or benefits by virtue of your employment or termination thereof except for those expressly described in this Agreement.  You will receive the payments described in this Section 1 whether or not you sign this Agreement.  You will not receive the separation pay and benefits described in Section 2 of this Agreement if (i) you do not sign this Agreement, (ii) pursuant to Section 5 below, you rescind your release of claims and Silver Bay then elects to void the Agreement, or (iii) you violate any of the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. 
    
  2.      Separation Pay and Benefits  .  Specifically in consideration of your signing this Agreement and subject to the limitations, obligations, and other provisions contained in this Agreement, Silver Bay agrees as follows: 
    
  a.    To pay you one (1) year s base salary severance, in the amount of $250,000.00, less applicable payroll taxes, deductions, and withholding, to be paid in a lump sum on the first payroll cycle immediately following the 60th day after the Separation Date, provided that you have duly executed and delivered to Silver Bay this Agreement and the Agreement has not been rescinded (in whole or in part) and has become irrevocable on or before the 60th day.  The payments described in Sections 2.a. and 2.b. will be considered timely if placed in the U.S. Mail, postage prepaid, and postmarked on the date payment is due.  If the date payment would be due falls on a weekend or holiday, payment will be considered timely if it is placed in the U.S. Mail, postage prepaid, on the next business day following the weekend or holiday.  
    
  b.    To pay you a Pro-Rated Bonus for the current fiscal year in the amount of $168,287.67, less applicable payroll taxes, deductions, and withholding, to be paid in a lump sum on the first payroll cycle immediately following the 60th day after the Separation Date, provided that you have duly executed and delivered to Silver Bay this Agreement and the Agreement has not been rescinded (in whole or in part) and has become irrevocable on or before the 60th day.   

- 2 - 

c.    If you elect pursuant to COBRA to continue to participate in Silver Bay s group health insurance plan, to reimburse you for the ordinary employer share of the premiums (equal to the ordinary employer share paid on behalf of similarly-situated active employees) for coverage under Silver Bay s group health insurance plan for up to a maximum of 18 continuous months immediately following the Separation Date.  You will continue to be responsible to pay the full premiums and comply with Silver Bay s expense reimbursement policies to obtain reimbursement under this section.  Silver Bay will discontinue payments under this Section 2.d. before the end of the 18-month period if, and at such time as, you (i) are covered under a group health insurance plan that provides substantially equivalent health insurance coverage through a new employer or self-employment, or (ii) cease to participate, for whatever reason, in Silver Bay s group health insurance plan.  You agree to promptly provide Silver Bay notice if you become covered under the group health insurance plan of a new employer or through self-employment.  The payments described in this section will be subject to payroll taxes, deductions, and withholding, and such additional taxes to the extent necessary to avoid adverse consequences to you or Silver Bay (or any related entity) under either Code Section 105(h) or the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010.   Silver Bay has the right to modify or terminate its group insurance plans at any time and you will have the same right to participate in Silver Bay s group insurance plans only as is provided on an equivalent basis to Silver Bay s employees.  The COBRA period for continuation of your insurance coverage under Silver Bay s group plans will begin on the date set forth in Section 1.d. above.

Further, you acknowledge that you are not aware of any material violations by Company and/or its officers, administrators, directors, agents, attorneys, or employees of any statute, regulation or other rules that have not been addressed by Company through appropriate compliance and/or corrective action. 
    
  12.      Successors and Assigns  .  This Agreement is personal to you and may not be assigned by you without the written agreement of Company.  The rights and obligations of this Agreement will inure to the successors and assigns of Company. 

- 7 - 

13.      Enforceability  .  If a court finds any term of this Agreement to be invalid, unenforceable, or void, the parties agree that the court will modify such term to make it enforceable to the maximum extent possible.  If the term cannot be modified, the parties agree that the term will be severed and all other terms of this Agreement will remain in effect.

  15.      Code Section 409A  .

In all cases, for purposes of compliance with Code Section 409A,  termination of employment  will have the same meaning as  separation from service  as defined in Code Section 409A.  In no event whatsoever will Company be liable for any additional tax, interest, or penalty that may be imposed on you by Code Section 409A or damages for failing to comply with Code Section 409A. 
    
  16.      Full Agreement  .  This Agreement contains the full agreement between you and Company and may not be modified, altered, or changed in any way except by written agreement signed by both parties.  The parties agree that this Agreement supersedes and terminates any and all other written and oral agreements and understandings between the parties, including but not limited to the Severance Agreement.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you have previously signed an agreement or agreements with Company containing confidentiality, trade secret, noncompetition, nonsolicitation, inventions, and/or similar provisions, your obligations under such agreement(s) (including but not limited to the Confidentiality and Nonsolicitation Agreement and the restrictions contained in the Severance Agreement) will continue in full force and effect according to their terms and will survive the termination of your employment. 
    
  17.      Acknowledgment of Reading and Understanding  .  By signing this Agreement, you acknowledge that you have read this Agreement, including the release of claims contained in Section 3, and understand that the release of claims is a   full and final release of all claims   you may have against Company and the other entities and individuals covered by the release.  By signing, you also acknowledge and agree that you have entered into this Agreement knowingly and voluntarily. 
    
  18.      Expiration of Offer  .    The offer contained in this Agreement will automatically expire at midnight on the twenty-first (21   st   ) calendar day after you receive it not counting the date of receipt (the  Expiration Date ).

After you sign the Agreement, you should promptly return one copy of this Agreement to Daniel Buechler.  You should keep the other copy for your records.
