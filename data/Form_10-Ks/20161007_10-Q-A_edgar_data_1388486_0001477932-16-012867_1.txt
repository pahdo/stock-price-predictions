You should read statements that contain these words carefully, because they discuss our expectations about our future operating results or our future financial condition or state other "forward-looking" information. There may be events in the future that we are not able to accurately predict or control. Before you invest in our securities, you should be aware that the occurrence of any of the events described in this Quarterly Report could substantially harm our business, results of operations and financial condition, and that upon the occurrence of any of these events, the trading price of our securities could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, growth rates, levels of activity, performance or achievements. We are under no duty to update any of the forward-looking statements after the date of this Quarterly Report to conform these statements to actual results.

     Table of Contents          SPOTLIGHT INNOVATION INC.     NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     (unaudited)       NOTE 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION       Spotlight Innovation Inc. (the  Company ) was organized under the laws of the state of Nevada on March 23, 2012 under the name Spotlight Innovation, LLC. In December 2013, the Company, through a reverse acquisition, merged with American Exploration Corporation ( American Exploration ). The Company is a life science company that identifies and acquires rights of innovative, proprietary technologies designed to address unmet medical needs, with an emphasis on rare, emerging and neglected diseases. To find and evaluate unique opportunities, we leverage our extensive relationships with leading scientists, academic institutions and other sources. We provide value-added development capability to accelerate progress. When scientifically significant benchmarks have been achieved, we will endeavor to partner with proven market leaders via sale, out-license or strategic alliance.     As of June 30, 2016, the Company has three subsidiaries: Celtic Biotech Iowa, Inc., Memcine Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and CDT Veterinary Therapeutics, Inc. (See Note 10 below).       Celtic Biotech Iowa, Inc.      On June 4, 2014, Celtic Biotech Iowa, Inc. (hereinafter "Celtic Iowa," a subsidiary of the Company) acquired Celtic Biotech Limited (hereinafter "Celtic Limited"). Celtic Limited was founded in 2003 in Dublin, Ireland and is developing novel and highly specialized compounds derived from snake venom, for the treatment of solid cancers and cancer imaging.       Memcine Pharmaceuticals, Inc.      The Company acquired approximately 82% of Memcine Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ("Memcine") in June 2015. The Company agreed to provide Memcine with up to $3,000,000 to fund the operations of Memcine via investment, grants or other means over the course of operations, upon the achievement of certain milestones, as determined by the board of directors of Memcine. Memcine, founded in 2010, holds the exclusive worldwide rights to Immunoplex, , a vaccine platform technology developed at the University of Iowa, with universal application to numerous antigens developed to improve vaccine efficacy by using more efficient targeting and delivery.       Basis of Presentation       The accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) and the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) and should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto contained in the Company's latest Annual Report filed with the SEC on Form 10-K. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position and the results of operations for the interim periods presented have been reflected herein. The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. Notes to the financial statements that would substantially duplicate disclosures contained in the audited financial statements for the most recent fiscal year, as reported in the Form 10-K filed with the SEC on August 31, 2016, have been omitted.      NOTE 2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES        Use of Estimates       The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Significant estimates include those regarding the valuation of option and warrant transactions.                  7       
     Table of Contents           Principles of Consolidation       The consolidated financial statements include the Company s accounts, including those of the Company s subsidiaries Celtic Iowa and Memcine. During the year ended December 31, 2014 the Company acquired 95% of the outstanding shares of Celtic Biotech. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company acquired 82.25% of the outstanding shares of Memcine. Accordingly, the Company has consolidated Celtic Limited, Celtic Iowa and Memcine. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.       Non-Controlling Interest       The Company is required to report the non-controlling interest in Celtic   Limited,   a subsidiary of Celtic Iowa and Memcine, as a separate component of shareholders  equity. The Company is also required to present the consolidated net income and the portion of the consolidated net income allocable to the non-controlling interest and to the shareholders of the Company separately in its consolidated statements of operations. Losses applicable to the non-controlling interest are allocated to the non-controlling interest even when those losses are in excess of the non-controlling interest s investment basis.       Loss per Common Share       Basic net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing the net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing the net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding during the period. Common share equivalents included in the diluted computation represent shares issuable upon assumed exercise of stock options and warrants or the assumed conversion of convertible debt instruments, using the treasury stock and  if converted  method. For periods in which net losses are incurred, weighted average shares outstanding is the same for basic and diluted loss per share calculations, as the inclusion of common share equivalents would have an anti-dilutive effect.     For the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, the dilutive effect of the issuance of 0 and 5,200 options, 0 and 2,992,671 warrants, and 0 and 5,215,967 common shares issuable for conversion of convertible debt, respectively, were excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation because their effect would have been anti-dilutive.       Cash and Cash Equivalents       The Company considers all highly liquid investments with maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents.       Concentrations of Credit Risk       Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk include cash deposits placed with financial institutions. The Company maintains its cash in bank accounts which, at times, may exceed federally insured limits as guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ). As of June 30, 2016, the Company had $0 of cash balances that were uninsured. The Company has not experienced any losses on such accounts.       Foreign exchange and currency translation       For the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company maintained cash accounts in U.S. Dollars and European Union euros, and incurred certain expenses denominated in European Union euros. The Company's and its consolidated subsidiaries  functional and reporting currency is the U.S. Dollar. Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are remeasured into U.S. Dollars at exchange rates in effect on the date of the transactions. Assets and liabilities are remeasured using exchange rates at the end of each period. Exchange gains or losses on re-measurements are included in earnings.                  8       
     Table of Contents         In the event that the functional currency of a Company s consolidated subsidiary was not the U.S. Dollar, then that subsidiary s foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. Dollars at the current exchange rate and non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated using historical exchange rates. Such adjustments resulting from the translation process would be reported in a separate component of other comprehensive income and are not included in the determination of the results of operations. As of June 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company had no subsidiaries with functional currencies that required translation.       In-Process Research and Development       In-process research and development ( IPR D ) represents the estimated fair value assigned to research and development projects acquired in a purchased business combination that have not been completed at the date of acquisition and which have no alternative future use. IPR D assets acquired in a business combination are capitalized as indefinite-lived intangible assets. These assets remain indefinite-lived until the completion or abandonment of the associated research and development efforts. During the periods prior to completion or abandonment, those acquired indefinite-lived assets are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently, if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. During periods after completion, those acquired indefinite-lived assets are amortized based on their useful life. During the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company acquired IPR D assets in its acquisition of Celtic Limited, the fair value of the assets acquired was $6,977,347. These assets are still subject to research and development completion and accordingly, no amortization has been recorded. The IPR D was evaluated for impairment at December 31. 2015 and it was determined that no impairment existed.       Equipment       Equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred. Renewals and betterments which extend the life or improve existing equipment are capitalized. Upon disposition or retirement of equipment, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in operations. Depreciation is provided using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which is 3-10 years.       Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and Intangibles       The Company performs impairment tests on its long-lived assets when circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. If required, recoverability is tested by comparing the estimated future undiscounted cash flows of the asset or asset group to its carrying value. If the carrying value is not recoverable, the asset or asset group is written down to fair value. For the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded $0 in impairment to the Company s long-lived assets. On December 31, 2015 the Company recorded an impairment of the intangible asset for Memcine of $212,000.       Stock-Based Compensation       The Company measures the cost of employee services received in exchange for stock and stock options based on the grant date fair value of the awards. The Company determines the fair value of stock option grants using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Company determines the fair value of shares of non-vested stock (also commonly referred to as restricted stock) based on the last quoted price of our stock on the date of the share grant. The fair value determined represents the cost for the award and is recognized over the vesting period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award. As share-based compensation expense is recognized based on awards ultimately expected to vest, the Company reduces the expense for estimated forfeitures based on historical forfeiture rates, if such historical forfeiture rates are available. Previously recognized compensation costs may be adjusted to reflect the actual forfeiture rate for the entire award at the end of the vesting period. Excess tax benefits, if any, are recognized as an addition to paid-in capital.       Income Taxes       The Company utilizes the asset and liability method in accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards and for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets unless it is more likely than not that the value of such assets will be realized.                   9       
     Table of Contents           Fair Value of Financial Instruments       The Company follows FASB ASC 820,  Fair Value Measurement  ( ASC 820 ), which clarifies fair value as an exit price, establishes a hierarchal disclosure framework for measuring fair value, and requires extended disclosures about fair value measurements. The provisions of ASC 820 apply to all financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value.     As defined in ASC 820, fair value, clarified as an exit price, represents the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As a result, fair value is a market-based approach that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability.     As a basis for considering these assumptions, ASC 820 defines a three-tier value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used in the valuation methodologies in measuring fair value.                  Level 1   Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.                       Level 2   Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.                       Level 3   Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.         The fair value hierarchy also requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.       Subsequent Events       The Company evaluated subsequent events through the date when financial statements are issued for disclosure consideration.       Recent Accounting Pronouncements       There were various accounting standards and interpretations issued recently, none of which are expected to have a material effect on the Company s operations, financial position or cash flows.      NOTE 3. GOING CONCERN      The Company is an early stage company and as such has not generated revenues from operations and there is no assurance of any future revenues. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates, among other things, the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. As of June 30, 2016, the Company has accumulated net losses of $21,221,820, and has a working capital deficit $6,129,772. These factors raise substantial doubt as to the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.     The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company s successful efforts to raise sufficient capital and then attain profitable operations. Management is investigating all options to raise enough funds to meet the Company s working capital requirements through either the sale of the Company s common stock or other financings. There can be no assurances, however, that management will be able to obtain sufficient additional funds when needed, or that such funds, if available, will be obtained on terms satisfactory to the Company.            NOTE 4. NOTES PAYABLE      On December 16, 2013, the Company assumed the liabilities of American Exploration which included the following notes payable too unrelated third parties:           The Company also assumed $97,436 in accrued interest related to these notes. The Company recorded $14,574 and $14,360 in interest expense for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, on the above notes payable.     The Company also assumed a liability for previous advances made by American Exploration s former CEO in the amount of $23,433 of which the Company repaid $3,500 in calendar year 2015 bringing the balance to the current $19,933 at June 30, 2016. These advances are due on demand and do not bear interest.     On December 31, 2015 recorded a guarantee for one of the lenders in the amount of $34,529.     During 2016, the Company has received demand notices from Pierco Management for its part of the assumed American Exploration notes payable for payment of principal and interest. On September 1, 2016, the Company agreed to a settlement and release agreement with Pierco Management as set forth in the table below:                  The Company and Pierco Management agreed to the following:                   Immediate cash payment of $25,000 from the Company.                        A deferred cash payment of $25,000 due in 90 days from the effective date.                        Issuance to Pierco Management of $50,000 worth of Company common stock using the average closing price for the 20 consecutive trading days preceding the effective date of the agreement.           NOTE 5. CONVERTIBLE INSTRUMENTS        Kopriva Note       On September 27, 2013, the Company entered into a convertible note (the  Kopriva Note ) in the amount of $40,000 with an investor. The term of the Kopriva Note was fifteen months from commencement. During the term of the Kopriva Note, interest accrued on the unpaid principal balance at a fixed rate equal to 10% per annum, compounded annually. Should the Company default on the Kopriva Note, the outstanding balance of the Kopriva Note bears interest at the default rate of 20% per annum, compounded annually. In addition to the interest accrued the holder received warrants to purchase up to 100,000 shares of common stock. The conversion feature of the Kopriva Note and the exercise price of the warrants is the greater of (i) a discount of 40% to the 20-day average closing market price prior to the day that the warrant is executed or (ii) $0.20 per share. The warrants expire December 27, 2017. The relative fair value of the warrants issued on the date of grant was $25,136 and was recorded as a debt discount on the Kopriva Note. On January 11, 2016, the Kopriva Note was converted into 100,000 shares of common stock at $0.5514 per share.     In connection with the Kopriva Note, the conversion feature was also analyzed for a beneficial conversion feature at which time it was concluded that a beneficial conversion feature existed. The Company recorded a debt discount of $14,864 for the fair value of the beneficial conversion feature. The Company is amortizing the combined debt discounts from the warrants and beneficial conversion feature over the term of the Kopriva Note. The Company recorded interest expense of $8,000 related to the amortization of the debt discounts for the three months ended March 31, 2015. The Company also recorded $1,000 in interest expense for the three months ended March 31, 2015.     On December 19, 2014, the Company entered an agreement to extinguish the Kopriva Note and its accrued interest in exchange for 100,002 shares of common stock. This agreement modified the terms of the conversion which resulted in the holder receiving more shares. As a result of the modification of the conversion feature, the Company determined that the change in the fair value of the conversion feature was greater than 10% and accordingly, recorded $120,085 as a loss on debt extinguishment which was the difference in fair value of the new conversion feature and the carrying value of the Kopriva Note and accrued interest on the date of modification. The Company recorded the issuance of the common stock on conversion at its fair value of $165,003 based on the market price on the date of grant.        Convertible Debt Associated with Line of Credit       On April 4, 2014, the Company entered into a letter of credit (the  April Letter of Credit ) with Denver Savings Bank in the principal amount of $752,325.

As security for the April Letter of Credit a third party (the  April Cosigner ) cosigned the April Letter of Credit, and pledged certain collateral. In exchange for this pledge the Company issued to the April Cosigner, 150,000 shares of common stock of the Company, and agreed to issue 30,000 shares of its common stock upon each one-year anniversary of the April Letter of Credit, provided that the April Letter of Credit remains in effect.

Subsequent to the termination of the foregoing Convertible Promissory Note, the Company issued a new Note to K4 Enterprises, LLC.

This series of Convertible Promissory Notes with Warrants was issued in connection with the April Line of Credit and the July Line of Credit.     - The Company and its counterparties terminated a series of agreements (including (i) Unit Subscription Agreements (USA Control No. 849207105 STLT No's: 01-10), (ii) Confidential Memorandum of Terms (MOT Control No. 849207105 STLT), (iii) Account Management Agreements (AMA Control No: AMA 849207105 STLT), and (iv) Escrow   Compliance Attorney Agreement, collectively referred to as the "Subscription Agreements") with nine investors, Copperbottom Investments, Ltd., Britannia Securities International, Ltd., Agri-Technologies International, Ltd., On Time Investments, ltd., RnD Company, Ltd., Rooftop Holdings, Ltd., Sequence Investments Ltd., Anybright Investments, Ltd., and Orange Investments, Ltd. (collectively the "Investors").

NOTE 6. INCOME TAXES      Realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon sufficient future taxable income during the period that deductible temporary differences and carry-forwards are expected to be available to reduce taxable income.     At June 30, 2016, the Company s deferred tax assets consisted primarily of net operating loss carry forwards acquired from American Exploration in the merger. For the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, the material reconciling items between the tax benefit computed at the statutory rate and the actual benefit recognized in the financial statements consisted of expenses related to share-based compensation and the change in the valuation allowance during the applicable period. At June 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company has recorded a 100% valuation allowance as management believes it is likely that any deferred tax assets will not be realized.     As of June 30, 2016, the Company has a net operating loss carry forward of approximately $19.1 million, which will expire between years 2028 and 2035. Due to the change in ownership provisions of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, our net operating loss carry forwards are expected to be subject to significant annual limitations for the change in ownership that resulted in the Merger.      NOTE 7. EQUITY      The Company has authorized the issuance of 500,000 shares of Series A preferred stock, 500,000 shares of Series C preferred stock, 4,000,000 shares of preferred stock and 4,000,000,000 shares of common stock.     Common Stock     On January 11, 2016, a holder exercised warrants to purchase 100,000 shares of common stock. The exercise price was 60% of the average closing market price for the 20 consecutive trading days preceding the exercise date. Total proceeds received from the exercise was $55,140. During the period April 8, 2016 through April 14, 2016 the Company issued 780,000 shares of common stock for services to the Company. The fair value of the common stock at issue dates totaled $377,500 and has been recorded as stock compensation expense.     Convertible Notes     During the six months ended June 30, 2016, as set forth in the table below, the Company entered into subscription agreements with certain individuals and entities for purchase of an aggregate of $550,000 principal amount of convertible notes.

A Qualified Financing means the issuance of equity securities to one or more investor in the amount of $2,000,000 or more of gross cash proceeds, of any conversion of outstanding securities.

Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.        Overview      The Company is a life sciences company that identifies and acquires rights to innovative proprietary technologies designed to address unmet medical needs, with an emphasis on rare, emerging and neglected diseases. To find and evaluate unique opportunities, we leverage our extensive relationships with leading scientists, academic institutions and other sources. We provide value-added development capability to accelerate the progress. When scientifically significant benchmarks have been achieved, we will endeavor to partner with proven market leaders via sale, out-license or strategic alliance. We believe that targeting rare and/or neglected indications offers and accelerated path to market, support from nonprofit advocacy groups, scarcity of competition, and pricing leverage.      Plan of Operation      Through June 30, 2016, management successfully completed two acquisitions, Celtic Biotech Iowa, Inc. and Memcine Pharmaceuticals, Inc.     Generally, we have financed operations to date through the proceeds of the private placement of equity and debt instruments. Management anticipates additional increases in operating expenses and capital expenditures relating to retention of additional personnel, and advancement of our technologies. We anticipate that we will finance these expenses with further issuances of equity securities and debt issuances. The Company sought to raise $850,000 in December 2015. $300,000 of those proceeds were received in 2015, and $550,000 was received in the first six-months of 2016.      The Company anticipates securing additional financing in 2016. Additional issuances of equity or convertible debt securities could result in dilution to our current shareholders. Further, such securities may have rights, preferences or privileges senior to our common stock. Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms, or at all.      Critical Accounting Policies      Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe there have been no significant changes in our critical accounting policies as discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.      Financial Condition and Changes in Financial Condition       Overall Operating Results:       Comparison of the Three Months Ended June 30, 2016 with the Three Months Ended June 30, 2015        Revenue.   For the three months ended June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015, sales were $0. The lack of revenues is due to the Company continuing to develop technologies in the health field.       General and Administrative Expenses .  Our selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $1,236,515 for the three months ended June 30, 2016, from $759,476 for the three months ended June 30, 2015, representing a $477,039 increase. The increase was mainly due to an increase in professional and consulting fees.              Other Income (Expense).   For the three months ended June 30, 2016, other income was $111,870, compared to $265,808 for the three months ended June 30, 2015. The decrease in other expense was primarily due to the change in fair value of derivative liability for 2016.       Net Loss .  The Company s net loss was $1,142,277 and $1,003,028 for the three months ended June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015, respectively. The increase in net loss was mainly due to an increase in professional fees and consulting services, offset by the change in the fair value of the derivative liability, as noted above.      Comparison of the Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 with the Six Months Ended June 30, 2015        Revenue.   For the six months ended June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015, sales were $0. The lack of revenues is due to the Company continuing to develop technologies in the health field.       General and Administrative Expenses .  Our selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $2,219,647 for the six months ended June 30, 2016, from $1,409,011 for the six months ended June 30, 2015, representing a $810,636 increase. The increase was mainly due to an increase in professional and consulting fees.       Other Income (Expense).   For the six months ended June 30, 2016, other expense was $270,597, compared to $547,619 for the six months ended June 30, 2015. The decrease in other expense was primarily due to decreased interest expense related to the restructuring of debt and the termination and release agreements the Company entered into as of December 31, 2015 resulting in less interest expense for 2016 as compared to 2015 and the change in fair value of the derivative liability for 2016.       Net Loss .  The Company s net loss was $2,606,903 and $1,964,358 for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in net loss was mainly due to an increase in professional fees and consulting services and a decrease in interest expense, as noted above.      Liquidity and Capital Resources:      The Company had $72,522 in cash and equivalents as of June 30, 2016. The Company has negative working capital of $6.1 million and total stockholders  equity of $0.88 million as of June 30, 2016. For the six months ended June 30, 2016, the Company has experienced recurring losses from operations and may not have enough cash and working capital to fund its operations beyond the very near term, which raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Management has made a similar note in the financial statements. The Company anticipates it will need approximately $3,000,000 for the next twelve months to fund operations. We may be required to seek additional capital by selling debt or equity securities, selling assets, or otherwise be required to bring cash flows in balance when we approach a condition of cash insufficiency. The sale of additional equity or debt securities, if accomplished, may result in dilution to our then shareholders. We provide no assurance that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, or at all.

ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures         Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures       We conducted an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures. The term  disclosure controls and procedures,  as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ( Exchange Act ), means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures also include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded as of June 30, 2016 that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective at ensuring that the material information required to be disclosed in the Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported as required in applicable SEC rules and forms. Through the use of external consultants and the review process, management believes that the financial statements and other information presented herewith are materially correct.       Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting       During the quarter ended June 30, 2016, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with management s evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over the financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act.
