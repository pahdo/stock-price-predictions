 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES    

A.
Organization and General Description of Business   

Cannabis
Science, Inc.  ( We  or  the Company ), was incorporated under the laws of the State of Colorado,
on February 29, 1996, as Patriot Holdings, Inc.  On August 26, 1999, the Company changed its name to National Healthcare
Technology, Inc. On June 6, 2007, the Company changed its name from National Healthcare Technology, Inc., to Brighton Oil  
Gas, Inc., and converted to a Nevada corporation.  On March 25, 2008 the Company changed its name to Gulf Onshore, Inc.
 On April 6, 2009, the Company changed its name to Cannabis Science, Inc., and obtained a new CUSIP number.    

On
May 7, 2009 the Company common shares commenced trading under the new stock symbol OTCBB: CBIS.  

Cannabis
Science, Inc. is at the forefront of medical marijuana research and development.  The Company works with world authorities
on phytocannabinoid science targeting critical illnesses, and adheres to scientific methodologies to develop, produce, and commercialize
phytocannabinoid-based pharmaceutical products.  In sum, we are dedicated to the creation of cannabis-based medicines, both
with and without psychoactive properties, to treat disease and the symptoms of disease, as well as for general health maintenance.  The
Company formed two operating subsidiaries Cannabis Science BV and Cannabis Science International Holding BV in The Netherlands
on May 10 th  and May 6 th , 2013, respectively, to pursue business opportunities in Europe and worldwide.  There
are currently minimal operations in the subsidiaries.  Agreements and business disclosures are in process.  

On
November 15, 2013, the Company submitted a patent application N2010968 in Europe entitled  Composition for the Treatment
of Neurobehavioral Disorders.   The subject of the patent is development of cannabinoid-based formulations to treat
a variety of neurobehavioral disorders, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety, and sleep disorders.

On
November 20, 2014, the Company signed an amendment to the license agreement with Apothecary Genetics Investments LLC.  Pursuant
to the amendment, the Company was to acquire all property, building, and equipment of Apothecary.  The Company signed a second
amendment on January 11, 2016 which superseded both License Agreement and November 20, 2014 Amendment by the issuance of additional
15,500,000 shares of Rule 144 restricted common stock for a property located in Northern California. The 14,500,000 shares of
Rule 144 restrict common stock, valued at $971,500 as deposit, issued in November of 2014 were for compensation of research and
development on the Northern California property. The Company wrote off the deposit as Research and Development expenses for the
period ended September 30, 2016. In the month of July 2016, Apothecary Genetics Investments, LLC breached the amended agreement
by refusing to transfer the Northern California property to the Company and demanded additional paymentfor the property. The Company
declined to pay additional funds for the property and put the project on hold.All the 15,500,000 Rule 144 restricted common shares
are held in escrow until further decision by the management of the Company.  

B. 
Basis of Presentation   

These
consolidated financial statements and related notes are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States, and are expressed in U.S. dollars.  The Company s fiscal year end is December 31.  

Interim
Financial Reporting   

While
the information presented in the accompanying interim consolidated financial statements is unaudited, it includes all adjustments,
which are in the opinion of management, necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows
for the interim periods presented in accordance with general accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( GAAP ).
These interim financial statements follow the same accounting policies and methods of application as used in the December 31,
2015 audited financial statements of Cannabis Science, Inc. (the  Company ). All adjustments are of a normal, recurring
nature. Interim financial statements and the notes thereto do not contain all of the disclosures normally found in the year-end
audited financial statements and these Notes to Financial Statements are abbreviated and contain only certain disclosures related
to the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. It is suggested that these interim financial statements be read in
conjunction with the Company s audited financial statements and related notes for the year ended December 31, 2015 included
in our Form 10-K filed with the SEC on file no. 000-28911 161631274 May 9, 2016. Operating results for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that can be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016.  

The
following subsidiaries and controlling interests are included with the consolidated financial statements of the Company for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016:  

In
2012, the Company formed Cannabis Science Europe GmbH ( CSE ) to operate joint-venture operations with Dupetit Natural
Products Ltd.  The JV asset was sold to Endocan Corporation (formerly X-Change Corporation) on December 12, 2012.  No
operations had commenced at the time of sale of the JV asset. The Company has reignited the CSE by appointing Mr. Alfredo Dupetit
on September 19, 2015 as president and chief executive officer of CSE. As recent as January 7, 2016, the Federal Health Ministry
in Germany has presented  Cannabis as medicine , a detailed draft bill that aims to modify the Drug Law and relax
the strict measures that regulate the consumption of medical cannabis and, above all, become the main vehicle for everything relating
to the plant and its medical users in the country. The Company has reinstated the development of cannabis products in February
2016 for medicinal uses in Germany.  

On
May 6, 2013, the Company formed Cannabis Science International Holdings B.V. and on May 10, 2013, the Company formed Cannabis
Science B.V. for the purpose of wholly-owned operating subsidiaries for the Company s European and world-wide operations.
 The Company has commenced some operating activities with cultivation in Spain and product development in 2014.  Mario
Lap, director of the Company and director and officer of Cannabis Science B.V. manages the day-to-day operations through his private
companies MLS BV, MJR BV and Cannabis Agency BV, all are Netherlands registered companies.  

On
August 6, 2014, the Company signed a proposal letter with Michigan Green Technologies, LLC ( MGT ) to acquire an additional
30.1% equity in MGT and completed the transaction with the principals of MGT under the proposal letter on February 20, 2015 to
effectively increase the Company s equity ownership to 50.1%.  As consideration for acquiring the additional 30.1%
equity, the Company issued 1,200,000 shares of common stock with a fair market value of $60,000 to the principals and shareholders
of MGT.  

On
May 6, 2015 the Company announced the Assets acquisition of Equi-Pharm LLC, a USA manufacturer and distributor of specialty horse
and pet grooming and topical applications. The acquisition incorporates an extensive expansion plan for Equi-Pharm including  Large
Animal  such as horses, cattle, sheep and the like and  Small Animal  or  Pets  include cats, dogs, pet
snakes and the like for medical and cosmetic products. As consideration for acquiring the Assets, which consist of Inventory,
Trademark and brand names, and goodwill, the Company issued ten million (10,000,000) shares to the shareholders of Equi-Pharm
and they agreed to change its company name. The acquisition was completed on November 16, 2015 and the Company has formed a new
wholly owned subsidiary called Equi-Pharm LLC. in the state of Tennessee and started the operation of distributing of existing
and new line of products.  

For
other accounting policies please refer to the Company s Form 10-K with the SEC on file no. 000-28911 161631274 May 9, 2016.  

The
Company qualifies as an  emerging growth company  as defined in Section 101 of the Jumpstart our Business Startups
Act ( JOBS Act ) as we do not have more than $1,000,000,000 in annual gross revenue and did not have such amount as
of December 31, 2015, our last fiscal year. We are electing to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised
accounting standards under Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act.  

2.
 GOING CONCERN    

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles,
which contemplate the continuation of the Company as a going concern.  The Company reported an accumulated deficit of $139,971,991and
had a stockholders  deficit of $4,344,643 as of September 30, 2016.  

In
view of the matters described, there is substantial doubt as to the Company's ability to continue as a going concern without a
significant infusion of capital.  At September 30, 2016, the Company had insufficient operating revenues and cash flow to
meet its financial obligations.  There can be no assurance that management will be successful in implementing its plans.
 The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.  

We
anticipate that we will have to raise additional capital to fund operations over the next 12 months.  To the extent that
we are required to raise additional funds to acquire research and growing facilities, and to cover costs of operations, we intend
to do so through additional public or private offerings of debt or equity securities.  There are no commitment or arrangements
for other offerings in place, no guaranties that any such financings would be forthcoming, or as to the terms of
any such financings.  

Any
future financing may involve substantial dilution to existing investors.  We had been relying on our common stock to pay
third parties for services which has resulted in substantial dilution to existing investors.  

3.
FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS AND DISCLOSURES    

ASC
Topic 820,  Fair Value Measurement , establishes a framework for measuring fair value. That framework provides a fair value
hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority
to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority
to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements).

Overview
of the Company s Business   

Cannabis
Science, Inc. (formerly Gulf Onshore, Inc.)  ( We  or  the Company ), was incorporated under
the laws of the State of Colorado, on February 29, 1996, as Patriot Holdings, Inc.  On August 26, 1999, the Company
changed its name to National Healthcare Technology, Inc.  On June 6, 2007, the Company changed its name from National Healthcare
Technology, Inc., to Brighton Oil   Gas, Inc., and converted to a Nevada corporation.  On March 25, 2008 the Company
changed its name to Gulf Onshore, Inc.  On April 7, 2009, the Company changed its name to Cannabis Science, Inc.  

Cannabis
Science, Inc. is at the forefront of medical cannabis research and development.  The Company works with world authorities
on phytocannabinoid science targeting critical illnesses, and adheres to scientific methodologies to develop, produce, and commercialize
phytocannabinoid-based pharmaceutical products.  In summary, we are dedicated to the creation of cannabis-based medicines,
both with and without psychoactive properties, to treat disease and the symptoms of disease, as well as for general health maintenance.

Cannabis
Science, Inc., takes advantage of its unique understanding of metabolic processes to provide novel treatment approaches to a number
of illnesses for which current treatments and understanding remain unsatisfactory.  The Company works with leading experts
in drug development, medicinal characterization, and clinical research to develop, produce, and commercialize novel therapeutic
approaches for the treatment for illnesses caused by infections as well as for age-related illness. Our initial focus is on skin
cancers and neurological conditions.  

Cannabis
Science, Inc. takes advantage of its unique understanding of metabolic processes to provide innovative treatment options for unmet
medical needs.  

Cannabis
use has an extensive history dating back thousands of years, and currently there are thousands of peer-reviewed scientific publications
that document the underlying biochemical pathways that cannabinoids modulate.  

At
Cannabis Science, we use an inquiring approach to discover and develop novel cannabinoid-based therapies to improve patients 
lives. From the initiation, our founders have been committed to fostering and maintaining a bold, pioneering spirit fostering
the true nature of innovation from which cutting edge ideas flourish and translate into evidence-based solutions.  

We
are dedicated to working closely with local, national and international regulatory agencies to provide access to high quality,
first class cannabinoid pharmaceuticals to those critically in need of new treatments for life threatening and debilitating conditions.
Cannabis Science s clinical trial material comes from the cultivation and production facilities that are GMP compliant,
surpassing high quality standard industrial and food processing requirements.  

The
Company works with leading experts in drug development, medicinal characterization, and clinical research to develop, produce,
and commercialize novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment of multiple critical ailments from cancer and infections to age-related
illnesses.  

Our
products, broadly described, are medical cannabinoid formulations developed from one or more of the cannabinoid compounds found
in the cannabis plant. Our immediate focus is to treat one of the most important diseases in the world, cancer.  

CS-S/BCC1
is in preparation to enter phase I clinical trials within one to two year. This product is formulated for topical administration
to be tested in phase I study, with an indication for skin cancer.    

CS-TATI1
is in preclinical development with the indication for infectious disease.  Consistent with data published in March by researchers
at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine found that cannabinoids inhibit TAT induced migration to TAT via cannabinoid 2 receptors
(CB2) which has potential applications in HIV and other infectious diseases.  

In
November 2013, Cannabis Science submitted patent application N2010968 in Europe entitled  Composition for the Treatment of
Neurobehavioral Disorders.   The subject of the patent is development of cannabinoid-based formulations to treat a variety
of neurobehavioral disorders, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and anxiety. The first formulation in the
series of neurobehavioral disorder-targeted products is the pre-clinical development and use of the invention in food products
through a licensing agreement with a strategic partner and related company, OmniCanna Health Solutions, Inc. And Cannabis Science
will move forward at the same time with pharmaceutical grade product development.  

Cannabis
plants have extensive history of medical and agricultural use dating back thousands of years.  

To
date hundreds of natural constituents covering several chemical classes have been isolated and identified from the Cannabis plant.  

Some
key phytocannabinoids are:  

tetrahydrocannabinol
                                         (THC)    

cannabidiol
                                         (CBD)    

cannabigerol
                                         (CBG)    

cannabichromene
                                         (CBC)    

cannabinol
                                         (CBN)    

These
cannabinoids belong to the chemical class of terpenophenolics, of which 85 have been uniquely identified in cannabis, including
the most psychoactive cannabinoid, THC.     

Some
applications of cannabinoids have been well established in peer-reviewed literature such as for alleviating nausea and stimulating
the appetite for people with AIDS and cancer. Other well-known uses include easing chronic pain and reducing muscle spasms associated
with multiple sclerosis and spinal cord injuries.  

The
pharmacology of THC has been widely studied, while many other identified cannabinoids are still poorly characterized pharmacologically
and biologically, with new activities for cannabinoids consistently being discovered.  

Cannabis
Science is developing novel cannabis based approaches to treat the world s most deadly illnesses. We learn from patients
about the healing properties of cannabis medicines. Our immediate focus is the development of cutting edge cancer treatments.  

The
Company s future endeavors include infectious illnesses, neurobehavioral disorders including attention deficit disorder,
post-traumatic stress disorder; and an application of the anti-inflammatory activities of cannabis in the management of age-related
illnesses.  

The
endocannabinoid system possessed by all vertebrates regulates all body systems and maintains homeostasis. As such, the mechanisms
of phytocannabinoids  biological impact are multidimensional.  

While
concentrating on our core activities of discovering and developing treatments that will make a meaningful difference in patients 
lives, we remain mindful that we have other responsibilities to the clinicians who utilize our drugs, health authorities around
the world, our shareholders, our employees, and the communities in which we live and work.  We continually strive to improve
our corporate responsibility standards and activities, implementing comprehensive ethical standards and undertaking patient and
community progressive initiatives.  

These
principles reflect the mission of Cannabis Science to provide innovative therapeutics for unmet medical needs.  

As
the industry leader, Cannabis Science consults and leads other emerging businesses that Cannabis Science believes has a preferred
business model, one which will mature into a key business model in the future. Our consulting is on the entire  seed to sale 
process with a focus on bio-pharmaceutical development.  

Cannabis
Science is one of the longest standing companies in the cannabis business.     

We
feel that the correct way is to look at the industry from a bio-pharmaceutical standpoint, in a manner that allows cannabinoid-based
products to modulate the endocannabinoid system to treat multiple conditions.

protocols that explore potential synergistic effects of their respective drug candidates, as well as potential new drug candidate
opportunities. IGXBio has a drug called GenePro , which is already registered with the FDA and has an IND number. This expedites
the process to seek FDA approval in the future. GenePro  is designed to promote an anti-HIV immune response that facilitates
virus control in HIV-infected subjects. There are more than 150 peer-reviewed publications that describe the effectiveness of
GenePro . The inflammatory response that is associated with HIV infection is present at even low levels of viral replication,
and is a major causal factor for the morbidities and associated mortality of HIV infection. Low-grade inflammation frequently
occurs despite clinically successful anti-retroviral therapy and is associated with increased incidence of heart disease, bone
disease, and cancers.

The
Company is working on several business acquisition and development projects to increase business and revenue generation in 2016
and beyond, including but not limited to: product licensing and royalty agreements, private label hemp product line, consulting,
and other strategic acquisitions to support product development, production, and distribution of newly acquire or manufactured
cannabis and hemp based products.  There can be no assurance that these will be successful in generating revenues in 2016.  

Liquidity   

The
Company has a working capital deficit of $5,031,688 as of September 30, 2016 compared to a working capital deficit of $4,100,603
as of December 31, 2015. There are insufficient liquid assets to meet current liabilities or sustain operations through 2016 and
beyond and the Company must raise additional capital to cover the working capital deficit. Management is working on plans to raise
additional capital through private placements and lending facilities.  The Company currently is relying on existing cash
and loans from stockholders to meet its obligations and sustain operations.  

The
Company has promissory note payment commitments of $1,340,156 due to stockholders and currently is in default.  The Company
is negotiating with the debtors to extend the notes payable. In addition, the Company has a promissory note payment commitment
of $725,407 to Raymond C. Dabney, CEO/Director of the Company.  

Contractual
Obligations   

The
Company has various commitments under consulting contracts, debt settlement, licensing agreements, laboratory services agreement,
joint development, and joint venture agreement.  

Capital
Resources   

The
Company has additional capital resource requirements for personnel, supplies, research and development, laboratory, cultivation
equipment, green houses and scientific equipment of approximately $5,381,500 over the next 12 months.  These capital disbursements
are dependent on management s successful raising of capital through private placements and/or lending facilities.  

The
Company is not currently in good short-term financial standing.  We anticipate that we may only generate limited revenues
in the near future and we will not have enough positive internal operating cash flow until we can generate substantial revenues,
which may take the next two years to fully realize.  There is no assurance we will achieve profitable operations.  We
have historically financed our operations primarily by cash flows generated from the sale of our equity securities and through
cash infusions from officers and outside investors in exchange for debt and/or common stock.  

Results
of Operations   

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 ( 2016 ) as compared to the prior year nine months ended September 30, 2015
( 2015 ):   

The
Company had $8,520in revenues for the 2016 compared to $4,150 for 2015.  This increase in revenue is due to assets acquisition
of Equi-Pharm and license revenue from product sales.  

Our
research and development expenses decreased by $116,748 to $265,024 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $381,772
for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  

Loss
on investment increased by $971,500 to $971,500 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $0 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015.  

Net
loss on settlement of debt decreased by $349,431 to $4,138,645 for thenine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $4,488,076
for the ninemonths ended September 30, 2015.  This decrease is due to the lesser amount of debt settlement and lower share
price of the Company s stock relative to loss related to settling debt at a lower share price.  

General
and administrative expenses decreased by $2,628,102 to $6,082,880 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $8,710,982
for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  This decrease is due to decreased stock compensation expense pursuant to management
consulting and bonus agreements.  

The
Company is working on several business development projects to generate revenues, including: signing a new license agreement with
Members of the Winnemucca Tribal Allotment and Free Spirit Organics, LLC in Nevada that will generate increased license, royalty
revenue, Cannabis/Hemp products sales, and other strategic acquisitions to support product development, production, and distribution
of newly acquired or manufactured cannabis and hemp based products.  The Company s drug development through its laboratory
services to facilitate new inhalation study for asthma/COPD and other respiratory conditions.  In addition, the Company signed
an agreement with Equi-Pharm for the commercialization of pet products for distribution in California.  Notwithstanding,
there can be no assurance that these will be successful in generating revenues in 2016.
