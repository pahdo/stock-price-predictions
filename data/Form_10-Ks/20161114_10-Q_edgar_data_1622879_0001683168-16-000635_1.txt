NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

  (UNAUDITED)  

Organization and Nature of Operations:  

Business Description    
 Business Activity:  Medicine Man Technologies Inc. (the  Company ) is a Colorado corporation incorporated
on March 20, 2014. The Company is a cannabis consulting company providing services related to cost efficient cannabis cultivation
technologies focusing on quality as well as safety, retail operations related to the delivery of cannabis related products, and
other related business lines as described in our operating strategic vision outlined below. 

The Company also intends to continue to expand
its presence within the cannabis industry through acquisition of affiliated and unaffiliated synergistic businesses. 

1.  
       Liquidity and Capital Resources :   

Cash Flows     During the
quarters ending September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company primarily utilized cash and cash equivalents and profits from operations
to fund its operations. 

Cash and cash equivalents are carried at cost
and represent cash on hand, deposits placed with banks or other financial institutions and all highly liquid investments with an
original maturity of three months or less as of the purchase date. The Company had $91,948 and $262,146 classified as cash and
cash equivalents as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. 

2.  
       Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates :   

Basis of Presentation:  The accompanying
condensed balance sheet as of December 31, 2015, has been derived from audited financial statements. The accompanying unaudited
interim condensed financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the annual audited financial statements
and in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ) for interim financial
information and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) for interim financial statements.
In the opinion of management, such unaudited information includes all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring accruals)
necessary for a fair presentation of this interim information. Operating results and cash flows for interim periods are not necessarily
indicative of results that can be expected for the entire year. The information included in this report should be read in conjunction
with the Company s audited financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

Use of Estimates:  The preparation
of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts
reported therein. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making estimates, actual results reported in future periods may be
based upon amounts that differ from these estimates. 

Accounts receivable:  The
Company extends unsecured credit to its customers in the ordinary course of business. Accounts receivable related to
licensing revenues are recorded at the time the milestone result in the funds being due being achieved, services are
delivered and payment is reasonably assured. Licensing revenues are generally collected from 30 to 60 days after the invoice
is sent. As of September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, the Company had accounts receivable of $25,000 and $83,739,
respectively. The company wrote off $5,792 of its accounts receivable in the current quarter. Allowance for doubtful accounts
is currently zero as all receivables are less than 60 days old. The company will continue to evaluate the need for
recognizing an additional allowance in the future. 

AFS Securities:  Investments available
for sale is comprised of publicly traded stock purchased as an investment. The Company considers the securities to be liquid and
convertible to cash in under a year. The Company has the ability and intent to liquidate any security that the Company holds to
fund operations over the next twelve months, if necessary, and as such has classified all its marketable securities as short-term.
Our investment securities at September 30, 2016 consist of available-for-sale instruments which include $16,000 of equity in publicly
traded companies. All our available-for-sale securities are Level 1. Realized gains and losses on these securities will be included
in  other income (expense)  in the consolidated statements of income using the specific identification method. Unrealized
gains and losses, net of tax, on available-for-sale securities are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (accumulated
OCT). 

Short term note receivable:  Note

per year and is due November 1, 2017. At any point, at the lenders sole discretion, before the due date this note can be
converted into members interest in the borrow. This loan will convert into an investment and will not be repaid if the
Company acquires the borrower. The loans initial funding of $40,000 was issued May 6, 2016 and is due to be repaid on
November 1, 2017. 

Other assets:  Other assets at September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 were $71,450 and $38,721, respectively and included $18,168 in prepaid rent and $46,346 prepaid
registrations fees for major cannabis events the Company is sponsoring and advertising costs. There was $6,936 in accrued interest
due as of September 30, 2016. 

Accounts payable:  Accounts payable at
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was $0 and $8,715, respectively and were comprised of operating accounts payable for various
professional services incurred during the ordinary course of business. 

Accrued tax and other liabilities:  Accrued
tax and other liabilities at September 30, 2016 and December 2015 were $18,475 and $13,200. This was comprised of accrued taxes
of $487, accrued interest expense of $1,726 and $16,262 in accrued expense. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments:  The
carrying amounts of cash and current assets and liabilities approximate fair value because of the short-term maturity of these
items. These fair value estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and, therefore,
cannot be determined with precision. Changes in assumptions could significantly affect these estimates. Available for sale securities
are recorded at current market value as of the date of this report. 

Revenue recognition and related allowances:  Revenue
from licensing services is recognized when the obligations to the client are fulfilled which is determined when milestones in the
contract are achieved. Revenue from seminar fees is related to one day seminars and is recognized as earned at the completion of
the seminar. All revenue is measured at fair value. 

Costs of Services Sold    Costs
of services sold are comprised of direct salaries and related expenses incurred while supporting the implementation of licensing
agreements and related services.

and marketing costs are expensed as incurred and were $61,540 and $36,475 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015,
respectively. 

Stock based compensation:  The Company
accounts for share-based payments pursuant to ASC 718,  Stock Compensation  and, accordingly, the Company records compensation
expense for share-based awards based upon an assessment of the grant date fair value for stock and restricted stock awards using
the Black-Scholes option pricing model. 

Stock compensation expense for stock options
is recognized over the vesting period of the award or expensed immediately under ASC 718 and EITF 96-18 when stock or options are
awarded for previous or current service without further recourse. The Company issued stock options to contractors and external
companies that had been providing services to the Company upon their termination of services. Under ASC 718 and EITF 96-18 these
options were recognized as expense in the period issued because they were given as a form of payment for services already rendered
with no recourse. 

Share based expense paid to through direct
stock grants is expensed as occurred. Since the Company s stock has become publicly traded, the value is determined based
on the number of shares issued and the trading value of the stock on the date of the transaction. Prior to the company s
stock being traded the Company used the most recent valuation. The company recognized $49,200 in expenses for stock based compensation
to employees through direct stock grants of 120,000 shares in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 and $79,725 in expenses
from the issuance of 122,500 shares in the similar period ended September 30, 2015. 

Income taxes:  The Company has adopted
SFAS No. 109    Accounting for Income Taxes . ASC Topic 740 requires the use of the asset and liability method
of accounting for income taxes. Under the asset and liability method of ASC Topic 740, deferred tax assets and liabilities are
recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts
of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted
tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or
settled. 

3.  
       Recent Accounting Pronouncements    

During May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,
Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which provides new guidance on the recognition of revenue and states that an entity should
recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration
to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The standard will be effective for annual reporting
periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is not permitted.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this accounting standard update on the financial position and
the results of operations. 

On September 10, 2014, The Financial Accounting
Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-10,  Development Stage Entities (Topic
915): Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements, including an Amendment to Variable Interest Entities Guidance
in Topic 810, consolidation  removes all incremental financial reporting requirements from GAAP for development stage entities,
including the removal of Topic 915 from the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. For the first annual period beginning after
December 15, 2014, the presentation and disclosure requirements in Topic 915 will no longer be required for the public business
entities. The revised consolidation standards are effective one year later, in annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015.
Early adoption is permitted. The Company has adopted this amendment effective this current fiscal year.

statement as tax expense and accrued as a current accrued liability on the balance sheet. Federal and state taxes due were paid
in the second quarter of 2015 and reduced the accrued tax reflected on the balance sheet. 

As the Company generated a loss from operations
in the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 the Company did not recognize any additional tax expense.  

In October 2016, the Company modified the
loan with Capital G Ltd. and issued an additional $110,000 loan toward the total $250,000 it has committed to make available to
the group that owns Funk Sac. The Company committed to extend an additional $40,000 once due diligence is completed which is expected
to be by the end of the year. However, if the Company terminates its plans to acquire this entity it is not required to loan the
additional $40,000. 

In October 2016, the Company entered a
material interim operating agreement with Pono Publications, Ltd. and Success Nutrients pending completion of its due diligence,
which is currently projected to occur in fourth quarter of 2016. The Company has agreed to issue seven million (7,000,000) shares
of its Common Stock to complete these acquisitions. 

In
October 2016, the Company converted Mr. Brett Roper, COO and Founder of the Company, to a full-time role for the Company. 

On
or about October 14, 2016, the Company  issued an aggregate of 260,000 shares of its Common Stock to fourteen different
individuals in recognition of services and other value provided to the Company.. The closing price on the date of the stock award
was $1.70. As a result, the Company will recognize compensation expense of $442,000 in the fourth quarter of 2016. 

In October 2016, the Company closed a
private offering of convertible notes in the principal amount of $1,000,000. These notes accrue interest at the rate of 12% per
annum, with interest payable quarterly. The Notes may be converted into Common Stock at the lower of $1.75 per share or 90% of
the five day VWAP upon advance notice provided by the note holder.

Overview  

Medicine Man Technologies Inc. ( we. 
 us,   our  or the  Company ) was incorporated on March 20, 2014, in the State of Nevada. On
May 1, 2014, we entered into an exclusive Technology License Agreement with Medicine Man Denver, Inc., f/k/a Medicine Man Production
Corporation, a Colorado corporation ( Medicine Man Denver ) whereby Medicine Man Denver granted us a license to use
all of their proprietary processes they have developed, implemented and practiced at its cannabis facilities relating to the commercial
growth, cultivation, marketing and distribution of medical marijuana and recreational marijuana pursuant to relevant state laws
and the right to use and to license such information, including trade secrets, skills and experience (present and future) (the
 Medicine Man Denver License Agreement ). 

We commenced our business on May 1, 2014 and
currently generate revenues derived from licensing agreements with cannabis related entities, as well as sponsoring seminars offered
to the cannabis industry and other business endeavors related to our core competencies. As of the date of this report we have or
have had 45 fee generating clients in 14 different states. 

We are currently a cannabis consulting company
providing services related to cost efficient cannabis cultivation technologies focusing on quality as well as safety, retail operations
related to the delivery of cannabis related products, and other related business lines as described in our operating strategic
vision outlined hereinbelow. 

One of the key components of our current business
plan includes acquisition of unaffiliated and affiliated synergistic companies. As we have previously disclosed in our SEC filings,
we intend to aggregate new business opportunities into our corporate fabric in a manner that does not diminish the various companies
or brands we will be partnering with, but rather enhances it. Suitable candidates for consideration will have ongoing operations
within similar or complementary segments of the cannabis industry, such as the Pono Publications and Success Nutrient acquisitions
previously announced by us. 

Our management believes that the selection
and subsequent due diligence process will enable both the acquisition candidate and us to mutually benefit from the proposed transaction.
This belief is supported by the following factors: 

consolidation of assets in order to allow
us to qualify for listing on a national exchange. We believe this to be very important to our continued growth, as such listing
is expected to offer us the opportunity to create relationships with institutions, investment banker and other sources of capital
to facilitate our anticipated expansion;    

where applicable, consolidation of marketing
efforts in order to take advantage of cost savings strategies;    

enhanced operating and reporting cost
efficiencies that are expected to become available through the aggregation of these acquisitions; and    

development of a full spectrum of products
and services deliverable to the general cannabusiness marketplace through careful segmentation of the marketplace as a whole.     

Pono Publications and Success Nutrients, both
Colorado corporations, are heavily involved in cultivation activities. More specifically, these acquisitions will also allow us
to offer enhanced cultivation consulting as well as an extraordinary nutrient line that has been developed specifically for cannabis
cultivation use. While we remain optimistic that we will successfully consummate these acquisitions, we are still engaged in performing
our due diligence. As previously reported, we recently entered into a temporary operating agreement that should allow us to effectively
bridge the time required to successfully complete these acquisitions while allowing all parties to begin to take advantage of common
operating element advantages as well as enjoy compensation opportunities driven by this new relationship. 

One of the new products developed in cooperation
with this new partner  referred to as Cultivation MAX, a service we will be launching shortly designed to increase the efficiency
as well as yields of an existing cultivation operation in states where such operations are lawful wherein we will be able to achieve
increased revenues for our client based upon the improvement of cultivation yields. Our clients will not have any obligation to
provide additional compensation to us for ongoing operations unless they achieve improved cultivation outcomes. In addition to
design and deployment revenue (nutrients included) we will receive for these services fees based upon the margin of improvement
yields typical to our industry on a pre-agreed to performance metric reflected in grams per watt, pounds per light, or grams per
square foot of flower canopy. 

While no assurances can be provided, we believe
our new cultivation performance metrics as achieved through this new partnership will provide extraordinary value to the industry
as a whole for those able to recognize that cost of operations and quality will eventually define who thrives or just survives
in this industry. 

We have never been subject to any bankruptcy
proceeding. Our executive offices are located at 4880 Havana Street, Suite 102 South ,  Denver, Colorado 80239, telephone
(303) 371-0387 .  Our website address is www.medicinemantechnologies.com  .   

Results
of Operations    

Comparison of Results of Operations for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015   

During the nine months ended September 30,
2016, we generated revenues of $568,388, including consulting/licensing fees of $553,221, with the balance of fees arising from
our participation in cannabis seminars, compared to revenue of $623,787 during the similar period in 2015, a decrease of $55,314.
This decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease of $15,252 in revenue derived from seminar fees during the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 due to our participation is less seminars. Based upon executed consulting agreements, we expect to recognize
substantial deferred income in future quarters related to existing service agreements that have payment triggers based upon new
state legislation in Oregon, California, Pennsylvania and Nevada. 

Cost of services, consisting of expense related
to delivery of services, was $264,825 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $157,250 during the comparable
period in 2015, an increase of $107,575. This increase was largely driven by a one-time payment of approximately $50,000 to another
company to assist us with applications during a high production season. In addition, during the first quarter of 2016 we incurred
extraordinary expenses working to develop our business in Hawaii. 

Operating expenses during the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, were $510,123, including general and administrative expense of $504,261, compared to operating expenses of
$330,544 incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $179,157. Increased operating expenses included
additional professional fees of $15,869 incurred during the relevant period in 2016 related to being a publicly traded company,
$86,683 in increased travel, including costs associated with our business expansion into Hawaii and conference show costs, as well
as $61,540 in advertising expense incurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to advertising expenses of
$12,107 during the corresponding period in 2015. Advertising expense increased because of there being more states who had approved
or had pending legislation authorizing legalization of cannabis, either medical, recreational or both. We also incurred $49,200
in stock based compensation relating to shares issued for services during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 (120,000
shares at $.41 per share) compared to $50,000 in stock based compensation related to shares issued for serviced during the nine
months ended September 30, 2015 (50,000 shares at $1.00 per share) during the similar period in 2015. Overall, we spent additional
funds to advance our brand and marketing presence, as well as beginning due diligence of potential acquisitions. 

As a result, we generated net loss of $206,475
during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 (approximately ($0.02) per share), compared to net income of $135,993 during the
nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

Comparison of Results of Operations for
the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  

During the three months ended September 30,
2016, we generated revenues of $236,593, including consulting/licensing fees of $233,500, with the balance of fees arising from
our participation in cannabis seminars, compared to revenue of $241,140 during the similar period in 2015, a decrease of $4,547.
This nominal decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease of $28,047 in revenue derived from seminar fees during the three
months ended September 30, 2016, due to our participation is less seminars. However, licensing fees increased by $27,000 during
the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the similar period in 2015. Based upon executed consulting agreements, we
expect to recognize substantial deferred income in future quarters related to existing service agreements that have payment triggers
based upon new state legislation in Oregon, California, Pennsylvania and Nevada. 

Cost of services, consisting of expense related
to delivery of services, was $83,209 during the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $35,603 during the comparable
period in 2015, an increase of $47,606. 

Operating expenses during the three months
ended September 30, 2016, were $139,760, including general and administrative expense of $94,099, compared to operating expenses
of $155,089 incurred during the three months ended September 30, 2015, including general and administrative expense of $149,443,
a decrease of $15,329. Included in these expenses were decreases of $22,548 in travel related expenses due to the completion of
our services in Hawaii, and a decrease of $19,107 in professional fees incurred during this period, offset by increased office
costs of $14,518 arising from our beginning to pay compensation to our COO. 

As a result, we generated net income of $18,752
during the three months ended September 30, 2016 (approximately $0.00 per share), compared to net income of $50,448 during the
three months ended September 30, 2015 (approximately ($0.01 per share). 

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

At September 30, 2016, we had $91,948
in cash on hand. 

Net cash used by operating activities was $320,198
during the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016, compared to cash earned from operating activities of $131,547 for the similar
period in 2015, a decrease of $451,745. We anticipate we will continue to generate negative cash flow from operations until we
complete at least one of several potential acquisitions. 

Between November 2014 and March 2015, we undertook
a private offering of our Common Stock wherein we sold 270,000 shares of our Common Stock for gross proceeds of $270,000 ($1.00
per share) to 4 non-accredited and 23  accredited  investors, as that term is defined under the Securities Act of 1933. 

As we continue to focus on expanding our branding
warehouse concept, we anticipated that we will begin to require infusion of additional capital even if we generate revenues from
operations, of which there are no assurances. In response, in October 2016, we closed a private offering of convertible notes in
the principal amount of $1,000,000. These notes accrue interest at the rate of 12% per annum, with interest payable quarterly.
The notes may be converted into Common Stock at the lower of $1.75 per share or 90% of a five day VWAP upon advance notice provided
by the note holder. It is expected, though not assured, that this additional cash infusion will meet our cash requirements until
we again start generating positive cash flow from operations, of which there can be no assurance. However, if we require additional
capital and cannot generate profits from our operations or we elect to expand our operations we have no agreement with any third
party to provide us the same and there can be no assurances that we will be able to raise any capital, either debt or equity on
commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If we require additional capital and are unable to raise the same, it could have a material
negative impact on our results of operations. 

Subsequent Events 

In October 2016, the Company modified the loan
with Capital G Ltd. and issued an additional $110,000 loan toward the total $250,000 it has committed to make available to the
group that owns Funk Sac. The Company has committed to extend an additional $40,000 once due diligence is completed which is expected
to be by the end of the year.by October 15th, 2016 as part of its acquisition of this entity. However, if the Company terminates
its plans to acquire this entity it is not required to loan the additional $40,000. 

In October 2016, we closed a private offering
of convertible notes in the principal amount of $1,000,000. These notes accrue interest at the rate of 12% per annum, with interest
payable quarterly. The Notes may be converted into Common Stock at the election of the holder at a price equal to the lower of
$1.75 per share or 90% of the five day VWAP upon advance notice provided by the note holder. 

We have generated a total of ten new clients
in the month of October, 2016, alone. These new clients include three new cultivation support and two new dispensary support licensing
agreements with clients in Pennsylvania, two cultivation agreements in in Puerto Rico and one new general support services agreement
with a Florida-based client. This fills our available capacities in Pennsylvania when added to our existing support commitments. 

Inflation   

Although our operations are influenced by general
economic conditions, we do not believe that inflation had a material effect on our results of operations during the nine-month
period ended September 30, 2016. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements   

We had no off-balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015. 

Critical Accounting Estimates   

Our financial statements and accompanying notes
have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates,
judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. We continually evaluate the
accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the condensed financial statements. The estimates are based on historical experience
and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances. Actual amounts and results could differ from these
estimates made by management. Certain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical
to our results of operations or financial position are discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December
31, 2015 in the Critical Accounting Policies section of Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations.

effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of September 30, 2016.   This
