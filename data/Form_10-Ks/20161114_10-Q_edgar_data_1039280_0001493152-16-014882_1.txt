NOTE
1 - BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION  

The
Company designs, develops, markets, and exports proprietary software products to customers in the automobile financing and leasing,
banking, and financial services industries worldwide. The Company also provides system integration, consulting, and IT products
and services in exchange for fees from customers.  

The
consolidated condensed interim financial statements included herein have been prepared by the Company, without audit, pursuant
to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally
included in financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles have been condensed or omitted
pursuant to such rules and regulations, although the Company believes that the disclosures are adequate to make the information
presented not misleading.  

These
statements reflect all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, which, in the opinion of management, are necessary
for fair presentation of the information contained therein. It is suggested that these condensed consolidated financial statements
be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s annual report on Form 10-K
for the year ended June 30, 2016. The Company follows the same accounting policies in preparation of interim reports. Results
of operations for the interim periods are not indicative of annual results.  

The
accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NetSol Technologies, Inc. and subsidiaries (collectively,
the  Company ) as follows:

For
comparative purposes, prior year s condensed consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to report
classifications of the current year.  

NOTE
2   ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

Use
of Estimates  

The
preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States
of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  

Concentration
of Credit Risk  

Cash
includes cash on hand and demand deposits in accounts maintained within the United States as well as in foreign countries. Certain
financial instruments, which subject the Company to concentration of credit risk, consist of cash and restricted cash. The Company
maintains balances at financial institutions which, from time to time, may exceed Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insured
limits for the banks located in the Unites States. Balances at financial institutions within certain foreign countries are not
covered by insurance. As of September 30, 2016, and June 30, 2016, the Company had uninsured deposits related to cash deposits
in accounts maintained within foreign entities of approximately $8,727,470 and $7,640,095, respectively. The Company has not experienced
any losses in such accounts.

   SEPTEMBER

   (UNAUDITED)   

The
Company s operations are carried out globally. Accordingly, the Company s business, financial condition and results
of operations may be influenced by the political, economic and legal environments of each country and by the general state of
the country s economy. The Company s operations in each foreign country are subject to specific considerations and
significant risks not typically associated with companies in economically developed nations. These include risks associated with,
among others, the political, economic and legal environments and foreign currency exchange. The Company s results may be
adversely affected by changes in governmental policies with respect to laws and regulations, anti-inflationary measures, currency
conversion and remittance abroad, and rates and methods of taxation, among other things.  

On
June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom (U.K.) held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the European Union (E.U.), commonly
referred to as  Brexit . As a result of the referendum, it is expected that the British government will begin negotiating
the terms of the U.K. s future relationship with the E.U. Although it is unknown what those terms will be, it is possible
that there will be greater restrictions on imports and exports between the U.K. and E.U. countries and perhaps increased regulatory
complexities. These changes may adversely affect the Company s operations and financial results.  

New
Accounting Pronouncements   

In
August 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements   Going Concern
(Subtopic 205-40), Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern (ASU 2014-15). The
guidance in ASU 2014-15 sets forth management s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity s
ability to continue as a going concern as well as required disclosures. ASU 2014-15 indicates that, when preparing financial statements
for interim and annual financial statements, management should evaluate whether conditions or events, in the aggregate, raise
substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern for one year from the date the financial statements
are issued or are available to be issued. This evaluation should include consideration of conditions and events that are either
known or are reasonably knowable at the date the financial statements are issued or are available to be issued, as well as whether
it is probable that management s plans to address the substantial doubt will be implemented and, if so, whether it is probable
that the plans will alleviate the substantial doubt. ASU 2014-15 is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016,
and interim periods and annual periods thereafter. Early application is permitted. The adoption of this guidance is not expected
to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.  

In
November 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASU 2015-17,  Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred
Taxes  (ASU 2015-17), which changes how deferred taxes are classified on the balance sheet and is effective for financial
statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. ASU 2015-17 requires all
deferred tax assets and liabilities to be classified as non-current. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material
impact on the Company s results of operations, financial position or disclosures.  

In
January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,  Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities 
(ASU 2016-01), which requires equity investments that are not accounted for under the equity method of accounting to be measured
at fair value with changes recognized in net income and updates certain presentation and disclosure requirements. ASU 2016-01
is effective beginning after December 15, 2017. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the
Company s results of operations, financial position or disclosures.  

In
February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,  Leases,  which requires lessees to recognize right-of-use assets
and lease liabilities, for all leases, with the exception of short-term leases, at the commencement date of each lease. This ASU
requires lessees to apply a dual approach, classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of
whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase by the lessee. This classification will determine whether lease expense
is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. This ASU is effective
for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within those annual periods. Early adoption is permitted.
The amendments of this update should be applied using a modified retrospective approach, which requires lessees and lessors to
recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented. The Company is currently evaluating the impact
of the adoption of this standard on its consolidated financial statements.

   (UNAUDITED)   

In
March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-07, Investments- Equity Method and Joint Ventures: Simplifying the
Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting ( ASU 2016-07 ). ASU 2016-07 eliminates the requirement to apply the
equity method of accounting retrospectively when a reporting entity obtains significant influence over a previously held investment.
ASU 2016-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years.
The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this standard would have on its financial condition, results of
operations and cash flows.  

In
March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,  Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.  The guidance simplifies
accounting for share-based payments, most notably by requiring all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies to be recorded as
income tax benefits or expense in the income statement and by allowing entities to recognize forfeitures of awards when they occur.
This new guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016 and may be adopted prospectively
or retroactively. The Company is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of this standard would have on its financial condition,
results of operations and cash flows.  

In
April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations
and Licensing  ( ASU 2016-10 ), which clarifies the following two aspects of Topic 606: (a) identifying performance
obligations; and (b) the licensing implementation guidance. The amendments do not change the core principle of the guidance in
Topic 606. The new guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within
those annual periods, which will be our interim period beginning January 1, 2018. Early adoption is permitted only as of annual
reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods with that reporting period. The Company
is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard on its consolidated financial statements.  

In
May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-11,  Revenue Recognition (Topic 605) and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Rescission
of SEC Guidance Because of Accounting Standards Updates 2014-09 and 2014-06 Pursuant to Staff Announcements at the March 3, 2016
EITF Meeting  ( ASU 2016-11 ), which clarifies revenue and expense recognition for freight costs, accounting
for shipping and handling fees and costs, and accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer. The new guidance is
effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those annual periods, which will
be our interim period beginning January 1, 2018. Early adoption is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after
December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods with that reporting period. The Company is currently evaluating the impact
of adopting this standard on its consolidated financial statements.  

In
May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and
Practical Expedients  ( ASU 2016-12 ), which amends the guidance in the new revenue standard on collectability,
noncash consideration, presentation of sales tax, and transition. The amendments are intended to address implementation issues
and provide additional practical expedients to reduce the cost and complexity of applying the new revenue standard. The new guidance
is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those annual periods, which
will be our interim period beginning January 1, 2018. Early adoption is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning
after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods with that reporting period. The Company is currently evaluating the
impact of adopting this standard on its consolidated financial statements.  

In
August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, regarding ASC Topic 230   Statement of Cash Flows.   This
update addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice. The new guidance
is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that reporting
period. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a significant effect on
its consolidated financial statements.

3   EARNINGS PER SHARE   

Basic
earnings per share are computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.
Diluted earnings per share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock plus the effect of dilutive
potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method. Dilutive potential common shares include
outstanding stock options, warrants, and stock awards.  

The
following potential dilutive shares were excluded from the shares used to calculate diluted earnings per share as their inclusion
would be anti-dilutive.

15   CONTINGENCIES   

As
previously disclosed, on July 25, 2014, purported class action lawsuits were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central
District of California against the Company and certain of its current or former officers and/or directors, which have been consolidated
under the caption  Rand-Heart of New York, Inc. v. NetSol Technologies, Inc., et al. , Case No. 2:14-cv-05787 PA (SHx). Plaintiffs
subsequently filed consolidated amended complaints, which asserted claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934. As a result of the Company s motions, the Court dismissed all of plaintiffs  claims except those related
to the scope of the Company s release of its next generation product, NFS Ascent , during the narrow proposed class
period of October 24, 2013 to November 8, 2013. The Company filed an answer and affirmative defenses denying the remaining claims.
On February 26, 2016, the parties executed a Stipulation of Settlement to fully resolve the consolidated class action lawsuit,
and filed a motion seeking the Federal Court s approval of the settlement. On March 28, 2016, the Court issued an order
preliminarily approving the settlement and providing for notice to class members. Following class notice and hearing, the Court
issued an order granting the motion for final approval of the settlement and plan of allocation and motion for an award of attorneys 
fees and case expenses on July 1, 2016. The Court s Judgment approving the settlement on the terms set forth in the Stipulation
of Settlement was signed on July 2, 2016. The cost of the settlement was covered by the Company s insurers.  

On
October 27, 2015, a shareholder derivative lawsuit was filed in the California state court entitled  McArthur v Ghauri, et al. ,
Case No. BC599020 (Los Angeles, Cty.), naming current and former members of the Company s board of directors as defendants.
The complaint alleges that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties based on the same alleged factual premise as the pending
federal securities class action described above. The Company is named as a nominal defendant only and no damages are sought from
it. On March 16, 2016, the parties in the California lawsuit reached an agreement-in-principle providing for the settlement of
that case. The proposed settlement is on the terms and conditions set forth in a Memorandum of Understanding ( MOU ).

On
December 30, 2015, a virtually identical shareholder derivative lawsuit was filed in Nevada state court,  Paulovits v. Ghauri,
et al. , Case No. CV15-02470 (Washoe Cty.). The Nevada complaint names the same defendants and is based on the same alleged
facts as the earlier-filed California case. On April 29, 2016, the Company filed a motion to dismiss or stay the Nevada proceeding
on multiple grounds, including that is it duplicative of the first-filed California action. On May 23, 2016, pursuant to the parties 
stipulation, the Nevada court ordered that matter to be stayed for a period of one year.  

On
June 15, 2016, the parties in the California and the Nevada cases jointly executed a Stipulation and Agreement of Settlement of
Derivative Claims, which is intended to fully resolve both cases. Pursuant to the stipulation and subject to the court s
approval, the Company has agreed to adopt or maintain certain corporate governance measures, and has agreed to cause its insurers
to pay plaintiff counsel s fees and expenses in an aggregate amount not to exceed $175,000. On June 16, 2016, the California
plaintiff filed a motion for preliminary approval of the derivative settlement. The motion for approval of the settlement was
continued by the California court until December 14, 2016.  

NOTE
16   OPERATING SEGMENTS   

The
Company has identified three segments for its products and services; North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific. Our reportable segments
are business units located in different global regions. Each business unit provides similar products and services; license fees
for leasing and asset-based software, related maintenance fees, and implementation and IT consulting services. Separate management
of each segment is required because each business unit is subject to different operational issues and strategies due to their
particular regional location. The Company accounts for intra-company sales and expenses as if the sales or expenses were to third
parties and eliminates them in the consolidation.

The
following discussion is intended to assist in an understanding of NetSol s financial position and results of operations
for the three months ended September 30, 2016. It should be read together with our condensed consolidated financial statements
and related notes included herein.  

Highlights   

Listed
below are a few of NetSol s major successes achieved in the three months ended September 30, 2016:  

The
    first implementation of our contract with a long-standing customer to upgrade to NFS Ascent  in 11 countries and implement
    NFS Ascent  in one new country was recently completed in New Zealand. The first implementation phase continues in Australia,
    Korea and China.   

Implementation
    of the NFS Ascent  contract with UK-based client valued at approximately $8 million is progressing as planned   

Sold
    LeasePak license valued at $500,000 to Korean based automotive captive for their U.S. operations.   

NetSol
    PK signed a collaboration agreement to provide technology services to eeGeo, an interactive 3D mapping company based in the
    United Kingdom. The eeGeo platform enables businesses to easily visualize complex data sets and location-based services in
    a 3D mobile experience. This agreement is progressing well as per joint agreements with NetSol and eeGeo.   

Went
    live with a major implementation of our NFS legacy system with Tri Petch Isuzu Leasing in Thailand.   

Our
success, in the near term, will depend, in large part, on the Company s ability to continue to grow revenues and improve
profits, adequately capitalize for growth in various markets and verticals, make progress in the North American and European markets
and, continue to streamline sales and marketing efforts in every market we operate. However, management s outlook for the
continuing operations, which has been consolidated and has been streamlined, remains optimistic.  

Management
has identified the following material trends affecting NetSol.  

Positive
trends:  

Improving
    U.S. economy generally, and particularly in the auto and banking markets.   

China
    to invest $46 billion in Pakistan on energy and infrastructure projects.   

According
    to the Wall Street Journal article on August 12, 2016, the Chinese Auto market experienced double digit growth of 26% in July
    2016 versus July 2015.   

NFS
    legacy Solutions and Ascent s largest auto finance market remains robust and resilient in China.   

According
    to Reuters, US auto manufactures hit a record 17.5 million units of new car sales in 2015, the highest in a decade.   

Slowly
    improving economic environment in the U.K. and major European economies.   

New
    emerging markets and IT destinations in Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, China and Australia.   

According
    to Deloitte s 2015 China Auto Finance Report, China s auto finance penetration rate will reach 50% by 2020.   

According
    to a KPMG report, global car sales are rising and forecast to exceed 91 million by 2017.   

Continued
    interest from multinational auto captives, global companies and existing clients in NetSol Ascent .   

Higher
    caliber and quality talents joining NetSol, globally including those strategic senior management hiring in the US, China and
    Pakistan.   

Improved
    economic and geo political indicators in Pakistan to restore business confidence.   

Negative
trends:  

The
    disruption risk of geopolitical unrest in the Middle East and the global threat of terrorist attacks.   

Restricted
    liquidity and financial burden due to tighter internal processes and limited budgets might cause delays in the receivables
    from some clients.   

The
    threats of conflict between the U.S. and Middle East region could potentially create volatility in oil prices, causing readjustments
    of corporate budgets and consumer spending slowing global auto sales.   

Currency
    fluctuation due to the concerns regarding the United Kingdom s proposed exit from the European Union.   

CHANGES
IN FINANCIAL CONDITION  

Quarter 
Ended September 30, 2016 compared to the Quarter Ended September 30, 2015   

The
following table sets forth the items in our unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations for the quarter ended September
30, 2016 and 2015 as a percentage of revenues.  

A
significant portion of our business is conducted in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We operate in several geographical
regions as described in Note 16  Operating Segments  within the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Weakening
of the value of the U.S. dollar compared to foreign currency exchange rates generally has the effect of increasing our revenues
but also increasing our expenses denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Similarly, strengthening of the U.S. dollar
compared to foreign currency exchange rates generally has the effect of reducing our revenues but also reducing our expenses denominated
in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We plan our business accordingly by deploying additional resources to areas of expansion,
while continuing to monitor our overall expenditures given the economic uncertainties of our target markets. In order to
provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency fluctuations,
we compare the changes in results from one period to another period using constant currency. In order to calculate our constant
currency results, we apply the current period results to the prior period foreign currency exchange rates. In the table below,
we present the change based on actual results in reported currency and in constant currency.  

Net
revenues for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are broken out among the segments as follows:  

Revenues   

License
fees   

License
fees for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were $3,746,817 compared to $1,193,354 for the three months ended September
30, 2015 reflecting an increase of $2,553,463 with a change in constant currency of $2,610,254. Included in the license fees are
licenses provided to related parties of $246,957 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $nil for the same period
last year. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we increased our license revenues through sales of our regional offerings
in the U.S. and sales of our NFS Ascent  product.  

Maintenance
fees   

Maintenance
fees for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were $3,533,452 compared to $3,170,469 for the three months ended September
30, 2015 reflecting an increase of $362,983 with a change in constant currency of $461,994. Included in the maintenance fees are
maintenance provided to related parties of $130,631 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $158,231 for the
same period last year. Maintenance fees begin once a customer has  gone live  with our product. The increase was due
to the start of new maintenance agreements from customers who went live with our product during the latter stages of fiscal year
2016 and into fiscal year 2017. We anticipate maintenance fees to gradually increase as we implement both our NFS legacy product
and NFS Ascent .  

Services   

Services
income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $7,721,289 compared to $8,941,281 for the three months ended September
30, 2015 reflecting a decrease of $1,219,992 with a change in constant currency of $1,006,692. Included in the services revenue
are services provided to related parties of $1,914,572 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $2,187,408 for
the same period last year. The decrease is due to a decrease in consulting services with current customers and a reduction in
implementation services. Services revenue is derived from services provided to both current customers as well as services provided
to new customers as part of the implementation process.  

Gross
Profit   

The
gross profit was $6,093,104, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared with $5,249,370 for the three months ended
September 30, 2015. This is an increase of $843,734 with an increase in constant currency of $1,053,687. The gross profit percentage
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 also increased to 40.62% from 39.45% for the three months ended September 30, 2015.
The cost of sales was $8,908,454 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $8,055,734 for the three months ended
September 30, 2015 for an increase of $852,720 and on a constant currency basis an increase of $1,011,869. As a percentage of
sales, cost of sales decreased from 60.55% for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to 59.38% for the three months ended
September 30, 2016.  

Salaries
and consultant fees increased by $732,100 from $5,161,249 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to $5,893,349 for the
three months ended September 30, 2016 and on a constant currency basis increased $849,061. The increase in salaries and consultant
fees is due annual salary increases and the strategic hiring of employees at key locations including Pakistan, Thailand, China,
UK and North America as we anticipate new projects associated with NFS Ascent .  

Depreciation
and amortization expense decreased to $1,330,872 compared to $1,474,235 for the three months ended September 30, 2015 or a decrease
of $143,363 and on a constant currency basis a decrease of $141,520. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased as some products
became fully amortized.  

Operating
Expenses   

Operating
expenses were $7,325,263 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $5,306,334, for the three months ended September
30, 2015 for an increase of 38.05% or $2,018,929 and on a constant currency basis an increase of 42.16% or $2,236,886. As a percentage
of sales, it increased from 39.88% to 45.38%. The increase in operating expenses was primarily due to the increase in selling
and marketing expenses of $712,732 or 41.96% and on a constant currency basis an increase of $821,669 or 48.38%, and an increase
in general and administrative expenses of $1,347,410 or 42.04% and on a constant currency basis an increase of $1,448,483 or 45.2%.  

The
increase in selling and marketing expenses is due to the increase in our salaries and commissions, travel expenses, and business
development costs to market and sell NFS Ascent  globally.  

General
and administrative expenses were $4,552,098 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $3,204,688 at September
30, 2015 or an increase of $1,347,410 or 42.04% and on a constant currency basis an increase of $1,448,483 or 45.2%. During the
three months ended September 30, 2016, salaries increased by approximately $763,303 or $827,836 on a constant currency basis due
to the increase in the number of employees, annual raises, share grants, cash bonuses and options; other general and administrative
expenses increased by approximately $541,491 or $565,594 on a constant currency basis; professional services increased by approximately
$79,396 or $91,833 on a constant currency basis.  

Loss
from Operations   

Loss
from operations was $1,232,159 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $56,964 for the three months ended September
30, 2015. This represents an increase in loss of $1,175,195 with an increase in loss of $1,183,199 on a constant currency basis
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared with the three months ended September 30, 2015. As a percentage of sales,
net loss from operations was 8.21% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to loss of 0.43% for the three months
ended September 30, 2015.  

Net
Loss   

Net
loss was $1,765,719 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to a loss of $411,028 for the three months ended September
30, 2015. This is an increase in loss of $1,354,691 compared to the prior year. For the three months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015, net loss per basic and diluted share was $0.17 and $0.04, respectively.  

Non-GAAP
Financial Measures   

Regulation
S-K Item 10(e),  Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures in Commission Filings,  defines and prescribes the conditions
for use of non-GAAP financial information. Our measures of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA per basic and diluted share meet
the definition of a non-GAAP financial measure.  

We
define the non-GAAP measures as follows:  

EBITDA
    is GAAP net income before net interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization.   

Non-GAAP
    adjusted EBITDA is EBITDA less stock-based compensation expense.   

Adjusted
    EBITDA per basic and diluted share   Adjusted EBITDA allocated to common stock divided by the weighted average shares
    outstanding and diluted shares outstanding.   

We
use non-GAAP measures internally to evaluate the business and believe that presenting non-GAAP measures provides useful information
to investors regarding the underlying business trends and performance of our ongoing operations as well as useful metrics for
monitoring our performance and evaluating it against industry peers. The non-GAAP financial measures presented should be used
in addition to, and in conjunction with, results presented in accordance with GAAP, and should not be relied upon to the exclusion
of GAAP financial measures. Management strongly encourages investors to review our consolidated financial statements in their
entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure in evaluating the Company.  

The
non-GAAP measures reflect adjustments based on the following items:  

EBITDA :
We report EBITDA as a non-GAAP metric by excluding the effect of net interest expense, income tax expense, depreciation and amortization
from net income because doing so makes internal comparisons to our historical operating results more consistent. In addition,
we believe providing an EBITDA calculation is a more useful comparison of our operating results to the operating results of our
peers.  

Stock-based
compensation expense : We have excluded the effect of stock-based compensation expense from the non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA and
non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA per basic and diluted share calculations. Although stock-based compensation expense is calculated in
accordance with current GAAP and constitutes an ongoing and recurring expense, such expense is excluded from non-GAAP results
because it is not an expense which generally requires cash settlement by NetSol, and therefore is not used by us to assess the
profitability of our operations. We also believe the exclusion of stock-based compensation expense provides a more useful comparison
of our operating results to the operating results of our peers.  

Non-controlling
interest:  We add back the non-controlling interest in calculating gross adjusted EBITDA and then subtract out the income taxes,
depreciation and amortization and net interest expense attributable to the non-controlling interest to arrive at a net adjusted
EBITDA.  

Our
reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures of adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP earnings per basic and diluted share to the
most comparable GAAP measures for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are as follows:  

(a)The
reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA of non-controlling interest to net income attributable to non-controlling interest is as follows  

LIQUIDITY
AND CAPITAL RESOURCES   

Our
cash position was $11,156,437 at September 30, 2016, compared to $11,557,527 at June 30, 2016.  

Net
cash used in operating activities was $217,529 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $3,178,491 for the three
months ended September 30, 2015. At September 30, 2016, we had current assets of $40,916,597 and current liabilities of $15,305,317.
We had accounts receivable of $12,526,828 at September 30, 2016 compared to $15,382,407 at June 30, 2016. We had revenues in excess
of billings of $14,040,907 at September 30, 2016 compared to $11,297,264 at June 30, 2016. During the three months ended September
30, 2016, our revenues in excess of billings were reclassified to accounts receivable pursuant to billing requirements detailed
in each contract. The combined totals for accounts receivable and revenues in excess of billings decreased by $111,936, from $26,679,671
at June 30, 2016, to $26,567,735 at September 30, 2016. The increase in accounts receivable is due to invoicing for services and
maintenance fees to various customers. To some customers, the maintenance fee is invoiced in advance for the year. The amount
is recorded in unearned revenue and is recognized as revenue on the time proportionate method. Accounts payable and accrued expenses,
and current portions of loans and lease obligations amounted to $6,389,128 and $4,408,173, respectively at September 30, 2016.  

The
average days sales outstanding for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were 159 and 116 days, respectively, for
each period. The days sales outstanding have been calculated by taking into consideration the average combined balances of accounts
receivable and revenue in excess of billings.  

Net
cash used in investing activities was $958,610 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $445,536 for the three
months ended September 30, 2015. We had purchases of property and equipment of $554,873 compared to $625,794 for the comparable
period last fiscal year. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we purchased a 2.5% interest in eeGeo, Inc. for $555,556
increasing our investment to 4.9%.  

Net
cash provided by financing activities was $241,757 and $327,616 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, and 2015, respectively.
The three months ended September 30, 2016 included the cash inflow of $276,861 from the exercising of stock options and warrants.
During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we had net payments from bank loans and capital leases of $49,117 compared to
net proceeds of $262,685 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. We are operating in various geographical regions of the
world through its various subsidiaries. Those subsidiaries have financial arrangements from various financial institutions to
meet both their short and long term funding requirements. These loans will become due at different maturity dates as described
in Note 12 of the financial statements. We are in compliance with the covenants of the financial arrangements and there is no
default, which may lead to early payment of these obligations. We anticipate paying back all these obligations on their respective
due dates from its own sources.  

We
typically fund the cash requirements for our operations in the U.S. through our license, services, and maintenance agreements,
intercompany charges for corporate services, and through the exercise of options and warrants. As of September 30, 2016, we had
approximately $11.16 million of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of which approximately $8.72 million is held
by our foreign subsidiaries. As of June 30, 2016, we had approximately $11.56 million of cash, cash equivalents and marketable
securities of which approximately $7.64 million is held by our foreign subsidiaries. We intend to permanently reinvest these funds
outside the U.S., and therefore, we do not anticipate repatriating undistributed earnings from our non-U.S. operations. If funds
from foreign operations are required to fund U.S. operations in the future, and if U.S. tax has not previously been provided,
we would be required to accrue and pay additional U.S. taxes to repatriate these funds.  

We
remain open to strategic relationships that would provide value added benefits. The focus will remain on continuously improving
cash reserves internally and reduced reliance on external capital raise.  

As
a growing company, we have on-going capital expenditure needs based on our short term and long term business plans. Although our
requirements for capital expenses vary from time to time, for the next 12 months, we anticipate needing $2 to $3 million for APAC,
U.S. and Europe new business development activities and infrastructure enhancements, which we expect to provide from current operations.  

While
there is no guarantee that any of these methods will result in raising sufficient funds to meet our capital needs or that even
if available will be on terms acceptable to us, we will be very cautious and prudent about any new capital raise given the global
market uncertainties. However, we are very conscious of the dilutive effect and price pressures in raising equity-based capital.  

Financial
Covenants   

Our
U.K. based subsidiary, NTE, has an approved overdraft facility of  300,000 which requires that the aggregate amount of invoiced
trade debtors (net of provisions for bad and doubtful debts and excluding intra-group debtors) of NTE, not exceeding 90 days old,
will not be less than an amount equal to 200% of the facility. NTE had been granted another credit facility of  1,000,000
for the VLS acquisition. This facility requires that NTE s adjusted tangible net worth would not be less than  600,000.
For this purpose, adjusted tangible net worth means shareholders  funds less intangible assets plus non-redeemable preference
shares. In addition, NTE s cash debt service coverage would not fall below 150% of the aggregate debt service cost.  

The
Pakistani subsidiary, NetSol PK, has an approved facility for export refinance from Askari Bank Limited amounting to Rupees 400
million or approximately $3.86 million which requires NetSol PK to maintain a long term debt equity ratio of 60:40 and the current
ratio of 1:1.  

As
of the date of this report, we are in compliance with the financial covenants associated with our borrowings. The maturity dates
of the borrowings of respective subsidiaries may accelerate if they do not comply with these covenants. In case of any change
in control in subsidiaries, they may have to repay their respective credit facilities.  

CRITICAL
ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

Our
financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States ( U.S. GAAP ). Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by management s
application of accounting policies. Critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition and multiple element arrangements,
intangible assets, software development costs, and goodwill.  

REVENUE
RECOGNTION  

The
Company derives revenues from the following sources: (1) software licenses, (2) services, which include implementation and consulting
services, and (3) maintenance, which includes post contract support.  

The
Company recognizes revenue from license contracts without major customization when a non-cancelable, non-contingent license agreement
has been signed, delivery of the software has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collectability is probable. Delivery
is considered to have occurred upon electronic transfer of the license key that provides immediate availability of the product
to the purchaser. Determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments
that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue the Company reports.  

If
an arrangement does not qualify for separate accounting of the software license and consulting transactions, then new software
license revenue is generally recognized together with the consulting services based on contract accounting using either the percentage-of-completion
or completed contract method. Contract accounting is applied to any arrangements: (1) that include milestones or customer specific
acceptance criteria that may affect collection of the software license fees; (2) where services include significant modification
or customization of the software; (3) where significant consulting services are provided for in the software license contract
without additional charge or are substantially discounted; or (4) where the software license payment is tied to the performance
of consulting services.  

Revenue
from consulting services is recognized as the services are performed for time-and-materials contracts. Revenue from training and
development services is recognized as the services are performed.  

Revenue
from maintenance agreements is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance agreement, typically one year.  

Multiple
Element Arrangements    

The
Company may enter into multiple element revenue arrangements in which a customer may purchase a number of different combinations
of software licenses, consulting services, maintenance and support, as well as training and development.  

Vendor
specific objective evidence ( VSOE ) of fair value for each element is based on the price for which the element is
sold separately. The Company determines the VSOE of fair value of each element based on historical evidence of the Company s
stand-alone sales of these elements to third-parties or from the stated renewal rate for the elements contained in the initial
software license arrangement. When VSOE of fair value does not exist for any undelivered element, revenue is deferred until the
earlier of the point at which such VSOE of fair value exists or until all elements of the arrangement have been delivered. The
only exception to this guidance is when the only undelivered element is maintenance and support or other services, then the entire
arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the performance period.  

INTANGIBLE
ASSETS  

Intangible
assets consist of product licenses, renewals, enhancements, copyrights, trademarks, trade names, and customer lists. Intangible
assets with finite lives are amortized over the estimated useful life and are evaluated for impairment at least on an annual basis
and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. We assess recoverability
by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through the undiscounted expected future cash flows.
If the future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of these assets, we recognize an impairment loss based
on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets.  

SOFTWARE
DEVELOPMENT COSTS  

Costs
incurred to internally develop computer software products or to enhance an existing product are recorded as research and development
costs and expensed when incurred until technological feasibility for the respective product is established. Thereafter, all software
development costs are capitalized and reported at the lower of unamortized cost or net realizable value. Capitalization ceases
when the product or enhancement is available for general release to customers.  

The
Company makes on-going evaluations of the recoverability of its capitalized software projects by comparing the amount capitalized
for each product to the estimated net realizable value of the product. If such evaluations indicate that the unamortized software
development costs exceed the net realizable value, the Company writes off the amount which the unamortized software development
costs exceed net realizable value. Capitalized and purchased computer software development costs are being amortized ratably based
on the projected revenue associated with the related software or on a straight-line basis.  

STOCK-BASED
COMPENSATION   

Our
stock-based compensation expense is estimated at the grant date based on the award s fair value as calculated by the Black-Scholes-Merton
(BSM) option pricing model and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period. The BSM model requires various highly
judgmental assumptions including expected volatility and expected term. If any of the assumptions used in the BSM model changes
significantly, stock-based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period.
In addition, we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to
vest. We estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical experience and our expectations regarding future pre-vesting termination
behavior of employees. To the extent our actual forfeiture rate is different from our estimate; stock-based compensation expense
is adjusted accordingly.  

GOODWILL  

Goodwill
represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in a purchase businesses
combination. Goodwill is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances
indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may be impaired. The goodwill impairment test is a two-step test. Under the first
step, the fair value of the reporting unit is compared with its carrying value (including goodwill). If the fair value of the
reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an indication of goodwill impairment exists for the reporting unit and the enterprise
must perform step two of the impairment test (measurement). Under step two, an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of
the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill. The implied fair value
of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation.
The residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill. Fair value of the reporting
unit is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value,
step two does not need to be performed.

Item
4. Controls and Procedures   

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures    

Our
management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of
our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, as of the end of the period covered by
this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Financial Officer and Chief Executive Officer concluded
that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.  

Management s
Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting    

Our
management has the responsibility to establish and maintain adequate internal controls over our financial reporting, as defined
in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. Our internal controls are designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of our financial reporting and the preparation of our external financial statements in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).  

Due
to inherent limitations of any internal control system, management acknowledges that there are limitations as to the effectiveness
of internal controls over financial reporting and therefore recognize that only reasonable assurance can be gained from any internal
control system. Accordingly, our internal control system may not detect or prevent material misstatements in our financial statements
and projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.  

Under
the supervision and participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we have performed
an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting as of September 30, 2016. This assessment
was based on the criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework, issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission. Based on the results of our assessment, the Company has determined that as of September 30, 2016,
there was no material weakness in the Company s internal control over financial reporting. Our management, including our
Chief Executive Officer, believes that the financial statements included in this report fairly present in all material respects
our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented.  

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting    

There
have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2016, that
have materially affected, or are reasonable likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control over financial reporting
(as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a   15(f) and 15d   15(f)).  

PART
II OTHER INFORMATION  

Item
1. Legal Proceedings  

As
previously disclosed, on July 25, 2014, purported class action lawsuits were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central
District of California against the Company and certain of its current or former officers and/or directors, which have been consolidated
under the caption  Rand-Heart of New York, Inc. v. NetSol Technologies, Inc., et al. , Case No. 2:14-cv-05787 PA (SHx). Plaintiffs
subsequently filed consolidated amended complaints, which asserted claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934. As a result of the Company s motions, the Court dismissed all of plaintiffs  claims except those related
to the scope of the Company s release of its next generation product, NFS Ascent , during the narrow proposed class
period of October 24, 2013 to November 8, 2013. The Company filed an answer and affirmative defenses denying the remaining claims.
On February 26, 2016, the parties executed a Stipulation of Settlement to fully resolve the consolidated class action lawsuit,
and filed a motion seeking the Federal Court s approval of the settlement. On March 28, 2016, the Court issued an order
preliminarily approving the settlement and providing for notice to class members. Following class notice and hearing, the Court
issued an order granting the motion for final approval of the settlement and plan of allocation and motion for an award of attorneys 
fees and case expenses on July 1, 2016. The Court s Judgment approving the settlement on the terms set forth in the Stipulation
of Settlement was signed on July 2, 2016. The cost of the settlement was covered by the Company s insurers.  

On
October 27, 2015, a shareholder derivative lawsuit was filed in the California state court entitled  McArthur v Ghauri, et al. ,
Case No. BC599020 (Los Angeles, Cty.), naming current and former members of the Company s board of directors as defendants.
The complaint alleges that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties based on the same alleged factual premise as the pending
federal securities class action described above. The Company is named as a nominal defendant only and no damages are sought from
it. On March 16, 2016, the parties in the California lawsuit reached an agreement-in-principle providing for the settlement of
that case. The proposed settlement is on the terms and conditions set forth in a Memorandum of Understanding ( MOU ).  

On
December 30, 2015, a virtually identical shareholder derivative lawsuit was filed in Nevada state court,  Paulovits v. Ghauri,
et al. , Case No. CV15-02470 (Washoe Cty.). The Nevada complaint names the same defendants and is based on the same alleged
facts as the earlier-filed California case. On April 29, 2016, the Company filed a motion to dismiss or stay the Nevada proceeding
on multiple grounds, including that is it duplicative of the first-filed California action. On May 23, 2016, pursuant to the parties 
stipulation, the Nevada court ordered that matter to be stayed for a period of one year.  

On
June 15, 2016, the parties in the California and the Nevada cases jointly executed a Stipulation and Agreement of Settlement of
Derivative Claims, which is intended to fully resolve both cases. Pursuant to the stipulation and subject to the court s
approval, the Company has agreed to adopt or maintain certain corporate governance measures, and has agreed to cause its insurers
to pay plaintiff counsel s fees and expenses in an aggregate amount not to exceed $175,000. On June 16, 2016, the California
plaintiff filed a motion for preliminary approval of the derivative settlement. The motion for approval of the settlement was
continued by the California court until December 14, 2016.
