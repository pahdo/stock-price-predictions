  INTRODUCTION 
  Freddie Mac is a GSE chartered by Congress in 1970. Our public mission is to provide liquidity, stability, and affordability to the U.S. housing market. We do this primarily by purchasing residential mortgage loans originated by lenders. In most instances, we package these loans into mortgage-related securities, which are guaranteed by us and sold in the global capital markets. We also invest in mortgage loans and mortgage-related securities. We do not originate loans or lend money directly to borrowers. 
  We support the U.S. housing market and the overall economy by enabling America s families to access mortgage loan funding with better terms and by providing consistent liquidity to the multifamily mortgage market, which we do primarily by providing financing for workforce housing. We have helped many distressed borrowers keep their homes or avoid foreclosure. We are working with FHFA, our customers and the industry to build a better housing finance system for the nation. 
  CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL RESULTS 
  Comprehensive income (loss) was   $2.3 billion   in 3Q 2016 compared to $(0.5) billion in 3Q 2015. The increase in comprehensive income was primarily driven by two market-related items, including an estimated: 

Management's Discussion and Analysis 
      
    Introduction 

Our total equity was   $3.5 billion   at   September 30, 2016  . Because our net worth was positive we are not requesting a draw from Treasury under the Purchase Agreement for 3Q 2016. Following payment of our dividend obligation of $2.3 billion in December 2016, our cumulative senior preferred stock dividend payments will total $101.4 billion. Under the Purchase Agreement, the payment of dividends does not reduce the outstanding liquidation preference of the senior preferred stock, which remains $72.3 billion. The amount of available funding remaining under the Purchase Agreement is $140.5 billion, and would be reduced by any future draws. 
  VARIABILITY OF EARNINGS 
  Our financial results are subject to significant earnings variability from period to period. This variability is primarily driven by: 
             
    Interest-Rate Volatility   We hold assets and liabilities that expose us to interest-rate risk. Through our use of derivatives, we manage our exposure to interest-rate risk on an economic basis to a low level as measured by our models. However, the way we account for our financial assets and liabilities (i.e., some are measured at amortized cost, while others are measured at fair value), including derivatives, creates volatility in our GAAP earnings when interest rates fluctuate. Based upon the composition of our financial assets and liabilities, including derivatives, at   September 30, 2016  , we generally recognize fair value losses in earnings when interest rates decline. This volatility generally is not indicative of the underlying economics of our business. For information about the sensitivity of our financial results to interest-rate volatility, see "Risk Management - Interest-Rate Risk and Other Market Risks." 
                
    Spread Volatility   The volatility of spreads (i.e., credit spreads, liquidity spreads, risk premiums, etc.), or OAS, is the risk associated with changes in the excess of interest rates over benchmark rates. We hold assets and liabilities that expose us to spread volatility, which may contribute to significant earnings volatility. For financial assets measured at fair value, we generally recognize fair value losses when spreads widen. Conversely, for financial liabilities measured at fair value, we generally recognize fair value gains when spreads widen.  
     The variability of earnings and the declining capital reserve required under the terms of the Purchase Agreement (ultimately reaching zero in 2018) increase the risk of our having a negative net worth and thus being required to draw from Treasury. We could face a risk of a draw for a variety of reasons, including if we were to experience a large decrease in interest rates coupled with a large widening of spreads. In an effort to reduce the probability of a draw due to changes in interest rates, we entered into certain structured transactions during the first half of 2016 that have resulted in additional financial assets being recognized and measured at fair value. In addition, we continue to explore other strategies and activities that may reduce the probability of a draw.  

Management's Discussion and Analysis 
      
    Introduction 

CONSERVATORSHIP AND GOVERNMENT SUPPORT FOR OUR BUSINESS 
  Since September 2008, we have been operating in conservatorship, with FHFA acting as our Conservator. The conservatorship and related matters significantly affect our management, business activities, financial condition, and results of operations. Our future is uncertain, and the conservatorship has no specified termination date. We do not know what changes may occur to our business model during or following conservatorship, including whether we will continue to exist. 
  Our Purchase Agreement with Treasury and the terms of the senior preferred stock we issued to Treasury constrain our business activities. The Purchase Agreement also requires our future profits to effectively be distributed to Treasury, and we cannot retain capital from the earnings generated by our business operations (other than a limited capital reserve amount that will decrease to zero in 2018) or return capital to stockholders other than Treasury. Consequently, our ability to access funds from Treasury under the Purchase Agreement is critical to keeping us solvent and avoiding the appointment of a receiver by FHFA under statutory mandatory receivership provisions. We believe that the support provided by Treasury pursuant to the Purchase Agreement currently enables us to have adequate liquidity to conduct our normal business activities.

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
  You should read this discussion of our consolidated results of operations in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.  
  COMPARISON 
   
  The table below compares our consolidated results of operations for 3Q 2016 vs. 3Q 2015 and YTD 2016 vs. YTD 2015.  

Key Drivers:  
  See "Net Interest Income," "Benefit (Provision) for Credit Losses," "Derivative Gains (Losses)," and "Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)" for a discussion of those line items. Key drivers for other line items for 3Q 2016 vs. 3Q 2015 and YTD 2016 vs. YTD 2015 include: 
             
    Gains (losses) on extinguishment of debt  
                
    3Q 2016 vs. 3Q 2015 and YTD 2016 vs. YTD 2015   -     Losses on extinguishment of debt increased primarily due to an increase in the amount of losses recognized from the extinguishment of certain fixed-rate debt securities of consolidated trusts. While our repurchase activity remained relatively flat during each comparative period, we recognized increased losses  

Management's Discussion and Analysis 
      
    Consolidated Results of Operations | Comparison 

during the 2016 periods primarily due to larger declines in market interest rates between the time of issuance and repurchase of certain debt securities of consolidated trusts.  
             
    Other gains on investment securities recognized in earnings  
                
    YTD 2016 vs. YTD 2015   - increased primarily due to the recognition of greater gains on our agency mortgage-related securities classified as trading, as longer-term interest rates declined by a larger amount during YTD 2016 compared to YTD 2015, partially offset by a decrease in realized gains, as we sold fewer non-agency mortgage-related securities classified as available-for-sale during YTD 2016. Our sales of non-agency mortgage-related securities will continue to vary as our portfolio that is saleable, based on a variety of criteria, has decreased.  
                
    Other income (loss)    
               * 
    Gains on multifamily loans and commitments for which we elected the fair value option due to higher spread-related fair value gains during 3Q 2016. Spread-related fair value gains increased due to tightening of the K Certificate benchmark spreads during 3Q 2016 compared to 3Q 2015 when the spreads widened; and  
              * 
    Reduced lower-of-cost-or-fair-value adjustments as we reclassified fewer seriously delinquent single-family loans from held-for-investment to held-for-sale during 3Q 2016; partially offset by 
              * 
    Losses on STACR debt notes carried at fair value driven by tightening spreads between STACR yields and LIBOR during 3Q 2016 compared to gains as a result of widening spreads during 3Q 2015. 
               * 
    Reduced lower-of-cost-or-fair-value adjustments as we reclassified fewer seriously delinquent single-family loans from held-for-investment to held-for-sale during YTD 2016; and 
              * 
    Gains on multifamily mortgage loans and commitments for which we elected the fair value option due to both increased interest rate-related and spread-related fair value gains. Interest rate-related fair value gains increased due to larger declines in longer-term interest rates during YTD 2016 compared to YTD 2015. Spread-related fair value gains increased due to K Certificate benchmark spreads tightening during YTD 2016 compared to the spreads widening during YTD 2015. 
                
    Other expense 
                
    3Q 2016 vs. 3Q 2015 and YTD 2016 vs. YTD 2015   -     decreased primarily due to fewer reclassifications of seriously delinquent single-family loans from held-for-investment to held-for-sale. See "Loan Reclassifications" below for the effect of these loan reclassifications on pre-tax net income. This was partially offset by higher credit risk transfer ("CRT") expense which resulted from an increase in the outstanding cumulative volume of ACIS transactions. 
     The three items discussed below affected multiple line items on our consolidated results of operations.  
   
  LOAN RECLASSIFICATIONS 
  During 3Q 2016 and 3Q 2015, we reclassified   $0.3 billion   and $2.5 billion, respectively, in UPB of seriously delinquent single-family mortgage loans from held-for-investment to held-for-sale. During YTD 2016 and YTD 2015, we reclassified   $3.8 billion   and $10.6 billion, respectively, in UPB of such mortgage

    Consolidated Results of Operations | Comparison 

loans. The initial reclassifications of these loans affected several line items on our consolidated results of operations, as shown in the table below. 

INTEREST-RATE RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES 
  We fund our business activities primarily through the issuance of unsecured other debt. The type of debt we issue is based on a variety of factors including market conditions and our liquidity requirements. 
  We currently favor a mix of shorter- and medium-term debt and derivatives to fund our business and manage interest-rate risk. This funding mix is a less expensive method than relying more extensively on long-term debt. 
  The table below presents the effect of derivatives used in our interest-rate risk management activities on our comprehensive income, after considering the accrual of periodic cash settlements (which is the economic equivalent of interest expense). The estimated net interest rate effect on comprehensive income is essentially the derivative gains (losses) attributable to financial instruments that are not measured at fair value. 

As this table demonstrates, the estimated net effect of derivatives on our comprehensive income is volatile, and can be significant. However, the estimated net interest rate effect during 3Q 2016 was minimal as the impact of a modest increase in longer-term interest rates was offset by the impact of yield curve flattening. For information about the sensitivity of our financial results to interest-rate volatility, see "Risk Management - Interest-Rate Risk and Other Market Risks." 

Management's Discussion and Analysis 
      
    Consolidated Results of Operations | Comparison 

CHANGES IN SPREADS 
  Comprehensive income (loss) was affected by changes in spreads in amounts estimated to be   $0.7 billion   and   $(0.5) billion   (after-tax) during 3Q 2016 and 3Q 2015, respectively, and   $0.2 billion   (after-tax) during both YTD 2016 and YTD 2015. During 3Q 2016 and YTD 2016, spreads tightening on our agency and non-agency mortgage-related securities and our multifamily mortgage loans and commitments measured at fair value resulted in an increase in comprehensive income. During 3Q 2015, the negative effect on comprehensive income was primarily due to spreads widening on these investments. During YTD 2015, spreads tightening on our agency and non-agency mortgage-related securities was partially offset by spreads widening on our multifamily mortgage loans measured at fair value, resulting in an increase in comprehensive income.

    Loan fees, primarily consisting of amortization of delivery fees, included in interest income were $1.9 billion and $1.6 billion for loans held by consolidated trusts and were $184 million and $289 million for loans held by Freddie Mac during YTD 2016 and YTD 2015, respectively. 

Management's Discussion and Analysis 
      
    Consolidated Results of Operations | Net Interest Income 

COMPONENTS OF NET INTEREST INCOME   The table below presents the components of net interest income. 

Key Drivers: 
             
    Guarantee fee income (contractual) 
                
    3Q 2016 vs. 3Q 2015     and YTD 2016 vs. YTD 2015   - increased during the 2016 periods due to higher average contractual guarantee fee rates, reflecting the continued growth in the size of the Core single-family book, and a larger overall single-family credit guarantee portfolio. Average contractual guarantee fees are generally higher on mortgage loans in our Core single-family book compared to those in our Legacy single-family book. 
                
    Other contractual net interest income  
                
    3Q 2016 vs. 3Q 2015 and YTD 2016 vs. YTD 2015   - decreased during the 2016 periods primarily due to the continued reduction in the balance of our mortgage-related investments portfolio pursuant to the portfolio limits established by the Purchase Agreement and FHFA. See "Conservatorship and Related Matters - Reducing Our Mortgage-Related Investments Portfolio Over Time" for a discussion of the key drivers of the decline in our mortgage-related investments portfolio. 
                
    Net amortization of other assets and debt 
                
    3Q 2016 vs. 3Q 2015 and YTD 2016 vs. YTD 2015   - decreased during the 2016 periods primarily due to less accretion of previously recognized other-than-temporary impairment. The decrease in accretion during the 2016 periods is due to a decline in the population of impaired securities as a result of our active disposition of these securities and the recognition of less other-than-temporary impairment due to stabilized collateral performance. 

Management's Discussion and Analysis 
      
    Consolidated Results of Operations | Provision for Credit Losses 

BENEFIT (PROVISION) FOR CREDIT LOSSES 
  The benefit (provision) for credit losses predominantly relates to single-family loans and includes components for both collectively and individually impaired loans.   
   
  The table below presents the components of our benefit (provision) for credit losses. 

Key Drivers: 
              
    Fewer seriously delinquent single-family loans were reclassified from held-for-investment to held-for-sale in 3Q 2016. During 3Q 2016,   $0.3 billion   in UPB of seriously delinquent single-family loans were reclassified to held-for-sale, compared to $2.5 billion during 3Q 2015. See "Loan Reclassifications" for the effect of these loan reclassifications on benefit (provision) for credit losses and pre-tax net income. 
                
    Management qualitatively increased the modeled estimate of incurred losses for mortgage loans during 3Q 2016 due to several factors. Sales prices of foreclosed properties have not improved over the last few years as much as national home price appreciation. Additionally, we have observed rising delinquency rates and increases in loan loss reserves at several large financial institutions for certain consumer financing receivables, such as credit card receivables and auto loans, which can be indicators for increases in mortgage loan defaults. 
                
    YTD 2016 vs. YTD 2015   - Benefit for credit losses declined in YTD 2016 compared to YTD 2015 primarily because fewer seriously delinquent single-family loans were reclassified from held-for-investment to held-for-sale in YTD 2016. During YTD 2016,   $3.8 billion   in UPB of seriously delinquent single-family loans were reclassified to held-for-sale, compared to $10.6 billion during YTD 2015. The smaller benefit for credit losses from the reclassifications of loans was partially offset by improvements in estimated loss severity and probability of default during YTD 2016 compared to YTD 2015.  

Management's Discussion and Analysis 
      
    Consolidated Results of Operations | Derivative Gains (Losses) 

DERIVATIVE GAINS (LOSSES) 
  Our sensitivity to interest rates on an economic basis remains low based on our models. Furthermore, our exposure to earnings volatility resulting from our use of derivatives has recently decreased as we have rebalanced our derivative portfolio in response to the declining interest-rate environment. We also entered into certain structured transactions during the first half of 2016, which resulted in more financial assets being recognized and measured at fair value. We continue to align our derivative portfolio with the changing duration of our hedged assets and liabilities. We believe the impact of derivatives on our GAAP financial results should be considered in the context of our overall interest-rate risk profile, including our PMVS and duration gap results. For more information about our interest-rate risk management activities and the sensitivity of reported earnings to those activities, see  Risk Management - Interest-Rate Risk and Other Market Risks.  
   
  The table below presents the components of derivative gains (losses). 

Key Drivers: 
              
    YTD 2016 vs. YTD 2015   - We recognized derivative fair value losses during YTD 2016 and YTD 2015 primarily due to declines in interest rates in both periods. The decline in fair value was partially offset by gains in our receive-fixed swaps and option-based derivatives. The 10-year par swap rate declined   74   basis points and   28   basis points during YTD 2016 and YTD 2015, respectively.

    3Q 2016 vs. 3Q 2015   - increased primarily due to unrealized gains from spreads tightening for our agency and non-agency mortgage-related securities during 3Q 2016 compared to unrealized losses from spreads widening for these securities during 3Q 2015. The increase attributable to spread changes was partially offset by unrealized losses due to an increase in longer-term interest rates during 3Q 2016 compared to unrealized gains due to a decrease in longer-term interest rates during 3Q 2015. 
                
    YTD 2016 vs. YTD 2015   - increased primarily due to a larger decline in longer-term interest rates during YTD 2016 compared to YTD 2015, which resulted in greater unrealized gains on our available-for-sale mortgage-related securities. The increase attributable to interest rate changes was partially offset by less spread tightening for our agency and non-agency mortgage-related securities during YTD 2016 compared to YTD 2015. 
                
    Accretion due to significant increases in expected cash flows on previously impaired available-for-sale securities  
                
    3Q 2016 vs. 3Q 2015 and YTD 2016 vs. YTD 2015   - decreased during the 2016 periods primarily due to a decline in the population of impaired securities as a result of our active dispositions of these securities, coupled with less new other-than-temporary impairment due to stabilized collateral performance. 
                
    Reclassifications from AOCI  
                
    3Q 2016 vs. 3Q 2015   - increased due to greater sales of agency and non-agency mortgage-related securities in an unrealized gain position.

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS ANALYSIS 
  The table below compares our summarized consolidated balance sheets. 

Key Drivers: 
  As of   September 30, 2016   compared to December 31, 2015: 
             
    Cash and cash equivalents  ,   restricted cash and cash equivalents  , and   securities purchased under agreements to resell   affect one another, so the changes in the balances should be viewed together. The combined balance as of September 30, 2016 decreased due to higher near term cash needs at December 31, 2015 for upcoming maturities and anticipated calls of other debt. However, the amounts held by consolidated trusts increased primarily due to an increase in prepayment proceeds. Our use of these proceeds is restricted by the provisions of the Master Trust Agreement as the proceeds are trust assets that will be distributed to the holders of our debt securities of consolidated trusts shortly following receipt. 
                
    Derivative assets, net   increased primarily due to an increase in non-cash collateral posted by our derivative counterparties. While we generally offset the obligation to return cash collateral against the fair value of our derivative assets on our consolidated balance sheets, we do not offset non-cash collateral received against the fair value of our derivative assets. 
                
    Real estate owned, net   continued to decline as we continued to sell our existing inventory. In addition, REO acquisitions continue to decline due to fewer seriously delinquent loans (see "Our  

Management's Discussion and Analysis 
      
    Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis 

Business Segments - Single-Family Loan Performance"), due in part to sales of certain seriously delinquent loans, and a large proportion of property sales to third parties at foreclosure. 
             
    Other assets   increased primarily because of receivables from servicers. Lower mortgage interest rates during YTD 2016 caused an increase in prepayments, and thus, an increase in receivables from servicers. When a borrower prepays, there is a brief delay before the servicer remits the payoff proceeds to us.  
                
    Total equity   increased as a result of higher comprehensive income in 3Q 2016 than in the fourth quarter of 2015.

    Single-family Guarantee   - reflects results from our purchase, securitization, and guarantee of single-family loans and the management of single-family mortgage credit risk. 
                
    Multifamily   - reflects results from our purchase, securitization, and guarantee of multifamily loans and securities, our investments in those loans and securities, and the management of multifamily mortgage credit risk. 
                
    Investments   - reflects results from managing the company s mortgage-related investments portfolio (excluding multifamily investments, single-family seriously delinquent loans, and the credit risk of single-family performing loans), treasury function, and interest-rate risk. 
                
    All Other   - consists of material corporate-level activities that are infrequent in nature and based on decisions outside the control of the management of our reportable segments. 
     SEGMENT EARNINGS 
  During the first and third quarters of 2016, we changed how we calculate certain components of our Segment Earnings for our Single-family Guarantee, Multifamily, and Investments segments.

    3Q 2016 vs. 3Q 2015 and YTD 2016 vs. YTD 2015 -   increased primarily due to higher amortization of upfront fees resulting from increased loan liquidations. Higher average contractual guarantee fees, reflecting the continued growth in the size of the Core single-family book in our single-family credit guarantee portfolio, also contributed. Average contractual guarantee fees are generally higher on mortgage loans in our Core single-family book compared to those in our Legacy single-family book. 
                
    Average guarantee fee rate charged on new acquisitions: 
                
    3Q 2016 vs. 3Q 2015 and YTD 2016 vs. YTD 2015 -   increased primarily due to changes in the product mix of our single-family new business purchases as new acquisitions have included a relatively higher proportion of 30-year fixed-rate mortgages which generally have higher guarantee fee rates.

Credit Risk Transfer Activity   
  Since 2013, STACR debt note and ACIS transactions have been our principal methods of transferring a portion of the expected credit losses and a significant portion of stress credit losses subsequent to loan acquisition in our Core single-family book to third parties. The following charts present transactions that occurred during 3Q 2016 and the cumulative amount of such transactions as of September 30, 2016 by loss position and the party holding each loss position.

  Transactions as of September 30, 2016   (1)   

(1)  
    The amounts represent the UPB upon issuance of STACR debt notes and execution of ACIS transactions. 

We continued to transfer a portion of expected credit losses and a significant portion of stress credit losses to third-party investors, insurers, and selected sellers through CRT transactions. During YTD 2016, we transferred a portion of the expected credit losses and a significant portion of stress credit losses associated with   $181.8 billion   in UPB of loans in our Core single-family book through STACR debt note, ACIS, seller indemnification, whole loan security and Deep Mortgage Insurance CRT, or Deep MI, transactions. Deep MI transactions are described below. 
                
    The interest and premiums we pay on our issued STACR debt note and ACIS transactions effectively reduce the guarantee fee income we earn on the PCs within the respective reference pools. Our expected guarantee fee income on the PCs within the STACR and ACIS reference pools has been effectively reduced by approximately   33%  , on average, for all transactions executed through   September 30, 2016  . The amount of the effective reduction to our overall guarantee fee income could change over time as we continue our credit risk transfer activities or if there are changes in the economic or regulatory environment that affect the cost of executing these transactions. We expect that the aggregate cost of our credit risk transfer activity will continue to increase as we enter into additional transactions. 
                
    Due to differences in accounting, there could be a significant lag in time between when we recognize a provision for credit losses and when we recognize the related recovery from our actual loss STACR debt note transactions. A credit expense on a loan in a reference pool related to these transactions is  

Management's Discussion and Analysis 
      
    Our Business Segments | Single-Family Guarantee 

recorded when it is probable that we have incurred a loss, while a recovery is recorded when an actual loss event occurs. 
             
    As of   September 30, 2016  , there has not been a significant number of loans in our STACR debt note reference pools that have experienced a credit event. As a result, we experienced minimal write-downs on our STACR debt notes and filed minimal claims for reimbursement of losses under our ACIS transactions. 
                
    In 3Q 2016, we announced a pilot of a new credit risk transfer offering called Deep MI, which is a credit enhancement purchased by us that takes effect immediately upon the sale of the mortgage loan to Freddie Mac. The pilot transaction provides additional coverage beyond primary mortgage insurance on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with LTV ratios between 80% and 95%. The pilot has a 6-month loan aggregation period which ends in the first quarter of 2017.

    Credit risk transfer transactions include STACR debt notes, ACIS insurance policies, seller indemnification agreements, whole loan securities, and Deep MI. The substantial majority of single-family loans covered by these transactions were acquired after 2012. 
     Commentary     
             
    The Core single-family book had credit protection on   46%   of total current UPB as of   September 30, 2016   compared to 39% as of December 31, 2015. Credit protection increased primarily as a result of our ongoing credit risk transfer transactions. 
                
    At September 30, 2016, as noted above, credit risk transfer transactions provided 25% of the coverage remaining on our Core single-family book, an increase from 23% at December 31, 2015. The increase reflects additional CRT transactions during 2016.

Mortgage Loan Credit Risk  
  Certain combinations of loan attributes can indicate a higher degree of credit risk, such as loans with both higher LTV ratios and lower credit scores. The following table presents the combination of credit score and current LTV (CLTV) ratio attributes of loans in our single-family credit guarantee portfolio. 

Management's Discussion and Analysis 
      
    Our Business Segments | Single-Family Guarantee 

Alt-A and Subprime Loans   W  hile we refer to certain loans as subprime or Alt-A for purposes of the discussion below and elsewhere in this Form 10-Q, there is no universally accepted definition of subprime or Alt-A, and the classification of such loans may differ from company to company. For example, some financial institutions may use credit scores to delineate certain residential loans as subprime. We do not rely on these loan classifications to evaluate the credit risk exposure relating to such loans in our single-family credit guarantee portfolio.    
  Participants in the mortgage market may characterize single-family loans based upon their overall credit quality at the time of origination, generally considering them to be prime or subprime. While we have not historically characterized the loans in our single-family credit guarantee portfolio as either prime or subprime, we monitor the amount of loans we have guaranteed with characteristics that indicate a higher degree of credit risk. In addition, we estimate that approximately   $1.3 billion   and $1.5 billion of security collateral underlying our other securitization products at   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, respectively, were identified as subprime based on information provided to us when we entered into these transactions. 
  Many mortgage market participants classify single-family loans with credit characteristics that range between their prime and subprime categories as Alt-A because these loans have a combination of characteristics of each category, may be underwritten with lower or alternative income or asset documentation requirements compared to a full documentation loan, or both. Although we have discontinued new purchases of loans with lower documentation standards, we continued to purchase certain amounts of such loans in cases where the loan was either purchased pursuant to a previously issued guarantee, part of our relief refinance initiative, or part of another refinance loan initiative and the pre-existing loan was originated under less than full documentation standards. In the event we purchase a refinance loan and the original loan had been previously identified as Alt-A, such refinance loan may no longer be categorized or reported as an Alt-A loan in this Form 10-Q and our other financial reports because the new refinance loan replacing the original loan would not be identified by the seller/servicer as an Alt-A loan. As a result, our reported Alt-A balances may be lower than would otherwise be the case had such refinancing not occurred. From the time the relief refinance initiative began in 2009 to   September 30, 2016  , we have purchased approximately   $34.0 billion   of relief refinance loans that were previously categorized as Alt-A loans in our portfolio, including   $0.4 billion   in 3Q 2016.   
  The table below contains information on Alt-A loans in our single-family credit guarantee portfolio.  

The UPB of Alt-A loans in our single-family credit guarantee portfolio declined during YTD 2016 primarily due to borrowers refinancing into other mortgage products, foreclosure transfers, and other liquidation events. Significant portions of the Alt-A loans in our portfolio are concentrated in Arizona, California, Florida, and Nevada.

  Serious Delinquency Rates 
     
  Commentary  
             
    Serious delinquency rates continued to decline across our single-family credit guarantee portfolio during YTD 2016 due to the continued strong performance of loans in the growing Core single-family book, continued home price appreciation, a stable labor market, continued loss mitigation and foreclosure activities for loans in the Legacy single-family book, as well as sales of certain seriously delinquent loans. 
                
    As part of our strategy to mitigate losses and reduce our holdings of less liquid assets, we sold seriously delinquent loans totaling   $2.4 billion   in UPB during YTD 2016. The sale of seriously delinquent loans during YTD 2016 contributed to a decline in the serious delinquency rate of the total single-family credit guarantee portfolio and the Legacy single-family book. Absent these sales, the serious delinquency rate of the total single-family credit guarantee portfolio and the Legacy single-family book would have been   1.18%   and   3.96%   as of September 30, 2016, respectively.

As of   September 30, 2016  ,   64%   of the loan loss reserves for single-family mortgage loans related to interest rate concessions provided to borrowers as part of loan modifications.  
                
    Most of our modified single-family loans, including TDRs, were current and performing at   September 30, 2016  . 
                
    We expect our loan loss reserves associated with existing single-family TDRs to continue to decline over time as borrowers continue to make monthly payments under the modified terms and interest-rate concessions are amortized into earnings. 
                 
    3Q 2016 vs. 3Q 2015 -   decreased REO acquisition and foreclosure alternative volumes due to fewer seriously delinquent loans, due in part to sales of certain seriously delinquent loans, and a large proportion of property sales to third parties at foreclosure;

    3Q 2016 vs. 3Q 2015 and YTD 2016 vs. YTD 2015 -   increased primarily due to higher amortization of upfront fees resulting from increased loan liquidations. Higher average contractual guarantee fee rates, reflecting the continued growth in the size of the Core single-family book, also contributed. 
                
    Benefit (provision) for credit losses 
                
    3Q 2016 vs. 3Q 2015   - (provision) increased primarily due to a change in management s outlook of the probability of default. Management qualitatively increased the modeled estimate of incurred losses for mortgage loans during 3Q 2016 due to several factors. Sales prices of foreclosed properties have not improved over the last few years as much as national home price appreciation. Additionally, we have observed rising delinquency rates and increases in loan loss reserves at several large financial institutions for certain consumer financing receivables, such as credit card receivables and auto loans, which can be indicators for increases in mortgage loan defaults.

  Source: REIS, Inc. 

Commentary   
             
    The profitability of our K Certificate transactions (as measured by gains and losses on sales of mortgage loans) is affected by the change in K Certificate benchmark spreads during the period between our commitment to purchase a loan and execution of the K Certificate transaction. These spread impacts contribute to our earnings variability which we try to manage through the size of our securitization pipeline of held-for-sale mortgage loans. 
                
    K Certificate benchmark spreads tightened during 3Q 2016, ending at 70 bps, which had a positive effect on K Certificate profitability.  
                
    During 3Q 2016, the rate of increase in effective rents fell, while vacancy rates were unchanged. We expect that, given the elevated levels of new construction, vacancy rates will increase slowly in the upcoming quarters, putting downward pressure on rent growth.

Commentary  
             
    We have a goal under the 2016 Conservatorship Scorecard to maintain the dollar volume of multifamily new business activity at or below a production cap, which was increased by FHFA during 3Q 2016 from $35 billion to $36.5 billion. For purposes of determining our performance under the goal, business activity associated with certain targeted loan types is excluded from this production cap. Reclassifications between new business activity subject to the production cap and new business activity not subject to the production cap may occur during 2016. 
                
    The dollar amount of our multifamily new business volumes increased during 3Q 2016 compared to 3Q 2015 and during YTD 2016 compared to YTD 2015, primarily due to an increase in overall multifamily market originations as a result of strong demand for apartments.

    Our total multifamily portfolio grew during 3Q 2016 due to an increase in the guarantee portfolio, which was primarily attributable to our securitization of loans in K Certificate transactions. 
                
    Our securitization pipeline of held-for-sale loans was $15.3 billion at September 30, 2016, a reduction from the elevated levels in recent quarters. This balance decreased slightly during 3Q 2016 as our securitization of loans into K Certificates and other securitization products outpaced our 3Q 2016 held-for-sale mortgage loan purchase volume.  
                
    The decline in less liquid assets during YTD 2016 was primarily due to continued runoff of our held-for-investment mortgage loan and CMBS portfolios. In addition, less liquid assets declined as a result of securitization of certain of our held-for-investment mortgage loans.

    Our K Certificate issuance volume increased during 3Q 2016 compared to 3Q 2015 as well as YTD 2016 compared to YTD 2015 as we continued to reduce our securitization pipeline, which was elevated in recent quarters as a result of the record origination volume in the multifamily market during 2015 as well as strong YTD 2016 purchase volume. While we may purchase portions of our newly issued K Certificates or the unguaranteed subordinated securities, to date we have not purchased any of the unguaranteed securities that are in the first loss position nor do we currently hold any in our portfolio. 
                
    In addition to the credit risk we transferred on K Certificates, we transferred a large majority of expected and stress credit losses associated with $0.5 billion of additional loans during 3Q 2016 through other securitization products, such as small balance loan securitizations. 
                
    The average guarantee fee rate on newly issued K Certificates increased during YTD 2016 compared to YTD 2015, primarily due to lower levels of subordination.

    Guarantee fee income 
                 
    Gains (losses) on loans and other non-interest income, derivative gains (losses),   and   total other comprehensive income (loss)   are evaluated together as they are collectively driven by a combination of spread-related and interest rate-related fair value changes. We use derivatives in the Multifamily segment to economically offset interest rate-related fair value changes of certain assets. The fair value changes of these economically hedged assets are included in   gains (losses) on loans and other non-interest income   and   total other comprehensive income (loss)  . These changes and the interest rate-related derivative fair value changes that are included in   derivative gains (losses)   largely offset each other and, as a result, there is minimal net impact on total comprehensive income for the Multifamily segment from interest rate-related derivatives.

    Longer-term interest rates (e.g., 2-year and 10-year rates) declined during 3Q 2015, YTD 2015 and YTD 2016, resulting in lower fair values for our pay-fixed interest rate swaps and higher fair values for our receive-fixed interest rate swaps, certain of our option contracts, and the vast majority of our investments in securities. Conversely, longer-term interest rates generally increased during 3Q 2016, resulting in higher fair values for our pay-fixed interest rate swaps and lower fair values for our receive-fixed interest rate swaps, certain of our option contracts, and the vast majority of our investments in securities.

Commentary  
             
    We continue to reduce the size of our mortgage investments portfolio in order to comply with the mortgage-related investments portfolio year-end limits. The balance of our mortgage investments portfolio declined 8.0% from December 31, 2015 to   September 30, 2016  .  
                
    Although the balance of our non-mortgage-related assets portfolio was elevated at December 31, 2015, due to higher near-term cash needs, the balance of this portfolio increased 1.1% from December 31, 2015 to   September 30, 2016  , primarily due to an increase in prepayment proceeds received by the custodial account. These proceeds are invested prior to being distributed to the holders of our debt securities of consolidated trusts shortly following receipt.  
                
    The percentage of less liquid assets relative to our total mortgage investments portfolio declined from 38.8% at December 31, 2015 to 34.6% at   September 30, 2016  , primarily due to repayments, sales and securitizations of our less liquid assets. We actively reduced the size of our less liquid assets

during YTD 2016 by selling $7.7 billion of non-agency mortgage-related securities and enhancing the liquidity of $5.7 billion of single-family reperforming loans and performing modified loans through securitization. Our strategy related to securitization of less liquid assets is to initially retain all of the resulting mortgage-related securities and then resecuritize a portion of these securities with some of the resulting interests being sold to third parties. 
             
    The overall liquidity of our mortgage investments portfolio continued to improve as our less liquid assets decreased at a faster pace than the overall decline of our mortgage investments portfolio.

    3Q 2016 vs. 3Q 2015 and YTD 2016 vs. YTD 2015 -   declined 44 basis points and 40 basis points, respectively, primarily due to higher hedging costs from an increase in amortization of upfront cash paid for swaptions, coupled with a reduction in the balance of our higher yielding mortgage-related assets due to repayments. The upfront cash paid for swaptions is amortized on a straight-line basis and reclassified from   derivative gains (losses)   into   net interest income  . The increase in amortization is due to an increase in upfront cash paid for swaptions to hedge our increased exposure to mortgage prepayment risk due to the continued low interest rate environment. The increase in amortization is partially offset by gains recognized in   derivative gains (losses)  .  
                
    Average Investments Portfolio Balance 
                
    The average investments portfolio balances for the 2016 periods declined compared to the 2015 periods primarily due to the repayment and sale of non-agency mortgage-related securities and the repayment of certain reperforming loans and performing modified loans, partially offset by an increase in our purchase of loans for our securitization pipeline and U.S. Treasury securities, which are classified as non-mortgage-related assets. The overall decline in our average

    Activity and balances disclosed in the table above exclude collateralized borrowings, including securities sold under agreements to repurchase, and certain other debt issued by other segments (e.g., STACR debt notes). 
     Commentary   
             
    The outstanding balance of our other debt continues to decline as we require less debt to fund our business operations due to the decline in the balance of our mortgage-related investments portfolio. 
                
    To replace the medium-term and long-term debt that was called or matured during the 2016 periods, we issued a combination of callable and non-callable debt. During 3Q 2016 compared to 3Q 2015, our issuances of callable and non-callable debt increased, while our issuances of discount notes decreased. The increase in term debt issuances offsets an increased amount of outstanding debt that was nearing maturity.

Commentary   
             
    We continued to rely on a mix of short-term and medium-term debt issuances to meet our overall funding needs. Our effective short-term debt percentage, which represents the percentage of our total other debt (including the par value of our STACR debt notes and collateralized borrowings that are excluded from the graphs above) that is expected to mature within one year, increased to 44.1% as of September 30, 2016 compared to 41.3% as of December 31, 2015. 
                
    Our short-term debt issuances provide us with overall lower funding costs relative to our medium-term and longer-term debt. In October 2016, amendments to the SEC rules that govern money market mutual funds became effective. These amendments make certain structural and operational reforms to address the risks of investor withdrawals from money market funds. These amendments do not apply to mutual funds that invest solely in debt issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government or its agencies and instrumentalities, including GSEs. As a result, the demand for government and agency debt has increased, which has contributed to the improvement in our short-term debt spreads during 2016.

Our callable debt provides us with the option to repay the outstanding principal balance of the debt prior to its contractual maturity date. As of September 30, 2016, $86 billion of the outstanding $103 billion of callable debt may be called within one year.

    3Q 2016 vs. 3Q 2015 and YTD 2016 vs. YTD 2015   - decreased primarily due to higher hedging costs from an increase in amortization of upfront cash paid for swaptions, coupled with a reduction in the balance of our higher yielding mortgage-related assets due to repayments. The increase in amortization is due to an increase in upfront cash paid for swaptions to hedge our increased exposure to mortgage prepayment risk due to the continued low interest rate environment.

tightening for our agency securities during 3Q 2016 compared to losses from spreads widening for our agency securities during 3Q 2015.  
             
    YTD 2016 vs. YTD 2015   - decreased primarily due to a larger decline in longer-term interest rates during YTD 2016 compared to YTD 2015, which resulted in greater gains on our trading securities. These changes attributable to interest rates were partially offset by less spread tightening for our agency securities.  
                
    Other non-interest income 
                
    YTD 2016 vs. YTD 2015   - decreased primarily due to a decline in sales of available-for-sale non-agency mortgage-related securities in an unrealized gain position and less accretion of previously recognized other-than-temporary impairment, partially offset by an increase in sales of agency mortgage-related securities in an unrealized gain position. The volume of our sales of non-agency mortgage-related securities will continue to vary as our portfolio that is saleable, based on a variety of criteria, has decreased.  
                
    Other comprehensive income (loss) 
                
    YTD 2016 vs. YTD 2015   - increased primarily due to a decline in sales of available-for-sale non-agency mortgage-related securities in an unrealized gain position, which resulted in less unrealized gains being reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to   other non-interest income  . While we recognized greater unrealized gains as a result of a larger interest rate decline, these gains were largely offset by less unrealized gains as a result of less spread tightening on our agency and non-agency mortgage-related securities and greater unrealized losses due to the movement of a larger number of premium securities towards their maturities.

RISK MANAGEMENT 
  Risk is an inherent part of our business activities. We are exposed to four major types of risk: credit risk, interest-rate and other market risks, liquidity risk, and operational risk. 
  For more discussion of these and other risks facing our business and our risk management framework, see "MD A - Risk Management" and "Risk Factors" in our 2015 Annual Report and Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2016, and "Liquidity and Capital Resources" in this report and in our 2015 Annual Report.

  CREDIT RISK 
   
  INSTITUTIONAL CREDIT RISK 

Sellers and Servicers  
  In our single-family guarantee business, we do not originate loans or have our own loan servicing operation. Instead, we rely on our seller and servicer counterparties to perform the primary loan origination and loan servicing functions on our behalf.  
  We have significant exposure to non-depository and smaller depository financial institutions who act as sellers and servicers in our single-family business. These institutions may not have the same financial strength or operational capacity, or be subject to the same level of regulatory oversight, as our largest mortgage seller or servicer counterparties. The financial performance of these companies has been under stress and many of them reported a net loss in recent quarters. If their weak financial performance persists, it could affect available servicing capacity in the market, which eventually could lead to higher operational risk and higher credit losses for Freddie Mac. 
  For more information about counterparty risk associated with sellers and servicers, see Note 12 in this Form 10-Q and "Risk Factors - Credit Risks -   We are exposed to institutional credit risk with respect to our business counterparties. Our financial results may be adversely affected if one or more of our counterparties fail to meet their obligations to us"   in our 2015 Annual Report. 
   
  Mortgage Insurers   
  On August 15, 2016, American International Group, Inc. announced that it had entered into an agreement to sell 100% of its interest in United Guaranty Corporation to Arch Capital Group Ltd. Because Arch US Mortgage Insurance, a subsidiary of Arch Capital Group Ltd., and United Guaranty Corporation are both approved mortgage insurers, Freddie Mac will evaluate the effect on the combined entity s financial strength when considering the planned acquisition. The transaction is also subject to other required approvals.  
  On October 23, 2016, Genworth Financial, Inc. announced that it had entered into an agreement to be acquired by China Oceanwide Holdings Group Co., Ltd. Because Genworth Mortgage Insurance Corporation, a subsidiary of Genworth Financial, Inc., is an approved mortgage insurer, Freddie Mac will evaluate the financial strength of China Oceanwide Holdings Group Co., Ltd. when considering the planned acquisition. The transaction is also subject to other required approvals. For more information about counterparty risk associated with mortgage insurers, see Note 12.

OPERATIONAL RISK 
  OPERATIONAL RISK UPDATE RELATING TO MASTER TRUST AGREEMENTS 
  
  As previously disclosed, the company identified that some of its operational procedures were not sufficiently detailed to comply with certain obligations under its Master Trust Agreements, which are amended from time to time. During 2016, we have made significant progress to correct the deficiencies in these operational procedures including developing the capability to record separate, individual receipts and payments in the custodial account to reflect transactions between the company and the trusts, rather than netting amounts due to and due from the trusts. 
  Past practices led to a build-up in the custodial account of funds that belonged to the company. This build-up totaled approximately $19 billion as of June 30, 2016. We withdrew approximately $8 billion of this amount during 3Q 2016, and anticipate withdrawing the vast majority of the remainder during 4Q 2016. We have also established processes to withdraw company funds from the custodial account on a regular basis as new amounts are received.

Management's Discussion and Analysis 
      
    Risk Management | Interest-Rate Risk and Other Market Risks 

INTEREST-RATE RISK AND OTHER MARKET RISKS 
  Our business segments have embedded exposure to interest-rate risk and other market risks. Interest-rate risk is consolidated and primarily managed by the Investments segment, while spread risk is owned and managed by each individual business segment. Interest-rate risk and other market risks can adversely affect future cash flows, or economic value, as well as earnings and net worth. 
  The majority of our interest-rate risk comes from our investments in mortgage-related assets (securities and loans), non-mortgage-related assets and other debt. Our primary goal in managing interest-rate risk is to reduce the amount of change in the value of our future cash flows due to future changes in interest rates. We use models to analyze possible future interest-rate scenarios, along with the cash flows of our assets and liabilities over those scenarios. 
  Our primary interest-rate risk measures are duration gap and Portfolio Market Value Sensitivity, or PMVS. PMVS measures are estimates of the amount of average potential pre-tax loss in the market value of our net assets due to parallel (PMVS-L) and non-parallel (PMVS-YC) changes in LIBOR. Our duration gap and PMVS estimates are determined using models that involve our judgment of interest-rate and prepayment assumptions. While we believe that PMVS and duration gap are useful risk management tools, they should be understood as estimates rather than as precise measurements. 
  Our PMVS and duration gap measures do not fully reflect the potential effect of negative index values across all of our floating rate assets and liabilities. See  Risk Factors -   Negative values for certain interest rate indices could have an adverse effect on our operational and interest-rate risk management processes    in our Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2016 for additional information. During the second half of 2Q 2016, we incorporated the effect of negative interest rate index values for the majority of our floating rate assets and liabilities. We are in the process of assessing the effect of negative interest rate index values for the remaining population of our floating rate assets. Incorporating the effect of the negative interest rate index values on the remaining population could result in significant percentage changes in the disclosed duration gap and PMVS levels. However, we do not believe any such percentage changes would represent an exposure to interest-rate risk that would be material to the company's financial condition or results of operations. 
  The table below provides duration gap, estimated point-in-time and minimum and maximum PMVS-L and PMVS-YC results, and an average of the daily values and standard deviation. The table below also provides PMVS-L estimates assuming an immediate 100 basis point shift in the LIBOR yield curve. The interest-rate sensitivity of a mortgage portfolio varies across a wide range of interest rates.  

Management's Discussion and Analysis 
      
    Risk Management | Interest-Rate Risk and Other Market Risks 

Derivatives enable us to reduce our interest-rate risk exposure. The table below shows that the PMVS-L risk levels, assuming a 50 basis point shift in the LIBOR yield curve for the periods presented, would have been higher if we had not used derivatives.  

While we manage our interest-rate risk exposure on an economic basis to a low level as measured by our models, the accounting treatment for our financial assets and liabilities (i.e., some are measured at amortized cost, while others are measured at fair value), including derivatives, creates volatility in our earnings when interest rates fluctuate. Based upon the composition of our financial assets and liabilities, including derivatives, at   September 30, 2016  , we generally recognize fair value losses in earnings when interest rates decline. The table below presents the estimated adverse net effect on pre-tax earnings of certain immediate shifts in interest rates. These estimates are essentially the derivative gains (losses) attributable to financial instruments that are not measured at fair value that we would expect to experience as a result of the shifts in interest rates. The methodology used to calculate these figures is consistent with the methodology used to calculate our PMVS-YC and PMVS-L metrics above. 

Our adverse exposures under these interest-rate scenarios as of September 30, 2016 declined compared to December 31, 2015 as we have rebalanced our derivative portfolio in response to the declining interest-rate environment. We increased our use of receive-fixed swaps as the duration of our financial assets declined, including those measured at amortized cost. We also entered into certain structured transactions during the first half of 2016, which resulted in additional financial assets being recognized and measured at fair value.

  OTHER DEBT ACTIVITIES 
  Debt securities that we issue are classified either as debt securities of consolidated trusts held by third parties or other debt. We issue other debt to fund our operations. Competition for funding can vary with economic, financial market, and regulatory environments. 
  The table below summarizes the par value of other debt securities we issued or paid off, including regularly scheduled principal payments, payments resulting from calls, and payments for repurchases. We repurchase, call, or exchange our outstanding debt securities from time to time for a variety of reasons, including managing our funding composition and supporting the liquidity of our debt securities. 

(1) Effective interest rate is weighted based on par value. 
  We continue to rely on short-term and medium-term other debt to meet our overall funding needs. Medium-term other debt is classified as long-term in the table above. Issuances and pay-offs of our short-term other debt increased during YTD 2016 compared to YTD 2015 as we continued to utilize overnight discount notes as a more cost effective tool to manage our intra-day liquidity needs. Our long-term other debt issuances increased during the 2016 periods compared to the 2015 periods, as we replaced called and matured debt with new callable and non-callable debt. Our outstanding other debt balance continues to decline as we reduce our indebtedness along with the decline in our mortgage-related investments portfolio.

DEBT SECURITIES OF CONSOLIDATED TRUSTS 
   
  The table below shows the issuance and extinguishment activity for the debt securities of our consolidated trusts. 

Debt securities of our consolidated trusts represent our liability to third parties that hold beneficial interests in our consolidated securitization trusts. Our exposure on debt securities of consolidated trusts is limited to the guarantee we provide on the payment of principal and interest on these securities, as the primary source of repayment of these debt securities comes from the cash flows of the mortgage loans that back the securities. At   September 30, 2016  , our estimated exposure (including the amounts that are due to Freddie Mac for debt securities of consolidated trusts that we purchased) to these debt securities is recognized as the allowance for credit losses on mortgage loans held by consolidated trusts. See Note 4 for details on our allowance for loan losses. 
   
  LIQUIDITY AND CONTINGENCY OPERATING PORTFOLIO 
  The investments in our Liquidity and Contingency Operating Portfolio are important to our cash flow, collateral management, and asset and liability management and our ability to provide liquidity and stability to the mortgage market. The table below summarizes the balances in our Cash and Other Investments Portfolio, which includes the Liquidity and Contingency Operating Portfolio.

    Consists of amounts related to collateral held by us from OTC derivative counterparties, and investments in unsecured agency debt that we may not otherwise invest in, other than to pledge as collateral to our counterparties when our derivatives are in a liability position.

Commentary  
  Cash provided by operating activities increased $10.5 billion primarily due to the following: 
             
    Increase in net sales of mortgage loans acquired as held-for-sale, primarily due to an increase in the volume of our multifamily securitizations. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in our net interest income. 
     Cash provided by investing activities decreased $58.4 billion primarily due to the following: 
             
    Increase in net purchases of investment securities, primarily due to more investment securities being retained from our agency resecuritizations;  
                
    Decrease in net proceeds received from loans acquired as held-for-investment, primarily due to an increase in loan purchases; 
                
    Increase in cash collateral posted to our derivative counterparties due to greater derivative losses resulting from larger declines in longer-term interest rates; and   
                
    Increase in advances to lenders. 
     Cash used in financing activities decreased $52.2 billion primarily due to the following: 
             
    Increase in net proceeds received from the issuance of debt securities of consolidated trusts held by third parties due to an increase in the volume of our single-family PC issuances for cash.  
      
  CAPITAL RESOURCES 
  Our entry into conservatorship resulted in significant changes to the assessment of our capital adequacy and our management of capital. Since our entry into conservatorship, Treasury and FHFA have taken a number of actions that affect our cash requirements and our ability to fund those requirements. Under the Purchase Agreement, Treasury made a commitment to provide us with funding, under certain conditions, to eliminate deficits in our net worth. Obtaining funding from Treasury pursuant to its commitment under the Purchase Agreement enables us to avoid being placed into receivership by FHFA. The amount of

  At   September 30, 2016  , our assets exceeded our liabilities under GAAP; therefore, no draw is being requested from Treasury under the Purchase Agreement. Based on our Net Worth Amount at   September 30, 2016   and the 2016 Capital Reserve Amount of $1.2 billion, our dividend obligation to Treasury in December 2016 will be   $2.3 billion  . Under the Purchase Agreement, the payment of dividends does not reduce the outstanding liquidation preference of the senior preferred stock. As a result of the net worth sweep dividend on the senior preferred stock, our future profits will effectively be distributed to Treasury, and we cannot retain capital from the earnings generated by our business operations (other than a limited capital reserve amount that will decrease to zero in 2018) or return capital to stockholders other than Treasury.  
  In June 2016, FASB issued a new Accounting Standards Update (ASU 2016-13) related to the measurement of credit losses on financial instruments that will be effective as of January 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted as of January 1, 2019. This Update replaces the incurred loss impairment methodology in current GAAP with a methodology that reflects lifetime expected credit losses. While we are still evaluating the effect that the adoption of this Update will have on our financial results, it will increase (perhaps substantially) our provision for credit losses in the period of adoption. As our capital reserve will decline to zero in 2018, this Update increases the risk that we will need to request a draw from Treasury for the period of adoption.

  REDUCING OUR MORTGAGE-RELATED INVESTMENTS PORTFOLIO OVER TIME 
  The table below presents the UPB of our mortgage-related investments portfolio for purposes of the portfolio limits imposed by the Purchase Agreement and by FHFA. 

(1) 
    Represents the amount that we manage to under our Retained Portfolio Plan, subject to certain exceptions. 
     The decline in our mortgage-related investments portfolio during YTD 2016 was primarily due to repayments, partially offset by net purchases of single-family loans for our securitization pipeline.  
  While we continued to purchase new single-family seriously delinquent loans, we reduced the size of our less liquid assets through the following:  
             
    Sales of $10.2 billion of less liquid assets, including $7.7 billion in UPB of non-agency mortgage-related securities and $2.4 billion in UPB of seriously delinquent unsecuritized single-family loans;  
                
    Securitizations of $1.3 billion in UPB of less liquid multifamily loans; and 
                
    Securitizations of $5.7 billion in UPB of single-family reperforming loans and performing modified loans, thereby enhancing their liquidity. Our strategy related to securitization of less liquid assets is to

initially retain all of the resulting mortgage-related securities and then resecuritize a portion of these securities with some of the resulting interests being sold to third parties. 

Management's Discussion and Analysis 
    Regulation and Supervision 

REGULATION AND SUPERVISION 
  In addition to our oversight by FHFA as our Conservator, we are subject to regulation and oversight by FHFA under our Charter and the GSE Act and to certain regulation by other government agencies. Furthermore, regulatory activities by other government agencies can affect us indirectly, even if we are not directly subject to such agencies  regulation or oversight. For example, regulations that modify requirements applicable to the purchase or servicing of mortgages can affect us. 
  AFFORDABLE HOUSING ALLOCATIONS 
  The GSE Act requires us to set aside in each fiscal year an amount equal to 4.2 basis points of each dollar of total new business purchases, and pay this amount to certain housing funds. During 3Q 2016 and YTD 2016, we completed   $128 billion   and   $313 billion  , respectively, of new business purchases subject to this requirement and accrued   $54 million   and   $131 million  , respectively, of related expense. We expect to pay this amount (and any additional amounts accrued based on our new business purchases during the remainder of 2016) in February 2017. We are prohibited from passing through these costs to the originators of the loans that we purchase.  
  LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS 
  CAP INCREASE FOR NEW MULTIFAMILY BUSINESS 
  
  On August 18, 2016, FHFA announced an increase to the 2016 multifamily lending cap for Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae under the 2016 Conservatorship Scorecard from $35 billion to $36.5 billion, effective immediately. The adjustment is based on increased estimates of the overall size of the 2016 multifamily finance market. 
  AFFORDABLE HOUSING GOALS AND RESULTS FOR 2015 
  
  In October 2016, FHFA informed us that it had reviewed our performance with respect to the affordable housing goals for 2015, and preliminarily determined that we achieved three of our five single-family affordable housing goals and all three of our multifamily goals. Our performance on the goals, as preliminarily determined by FHFA, is set forth below.

    Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS 
  We enter into certain business arrangements that are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheets or that may be recorded in amounts that differ from the full contract or notional amount of the transaction and that may expose us to potential losses in excess of the amounts recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. For a description of our off-balance sheet arrangements, see "MD A - Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements" in our 2015 Annual Report. See Note 3 for more information on our off-balance sheet securitization activities and other guarantees. 
  We have certain off-balance sheet arrangements related to our securitization activities involving guaranteed loans and mortgage-related securities, though most of our securitization activities are on-balance sheet. Our off-balance sheet arrangements related to these securitization activities primarily consist of K Certificates. We also have off-balance sheet arrangements related to certain other securitization products and other mortgage-related guarantees. Our maximum potential off-balance sheet exposure to credit losses relating to these securitization activities and guarantees is primarily represented by the UPB of the underlying loans and securities, which was   $156.3 billion   and $127.3 billion at   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, respectively.

NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
   
  NOTE 1: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
  Freddie Mac is a GSE chartered by Congress in 1970. Our public mission is to provide liquidity, stability, and affordability to the U.S. housing market. We are regulated by FHFA, the SEC, HUD, and Treasury, and are currently operating under the conservatorship of FHFA. For more information on the roles of FHFA and Treasury, see Note 2 in this Form 10-Q and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, or 2015 Annual Report. Throughout our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes, we use certain acronyms and terms which are defined in the  GLOSSARY  of our 2015 Annual Report and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the second quarter of 2016. Throughout our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes, we refer to the three months ended September 30, 2016 and the three months ended September 30, 2015 as  3Q 2016  and  3Q 2015,  respectively, and we refer to the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and the nine months ended September 30, 2015 as  YTD 2016  and  YTD 2015,  respectively. 
  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes in our 2015 Annual Report. 
  BASIS OF PRESENTATION  
  The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP and include our accounts as well as the accounts of other entities in which we have a controlling financial interest. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. 
  We are operating under the basis that we will realize assets and satisfy liabilities in the normal course of business as a going concern and in accordance with the delegation of authority from FHFA to our Board of Directors and management. Certain amounts in prior periods  consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments, have been recorded for a fair presentation of our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. 
  We evaluate the materiality of identified errors in the financial statements using both an income statement, or  rollover,  and a balance sheet, or  iron curtain,  approach, based on relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. Net income includes certain adjustments to correct immaterial errors related to previously reported periods. 
  USE OF ESTIMATES  
  The preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, gains, and losses during the reporting period. Management has made significant estimates in preparing the financial statements for establishing the allowance for loan losses and reserve for guarantee losses, and valuing financial

NOTE 2: CONSERVATORSHIP AND RELATED MATTERS 
  BUSINESS OBJECTIVES  
  We operate under the conservatorship that commenced on September 6, 2008, conducting our business under the direction of FHFA, as our Conservator. The conservatorship and related matters significantly affect our management, business activities, financial condition and results of operations. Upon its appointment, FHFA, as Conservator, immediately succeeded to all rights, titles, powers and privileges of Freddie Mac, and of any stockholder, officer or director thereof, with respect to the company and its assets. The Conservator also succeeded to the title to all books, records, and assets of Freddie Mac held by any other legal custodian or third party. The Conservator delegated certain authority to the Board of Directors to oversee, and management to conduct, business operations so that the company can continue to operate in the ordinary course. The directors serve on behalf of, and exercise authority as directed by, the Conservator. 
  We are also subject to certain constraints on our business activities under the Purchase Agreement. However, we believe that the support provided by Treasury pursuant to the Purchase Agreement currently enables us to maintain our access to the debt markets and to have adequate liquidity to conduct our normal business activities, although the costs of our debt funding could vary.  
  IMPACT OF CONSERVATORSHIP AND RELATED DEVELOPMENTS ON THE MORTGAGE-RELATED INVESTMENTS PORTFOLIO  
  For purposes of the limit imposed by the Purchase Agreement and FHFA regulation, the UPB of our mortgage-related investments portfolio cannot exceed   $339.3 billion   at December 31, 2016 and was   $308.1 billion   at   September 30, 2016  . Our Retained Portfolio Plan provides for us to manage the UPB of the mortgage-related investments portfolio so that it does not exceed   90%   of the annual cap established by the Purchase Agreement (subject to certain exceptions). Our mortgage-related investments portfolio cap is reduced by   15%   annually until it reaches   $250 billion  . This amount is calculated based on the maximum allowable size of the mortgage-related investments portfolio, rather than the actual UPB of the mortgage-related investments portfolio, as of December 31 of the preceding year. Our ability to acquire and sell mortgage assets is significantly constrained by limitations of the Purchase Agreement and those imposed by FHFA.  
  GOVERNMENT SUPPORT FOR OUR BUSINESS  
  We receive substantial support from Treasury and are dependent upon its continued support in order to continue operating our business. Our ability to access funds from Treasury under the Purchase Agreement is critical to: 
             
    Keeping us solvent; 
                
    Allowing us to focus on our primary business objectives under conservatorship; and 
                
    Avoiding the appointment of a receiver by FHFA under statutory mandatory receivership provisions.  
     At June 30, 2016, our assets exceeded our liabilities under GAAP; therefore, FHFA did not request a draw on our behalf and, as a result, we did   not   receive any funding from Treasury under the Purchase Agreement during 3Q 2016. Since conservatorship began through   September 30, 2016  , we have paid cash dividends of   $99.1 billion   to Treasury at the direction of the Conservator. 

Financial Statements 
    Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements | Note 2 

See Note 6 and Note 9 for more information on the conservatorship and the Purchase Agreement. 
  RELATED PARTIES AS A RESULT OF CONSERVATORSHIP  
  We are deemed related parties with Fannie Mae as both we and Fannie Mae have the same relationships with FHFA and Treasury. Common Securitization Solutions, LLC (CSS), was formed in 2013 as a limited liability company equally-owned by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. Therefore, CSS is also deemed a related party. During YTD 2016, we contributed   $88 million   of capital to CSS.

    Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements | Note 3 

NOTE 3: SECURITIZATION AND GUARANTEE ACTIVITIES 
  Our primary business activities in our Single-family Guarantee and Multifamily segments involve the securitization of loans or other mortgage-related assets using trusts that are VIEs. These trusts issue beneficial interests in the loans or other mortgage-related assets that they own. We guarantee the principal and interest payments on some or all of the issued beneficial interests in substantially all of our securitization transactions. We consolidate VIEs when we have a controlling financial interest in the VIE and are therefore considered the primary beneficiary of the VIE.  
   
  VIEs FOR WHICH WE ARE THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY  
  The table below presents the carrying value and classification of the assets and liabilities of consolidated VIEs on our consolidated balance sheets. 

Financial Statements 
    Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements | Note 3 

VIEs FOR WHICH WE ARE NOT THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY  
  Our involvement with VIEs for which we are not the primary beneficiary takes one or both of two forms - purchasing an investment in these entities or providing a guarantee to these entities. The following table presents the carrying amounts and classification of the assets and liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheets related to our variable interests in unconsolidated VIEs with which we were involved in the design and creation and have a significant continuing involvement, as well as our maximum exposure to loss.  

We also obtain interests in various other VIEs created by third parties through the normal course of business, such as through our investments in non-Freddie Mac mortgage-related securities, purchases of multifamily loans, guarantees of multifamily housing revenue bonds, as a derivative counterparty, or through other activities. 
   
  FINANCIAL GUARANTEES  
  The table below shows our maximum potential exposure, recognized liability, and maximum remaining term of our recognized financial guarantees to unconsolidated VIEs and other third parties. This table does not include our unrecognized financial guarantees, such as guarantees to consolidated VIEs or to resecuritization trusts that do not expose us to incremental credit risk. 

(1) 
    This amount excludes our reserve for guarantee losses, which totaled   $70 million   and   $76 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, and is included within other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. 
      
  CREDIT ENHANCEMENTS  
  For many of the loans underlying our single-family PCs, other securitization products, and other mortgage-related guarantees, we obtained credit enhancements from third parties covering a portion of our credit risk exposure. See Note 4 for information about credit enhancements on loans. 

Financial Statements 
    Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements | Note 3 

In connection with the securitization activities of the Multifamily segment, we have various forms of credit protection. The most prevalent type is subordination, primarily through our K Certificates. Through subordination, we mitigate our credit risk exposure by structuring our securities to transfer a large majority of expected and stress credit losses to private investors who purchase the subordinate tranches, as shown in the table below.    

  In addition to subordination, the Multifamily segment also has various other credit enhancements, primarily related to our mortgage loans and other mortgage-related guarantees, in the form of collateral posting requirements, loss sharing agreements, credit-linked notes, and other similar arrangements. We expect that these credit enhancements will enable us to recover all or a portion of our losses or the amounts paid under our guarantee. Our historical losses and related recoveries pursuant to these agreements have not been significant.

    Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements | Note 4 

NOTE 4: MORTGAGE LOANS AND LOAN LOSS RESERVES 
  The table below provides details of the loans on our consolidated balance sheets. 

During 3Q 2016 and 3Q 2015, we purchased   $115.7 billion   and   $92.6 billion  , respectively, in UPB of single-family loans and   $1.7 billion   and   $1.4 billion  , respectively, in UPB of multifamily loans that were classified as held-for-investment. During YTD 2016 and YTD 2015, we purchased   $273.9 billion   and   $271.6 billion  , respectively, in UPB of single-family loans and   $3.7 billion   and   $3.2 billion  , respectively, in UPB of multifamily loans that were classified as held-for-investment. 
  Our sales of multifamily loans occur primarily through the issuance of multifamily K Certificates. During 3Q 2016 and 3Q 2015, we sold   $10.2 billion   and   $6.0 billion  , respectively, in UPB of held-for-sale multifamily loans. During YTD 2016 and YTD 2015, we sold   $36.4 billion   and   $21.2 billion  , respectively, in UPB of held-for-sale multifamily loans. See Note 3 for more information on our issuances of K Certificates. 
  As part of our strategy to mitigate losses and reduce our holdings of less liquid assets, we completed sales of   $0.6 billion   in UPB of seriously delinquent single-family loans during both 3Q 2016 and 3Q 2015, and   $2.4 billion   and   $1.9 billion   during YTD 2016 and YTD 2015, respectively. 
  We reclassified   $0.3 billion   and   $2.5 billion   in UPB of seriously delinquent single-family loans from held-for-investment to held-for-sale during 3Q 2016 and 3Q 2015, respectively, and   $3.8 billion   and   $10.6 billion   during YTD 2016 and YTD 2015, respectively. For additional information regarding the fair value of our loans classified as held-for-sale, see Note 13. 
  CREDIT QUALITY   
  The current LTV ratio is one key factor we consider when estimating our loan loss reserves for single-family loans. As current LTV ratios increase, the borrower s equity in the home decreases, which negatively affects the borrower s ability to refinance (outside of HARP) or to sell the property for an amount at or above the balance of the outstanding loan. A second-lien loan also reduces the borrower s equity in the home, and has a similar negative effect on the borrower s ability to refinance or sell the property for an amount at or above the combined balances of the first and second loans. As of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, based on data collected by us at loan delivery,  

Financial Statements 
    Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements | Note 4 

approximately   11%   and   13%  , respectively, of loans in our single-family credit guarantee portfolio had second-lien financing by third parties at origination of the first loan. However, borrowers are free to obtain second-lien financing after origination, and we are not entitled to receive notification when a borrower does so. For further information about concentrations of risk associated with our single-family and multifamily loans, see Note 12. 
  For reporting purposes: 
             
    Loans within the Alt-A category continue to be presented in that category following modification, even though the borrower may have provided full documentation of assets and income to complete the modification; and 
                
    Loans within the option ARM category continue to be presented in that category following modification, even though the modified loan no longer provides for optional payment or adjustable interest-rate provisions. 
      
  The table below presents the recorded investment of single-family held-for-investment loans by current LTV ratios. Our current LTV ratios are estimates based on available data through the end of each respective period presented.

    The majority of our loan modifications result in new terms that include fixed interest rates after modification. As of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, we have categorized UPB of approximately   $34.2 billion   and   $38.3 billion  , respectively, of modified loans as fixed-rate loans (instead of as adjustable rate loans), even though the modified loans have rate adjustment provisions. In these cases, while the terms of the modified loans provide for the interest rate to adjust, such rates and the timing of the adjustment are determined at the time of modification rather than at a subsequent date. 
      
  The following table presents the recorded investment in our multifamily held-for-investment loans, by credit quality indicator based on available data through the end of each period presented. These indicators involve significant management judgment. 

(1) 
    A loan categorized as: "Pass" is current and adequately protected by the current financial strength and debt service capacity of the borrower; "Special mention" has signs of potential financial weakness; "Substandard" has a weakness that jeopardizes the timely full repayment; and "Doubtful" has a weakness that makes collection or liquidation in full highly questionable and improbable based on existing conditions.

The table below summarizes the delinquency rates of loans within our single-family credit guarantee and multifamily mortgage portfolios.   

(1) 
    Serious delinquencies on single-family loans underlying certain REMICs, other securitization products, and other mortgage-related guarantees may be reported on a different schedule due to variances in industry practice. 
              (2) 
    The credit-enhanced categories are not mutually exclusive, as a single loan may be covered by both primary mortgage insurance and other credit protection. 
              (3) 
    Consists of single-family loans covered by financial arrangements (other than primary mortgage insurance) that are designed to reduce our credit risk exposure. See "Credit Protection and Other Forms of Credit Enhancement" for more information. 
              (4) 
    Multifamily delinquency performance is based on UPB of loans that are two monthly payments or more past due or those in the process of foreclosure.  
      
  LOAN LOSS RESERVES  
  The loan loss reserves represent estimates of probable incurred credit losses. We recognize probable incurred losses by recording a charge to the provision for credit losses in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income. The loan loss reserves include: 
              
    Our allowance for loan losses, which pertains to all single-family and multifamily loans classified as held-for-investment on our consolidated balance sheets; and 
                 
    Our reserve for guarantee losses, which pertains to single-family and multifamily loans underlying our K Certificates, other securitization products, and other mortgage-related guarantees. 

Financial Statements 
    Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements | Note 4 

The table below presents our loan loss reserves activity. 

(1) 
    Consists of approximately   $0.1 billion   and   $0.1 billion   during 3Q 2016 and 3Q 2015, respectively, and   $0.3 billion   and   $0.4 billion   during YTD 2016 and YTD 2015, respectively, attributable to capitalization of past due interest on modified loans. Also includes amounts associated with reclassified single-family reserves related to our removal of loans previously held by consolidated trusts, net of reclassifications for single-family loans subsequently resecuritized after such removal. 
      
  The allowance for loan losses associated with our held-for-investment unsecuritized loans represented approximately   9.7%   and   10.8%   of the recorded investment in such loans at   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, respectively, and a substantial portion of the allowance associated with these loans represented interest rate concessions provided to borrowers as part of loan modifications. The allowance for loan losses associated with loans held by our consolidated trusts represented approximately   0.2%   of the recorded investment in such loans as of both   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015.

The table below presents the volume of single-family and multifamily loans that were newly classified as TDRs, based on the original category of the loan before the loan was classified as a TDR. Loans classified as a TDR in one period may be subject to further action (such as a modification or remodification) in a subsequent period. In such cases, the subsequent action would not be reflected in the table below since the loan would already have been classified as a TDR.   

The table below presents the volume of our TDR modifications that experienced payment defaults (i.e., loans that became two months delinquent or completed a loss event) during the applicable periods and had completed a modification during the year preceding the payment default. The table presents loans based on their original product category before modification.   

In addition to modifications, loans may be initially classified as TDRs as a result of other loss mitigation activities (i.e., repayment plans, forbearance agreements, or loans in modification trial periods). During YTD 2016 and YTD 2015,   6,352   and   7,280  , respectively, of such loans (with a post-TDR recorded investment of   $0.8 billion   and   $0.9 billion  , respectively) experienced a payment default within a year after the loss mitigation activity occurred. 
  Loans may also be initially classified as TDRs because the borrowers  debts were discharged in Chapter 7 bankruptcy (and the loan was not already classified as a TDR for other reasons). During YTD 2016 and YTD 2015,   920   and   1,821  , respectively, of such loans (with a post-TDR recorded investment of   $0.1

    Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements | Note 4 

billion   and   $0.2 billion  , respectively) experienced a payment default within a year after the borrowers' Chapter 7 bankruptcy. 
  Single-Family TDRs 
  During 3Q16 and YTD 2016, approximately   43%   and   42%   of the single-family loan modifications completed during the respective periods that were classified as TDRs involved interest rate reductions and, in certain cases, term extensions. During 3Q16 and YTD 2016, approximately   15%   and   16%   of the single-family loan modifications completed during the respective periods that were classified as TDRs involved principal forbearance in addition to interest rate reductions and, in certain cases, term extensions. During 3Q 2016 and YTD 2016, the average term extension was   177   months and   178   months, respectively, and the average interest rate reduction was   0.8%   in both periods on completed single-family loan modifications classified as TDRs.

CREDIT PROTECTION AND OTHER FORMS OF CREDIT ENHANCEMENT  
  In connection with many of our single-family loans and other mortgage-related guarantees, we have various forms of credit protection.  
   
  The table below presents the UPB of single-family loans on our consolidated balance sheets or underlying certain of our financial guarantees with credit protection and the maximum amounts of potential loss recovery by type of credit protection. 

(1) 
    Except for the majority of our single-family credit risk transfer ("CRT") transactions, our credit enhancements generally provide protection for the first, or initial, credit losses associated with the related loans. Excludes: (a) FHA/VA and other governmental loans; (b) credit protection associated with   $7.2 billion   and   $8.3 billion   in UPB of single-family loans underlying other securitization products as of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, respectively, as the information was not available; and (c) repurchase rights (subject to certain conditions and limitations) we have under representations and warranties provided by our agreements with seller/servicers to underwrite loans and service them in accordance with our standards. The UPB of single-family loans covered by insurance or partial guarantees issued by federal agencies (such as FHA, VA and USDA) was   $2.9 billion   and   $3.2 billion   as of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, respectively. 
              (2) 
    Except for subordination, this represents the remaining amount of loss recovery that is available subject to terms of counterparty agreements. For subordination, this represents the UPB of the securities that are subordinate to our guarantee, which could provide protection by absorbing first losses. 
              (3) 
    Excludes   $120.6 billion   and   $87.4 billion   in UPB at   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, respectively, where the related loans are also covered by primary mortgage insurance. Maximum coverage amounts presented represent the outstanding balance of STACR debt notes held by third parties as well as the remaining aggregate limit of insurance purchased from third parties in ACIS transactions.  

Financial Statements 
    Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements | Note 4 

Primary mortgage insurance and credit risk transfer transactions are the most prevalent types of credit enhancement protecting our single-family credit guarantee portfolio. For information about counterparty risk associated with mortgage insurers, see Note 12.  
  Our credit risk transfer transactions provide credit enhancement by transferring a portion of our expected credit losses to third-party investors, insurers, and selected sellers. The value of these transactions to us is dependent on various economic scenarios, and we will primarily benefit from these transactions if we experience significant mortgage loan defaults. 
   
  NON-CASH INVESTING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES  
  During YTD 2016 and YTD 2015, we acquired   $165.3 billion   and   $189.0 billion  , respectively, of loans held-for-investment in exchange for the issuance of debt securities of consolidated trusts in guarantor swap transactions. The guarantor swap transactions during YTD 2016 and YTD 2015 included approximately   $20.0 billion   and   $7.6 billion  , respectively, of loans received from sellers to satisfy advances that were recorded in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets. 
  In addition, we acquired REO properties as a result of the derecognition of loans held on our consolidated balance sheets upon foreclosure of the underlying collateral or by deed in lieu of foreclosure. These acquisitions represent non-cash transfers. During YTD 2016 and YTD 2015, we had transfers of   $1.1 billion  , and   $1.6 billion  , respectively, from loans to REO.

NOTE 7: DERIVATIVES 
  At   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, we did   not   have any derivatives in hedge accounting relationships; however, there are amounts recorded in AOCI related to discontinued cash flow hedges which are recognized in earnings when the originally forecasted transactions affect earnings. Amounts reclassified from AOCI linked to interest payments on other debt are recorded in other debt interest expense and amounts not linked to interest payments on other debt are recorded in expense related to derivatives. During YTD 2016 and YTD 2015, we reclassified from AOCI into earnings, pre-tax losses of   $147 million   and   $177 million  , respectively, related to closed cash flow hedges. See Note 9 for information about future reclassifications of deferred net losses related to closed cash flow hedges to net income. 
  USE OF DERIVATIVES  
  We use derivatives primarily to hedge interest-rate sensitivity mismatches between our financial assets and liabilities. We analyze the interest-rate sensitivity of financial assets and liabilities on a daily basis across a variety of interest-rate scenarios based on market prices, models and economics. When we use derivatives to mitigate our exposures, we consider a number of factors, including cost, exposure to counterparty risk, and our overall risk management strategy. 
  We classify derivatives into   three   categories:  
             
    Exchange-traded derivatives;  
                
    Cleared derivatives; and  
                
    OTC derivatives. 
     Exchange-traded derivatives include standardized interest-rate futures contracts and options on futures contracts. Cleared derivatives refer to those interest-rate swaps that the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission has determined are subject to the central clearing requirement of the Dodd-Frank Act. OTC derivatives refer to those derivatives that are neither exchange-traded derivatives nor cleared derivatives. 
  TYPES OF DERIVATIVES   We principally use the following types of derivatives: 
             
    LIBOR-based interest-rate swaps; 
                
    LIBOR- and Treasury-based options (including swaptions); and 
                
    LIBOR- and Treasury-based exchange-traded futures. 
     In addition to swaps, futures, and purchased options, our derivative positions include written options and swaptions, commitments, and credit derivatives. 
  For a discussion of significant accounting policies related to derivatives, see Note 8 in our 2015 Annual Report.

NOTE 8: COLLATERALIZED AGREEMENTS AND OFFSETTING ARRANGEMENTS 
  DERIVATIVE PORTFOLIO   Derivative Counterparties  
  Our use of cleared derivatives, exchange-traded derivatives, and OTC derivatives exposes us to institutional credit risk. For additional information, see Note 9 in our 2015 Annual Report. 
  Our use of interest-rate swaps and option-based derivatives is subject to internal credit and legal reviews. On an ongoing basis, we review the credit fundamentals of all of our derivative counterparties, clearinghouses, and clearing members to confirm that they continue to meet our internal risk management standards. 
  Master Netting and Collateral Agreements  
  We use master netting and collateral agreements to reduce our credit risk exposure to our derivative counterparties for interest-rate swap and option-based derivatives. At   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, all amounts of cash collateral related to derivatives with master netting and collateral agreements were offset against derivative assets, net or derivative liabilities, net, as applicable. 
  In the event that all of our counterparties for OTC interest-rate swaps and option-based derivatives were to have defaulted simultaneously on   September 30, 2016  , our maximum loss for accounting purposes after applying netting agreements and collateral on an individual counterparty basis would have been approximately   $155 million  . A significant majority of our net uncollateralized exposure to OTC derivative counterparties is concentrated among   three   counterparties, all of which were investment grade as of   September 30, 2016  . 
  Exposure to Certain Counterparties  
  The total exposure on our forward purchase and sale commitments, which are treated as derivatives, 
  was   $94 million   and   $34 million   at   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, respectively. Many of our transactions involving forward purchase and sale commitments of mortgage-related securities, including our dollar roll transactions, utilize the Mortgage Backed Securities Division of the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation ( MBSD/FICC ) as a clearinghouse. As a clearing member of the clearinghouse, we post margin to the MBSD/FICC and are exposed to the institutional credit risk of the organization (including its clearing members).

  At   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, we had   $0.9 billion   and   $0.3 billion  , respectively, of collateral in the form of securities pledged to and held by us related to OTC derivative instruments. Although it is our practice not to repledge assets held as collateral, a portion of the collateral may be repledged based on master netting agreements related to our derivative instruments. 
  Also, at   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, we had   $8.2 billion   and   $0.7 billion  , respectively, of securities pledged to us for transactions involving securities purchased under agreements to resell that we had the right to repledge. From time to time we may obtain pledges of collateral from certain seller/servicers as additional security for certain of their obligations to us, including their obligations to repurchase loans sold to us in breach of representations and warranties. This collateral may, at our discretion, take the form of cash, cash equivalents, or agency securities. 
  Collateral Pledged by Freddie Mac  
  The aggregate fair value of all OTC derivative instruments netted by counterparty that contain credit-risk related contingent features that were in a liability position on   September 30, 2016  , was   $2.5 billion   for which we posted cash and non-cash collateral of   $2.5 billion   in the normal course of business. A reduction in our credit ratings may trigger additional collateral requirements related to our OTC derivative instruments. If a reduction in our credit ratings had triggered additional collateral requirements related to our OTC derivative instruments on   September 30, 2016  , we would have been required to post an additional   $61 million   of collateral to our counterparties. A reduction in our credit ratings could also cause the clearinghouses or clearing members we use for our cleared and exchange-traded derivatives to demand additional collateral.

Reclassifications from AOCI to Net Income  
  The table below presents reclassifications from AOCI to net income, including the affected line item in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income. 

Future Reclassifications from AOCI to Net Income Related to Closed Cash Flow Hedges  
  The total AOCI related to derivatives designated as cash flow hedges was a loss of   $0.5 billion   and   $0.7 billion   at   September 30, 2016   and September 30, 2015, respectively, composed of deferred net losses on closed cash flow hedges. Closed cash flow hedges involve derivatives that have been terminated or are no longer designated as cash flow hedges. Fluctuations in prevailing market interest rates have no effect on the deferred portion of AOCI relating to losses on closed cash flow hedges. 
  The previously deferred amount related to closed cash flow hedges remains in our AOCI balance and will be recognized into earnings over the expected time period for which the forecasted transactions affect earnings, unless it is deemed probable that the forecasted transactions will not occur. Over the next 12 months, we estimate that approximately   $127 million  , net of taxes, of the   $0.5 billion   of cash flow hedge losses in AOCI at   September 30, 2016   will be reclassified into earnings. The maximum remaining length of time over which we have hedged the exposure related to the variability in future cash flows on forecasted transactions, primarily forecasted debt issuances, is   17   years.

SENIOR PREFERRED STOCK  
  At   September 30, 2016  , our assets exceeded our liabilities under GAAP; therefore,   no   draw is being requested from Treasury under the Purchase Agreement. Based on our Net Worth Amount at   September 30, 2016   and the Capital Reserve Amount of   $1.2 billion   in 2016, our dividend obligation to Treasury in December 2016 will be   $2.3 billion  . See Note 2 for additional information. The aggregate liquidation preference on the senior preferred stock owned by Treasury was   $72.3 billion   as of both   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015. 
   
  STOCK ISSUANCES AND REPURCHASES  
  We did not repurchase or issue any of our common shares or non-cumulative preferred stock during 3Q 2016 and YTD 2016, except for issuances of treasury stock relating to stock-based compensation granted prior to conservatorship. 
  EARNINGS PER SHARE  
  We have participating securities related to options and restricted stock units with dividend equivalent rights that receive dividends as declared on an equal basis with common shares but are not obligated to participate in undistributed net losses. These participating securities consist of:  
             
    Vested options to purchase common stock; and  
                
    Vested restricted stock units that earn dividend equivalents at the same rate when and as declared on common stock.  
     Consequently, in accordance with accounting guidance, we use the  two-class  method of computing earnings per common share. The  two-class  method is an earnings allocation formula that determines earnings per share for common stock and participating securities based on dividends declared and participation rights in undistributed earnings. 
  Basic earnings per common share is computed as net income attributable to common stockholders divided by the weighted average common shares outstanding for the period. The weighted average common shares outstanding for the period includes the weighted average number of shares that are associated with the warrant for our common stock issued to Treasury pursuant to the Purchase Agreement. These shares are included since the warrant is unconditionally exercisable by the holder at a minimal cost.  
  Diluted earnings per common share is computed as net income attributable to common stockholders divided by the weighted average common shares outstanding during the period adjusted for the dilutive effect of common equivalent shares outstanding. For periods with net income attributable to common stockholders, the calculation includes the effect of the following common stock equivalent shares outstanding:  
             
    Weighted average shares related to stock options if the average market price during the period exceeds the exercise price; and 
                
    The weighted-average of restricted stock units.  
     During periods in which a net loss attributable to common stockholders has been incurred, potential common equivalent shares outstanding are not included in the calculation because it would have an

    Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements | Note 9 

antidilutive effect.  
  For purposes of the earnings-per-share calculation, all stock options outstanding at September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 were out of the money and excluded from the computation of dilutive potential common shares during 3Q 2016 and YTD 2016, and 3Q 2015 and YTD 2015, respectively.  
  DIVIDENDS DECLARED  
  No   common dividends were declared during YTD 2016. During 1Q 2016, 2Q 2016, and 3Q 2016, we paid dividends of   $1.7 billion  ,   $0 billion  , and   $0.9 billion  , respectively, in cash on the senior preferred stock at the direction of our Conservator. We did not declare or pay dividends on any other series of Freddie Mac preferred stock outstanding during YTD 2016.

NOTE 10: INCOME TAXES 
   
  INCOME TAX EXPENSE  
  For 3Q 2016 and 3Q 2015, we reported an income tax benefit (expense) of   $(1.0) billion   and   $0.2 billion  , respectively, resulting in effective tax rates of   30.0%   and   29.0%  , respectively. For YTD 2016 and YTD 2015, we reported an income tax expense of   $1.3 billion   and   $2.0 billion  , respectively, resulting in effective tax rates of   30.6%   and   31.9%  , respectively. Our effective tax rate differed from the statutory rate of   35%   in these periods primarily due to our recognition of low income housing tax credits. 
  Deferred Tax Assets, Net  
  We had net deferred tax assets of   $18.7 billion   and   $18.2 billion   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. At   September 30, 2016  , our net deferred tax assets consisted primarily of basis differences related to derivative instruments and deferred fees. 
  Based on all positive and negative evidence available at   September 30, 2016  , we determined that it is more likely than not that our net deferred tax assets will be realized. Therefore, a valuation allowance was not necessary. 
   
  UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS  
  We evaluated all income tax positions and determined that there were   no   uncertain tax positions that required reserves as of   September 30, 2016  .

NOTE 11: SEGMENT REPORTING 
  We have   three     reportable segments, which are based on the type of business activities each performs - Single-family Guarantee, Multifamily, and Investments. The chart below provides a summary of our three reportable segments and the All Other category. For more information, see our 2015 Annual Report. 
                   Segment 
    Description 
    Financial Performance Measurement Basis 
      Single-family Guarantee 
    The Single-family Guarantee segment reflects results from our purchase, securitization, and guarantee of single-family loans and the management of single-family mortgage credit risk. 
    Contribution to GAAP net income (loss) 
      Multifamily 
    The Multifamily segment reflects results from our purchase, securitization, and guarantee of multifamily loans and securities, our investments in those loans and securities, and the management of multifamily mortgage credit risk. 
    Contribution to GAAP comprehensive income (loss) 
      Investments 
    The Investments segment reflects results from managing the company's mortgage-related investments portfolio (excluding Multifamily segment investments, single-family seriously delinquent loans, and the credit risk of single-family performing loans), treasury function, and interest-rate risk.  
    Contribution to GAAP comprehensive income (loss)  
      All Other 
    The All Other category consists of material corporate-level activities that are infrequent in nature and based on decisions outside the control of the management of our reportable segments. 
    N/A 

Segment Earnings  
  We present Segment Earnings by reclassifying certain credit guarantee-related activities and investment-related activities between various line items on our GAAP consolidated statements of comprehensive income and allocating certain revenues and expenses, including certain returns on assets and funding costs, and all administrative expenses to our three reportable segments.  
  We do not consider our assets by segment when evaluating segment performance or allocating resources. We operate our business in the United States and its territories, and accordingly, we generate no revenue from and have no long-lived assets, other than financial instruments, in geographic locations other than the United States and its territories. 
  We evaluate segment performance and allocate resources based on a Segment Earnings approach, subject to the conduct of our business under the direction of the Conservator. See Note 2 for information about the conservatorship.   
  During the first quarter of 2016, we changed how we calculate certain components of our Segment Earnings for our Single-family Guarantee and Investments segments. The purpose of these changes is to simplify Segment Earnings results relative to GAAP results, as well as to reduce operational complexity. Prior period results have been revised to conform to the current period presentation. Changes include: 
             
    The discontinuation of adjustments to net interest income and guarantee fee income which reflected the amortization of cash premiums and discounts on the consolidated Freddie Mac mortgage-related securities we purchased as investments, as well as the amortization of certain guarantee buy-up and buy-down fees and credit delivery fees on mortgage loans we purchased. The discontinuation of the adjustments resulted in an increase to net interest income for the Investments segment of   $205 million   and   $602 million   and a decrease to guarantee fee income for the Single-family Guarantee

segment of   $62 million   and   $202 million   for 3Q 2015 and YTD 2015, respectively, to align with the current presentation. 
             
    Adjustments to record amortization of premiums and discounts on loans that were securitized in other non-interest income. Previously when we securitized loans into PCs, the premiums and discounts on the loans were amortized in net interest income.  We reclassified   $325 million   and   $1.0 billion   of expense from net interest income into other non-interest income (loss) for the Investments segment for 3Q 2015 and YTD 2015, respectively, to align with the current presentation. 
                
    Adjustments to reflect the impacts from the reclassification of mortgage loans from held-for-investment to held-for-sale as other non-interest income. We reclassified   $485 million   and   $2.0 billion   of benefit from (provision) benefit for credit losses and   $177 million   and   $937 million   of expense from other non-interest expense into other non-interest income (loss) for the Single-family Guarantee segment for 3Q 2015 and YTD 2015, respectively, to align with the current presentation. 
     In addition, during the third quarter of 2016, we changed how we calculate certain components of our Segment Earnings for our Single-family Guarantee and Multifamily segments. The purpose of these changes is to better reflect how management evaluates the Single-family Guarantee and Multifamily segments. Prior period results have been revised to conform to the current period presentation. Changes include: 
             
    Adjustments to record amortization of non-cash premiums and discounts on single-family loans in trusts and on consolidated PCs and amortization of discounts on loans purchased with deteriorated credit quality that are on accrual status into other non-interest income (loss).  Previously this activity was included in net interest income. We reclassified   $171 million   and   $254 million   of income from net interest income into other non-interest income (loss) for the Single-family Guarantee segment for 3Q 2015 and YTD 2015, respectively, to align with the current presentation. 
                
    Adjustments to record STACR debt note expense and net float income or expense into other non-interest expense. Previously this activity was included in net interest income. We reclassified   $(118) million   and   $(309) million   of expense from net interest income into other non-interest expense for the Single-family Guarantee segment for 3Q 2015 and YTD 2015, respectively, to align with the current presentation. 
                
    Multifamily segment net interest income previously reflected the internally allocated costs associated with the refinancing of debt related to held-for-investment loans which we securitized. These costs are now reflected in other non-interest income (loss). We reclassified   $122 million   of expense from net interest income into other non-interest income (loss) for the Multifamily segment for both 3Q 2015 and YTD 2015 to align with the current presentation.

  CREDIT PERFORMANCE OF CERTAIN HIGHER RISK SINGLE-FAMILY LOAN CATEGORIES  
  Participants in the mortgage market often characterize single-family loans based upon their overall credit quality at the time of origination, generally considering them to be prime or subprime. Many mortgage market participants classify single-family loans with credit characteristics that range between their prime and subprime categories as Alt-A. Although we discontinued new purchases of loans with lower documentation standards beginning March 1, 2009, we continued to purchase certain amounts of these loans in cases where the loan was either:  
             
    Purchased pursuant to a previously issued other mortgage-related guarantee;  

Financial Statements 
    Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements | Note 12 

Part of our relief refinance initiative; or  
                
    In another refinance loan initiative and the pre-existing loan (including Alt-A loans) was originated under less than full documentation standards.  
     In the event we purchase a refinance loan and the original loan had been previously identified as Alt-A, such refinance loan may no longer be categorized or reported as Alt-A in the table below because the new refinance loan replacing the original loan would not be identified by the seller/servicer as an Alt-A loan. As a result, our reported Alt-A balances may be lower than would otherwise be the case had such refinancing not occurred. 
  Although we do not categorize single-family loans we purchase or guarantee as prime or subprime, we recognize that there are a number of loan types with certain characteristics that indicate a higher degree of credit risk. 
  For example, a borrower s credit score is a useful measure for assessing the credit quality of the borrower. Statistically, borrowers with higher credit scores are more likely to repay or have the ability to refinance than those with lower scores. 
   
  Presented below is a summary of the serious delinquency rates of certain higher-risk categories (based on characteristics of the loan at origination) of loans in our single-family credit guarantee portfolio. The table includes a presentation of each higher-risk category in isolation. A single loan may fall within more than one category (for example, an interest-only loan may also have an original LTV ratio greater than 90%). Loans with a combination of these attributes will have an even higher risk of delinquency than those with an individual attribute.

    Excludes loans underlying certain other securitization products for which data was not available.  
              (2) 
    Includes HARP loans, which we purchase as part of our participation in the MHA Program. 
      
  SELLERS AND SERVICERS  
  We acquire a significant portion of our single-family and multifamily loan purchase volume from several large sellers. The table below summarizes the concentration of single-family and multifamily sellers who provided 10% or more of our purchase volume during YTD 2016. 

Financial Statements 
    Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements | Note 12 

In recent years, there has been a shift in our purchase volume from depository institutions to non-depository and smaller depository financial institutions. Some of these non-depository sellers have grown rapidly in recent years, and we purchase a significant share of our loans from them. Our top three non-depository sellers provided approximately   12%   of our single-family purchase volume during YTD 2016. 
  Significant portions of our single-family and multifamily loans are serviced by several large servicers. The table below summarizes the concentration of single-family and multifamily servicers who serviced 10% or more of our single-family credit guarantee portfolio and our multifamily mortgage portfolio, excluding loans underlying K Certificates as of September 30, 2016. 

In recent years, there has been a shift in our servicing from depository institutions to non-depository servicers. Some of these non-depository servicers have grown rapidly in recent years and now service a large share of our loans. As of both   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, approximately   10%   of our single-family credit guarantee portfolio was serviced by our top three non-depository servicers, on a combined basis.     Several of these non-depository servicers also service a large share of the loans underlying our investments in non-agency mortgage-related securities. We routinely monitor the performance of our largest non-depository servicers. 
  Ocwen Financial Corp. (Ocwen) and its subsidiaries and/or affiliates continue to be the subject of adverse regulatory scrutiny. Although we have taken steps to reduce our exposure to them, Ocwen remains one of

  MORTGAGE INSURERS  
  We have institutional credit risk relating to the potential insolvency of, or non-performance by, mortgage insurers that insure single-family loans we purchase or guarantee. We evaluate the recovery and collectability from mortgage insurers as part of the estimate of our loan loss reserves. See Note 4 for additional information. As of   September 30, 2016  , mortgage insurers provided coverage with maximum loss limits of   $72.8 billion  , for   $283.9 billion   of UPB, in connection with our single-family credit guarantee portfolio. These amounts are based on gross coverage without regard to netting of coverage that may exist to the extent an affected loan is covered under both primary and pool insurance. 
  The table below summarizes the concentration of mortgage insurer counterparties who provided 10% or more of our overall mortgage insurance coverage. On August 15, 2016, American International Group, Inc. announced that it had entered into an agreement to sell 100% of its interest in United Guaranty Corporation to Arch Capital Group Ltd. Completion of this sale will affect the concentrations shown in the table below. As of September 30, 2016, Arch Capital Group, Ltd. provided   3%   of our overall mortgage insurance coverage and was rated BBB+. On October 23, 2016, Genworth Financial, Inc. announced that it had entered into an agreement to be acquired by China Oceanwide Holdings Group Co., Ltd. Genworth Mortgage Insurance Corporation is a subsidiary of Genworth Financial, Inc.

Latest rating available as of September 30, 2016. Represents the lower of S P and Moody s credit ratings stated in terms of the S P equivalent. 
     We received proceeds of   $0.4 billion   and   $0.5 billion   during YTD 2016 and YTD 2015, respectively, from our primary and pool mortgage insurance policies for recovery of losses on our single-family loans. We had outstanding receivables from mortgage insurers of   $0.2 billion   and   $0.3 billion   (excluding deferred payment obligations associated with unpaid claim amounts) as of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, respectively. The balance of these receivables, net of associated reserves, was approximately   $0.1 billion   and   $0.2 billion   at   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, respectively. 
  PMI Mortgage Insurance Co. and Triad Guaranty Insurance Corp. are both under the control of their state regulators and are in run-off. A substantial portion of their claims is recorded by us as deferred payment obligations. As of both   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, we had cumulative unpaid deferred payment obligations of   $0.5 billion   from these insurers. We reserved for all of these unpaid amounts as collectability is uncertain. It is not clear how the regulators of these companies will administer their respective deferred payment plans in the future, nor when or if those obligations will be paid.

CASH AND OTHER INVESTMENT COUNTERPARTIES  
  We are exposed to institutional credit risk relating to the potential insolvency of, or the non-performance by, counterparties relating to cash and other investments (including non-mortgage-related investments and cash equivalents) transactions, including those entered into on behalf of our securitization trusts. Our policies require that the issuer be rated as investment grade at the time the financial instrument is purchased. We base the permitted term and dollar limits for each of these transactions on the counterparty's financial strength in order to further mitigate our risk. 
  Our cash and other investments (including non-mortgage-related investments and cash equivalents) counterparties are primarily major financial institutions, including other GSEs, Treasury, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, and money market funds. As of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, including amounts related to our consolidated VIEs, there were   $78.7 billion   and   $83.8 billion  , respectively, of cash and securities purchased under agreements to resell invested with institutional counterparties, U.S. Treasury securities classified as cash equivalents, or cash deposited with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. As of   September 30, 2016  , all of our securities purchased under agreements to resell were fully collateralized.  
  NON-AGENCY MORTGAGE-RELATED SECURITY ISSUERS  
  We are engaged in various loss mitigation efforts concerning certain investments in non-agency mortgage-related securities, including the efforts described below. 
  In 2011, FHFA, as Conservator for Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, filed lawsuits against a number of corporate families of financial institutions and related defendants alleging securities laws violations and, in some cases, fraud. In March 2015, FHFA s case against Nomura Holding America, Inc. (or Nomura) went to trial in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. In May 2015, the judge ruled against Nomura and co-defendant RBS Securities Inc. and ordered the defendants to pay an aggregate of   $806 million  , of which   $779 million   will be paid to Freddie Mac. The order also provides for Freddie Mac to transfer the mortgage-related securities at issue in this trial to the defendants. The defendants have agreed to pay for certain costs, legal fees and expenses if FHFA ultimately prevails in the litigation. This expense reimbursement payment is subject to various conditions, and is capped at   $33 million   (half of any such payment would be made to Freddie Mac). The defendants have filed a notice of appeal and the Court has stayed enforcement of the judgment during the pendency of the appeal. 
  We worked with an investor consortium to enforce certain claims relating to certain Countrywide non-agency mortgage-related securities. In June 2011, Bank of America Corporation, BAC Home Loans Servicing, LP, Countrywide Financial Corporation and Countrywide Home Loans, Inc. entered into a settlement agreement with The Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee, to resolve certain claims with respect to a number of Countrywide mortgage securitization trusts. In May 2016, after various judicial proceedings, a judge ordered distribution of allocable shares under the settlement agreement to most of the trusts covered by the settlement, including to all of the securities we hold. This benefit, which was received in June 2016, was approximately   $315 million  . We subsequently sold certain of the securities covered by this settlement during 3Q 2016.

    Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements | Note 12 

We also worked with an investor consortium to enforce certain claims relating to certain Citigroup non-agency mortgage-related securities. In April 2014, Citigroup Inc. entered into a settlement agreement with the trustees of the securities covered by the settlement. In December 2015, a New York state court entered a judgment approving the settlement. The order became final in January 2016. The conditions of the settlement have been satisfied. As a result, we expect to receive a benefit for those securitizations that we hold at the time settlement proceeds are distributed to the trust. This benefit, which is expected to be approximately   $26 million  , will be recognized in earnings over the expected remaining life of the securities, unless the securities are sold, at which time the benefit would be considered in the sales price of the securities.  
  We have also been working with an investor consortium that seeks to enforce certain claims with J.P. Morgan Chase   Co. relating to a number of non-agency mortgage-related securities. In November 2013, J.P. Morgan Chase   Co. announced a settlement of these claims. In August 2016, a New York state court entered a judgment approving the settlement. The settlement is subject to certain additional conditions, which have not yet been satisfied. We expect to receive a benefit for those securitizations that we hold at the time settlement proceeds are distributed to the trusts. This benefit, which is expected to be approximately   $78 million  , will be recognized in earnings over the expected remaining life of the securities, unless the securities are sold, at which time the benefit would be considered in the sales price of the securities. 
  The majority of the single-family loans underlying our investments in non-agency mortgage-related securities are serviced by non-depository servicers. As of   September 30, 2016   and December 31, 2015, approximately   $8.8 billion   and   $13.0 billion  , respectively, in UPB of loans underlying our investments in single-family non-agency mortgage-related securities were serviced by subsidiaries and/or affiliates of Ocwen.

NOTE 13: FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURE 
  The accounting guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and sets forth disclosure requirements regarding fair value measurements. This guidance applies whenever other accounting guidance requires or permits assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value. Fair value represents the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value measurement assumes that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either in the principal market for the asset or liability, or, in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability. 
  We use fair value measurements for the initial recording of certain assets and liabilities and periodic remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities on a recurring or non-recurring basis. 
  FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS  
  The accounting guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures establishes a three-level fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs into the valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The levels of the fair value hierarchy are defined as follows in priority order: 
             
    Level 1 - inputs to the valuation techniques are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  
                
    Level 2 - inputs to the valuation techniques are based on observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  
                
    Level 3 - one or more inputs to the valuation technique are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement. 
     We use quoted market prices and valuation techniques that seek to maximize the use of observable inputs, where available, and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Our inputs are based on the assumptions a market participant would use in valuing the asset or liability. Assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety within the fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. 
  VALUATION PROCESSES AND CONTROLS OVER FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS  
  We designed our control processes so that our fair value measurements are appropriate and reliable, that they are based on observable inputs where possible, and that our valuation approaches are consistently applied and the assumptions and inputs are reasonable. Our control processes provide a framework for segregation of duties and oversight of our fair value methodologies, techniques, validation procedures, and results.

    Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements | Note 13 

VALUATION TECHNIQUES   
  HARP Loans 
  For loans that have been refinanced under HARP, we value our guarantee obligation using the guarantee fees currently charged by us under that initiative. HARP loans valued using this technique are classified as Level 2, as the fees charged by us are observable. The majority of our HARP loans are classified as Level 2. If, subsequent to delivery, the refinanced loan no longer qualifies for purchase based on current underwriting standards (such as becoming past due or being modified), the fair value of the guarantee obligation is then measured using our internal credit models or the median of external sources, if the loan s principal market has changed to the whole loan market. HARP loans valued using either of these techniques are classified as Level 3 as significant inputs are unobservable.  
  The total compensation that we receive for the delivery of a HARP loan reflects the pricing that we are willing to offer because HARP is a part of a broader government program intended to provide assistance to homeowners and prevent foreclosures. When HARP ends in September 2017, the beneficial pricing afforded to HARP loans will no longer be reflected in the pricing structure of our guarantee fees. If these benefits were not reflected in the pricing for these loans, the fair value of our loans would have decreased by   $9.0 billion   and   $12.9 billion   as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The total fair value of the loans in our portfolio that reflect the pricing afforded to HARP loans as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   is   $63.2 billion   and   $82.8 billion  , respectively. 
  ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS  
  The following tables present our assets and liabilities measured on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value on a recurring basis subsequent to initial recognition, including instruments where we have elected the fair value option.

ASSETS ON OUR CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON A NON-RECURRING BASIS  
  We may be required, from time to time, to measure certain assets at fair value on a non-recurring basis after our initial recognition. These adjustments usually result from the application of lower-of-cost-or-fair-value accounting or measurement of impairment based on the fair value of the underlying collateral. 
   
  The table below presents assets measured on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value on a non-recurring basis. 

(1) 
    Includes loans that are classified as held-for-investment and have been measured for impairment based on the fair value of the underlying collateral and held-for-sale loans where the fair value is below cost.  
              (2) 
    Represents the fair value of foreclosed properties that were measured at fair value subsequent to their initial classification as REO, net. The carrying amount of REO, net was adjusted to fair value of   $0.5 billion  , less estimated costs to sell of   $33 million   (or approximately   $0.5 billion  ) at   September 30, 2016  . The carrying amount of REO, net was adjusted to fair value of   $1.0 billion  , less estimated costs to sell of   $68 million   (or approximately   $0.9 billion  ) at   December 31, 2015  . 
      
  LEVEL 3 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS  
  The table below presents a reconciliation of all assets and liabilities measured on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3), including transfers into and out of Level 3 assets and liabilities. The table also presents gains and losses due to changes in fair value, including both realized and unrealized gains and losses, recognized in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income for Level 3 assets and liabilities. When assets and liabilities are transferred between levels, we recognize the transfer as of the beginning of the period.

    Transfers out of Level 3 during 3Q 2016 and YTD 2016 consisted primarily of certain mortgage-related securities due to an increased volume and level of activity in the market and availability of price quotes from dealers and third-party pricing services. Certain Freddie Mac securities are classified as Level 3 at issuance and generally are classified as Level 2 when they begin trading. Transfers into Level 3 during 3Q 2016 and YTD 2016 consisted primarily of certain mortgage-related securities due to a lack of market activity and relevant price quotes from dealers and third-party pricing services.

Changes in Fair Value under the Fair Value Option Election  
  We recorded gains of   $118 million   and   $164 million   for 3Q 2016 and 3Q 2015, respectively, and   $697 million   and   $262 million   for YTD 2016 and YTD 2015, respectively, from the change in fair value on multifamily held-for-sale loans recorded at fair value in other income in our condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income. 
  We recorded gains of   $391 million   and   $635 million   for 3Q 2016 and YTD 2016 respectively, from the change in fair value of multifamily held-for-sale loan purchase commitments recorded at fair value in other income in our condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income. We elected the fair value option for these commitments in 2016. 
  Gains (losses) on debt securities with the fair value option elected were   $(174) million   and   $80 million   for 3Q 2016 and 3Q 2015, respectively, and   $(268) million   and   $(65) million   for YTD 2016 and YTD 2015, respectively, and were recorded in other income in our condensed consolidated statements of comprehensive income. 
  Changes in fair value attributable to instrument-specific credit risk were not material for 3Q 2016 and YTD 2016 and for 3Q 2015 and YTD 2015 for any assets or liabilities for which we elected the fair value option.

NOTE 14: LEGAL CONTINGENCIES 
  We are involved as a party in a variety of legal and regulatory proceedings arising from time to time in the ordinary course of business including, among other things, contractual disputes, personal injury claims, employment-related litigation and other legal proceedings incidental to our business. We are frequently involved, directly or indirectly, in litigation involving mortgage foreclosures. From time to time, we are also involved in proceedings arising from our termination of a seller/servicer s eligibility to sell loans to, and/or service loans for, us. In these cases, the former seller/servicer sometimes seeks damages against us for wrongful termination under a variety of legal theories. In addition, we are sometimes sued in connection with the origination or servicing of loans. These suits typically involve claims alleging wrongful actions of seller/servicers. Our contracts with our seller/servicers generally provide for indemnification of Freddie Mac against liability arising from seller/servicers' wrongful actions with respect to loans sold to or serviced for Freddie Mac. 
  Litigation and claims resolution are subject to many uncertainties and are not susceptible to accurate prediction. In accordance with the accounting guidance for contingencies, we reserve for litigation claims and assessments asserted or threatened against us when a loss is probable (as defined in such guidance) and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. 
  PUTATIVE SECURITIES CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT: OHIO PUBLIC EMPLOYEES RETIREMENT SYSTEM VS. FREDDIE MAC, SYRON, ET AL. 
  
  This putative securities class action lawsuit was filed against Freddie Mac and certain former officers on January 18, 2008 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio purportedly on behalf of a class of purchasers of Freddie Mac stock from August 1, 2006 through November 20, 2007. FHFA later intervened as Conservator, and the plaintiff amended its complaint on several occasions. The plaintiff alleged, among other things, that the defendants violated federal securities laws by making false and misleading statements concerning our business, risk management, and the procedures we put into place to protect the company from problems in the mortgage industry. The plaintiff seeks unspecified damages and interest, and reasonable costs and expenses, including attorney and expert fees. 
  In October 2013, defendants filed motions to dismiss the complaint. In October 2014, the District Court granted defendants  motions and dismissed the case in its entirety against all defendants, with prejudice. In November 2014, plaintiff filed a notice of appeal in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. On July 20, 2016, the Court of Appeals reversed the District Court s dismissal and remanded the case to the District Court for further proceedings. 
  At present, it is not possible for us to predict the probable outcome of this lawsuit or any potential effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity, or results of operations. In addition, we are unable to reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of possible loss in the event of an adverse judgment in the foregoing matter due to the following factors, among others: the inherent uncertainty of pre-trial litigation and the fact that the District Court has not yet ruled upon motions for class certification or summary judgment. In particular, absent the certification of a class, the identification of a class period, and the identification of the alleged statement or statements that survive dispositive motions, we cannot reasonably estimate any possible loss or range of possible loss.

LITIGATION RELATED TO THE TAYLOR, BEAN   WHITAKER (TBW) BANKRUPTCY  
  In August 2009, TBW, which had been one of our single-family seller/servicers, filed for bankruptcy in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Middle District of Florida. We entered into a settlement with TBW and the TBW creditors' committee regarding the TBW bankruptcy in 2011. However, we continue to be involved in litigation with other parties relating to the TBW bankruptcy, as described below. 
  On or about May 14, 2010, certain underwriters at Lloyds, London and London Market Insurance Companies brought an adversary proceeding in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Middle District of Florida against TBW, Freddie Mac and other parties seeking a declaration rescinding   $90 million   of mortgage bankers bonds providing fidelity and errors and omissions insurance coverage. Several excess insurers on the bonds thereafter filed similar claims in that action. Freddie Mac filed a proof of loss under the bonds. In March 2016, a settlement agreement among the parties was submitted to the Court for approval. On April 25, 2016, the Court approved the settlement. On May 6, 2016, Sovereign Bank, which was not a party to the settlement agreement, appealed the order approving the settlement agreement and various other prior Bankruptcy Court orders to the U.S. District Court. Sovereign's appeal and related motions are pending. 
  LIBOR LAWSUIT 
  
  On March 14, 2013, Freddie Mac filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia against the British Bankers Association and the   16   U.S. Dollar LIBOR panel banks and a number of their affiliates. The case was subsequently transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The complaint alleges, among other things, that the defendants fraudulently and collusively depressed LIBOR, a benchmark interest rate indexed to trillions of dollars of financial products, and asserts claims for antitrust violations, breach of contract, tortious interference with contract and fraud. Freddie Mac filed an amended complaint in July 2013, and a second amended complaint in October 2014. In August 2015, the District Court dismissed the portion of our claim related to antitrust violations and fraud and we filed a motion for reconsideration. On March 31, 2016, the District Court granted a portion of our motion, finding personal jurisdiction over certain defendants, and denied the portion of our motion with respect to statutes of limitation for our fraud claims. Subsequently, in a related case, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the District Court s dismissal of certain plaintiffs  antitrust claims and remanded the case to the District Court for consideration of whether, among other things, the plaintiffs are  efficient enforcers  of the antitrust laws. Briefing on these issues is complete. 
  LITIGATION CONCERNING THE PURCHASE AGREEMENT  
  Since July 2013, a number of lawsuits have been filed against us concerning the August 2012 amendment to the Purchase Agreement, which created the net worth sweep dividend provisions of the senior preferred stock. The plaintiffs in the lawsuits allege that they are holders of common stock and/or junior preferred stock issued by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. (For purposes of this discussion, junior preferred stock refers to the various series of preferred stock of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae other than the senior preferred stock issued to Treasury.) It is possible that similar lawsuits will be filed in the future. The lawsuits against us are described below.

Litigation in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia  
  In re Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac Senior Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement Class Action Litigations  . This case is the result of the consolidation of three putative class action lawsuits:   Cacciapelle and Bareiss vs. Federal National Mortgage Association, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation and FHFA  , filed on July 29, 2013;   American European Insurance Company vs. Federal National Mortgage Association, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation and FHFA  , filed on July 30, 2013; and   Marneu Holdings, Co. vs. FHFA, Treasury, Federal National Mortgage Association and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation  , filed on September 18, 2013. (The Marneu     case was also filed as a shareholder derivative lawsuit.) A consolidated amended complaint was filed in December 2013. In the consolidated amended complaint, plaintiffs allege, among other items, that the August 2012 amendment to the Purchase Agreement breached Freddie Mac's and Fannie Mae's respective contracts with the holders of junior preferred stock and common stock and the covenant of good faith and fair dealing inherent in such contracts. Plaintiffs sought unspecified damages, equitable and injunctive relief, and costs and expenses, including attorney and expert fees.   
  The Cacciapelle and American European Insurance Company lawsuits were filed purportedly on behalf of a class of purchasers of junior preferred stock issued by Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae who held stock prior to, and as of, August 17, 2012. The Marneu lawsuit was filed purportedly on behalf of a class of purchasers of junior preferred stock and purchasers of common stock issued by Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae over a not-yet-defined period of time.  
  Arrowood Indemnity Company vs. Federal National Mortgage Association, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, FHFA and Treasury  . This case was filed on September 20, 2013. The allegations and demands made by plaintiffs in this case were generally similar to those made by the plaintiffs in the In re Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac Senior Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement Class Action Litigations case described above. Plaintiffs in the Arrowood lawsuit also requested that, if injunctive relief were not granted, the Arrowood plaintiffs be awarded damages against the defendants in an amount to be determined including, but not limited to, the aggregate par value of their junior preferred stock, the total of which they stated to be approximately   $42 million  .  
  American European Insurance Company, Cacciapalle and Miller vs. Treasury and FHFA  . This case was filed as a shareholder derivative lawsuit, purportedly on behalf of Freddie Mac as a  nominal  defendant, on July 30, 2014. The complaint alleged that, through the August 2012 amendment to the Purchase Agreement, Treasury and FHFA breached their respective fiduciary duties to Freddie Mac, causing Freddie Mac to suffer damages. The plaintiffs asked that Freddie Mac be awarded compensatory damages and disgorgement, as well as attorneys  fees, costs and other expenses.  
  FHFA, joined by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, moved to dismiss the   In re Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac Senior Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement Class Action Litigations   case and the other related cases in January 2014. Treasury filed a motion to dismiss the same day. In September 2014, the District Court granted the motions and dismissed the plaintiffs  claims. In October 2014, plaintiffs in the   In re Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac Senior Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement Class Action Litigations   case filed a notice of appeal of the District Court s decision. The scope of this appeal includes the American European Insurance Company shareholder derivative lawsuit. In October 2014, Arrowood filed a notice of appeal of the District Court s decision. Defendants have opposed the appeals.

Litigation in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims  
  Reid and Fisher vs. the United States of America and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation.   This case was filed as a derivative lawsuit, purportedly on behalf of Freddie Mac as a  nominal  defendant, on February 26, 2014. The complaint alleges, among other items, that the net worth sweep dividend provisions of the senior preferred stock constitute an unlawful taking of private property for public use without just compensation. The plaintiffs ask that Freddie Mac be awarded just compensation for the U.S. government s alleged taking of its property, attorneys  fees, costs and other expenses. 
  Rafter, Rattien and Pershing Square Capital Management vs. the United States of America et al.   This case was filed as a shareholder derivative lawsuit, purportedly on behalf of Freddie Mac as a  nominal  defendant, on August 14, 2014. The complaint alleges that the net worth sweep dividend provisions of the senior preferred stock constitute an unlawful taking of private property for public use without just compensation, and the U.S government breached an implied-in-fact contract with Freddie Mac. In September 2015, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, which contains one claim involving Freddie Mac. The amended complaint alleges that Freddie Mac s charter is a contract with its common stockholders, and that, through the August 2012 amendment to the Purchase Agreement, the U.S. government breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing inherent in such contract. Plaintiffs ask that they be awarded damages or other appropriate relief for the alleged breach of contract as well as attorneys  fees, costs and expenses  . 
  Litigation in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware  
  Jacobs and Hindes vs. FHFA and Treasury.   This case was filed on August 17, 2015 as a putative class action lawsuit purportedly on behalf of a class of holders of preferred stock or common stock issued by Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae. The case was also filed as a shareholder derivative lawsuit, purportedly on behalf of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae as  nominal  defendants. The complaint alleges, among other items, that the August 2012 amendment to the Purchase Agreement violated applicable state law and constituted a breach of contract, as well as a breach of covenants of good faith and fair dealing. Plaintiffs seek equitable and injunctive relief (including restitution of the monies paid by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae to Treasury under the net worth sweep dividend), compensatory damages, attorneys  fees, costs and expenses. The case was stayed pending resolution of FHFA's motion to the U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation to transfer this case to the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. This motion was denied on June 2, 2016, and the stay was lifted on July 13, 2016. Plaintiffs filed an application for certification of a question to the Delaware and Virginia Supreme Courts, which was denied on September 12, 2016. On September 7, 2016, plaintiffs filed a motion to amend the complaint, which Treasury opposed in part. 
  Litigation in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia  
  Pagliara vs. Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation  . This case was filed on March 14, 2016 in the Circuit Court of Fairfax County, Virginia, and subsequently removed to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. The plaintiff seeks an order to permit inspection and copying of corporate records under Virginia law, primarily for the purpose of investigating potential claims arising from the net worth sweep. The case was stayed pending resolution of FHFA's request to the U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation to transfer this case to the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, which was denied on June 2, 2016. On June 17, 2016, Freddie Mac and FHFA filed a motion to dismiss or, in the

alternative, substitute FHFA as plaintiff in the case. On August 23, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia dismissed the case. The plaintiff filed a notice of appeal on September 21, 2016. 
  At present, it is not possible for us to predict the probable outcome of the lawsuits discussed above in the U.S. District Courts and the U.S. Court of Federal Claims (including the outcome of any appeal) or any potential effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity, or results of operations. In addition, we are unable to reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of possible loss in the event of an adverse judgment in the foregoing matters due to a number of factors, including the inherent uncertainty of pre-trial litigation. In addition, with respect to the In re Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac Senior Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement Class Action Litigations case, the plaintiffs have not demanded a stated amount of damages they believe are due, and the Court has not certified a class. 
  Stockholder Letters 
  
  We received a letter dated January 19, 2016 addressed to the Board of Directors, purportedly on behalf of a holder of stock of Freddie Mac. The letter urged the members of the Board to take various steps under Virginia law including, among others, causing Freddie Mac to immediately stop paying dividends to Treasury on account of the senior preferred stock. On January 28, 2016, FHFA (as Conservator) informed the purported stockholder s representative that the state law principles asserted in the letter are not applicable to the Board. 
  We also received a letter dated March 1, 2016 addressed to the Board of Directors from a purported holder of preferred stock of Freddie Mac. In the letter, the purported stockholder states that he intends to file suit against the Board and the company for alleged breaches of contract and fiduciary duty in the event the Board does not take unspecified steps  with respect to payment of dividends and other matters  involving the company and its preferred shareholders. On March 10, 2016, FHFA (as Conservator) informed the purported stockholder that the state law principles asserted in the letter are not applicable to the Board. On about April 19, 2016, the purported stockholder sent a second letter in which he reiterated his intent to file suit and attached a proposed class action complaint naming the company and the Board as defendants. The proposed complaint asserts claims for breach of contract, breach of implied covenants of good faith and fair dealing, and breach of fiduciary duties and seeks   $14.1 billion   in compensatory damages.

For information on these lawsuits, see the  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  sections in our 2015 Annual Report and in our Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2016. One of the cases was filed in the US. District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky. On September 9, 2016, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky entered an order dismissing the case in that Court. In addition, on October 20, 2016, a lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas against FHFA, the Director of FHFA, Treasury and the Secretary of the Treasury. This new lawsuit seeks to invalidate the net worth sweep dividend provisions of the senior preferred stock, and is generally similar to the other lawsuits. Freddie Mac is not a party to any of these lawsuits. 
   
  RISK FACTORS 
  This Form 10-Q should be read together with the  Risk Factors  sections in our 2015 Annual Report and our Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2016, which describe various risks and uncertainties to which we are or may become subject. These risks and uncertainties could, directly or indirectly, adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, strategies, and/or prospects. 

Other Information 

UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 
  RECENT SALES OF UNREGISTERED SECURITIES 
  The securities we issue are  exempted securities  under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. As a result, we do not file registration statements with the SEC with respect to offerings of our securities. 
  Following our entry into conservatorship, we suspended the operation of, and ceased making grants under, equity compensation plans. Previously, we had provided equity compensation under those plans to employees and members of the Board of Directors. Under the Purchase Agreement, we cannot issue any new options, rights to purchase, participations, or other equity interests without Treasury s prior approval. However, grants outstanding as of the date of the Purchase Agreement remain in effect in accordance with their terms. 
  No stock options were exercised during 3Q 2016. See Note 10 in our 2015 Annual Report for more information. 
  DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS 
  Our payment of dividends on Freddie Mac common stock or any series of Freddie Mac preferred stock (other than senior preferred stock) is subject to certain restrictions as described in  MARKET FOR REGISTRANT S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES - Dividends and Dividend Restrictions  in our 2015 Annual Report. 
  INFORMATION ABOUT CERTAIN SECURITIES ISSUANCES BY FREDDIE MAC 
  Pursuant to SEC regulations, public companies are required to disclose certain information when they incur a material direct financial obligation or become directly or contingently liable for a material obligation under an off-balance sheet arrangement. The disclosure must be made in a current report on Form 8-K under Item 2.03 or, if the obligation is incurred in connection with certain types of securities offerings, in prospectuses for that offering that are filed with the SEC. 
  Freddie Mac s securities offerings are exempted from SEC registration requirements. As a result, we do not file registration statements or prospectuses with the SEC with respect to our securities offerings. To comply with the disclosure requirements of Form 8-K relating to the incurrence of material financial obligations, we report these types of obligations either in offering circulars or supplements thereto that we post on our web site or in a current report on Form 8-K, in accordance with a  no-action  letter we received from the SEC staff. In cases where the information is disclosed in an offering circular posted on our web site, the document will be posted within the same time period that a prospectus for a non-exempt securities offering would be required to be filed with the SEC. 
  The web site address for disclosure about our debt securities, other than debt securities of consolidated trusts, is www.freddiemac.com/debt. From this address, investors can access the offering circular and related supplements for debt securities offerings under Freddie Mac s global debt facility, including pricing  

Other Information 

supplements for individual issuances of debt securities. Similar information about our STACR debt notes and Whole Loan Securities is available at www.freddiemac.com/creditriskofferings. 
  Disclosure about the mortgage-related securities we issue, some of which are off-balance sheet obligations (e.g., K Certificates), can be found at www.freddiemac.com/mbs. From this address, investors can access information and documents about our mortgage-related securities, including offering circulars and related offering circular supplements.

Controls and Procedures 

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
  EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
  Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that the information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management of the company, including the company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing our disclosure controls and procedures, we recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and we must apply judgment in implementing possible controls and procedures. 
  Management, including the company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of   September 30, 2016  . As a result of management s evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of   September 30, 2016  , at a reasonable level of assurance, because we have not been able to update our disclosure controls and procedures to provide reasonable assurance that information known by FHFA on an ongoing basis is communicated from FHFA to Freddie Mac s management in a manner that allows for timely decisions regarding our required disclosure under the federal securities laws. We consider this situation to be a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting.  
  CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING DURING 3Q 2016 
  We evaluated the changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during 3Q 2016 and concluded that there were no changes that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

Controls and Procedures 

MITIGATING ACTIONS RELATED TO THE MATERIAL WEAKNESS IN INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING 
  As described above under  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures,  we have one material weakness in internal control over financial reporting as of   September 30, 2016   that we have not remediated. 
  Based on discussions with FHFA and given the structural nature of this material weakness, we believe it is likely that we will not remediate it while we are under conservatorship. However, both we and FHFA have continued to engage in activities and employ procedures and practices intended to permit accumulation and communication to management of information needed to meet our disclosure obligations under the federal securities laws. These include the following: 
             
    FHFA has established the Division of Conservatorship, which is intended to facilitate operation of the company with the oversight of the Conservator. 
                
    We provide drafts of our SEC filings to FHFA personnel for their review and comment prior to filing. We also provide drafts of external press releases, statements and speeches to FHFA personnel for their review and comment prior to release. 
                
    FHFA personnel, including senior officials, review our SEC filings prior to filing, including this Form 10-Q, and engage in discussions with us regarding issues associated with the information contained in those filings. Prior to filing this Form 10-Q, FHFA provided us with a written acknowledgment that it had reviewed the Form 10-Q, was not aware of any material misstatements or omissions in the Form 10-Q, and had no objection to our filing the Form 10-Q. 
                
    The Director of FHFA is in frequent communication with our Chief Executive Officer, typically meeting (in person or by phone) on at least a bi-weekly basis. 
                
    FHFA representatives attend meetings frequently with various groups within the company to enhance the flow of information and to provide oversight on a variety of matters, including accounting, credit and capital markets management, external communications, and legal matters. 
                
    Senior officials within FHFA s accounting group meet frequently with our senior financial executives regarding our accounting policies, practices, and procedures. 
     In view of our mitigating actions related to this material weakness, we believe that our condensed consolidated financial statements for 3Q 2016 have been prepared in conformity with GAAP.

Exhibit 12.1 
  RATIO OF EARNINGS TO FIXED CHARGES AND 
  RATIO OF EARNINGS TO COMBINED FIXED CHARGES AND PREFERRED STOCK DIVIDENDS 

(1) 
    Senior preferred stock and preferred stock dividends represent pre-tax earnings required to cover any senior preferred stock and preferred stock dividend requirements computed using our effective tax rate, whenever there is an income tax provision, for the relevant periods. 
              (2) 
    Ratio of earnings to fixed charges is computed by dividing earnings, as adjusted by total fixed charges. For the ratio to equal 1.00, earnings, as adjusted must increase by $5.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011. 
              (3) 
    Ratio of earnings to combined fixed charges and preferred stock dividends is computed by dividing earnings, as adjusted by total fixed charges including preferred stock dividends. For the ratio to equal 1.00, earnings, as adjusted must increase by $8.6 billion, $22.2 billion, and $12.2 billion for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2011, respectively.
