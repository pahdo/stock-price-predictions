1.    Interim Financial Statements    

The accompanying unaudited
interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial
information and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission for reporting on Form 10-Q. Accordingly,
certain information and footnote disclosure required for complete financial statements are not included herein. It is recommended
that these financial statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes of Psychemedics Corporation
( the Company,   our Company,   our  or  we ) as reported in the Company s
Annual Report on Form 10-K ( 10-K ) for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed on February 26, 2016. In the opinion
of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments) considered necessary for a fair presentation of financial
position, results of operations, and cash flows at the dates and for the periods presented have been included. The results of operations
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 may not be indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending
December 31, 2016, or any other period. 

2.    Cash and Cash Equivalents  

The Company considers
all highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents consisted exclusively
of cash in the bank as of December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2016. 

3.    Stock-Based Compensation    

The Company s
2006 Incentive Plan ( the Plan ) provides for cash based awards or the grant or issuance of stock-based awards including;
options, restricted stock or stock unit awards (SUA s). 

Activity for SUAs under the Plan for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 was as follows: 

1)  The aggregate intrinsic value on these tables was calculated based on the closing market value
of the Company s stock on September 30, 2016 ($19.82).

  NOTES TO CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

  (UNAUDITED)  

3.    Stock-Based Compensation (continued)    

Activity for options under the Plan for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 was as follows: 

(2)  The aggregate intrinsic value on this table was calculated based on the amount, if any, by which
the closing market value of the Company s stock on the September 30, 2016 ($19.82) exceeded the exercise price of the underlying
options, multiplied by the number of shares subject to each option.   

As of September 30, 2016, a total of 541,017 shares of common
stock were reserved for issuance under the 2006 Incentive Plan. As of September 30, 2016, the unamortized fair value of awards
relating to outstanding SUAs and options was $1.1 million, which is expected to be amortized over a weighted average period of
2.8 years. The total number of shares available for grant as of September 30, 2016 was 307,392.

4.    Basic and Diluted Net Income Per Share    

Basic net income per share is computed
by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share
is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common and dilutive common equivalent shares outstanding during
the period. The number of dilutive common equivalent shares outstanding during the period is determined in accordance with the
treasury-stock method. Common equivalent shares consist of common stock issuable upon the exercise of outstanding options and common
stock issuable upon the vesting of outstanding, unvested SUAs. Basic and diluted weighted average common shares outstanding for
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were as follows (in thousands): 

5.    Fair Value Measurements  

The Company has financial
instruments, such as accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued expenses, which are stated at carrying amounts that approximate
fair value because of the short maturity of those instruments. The carrying amount of the Company s long-term debt approximates
fair value as the interest rate on the debt approximates the estimated borrowing rate currently available to the company. 

6.    Subsequent Events  

On October 26, 2016, the Company declared
a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share for a total of $819 thousand, which will be paid on November 17, 2016 to shareholders of
record on November 7, 2016. 

7.    Commitments and Contingencies    

The Company is subject
to legal proceedings and claims which arise in the ordinary course of its business. The Company believes that based upon information
available to the Company at this time, the expected outcome of these matters would not have a material impact on the Company s
results of operations or financial condition.

8.    Debt and Other Financing Arrangements    

On March 20, 2014,
the Company entered into an equipment financing arrangement ( Loan Arrangement ) with Banc of America Leasing  
Capital, LLC, which it amended on September 15, 2015. The terms of this arrangement are detailed in the 10-K. 

On March 23, 2016,
under the Loan Arrangement, the Company executed a note in the amount of $609 thousand, for total borrowings of $8.7 million. The
weighted average interest rate for all notes related to the Loan Arrangement for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 was 2.5%,
and represented $33,904 of interest expense as compared to a rate of 2.2% and interest expense of $30,411 for the comparable period
in 2015. The weighted average interest rate for all notes related to the Loan Arrangement for the nine months ended September 30,
2016 was 2.4%, and represented $104,037 of interest expense as compared to a rate of 2.2% and interest expense of $94,614 for the
comparable period in 2015. As of September 30, 2016, the interest rate was 2.5% and there was $5.2 million of outstanding debt
related to the loan. The Company was in compliance with all loan covenants as of September 30, 2016. 

The annual principal
repayment requirements for debt obligations as of September 30, 2016 were as follows (in 000 s): 

9.    Significant Customers    

The Company had one
customer that exceeded 10% of revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. There were no customers that exceeded
10% of revenue for the same periods in 2015. The Company had one customer that accounted for 29% and 9% of the total accounts receivable
balance as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.

10.    Recent Accounting Pronouncements    

In February 2016,
the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases, which introduces the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those
leases classified as operating leases under previous guidance. The new standard establishes a right-of-use ( ROU ) model
that requires a lessee to record an ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than
12 months. The new standard will become effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 and interim periods within
those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impacts the adoption of this accounting
guidance will have on its financial statements. 

In
March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which simplifies several aspects
of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory
tax withholding requirements, as well as classification of related amounts within the statement of cash flows. The new standard
will become effective beginning with the first quarter of 2017, with early adoption permitted. The Company elected early adoption
of ASU 2016-09 in the second quarter of 2016 which will be applied using a modified retrospective approach.   The
adoption of ASU 2016-09 did not materially impact the Company s financial position, results of operations, equity or cash
flows. As a result of our adoption of ASU 2016-09, we recognize the impact of forfeitures when they occur with no adjustment for
estimated forfeitures and recognize excess tax benefits as a reduction of income tax expense regardless of whether the benefit
reduces income taxes payable. Additionally, we recognize the cash flow impact of such excess tax benefits in operating activities
in our condensed statements of cash flows. The cumulative impact upon adoption was a $41 thousand benefit from income taxes and
a $60 thousand adjustment to retained earnings.

OVERVIEW   

Revenues for the third
quarter of 2016 were $11.8 million, an increase of 67% from third quarter 2015 revenue of $7.1 million. The Company reported net
income of $2.7 million, or $0.49 per diluted share for the three months ended September 30, 2016 versus $796 thousand, or $0.15
per diluted share for the same period in 2015, an increase of 240%. The increase in revenue and earnings was primarily the result
of higher testing volume from Brazil. The Brazil opportunity derived from the implementation of a recently passed Brazilian law
requiring a hair drug test for all professional drivers in the country that began to take effect in March 2016. The Company distributed
$2.5 million or $0.45 per share of cash dividends to its shareholders in the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The Company
has paid 80 consecutive quarterly cash dividends. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS   

Revenues  were $11.8 million for
three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to revenues of $7.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015, representing
an increase of 67%. The increase was attributable to testing volume from Brazil. Revenues for the nine months ended September 30,
2016 were $28.2 million, representing an increase of 35% in revenues from the comparable period of 2015 of $20.8 million. This
increase was primarily attributable to testing volume from Brazil. 

Gross profit  was $7.1 million for
the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $3.5 million for the same period in 2015, representing an increase of 106%.
Direct costs increased by $1.1 million or 31% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015,
mainly due to the higher volume of samples. As a result of the higher sales, the gross profit margin increased to 60% for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 from 49% for the comparable period of 2015. Gross profit for the nine months ended September 30,
2016 increased $5.0 million to $15.1 million. Direct costs increased by $2.4 million or 22% for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015, mainly due to the higher volume of samples. As a result of the higher sales, the
gross profit margin increased to 53% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from 48% for the comparable period of 2015. 

General and administrative ( G A )
expenses  were $1.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $1.2 million for the same period in 2015.
As a percentage of revenue, G A expenses were 11% for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to 17% for the same
period in 2015. General and administrative expenses were $3.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to
$3.5 million for the same period in 2015. As a percentage of revenue, G A expenses were 13% for the nine months ended September
30, 2016, compared to 17% for the same period in 2015. 

Marketing and selling expenses  were
$1.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $1.3 million for the same period in 2015. Total marketing
and selling expenses represented 12% of revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to 18% for the same period
in 2015. Marketing and selling expenses were $3.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $3.9 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Total marketing and selling expenses represented 13% of revenue for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016, compared to 19% for the comparable period of 2015. 

Research and development ( R D ) 
 expenses  for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were $348 thousand compared to $392 thousand for the comparable period
of 2015, a decrease of 11%. R D expenses represented 3% and 6% of revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015, respectively. Research and development expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $1.1 million compared to
$1.3 million in the prior year, a decrease of 18%. R D expenses represented 4% and 6% of revenue for the nine months ended
2016 and 2015, respectively. 

Provision for income taxes  During
the three months ended September 30, 2016 the Company recorded a provision of $1.4 million. For the three months ended September
30, 2015, the Company recorded a benefit of $276 thousand which consisted of a 2015 tax provision of $203 thousand, offset by $479
thousand of R D tax credits. The respective provision and benefit represented effective tax rates of 33% for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 and (53%) for the comparable period of 2015. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company
recorded a provision of $2.1 million. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recorded a benefit of $63 thousand,
due to R D tax credits. The respective provision and benefit represented effective tax rates of 32% for the nine month periods
ended September 30, 2016 and (5%) for the comparative period last year. The Company expects the year-end tax rate to be to be between
32% and 34%. 

LIQUIDITY AND
CAPITAL RESOURCES   

At September 30, 2016,
the Company had approximately $4.1 million of cash. The Company's operating activities generated net cash of $6.1 million for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016. Investing activities used $1.4 million of cash while financing activities used $3.3 million
of cash during the first nine months of 2016. 

Cash provided by operating
activities of $6.1 million reflected net income of $4.3 million adjusted for depreciation and amortization of $1.6 million and
stock-based compensation of $508 thousand. This was affected by the following changes in assets and liabilities: an increase in
accounts receivable of $2.7 million, a decrease in prepaid expenses, other current assets and income tax receivable of $634 thousand,
an increase in accounts payable of $397 thousand, an increase in accrued expenses of $1.3 million and a decrease in deferred income
taxes of $17 thousand. The increase in accrued expenses was driven a $1.0 million increase in accrued income taxes. 

Cash used in investing
activities primarily included equipment and leasehold improvements of $1.2 million which were purchased during the first nine months
of 2016. We anticipate spending $0.5 million to $1.0 million in additional capital purchases for the remainder of 2016. 

Cash used by financing
activities of $3.3 million primarily included cash dividends to shareholders of $2.5 million and $1.3 million from payments on
long term debt, offset by $610 thousand of proceeds from additional equipment financing. On October 25, 2016, the Company declared
a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share for an estimated total of $819 thousand, which will be paid on November 14, 2016 to shareholders
of record on November 4, 2016. 

Contractual obligations
and other commercial commitments as of September 30, 2016 were as follows (in thousands): 

At September 30,
2016, the Company's principal source of liquidity consisted of approximately $4.1 million of cash.  Management currently
believes that such funds, together with cash generated from operations, should be adequate to fund anticipated working capital
requirements and capital equipment expenditures for the next 12 months.  Depending upon the Company's results of operations
and capital needs, the Company may use various financing sources to raise additional funds.  

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market
Risk  

Interest Rate Sensitivity .
The Company s long-term debt agreement is subject to the 30 day Libor rate, which changes the Company s interest rate
on a monthly basis. The Company does not expect any changes in this rate to materially affect the Company s performance. 

Based on our ability
to access our cash and cash equivalents, our expected operating cash flows and our other sources of cash, we do not anticipate
that any lack of liquidity will materially affect our ability to operate our business. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures  

As of the end of the
period covered by this report, the Company s management under the supervision and with the participation of, the Company s
Chief Executive Officer and Vice President   Finance, performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation
of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15. Based upon that evaluation, the
Chief Executive Officer and Vice President - Finance concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were
effective for ensuring that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s
rules and forms, and that its disclosure controls and procedures were also effective to ensure that information required to be
disclosed in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, including
the Company s principal executive and principal financial officers, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

There has been no
significant change in the Company s internal control over financial reporting during the most recent fiscal quarter that
has materially affected or is reasonably likely to materially affect the Company s internal control over financial reporting.
