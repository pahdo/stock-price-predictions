1. 
    DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS, BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
     American Tower Corporation (together with its subsidiaries,  ATC  or the  Company ) is one of the largest global real estate investment trusts and a leading independent owner, operator and developer of multitenant communications real estate. The Company s primary business is the leasing of space on communications sites to wireless service providers, radio and television broadcast companies, wireless data providers, government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries, which the Company refers to as its property operations. Additionally, the Company offers tower-related services, referred to as its services operations, in the United States, including site acquisition, zoning and permitting and structural analysis, which primarily support its site leasing business, including the addition of new tenants and equipment on its sites.   
  The Company s portfolio primarily consists of towers it owns and towers it operates pursuant to long-term lease arrangements, as well as distributed antenna system ( DAS ) networks, which provide seamless coverage solutions for in-building and certain outdoor wireless environments. In addition to the communications sites in its portfolio, the Company manages rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements. The Company also holds property interests that it leases to communications service providers and third-party tower operators. 
    
  ATC is a holding company that conducts its operations through its directly and indirectly owned subsidiaries and its joint ventures. ATC s principal domestic operating subsidiaries are American Towers LLC and SpectraSite Communications, LLC. ATC conducts its international operations primarily through its subsidiary, American Tower International, Inc., which in turn conducts operations through its various international holding and operating subsidiaries and joint ventures.  
    
  On April 21, 2016, the Company significantly expanded its Asia segment portfolio by acquiring a   51%   controlling ownership interest in Viom Networks Limited ( Viom ), a telecommunications infrastructure company that owns and operates over   42,000   wireless communications towers and   200   indoor DAS networks in India (the  Viom Acquisition ). Subsequent to the closing, Viom was renamed ATC Telecom Infrastructure Private Limited ( ATC TIPL ). 
    
  The Company operates as a real estate investment trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes ( REIT ). Accordingly, the Company generally is not subject to U.S. federal income taxes on income generated by its REIT operations, including the income derived from leasing space on its towers, as the Company receives a dividends paid deduction for distributions to stockholders that generally offsets its income and gains.  However, the Company remains obligated to pay U.S. federal income taxes on earnings from its domestic taxable REIT subsidiaries ( TRSs ). In addition, the Company s international assets and operations, regardless of their designation for U.S. tax purposes, continue to be subject to taxation in the foreign jurisdictions where those assets are held or those operations are conducted. 
    
  The use of TRSs enables the Company to continue to engage in certain businesses while complying with REIT qualification requirements. The Company may, from time to time, change the election of previously designated TRSs to be included as part of the REIT. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company s REIT-qualified businesses included its U.S. tower leasing business, most of its operations in Costa Rica, Germany and Mexico and a majority of its services segment and indoor DAS networks business. 
    
  The accompanying consolidated and condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared by the Company pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The financial information included herein is unaudited. However, the Company believes that all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of its financial position and results of operations for such periods have been included herein. The consolidated and condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes should be read in conjunction with the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   (the    2015   Form 10-K ). The results of operations for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the entire year.  
    
  Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation   The accompanying consolidated and condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and those entities in which it has a controlling interest. Investments in entities that the Company does not control are accounted for using the equity or cost method, depending  
  
   6 

AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED AND CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

upon the Company s ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company has a controlling interest in  
  two   joint ventures in Ghana and Uganda with MTN Group Limited ( MTN Group ). The joint ventures are controlled by a holding company of which a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company holds a   51%   interest and a wholly owned subsidiary of MTN Group holds a   49%   interest. In addition, the Company holds an approximate   75%   controlling interest in a subsidiary of the Company in South Africa and the South African investors hold an approximate   25%   noncontrolling interest. The Company also holds a   51%   controlling interest in ATC TIPL.  
    
  Significant Accounting Policies   The Company s significant accounting policies are described in note 1 to the Company s consolidated financial statements included in the 2015 Form 10-K. There have been no material changes to the Company s significant accounting policies during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .  
  Accounting Standards Updates   In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the  FASB ) issued new revenue recognition guidance, which requires an entity to recognize revenue in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The standard will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance and will become effective for the Company on January 1, 2018. Early adoption is permitted for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. Leases are not included in the scope of this standard. The Company is evaluating the impact this standard will have on its financial statements. 
    
  In January 2016, the FASB issued new guidance on the recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities. The guidance amends certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. This standard is effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material effect on its financial statements. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued new guidance on the accounting for leases. The guidance amends the existing accounting standards for lease accounting, including the requirement that lessees recognize assets and liabilities for leases with terms greater than twelve months in the statement of financial position. Under the new guidance, lessor accounting is largely unchanged. This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. The standard is required to be applied using a modified retrospective approach for all leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented. The Company is evaluating the impact this standard will have on its financial statements. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued new guidance on the accounting for share-based payment transactions. The guidance amends the accounting for taxes related to stock-based compensation, including how excess tax benefits and a company s payments for tax withholdings should be classified. This guidance is effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company early adopted this standard in the second quarter of 2016 and elected to account for forfeitures as they occur, effective January 1, 2016. The adoption of this guidance was not material to the Company s consolidated financial statements. Additionally, the Company elected to apply the prospective transition method to the amendments related to the presentation of excess tax benefits in the statements of cash flows. 
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued new guidance on certain classifications within the statement of cash flows. The guidance addresses, among other things, how cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows, including payments for costs related to debt prepayments or extinguishment, as well as payments of contingent consideration after an acquisition. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption within an interim period. The Company is evaluating the impact this standard will have on its financial statements.

AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED AND CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

The acquired network location intangibles represent the value to the Company of the incremental revenue growth that could potentially be obtained from leasing the excess capacity on acquired communications sites. The acquired customer-related intangibles typically represent the value to the Company of customer contracts and relationships in place at the time of an acquisition or similar transaction, including assumptions regarding estimated renewals.  
  The Company amortizes its acquired network location intangibles and customer-related intangibles on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. As of   September 30, 2016  , the remaining weighted average amortization period of the Company s intangible assets, excluding the TV Azteca Economic Rights detailed in note 5 to the Company s consolidated financial statements included in the 2015 Form 10-K, was   16   years. Amortization of intangible assets for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   $183.9 million   and   $521.0 million  , respectively, and amortization of intangible assets for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2015   was   $154.4 million   and   $412.5 million  , respectively. Based on current exchange rates, the Company expects to record amortization expense as follows over the remaining current year and the five subsequent years (in millions):

  Viom indebtedness   Amounts outstanding and key terms of the Viom indebtedness consisted of the following as of   September 30, 2016   (in millions, except percentages): 

The Viom indebtedness includes several term loans, ranging from   one   to   ten   years, which are generally secured by the borrower s short-term and long-term assets. Each of the term loans bear interest at the applicable bank s Marginal Cost of Funds based Lending Rate or base rate, plus a spread. Interest rates on the term loans are fixed until certain annual reset dates. Generally, the term loans can be repaid without penalty on the annual reset dates; earlier repayments require notice to the lenders and are subject to prepayment penalties, typically of   1%   to   2%  . Scheduled repayment terms include either ratable or staggered amortization with repayments typically commencing between   six   and   36   months after the initial disbursement of funds. 
  The debenture     is secured by the borrower s long-term assets, including property and equipment and intangible assets. The debenture bears interest at a base rate plus a spread of   0.6%  . The base rate is set in advance for each quarterly coupon period. Should the actual base rate be between   9.75%   and   10.25%  , the revised base rate is assumed to be   10.00%   for purposes of the reset. Additionally, the spread is subject to reset   36   and   48   months from the issuance date of April 27, 2015.  The holders of the debenture must reach a consensus on the revised spread and the borrower must redeem all of the debentures held by holders from whom consensus is not achieved. Additionally, the debenture is required to be redeemed by the borrower if it does not maintain a minimum credit rating.  
  The Viom indebtedness includes several working capital facilities, most of which are subject to annual renewal, which are generally secured by the borrower s short-term and long-term assets. The working capital facilities bear interest at rates that are comprised of base rates plus spreads. Generally, the working capital facilities are payable on demand prior to maturity.

  2.250%   Senior Notes and   3.125%   Senior Notes Offering   On September 30, 2016, the Company completed a registered public offering of   $600.0 million   aggregate principal amount of   2.250%   senior unsecured notes due 2022 (the    2.250%   Notes ) and   $400.0 million   aggregate principal amount of   3.125%   senior unsecured notes due 2027 (the    3.125%   Notes ). The net proceeds from this offering were approximately   $990.6 million  , after deducting commissions and estimated expenses. The Company used the proceeds to repay existing indebtedness under the Company s unsecured term loan entered into in October 2013, as amended (the  Term Loan ). 
    
  The   2.250%   Notes will mature on January 15, 2022 and bear interest at a rate of   2.250%   per annum. The   3.125%   Notes will mature on January 15, 2027 and bear interest at a rate of   3.125%   per annum. Accrued and unpaid interest on the notes will be payable in U.S. Dollars semi-annually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year, beginning on January 15, 2017. Interest on the notes is computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months and commenced accruing on September 30, 2016. The Company entered into interest rate swaps, which were designated as fair value hedges at inception, to hedge against changes in fair value of the debt under the   2.250%   Notes resulting from changes in interest rates. As of September 30, 2016, the interest rate on the   2.250%   Notes, after giving effect to the interest rate swap agreements, was   1.75%  .  
    
  The Company may redeem each series of notes at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to   100%   of the principal amount of the notes plus a make-whole premium, together with accrued interest to the redemption date. If the Company redeems the   3.300%   Notes on or after January 15, 2021, the   4.400%   Notes on or after November 15, 2025, the   3.375%   Notes on or after July 15, 2026 or the   3.125%   Notes on or after October 15, 2026, it will not be required to pay a make-whole premium. In addition, if the Company undergoes a change of control and corresponding ratings

decline, each as defined in the applicable supplemental indenture, it may be required to repurchase all of the applicable notes at a purchase price equal to   101%   of the principal amount of such notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest (including additional interest, if any), up to but not including the repurchase date. The notes rank equally with all of the Company s other senior unsecured debt and are structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other obligations of its subsidiaries.  
    
  The supplemental indentures contain certain covenants that restrict the Company s ability to merge, consolidate or sell assets and its (together with its subsidiaries ) ability to incur liens. These covenants are subject to a number of exceptions, including that the Company, and its subsidiaries, may incur certain liens on assets, mortgages or other liens securing indebtedness if the aggregate amount of such liens does not exceed   3.5  x Adjusted EBITDA, as defined in the applicable supplemental indenture.

  (1)    LIBOR means the London Interbank Offered Rate. 
  (2)    Fee on undrawn portion of each credit facility. 
  (3)    Subject to two optional renewal periods. 

6.    FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 
  The Company determines the fair value of its financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Below are the three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value: 

Level 1 
    Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access at the measurement date. 

Level 2 
    Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. 

Level 3 
    Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.

Items Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis   The fair values of the Company s financial assets and liabilities that are required to be measured on a recurring basis at fair value were as follows (in thousands): 

On September 30, 2016, the Company entered into interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional value of   $600.0 million   related to the   2.250%   Notes. The interest rate swap agreements require the Company to pay interest at a variable interest rate of one-month LIBOR plus applicable spreads and to receive fixed interest at a rate of   2.250%   through January 15, 2022. 
    
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company has made no changes to the methods described in note 11 to the Company s consolidated financial statements in the 2015 Form 10-K that it used to measure the fair value of its interest rate swap agreements, the embedded derivative in one of its lease agreements and acquisition-related contingent consideration. The changes in fair value during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and 2015 were not material to the consolidated financial statements.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company estimated the value of all potential acquisition-related contingent consideration required payments to be between   zero   and   $47.7 million  , which includes   $22.2 million   related to an acquisition in South Africa that occurred during the three months ended September 30, 2016. 
    
  Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests 
  In connection with the Viom Acquisition, the Company entered into a shareholders  agreement that provides for put options held by certain noncontrolling shareholders. The fair value of the Company s noncontrolling interests reflected on the consolidated balance sheet are determined using a discounted cash flow approach, which takes into consideration Level 3 unobservable inputs and applies a discount factor.  
    
  The fair value of the redeemable noncontrolling interests was   $1.1 billion   at the date of acquisition and was recorded in   
  Redeemable noncontrolling interests in the consolidated balance sheet.  
    
  See notes 9 and 13 for more information. 
    
  Items Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis 
  Assets Held and Used   The Company s long-lived assets are recorded at amortized cost and, if impaired, are adjusted to fair value using Level 3 inputs. During the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and 2015, the Company did not record any material asset impairment charges. 
    
  There were no other items measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and 2015. 
    
  Fair Value of Financial Instruments   The Company s financial instruments for which the carrying value reasonably approximates fair value at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   include cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable and accounts payable. The Company s estimates of fair value of its long-term obligations, including the current portion, are based primarily upon reported market values. For long-term debt not actively traded, fair value is estimated using either indicative price quotes or a discounted cash flow analysis using rates for debt with similar terms and maturities. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the carrying value of long-term obligations, including the current portion, was   $18.7 billion   and   $17.1 billion  , respectively. As of   September 30, 2016  ,  
  
   14 

AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED AND CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

the fair value of long-term obligations, including the current portion, was   $19.5 billion  , of which   $12.3 billion   was measured using Level 1 inputs and   $7.2 billion   was measured using Level 2 inputs. As of   December 31, 2015  , the fair value of long-term obligations, including the current portion, was   $17.4 billion  , of which   $8.7 billion   was measured using Level 1 inputs and   $8.7 billion   was measured using Level 2 inputs. 

7.    INCOME TAXES 
  The Company provides for income taxes at the end of each interim period based on the estimated effective tax rate ( ETR ) for the full fiscal year. Cumulative adjustments to the Company s estimate are recorded in the interim period in which a change in the estimated annual ETR is determined. As a REIT, the Company continues to be subject to income taxes on the income of its TRSs and income taxes in foreign jurisdictions where it conducts operations. Under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, the Company may deduct amounts distributed to stockholders against the income generated by its REIT operations. In addition, the Company is able to offset certain income by utilizing its net operating losses, subject to specified limitations.  
  The Company provides valuation allowances if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Management assesses the available positive and negative evidence to estimate if sufficient future taxable income will be generated to use the existing deferred tax assets. 
    
  As described in note 1, effective January 1, 2016, the Company adopted new guidance on the accounting for share-based payment transactions. As part of this new guidance, excess windfall tax benefits and tax deficiencies related to the Company s stock option exercises and restricted stock unit vestings are recognized as an income tax benefit or expense in the consolidated statements of operations in the period in which the deduction occurs. Excess windfall tax benefits and tax deficiencies are, therefore, not anticipated when determining the annual ETR and are instead recognized in the interim period in which those items occur.  
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the total unrecognized tax benefits that would impact the ETR, if recognized, were approximately   $74.7 million   and   $28.1 million  , respectively. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits during the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   includes additions to the Company s existing tax positions of   $8.4 million   and   $47.7 million   (including   $23.8 million   assumed through acquisition), respectively, and reductions due to the expiration of the statute of limitations in certain jurisdictions of   $1.8 million   during each of the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . The Company expects the unrecognized tax benefits to change over the next 12 months if certain tax matters ultimately settle with the applicable taxing jurisdiction during this time frame, as described in note 12 to the Company s consolidated financial statements included in the   2015   Form 10-K. The impact of the amount of these changes to previously recorded uncertain tax positions could range from   zero   to   $12.4 million  . 
  The Company recorded penalties and income tax-related interest expense during the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   of   $1.8 million   and   $7.0 million  , respectively, and during the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2015   of   $0.7 million   and   $2.3 million  , respectively. In addition, due to the expiration of the statute of limitations in certain jurisdictions, the Company reduced its liability for penalties and income tax-related interest expense related to uncertain tax positions during the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   by   $1.6 million   and during the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2015   by   $3.1 million  . As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the total amount of accrued income tax related interest and penalties included in the consolidated balance sheets was   $24.5 million   and   $20.2 million  , respectively.  

8.    STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION 
  Summary of Stock-Based Compensation Plans   The Company maintains equity incentive plans that provide for the grant of stock-based awards to its directors, officers and employees. The 2007 Equity Incentive Plan (the  2007 Plan ) provides for the grant of non-qualified and incentive stock options, as well as restricted stock units, restricted stock and other stock-based awards. Exercise prices in the case of non-qualified and incentive stock options are not less than the fair value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant. Equity awards typically vest ratably, generally over   four years   for time-based restricted stock units ( RSUs ) and stock options and   three years   for performance-based restricted stock units ( PSUs ). Stock options generally expire   ten years   from the date of grant. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had the ability to grant stock-based awards with respect to an aggregate of   9.5 million   shares of common stock  
  
   15 

AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED AND CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

under the 2007 Plan. In addition, the Company maintains an employee stock purchase plan ( ESPP ) pursuant to which eligible employees may purchase shares of the Company s common stock on the last day of each bi-annual offering period at a   15%   discount of the lower of the closing market value on the first or last day of such offering period. The offering periods run from June 1 through November 30 and from December 1 through May 31 of each year. 
  During the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company recorded and capitalized the following stock-based compensation expenses (in thousands): 

Stock Options   The fair value of each option granted during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model based on the assumptions noted in the table below. The expected life of stock options (estimated period of time outstanding) was estimated using the vesting term and historical exercise behavior of the Company s employees. The risk-free interest rate was based on the U.S. Treasury yield with a term that approximated the estimated life in effect at the accounting measurement date. The expected volatility of the underlying stock price was based on historical volatility for a period equal to the expected life of the stock options. The expected annual dividend yield was the Company s best estimate of expected future dividend yield. 
    
  Key assumptions used to apply this pricing model during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   were as follows: 

The weighted average grant date fair value per share during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   $14.57  . As of   September 30, 2016  , total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock options was   $30.1 million  , which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately   two years  .  
  The Company s option activity for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was as follows: 

Restricted Stock Units   As of   September 30, 2016  , total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested RSUs granted under the 2007 Plan was   $100.6 million   and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately   two years  .

AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED AND CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units   During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company s Compensation Committee granted an aggregate of   169,340   PSUs to its executive officers (the  2016 PSUs ) and established the performance metrics for this award. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , the Company s Compensation Committee granted an aggregate of   70,135   PSUs to its executive officers (the  2015 PSUs ) and established the performance metric for this award. Threshold, target and maximum parameters were established for the metrics for a   three  -year performance period with respect to the 2016 PSUs and for each year in the   three  -year performance period with respect to the 2015 PSUs and will be used to calculate the number of shares that will be issuable when the award vests, which may range from   zero   to   200%   of the target amount. At the end of the   three  -year performance period, the number of shares that vest will depend on the degree of achievement against the pre-established performance goals. PSUs will be paid out in common stock at the end of the performance period, subject generally to the executive s continued employment. PSUs will accrue dividend equivalents prior to vesting, which will be paid out only in respect of shares actually vested.  
    
  The performance metric related to the 2015 PSUs is tied to year-over-year growth, and actual results for the metric cannot be determined until the end of each respective fiscal year. As a result, as of   September 30, 2016  , the Company was unable to determine the annual target for the third year of the performance period for this award. Accordingly, an aggregate of   23,377   PSUs was not included in the table below.  
  Restricted Stock Units and Performance-Based Restricted Stock Units   The Company s RSU and PSU activity for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was as follows:    

_______________ 
           (1) 
    PSUs represent the shares issuable for the 2015 PSUs at the end of the   three  -year performance cycle based on exceeding the performance metric for the first year s performance period.  
              (2) 
    PSUs represent the target number of shares issuable at the end of the   three  -year performance cycle attributable to the second year s performance period for the 2015 PSUs and the target number of shares issuable at the end of the   three  -year performance cycle for the 2016 PSUs. 
       
  During the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company recorded   $2.3 million   and   $5.5 million  , respectively, in stock-based compensation expense for equity awards in which the performance goals had been established and were probable of being achieved. The remaining unrecognized compensation expense related to these awards at   September 30, 2016   was   $14.2 million   based on the Company s current assessment of the probability of achieving the performance goals. The weighted-average period over which the cost will be recognized is approximately   two years  . 

9.    REDEEMABLE NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS 
    
  Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests   In connection with the Viom Acquisition, the Company, through one of its subsidiaries, entered into a shareholders agreement (the  Shareholders Agreement ) with Viom and the following remaining Viom shareholders: Tata Sons Limited, Tata Teleservices Limited, IDFC Private Equity Fund III, Macquarie SBI Investments Pte Limited and SBI Macquarie Infrastructure Trust (collectively, the  Remaining Shareholders ). The Shareholders Agreement provides for, among other things, put options held by certain of the Remaining Shareholders, which allow the Remaining Shareholders to sell outstanding shares of ATC TIPL, and call options held by the Company, which allow the Company to buy the noncontrolling shares of ATC TIPL. The put options, which are not under the Company s control, cannot be separated from the noncontrolling interests. As a result, the combination of the noncontrolling interests and the redemption feature require classification as redeemable noncontrolling interests in the consolidated balance sheet, separate from equity. 
    
  Given the provisions governing the put rights, the redeemable noncontrolling interests are recorded outside of permanent equity at their redemption value. The noncontrolling interests become redeemable after the passage of time, and  
  
   17 

AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED AND CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

therefore, the Company records the carrying amount of the noncontrolling interests at the greater of (i) the initial carrying amount, increased or decreased for the noncontrolling interests  share of net income or loss and foreign currency translation adjustments, and (ii) the redemption value. If required, the Company will adjust the redeemable noncontrolling interests to redemption value on each balance sheet date with changes in redemption value recognized as an adjustment to Distributions in excess of earnings. 
    
  The put options may be exercised, requiring the Company to purchase the Remaining Shareholders  equity interests, on specified dates beginning April 1, 2018 through March 31, 2021. The price of the put options will be based on the fair market value of the exercising Remaining Shareholder s interest in the Company s India operations at the time the option is exercised. Put options held by certain of the Remaining Shareholders are subject to a floor price of   216   INR per share.  
    
  The following is a reconciliation of the changes in the Redeemable noncontrolling interests (in thousands):

  Litigation   The Company periodically becomes involved in various claims, lawsuits and proceedings that are incidental to its business. In the opinion of Company management, after consultation with counsel, there are no matters currently pending that would, in the event of an adverse outcome, materially impact the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity.  
  Verizon Transaction   In March 2015, the Company entered into an agreement with various operating entities of Verizon Communications Inc. ( Verizon ) that provides for the lease, sublease or management of   11,286   wireless communications sites commencing March 27, 2015. The average term of the lease or sublease for all sites at the inception of the agreement was approximately   28 years  , assuming renewals or extensions of the underlying ground leases for the sites. The Company has the option to purchase the leased sites in tranches, subject to the applicable lease, sublease or management rights upon its scheduled expiration. Each tower is assigned to an annual tranche, ranging from 2034 to 2047, which represents the outside expiration date for the sublease rights to the towers in that tranche. The purchase price for each tranche is a fixed amount stated in the lease for such tranche plus the fair market value of certain alterations made to the related towers. The aggregate purchase option price for the towers leased and subleased is approximately   $5.0 billion  . Verizon will occupy the sites as a tenant for an initial term of   ten years   with   eight   optional successive   five  -year terms; each such term shall be governed by standard master lease agreement terms established as a part of the transaction.

December 2000 and August 2004. Substantially all of the towers are part of the Company s 2013 securitization transaction. The average term of the lease or sublease for all sites at the inception of the agreement was approximately   27 years  , assuming renewals or extensions of the underlying ground leases for the sites. The Company has the option to purchase the sites subject to the applicable lease or sublease upon its expiration. Each tower is assigned to an annual tranche, ranging from 2013 to 2032, which represents the outside expiration date for the sublease rights to that tower. The purchase price for each site is a fixed amount stated in the lease for that site plus the fair market value of certain alterations made to the related tower by AT T. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company has purchased an aggregate of   60   of the subleased towers upon expiration of the applicable agreement. The aggregate purchase option price for the remaining towers leased and subleased is   $748.3 million   and will accrete at a rate of   10%   per annum through the applicable expiration of the lease or sublease of a site. For all such sites purchased by the Company prior to June 30, 2020, AT T will continue to lease the reserved space at the then-current monthly fee, which shall escalate in accordance with the standard master lease agreement for the remainder of AT T s tenancy. Thereafter, AT T shall have the right to renew such lease for up to   four   successive   five  -year terms. For all such sites purchased by the Company subsequent to June 30, 2020, AT T has the right to continue to lease the reserved space for successive   one  -year terms at a rent equal to the lesser of the agreed upon market rate or the then-current monthly fee, which is subject to an annual increase based on changes in the U.S. Consumer Price Index. 
  ALLTEL Transaction   In December 2000, the Company entered into an agreement with ALLTEL, a predecessor entity to Verizon Wireless, to acquire towers through a   15  -year sublease agreement. Pursuant to the agreement, as amended, with Verizon Wireless, the Company acquired rights to approximately   1,800   towers in tranches between April 2001 and March 2002. The Company has the option to purchase each tower at the expiration of the applicable sublease. The Company exercised the purchase options for approximately   1,525   towers in a single closing to occur on or before November 30, 2016. The Company has provided notice to the tower owner of its intent to exercise the purchase options related to the remaining towers. As of   September 30, 2016  , the purchase price per tower was   $42,844   payable in cash or, at Verizon Wireless s or its assignee s option, as applicable, with   769   shares of the Company s common stock per tower. The aggregate cash purchase option price for the subleased towers was   $75.7 million   as of   September 30, 2016  .  
  Other Contingencies   The Company is subject to income tax and other taxes in the geographic areas where it operates, and periodically receives notifications of audits, assessments or other actions by taxing authorities. The Company evaluates the circumstances of each notification based on the information available and records a liability for any potential outcome that is probable or more likely than not unfavorable if the liability is also reasonably estimable. 
  Tenant Leases   The Company s lease agreements with its tenants vary depending upon the region and the industry of the tenant, and typically have initial terms of   ten   years with multiple renewal terms at the option of the tenant. 
  Future minimum rental receipts expected from tenants under non-cancellable operating lease agreements in effect at   September 30, 2016   were as follows (in millions): 

Lease Obligations   The Company leases certain land, office and tower space under operating leases that expire over various terms. Many of the leases contain renewal options with specified increases in lease payments upon exercise of the renewal option. Escalation clauses present in operating leases, excluding those tied to a consumer price index or other inflation-based indices, are recognized on a straight-line basis over the non-cancellable term of the leases. 
  Future minimum rental payments under non-cancellable operating leases include payments for certain renewal periods at the Company s option because failure to renew could result in a loss of the applicable communications sites and related

revenues from tenant leases, thereby making it reasonably assured that the Company will renew the leases. Such payments at   September 30, 2016   are as follows (in millions): 

13.    ACQUISITIONS  
    
  Impact of current year acquisitions   The Company typically acquires communications sites from wireless carriers or other tower operators and subsequently integrates those sites into its existing portfolio of communications sites. The financial results of the Company s acquisitions have been included in the Company s consolidated statements of operations for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   from the date of the respective acquisition. The date of acquisition, and by extension the point at which the Company begins to recognize the results of an acquisition, may depend on, among other things, the receipt of contractual consents, the commencement and extent of leasing arrangements and the timing of the transfer of title or rights to the assets, which may be accomplished in phases. Sites acquired from communications service providers may never have been operated as a business and may instead have been utilized solely by the seller as a component of its network infrastructure. An acquisition may or may not involve the transfer of business operations or employees.  
    
  The estimated aggregate impact of the   2016   acquisitions on the Company s revenues and gross margin for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   was approximately   $208.1 million   and   $87.9 million  , respectively, and the estimated aggregate impact for the   nine months ended September 30,     2016   was approximately   $366.1 million   and   $153.1 million  , respectively. The revenues and gross margin amounts also reflect incremental revenues from the addition of new tenants to such sites subsequent to the transaction date.  
    
  For those acquisitions accounted for as business combinations, the Company recognizes acquisition and merger related expenses in the period in which they are incurred and services are received.  Acquisition and merger related expenses may include finder s fees, advisory, legal, accounting, valuation and other professional or consulting fees, fair value adjustments to contingent consideration and general administrative costs directly related to the transaction.  Integration costs include incremental and non-recurring costs necessary to convert data, retain employees and otherwise enable the Company to operate new businesses efficiently. The Company records acquisition and merger related expenses, as well as integration costs, in Other operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.   
    
  During the three and   nine months ended September 30,     2016   and   2015  , the Company recorded acquisition and merger related expenses and integration costs as follows (in thousands):

  2016 Acquisitions 
    
  Viom Acquisition   On April 21, 2016, the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary, ATC Asia Pacific Pte. Ltd. ( ATC Asia ), acquired a   51%   controlling ownership interest in Viom, a telecommunications infrastructure company that owns and operates over   42,000   wireless communications towers and   200   indoor DAS networks in India, from certain Viom shareholders, including the managing shareholder, SREI Infrastructure Finance Limited, several other minority shareholders and Tata Teleservices Limited, pursuant to its previously announced share purchase agreement. Consideration for the acquisition included   76.4 billion   INR in cash (  $1.1 billion   at the date of acquisition), as well as the assumption of approximately   52.3 billion   INR (  $0.8 billion   at the date of acquisition) of existing debt, which included   1.7 billion   INR (  $25.1 million   at the date of acquisition) of mandatorily redeemable preference shares issued by Viom.  
  On April 21, 2016, the closing date of the Viom Acquisition, ATC Asia s Shareholders Agreement with the Remaining Shareholders became effective. The Shareholders Agreement provides that, among other things, the Remaining Shareholders will have certain governance, anti-dilution and contractual rights. The Remaining Shareholders will have put options, and ATC Asia will have a call option, subject to the time periods and conditions outlined in the Shareholders Agreement. 
    
  Other Acquisitions   During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company acquired a total of   784   communications sites in the United States, Brazil, Germany, Nigeria and South Africa for an aggregate purchase price of   $185.6 million   (including contingent consideration of   $8.7 million  ). Of the total purchase price,   $2.1 million   is reflected in Accounts payable in the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2016. The purchase prices of certain transactions are subject to post-closing adjustments.

2015 Acquisitions 
    
  The estimates of the fair value of the assets or rights acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of the applicable acquisition are subject to adjustment during the measurement period (up to one year from the applicable acquisition date). During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , the Company adopted new guidance on the accounting for measurement-period adjustments related to business combinations. This guidance requires that an acquirer make adjustments to the provisional amounts recognized at acquisition date with a corresponding adjustment to goodwill in the current period. Additionally, the effects on earnings of all measurement-period adjustments are included in current period earnings.  
    
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , post-closing adjustments impacted the following 2015 acquisitions: 
    
  TIM Acquisition   On April 29, 2015, the Company acquired   4,176   communications sites from TIM Celular S.A. ( TIM ) for an initial aggregate purchase price of   $644.3 million  , which was subsequently reduced by   $0.8 million   during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. On September 30, 2015, the Company acquired an additional   1,125   communications sites from TIM for an initial aggregate purchase price of   $130.9 million  . On December 16, 2015, the Company acquired an additional   182   communications sites from TIM for an initial aggregate purchase price of   $21.7 million  . The purchase price for the December 2015 TIM acquisition remains subject to post-closing adjustments. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, the Company has the ability to purchase the remaining communications sites as they become available through October 2016, a portion of which was acquired during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  
    
  Other   The initial aggregate purchase price of other 2015 acquisitions was subsequently reduced by   $0.2 million   during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  
    
  The following table summarizes the preliminary and updated allocations of the purchase prices paid and the amounts of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for the fiscal year 2015 acquisitions based upon their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition (in thousands).

Pro Forma Consolidated Results  
  The following table presents the unaudited pro forma financial results as if the 2016 acquisitions had occurred on January 1, 2015 and acquisitions completed in 2015 had occurred on January 1, 2014. The pro forma results do not include any anticipated cost synergies, costs or other integration impacts. Accordingly, such pro forma amounts are not necessarily indicative of the results that actually would have occurred had the transactions been completed on the date indicated, nor are they indicative of the future operating results of the Company.     

Other Signed Acquisitions 
    
  Airtel Tanzania   On March 17, 2016, the Company entered into a definitive agreement with Airtel, through its subsidiary company Airtel Tanzania Limited ( Airtel Tanzania ), pursuant to which the Company may acquire approximately   1,350   of Airtel Tanzania s communications sites in Tanzania, for total consideration of approximately   $179.0 million  , subject to customary adjustments. Under the definitive agreement, the Company may pay additional consideration to acquire up to approximately   100   additional communications sites currently in development. The closing of this transaction is subject to customary closing conditions. In light of recent legislation in Tanzania, the Company is negotiating potential adjustments to the definitive agreement in the event a waiver of such legislation is not obtained. 

14  .    BUSINESS SEGMENTS 
    
  In 2015, as a result of recent investment activity, including signed acquisitions, the Company reviewed and changed its reportable segments to divide its international segment into   three   regional segments: (i) Asia property, (ii) Europe, Middle East and Africa ( EMEA ) property and (iii) Latin America property, resulting in   five   total segments. The change in reportable segments had no impact on the Company s consolidated and condensed consolidated financial statements for any periods. However, certain expenses previously reflected in segment selling, general, administrative and development expense have been reclassified and are now reflected as Other selling, general, administrative and development expense. Historical financial information included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q has been adjusted to reflect the change in reportable segments.   
    
  The Company s primary business is leasing space on multitenant communications sites to wireless service providers, radio and television broadcast companies, wireless data providers, government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries. This business is referred to as the Company s property operations, which as of   September 30, 2016  , consisted of the following: 

U.S.: property operations in the United States; 
                
    Asia: property operations in India; 
                
    EMEA: property operations in Germany, Ghana, Nigeria, South Africa and Uganda; and 
                
    Latin America: property operations in Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Mexico and Peru. 
     The Company has applied the aggregation criteria to operations within the EMEA and Latin America property operating segments on a basis that is consistent with management s review of information and performance evaluations of these regions.

AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED AND CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

The Company s services segment offers tower-related services in the United States, including site acquisition, zoning and permitting services and structural analysis services, which primarily support its site leasing business, including the addition of new tenants and equipment on its sites. The services segment is a strategic business unit that offers different services from, and requires different resources, skill sets and marketing strategies than, the property operating segments. 
  The accounting policies applied in compiling segment information below are similar to those described in note 1 to the Company s consolidated financial statements included in the 2015 Form 10-K. Among other factors, in evaluating financial performance in each business segment, management uses segment gross margin and segment operating profit. The Company defines segment gross margin as segment revenue less segment operating expenses excluding stock-based compensation expense recorded in costs of operations; Depreciation, amortization and accretion; Selling, general, administrative and development expense; and Other operating expenses. The Company defines segment operating profit as segment gross margin less Selling, general, administrative and development expense attributable to the segment, excluding stock-based compensation expense and corporate expenses. For reporting purposes, the Latin America property segment gross margin and segment operating profit also include Interest income, TV Azteca, net. These measures of segment gross margin and segment operating profit are also before Interest income, Interest expense, Gain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations, Other income (expense), Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests and Income tax benefit (provision). The categories of expenses indicated above, such as depreciation, have been excluded from segment operating performance as they are not considered in the review of information or the evaluation of results by management. There are no significant revenues resulting from transactions between the Company s operating segments. All intercompany transactions are eliminated to reconcile segment results and assets to the consolidated statements of operations and consolidated balance sheets. 
  Summarized financial information concerning the Company s reportable segments for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   is shown in the following tables. The  Other  column (i) represents amounts excluded from specific segments, such as business development operations, stock-based compensation expense and corporate expenses included in Selling, general, administrative and development expense; Other operating expenses; Interest income; Interest expense; Gain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations; and Other income (expense), and (ii) reconciles segment operating profit to Income from continuing operations before income taxes, as the amounts are not utilized in assessing each segment s performance.

For example, when we use words such as  project,   believe,   anticipate,   expect,   forecast,   estimate,   intend,   should,   would,   could,       may  or other words that convey uncertainty of future events or outcomes, we are making forward-looking statements. Certain important factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by our forward-looking statements, including those set forth under the caption  Risk Factors  in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 (the  2015 Form 10-K ). Forward-looking statements represent management s current expectations and are inherently uncertain. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements made by us. 
    
  The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations that follow are based upon our consolidated and condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ). The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences could be material to our financial statements.  This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated and condensed consolidated financial statements herein and the accompanying notes thereto, information set forth under the caption  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  in the 2015 Form 10-K, and in particular, the information set forth therein under Item 7  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.    

Overview 
    
  We are one of the largest global real estate investment trusts and a leading independent owner, operator and developer of multitenant communications real estate. Our primary business is the leasing of space on communications sites to wireless service providers, radio and television broadcast companies, wireless data providers, government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries. In addition to the communications sites in our portfolio, we manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements. We also hold property interests that we lease to communications service providers and third-party tower operators. We refer to this business as our property operations, which accounted for   99%   of our total revenues for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and includes our U.S. property segment, Asia property segment, Europe, Middle East and Africa ( EMEA ) property segment and Latin America property segment. 
    
  Through our services segment, we offer tower-related services, including site acquisition, zoning and permitting and structural analysis services, which primarily support our site leasing business, including the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites.  
    
  On April 21, 2016, we acquired a 51% controlling ownership interest in Viom Networks Limited ( Viom ), a telecommunications infrastructure company that owns and operates over 42,000 wireless communications towers and 200 indoor distributed antenna system ( DAS ) networks in India (the  Viom Acquisition ). Subsequent to the closing, Viom was renamed ATC Telecom Infrastructure Private Limited ( ATC TIPL ). The results of operations for ATC TIPL have been included since the date of acquisition.  

30 

The following table details the number of communications sites, excluding managed sites, that we owned or operated as of   September 30, 2016  :    

_______________ 
           (1) 
    Approximately 96% of the operated towers are held pursuant to long-term capital leases, including those subject to purchase options. 
          
  We operate in five reportable segments: U.S. property, Asia property, EMEA property, Latin America property and services. In evaluating operating performance in each business segment, management uses, among other factors, segment gross margin and segment operating profit (see note 14 to our consolidated and condensed consolidated financial statements included herein). 
  In the section that follows, we provide information regarding management s expectations of long-term drivers of demand for our communications sites, as well as our current results of operations, financial position and sources and uses of liquidity. In addition, we highlight key trends, which management believes provide valuable insight into our operating and financial resource allocation decisions. 
    
  Revenue Growth  . The primary factors affecting the revenue growth in our property segments are: 
    
     Growth in tenant billings, including: 
             
    New revenue attributable to leases in place at the commencement of operations on sites acquired or constructed since the beginning of the prior-year period; 
                
    Contractual rent escalations on existing tenant leases, net of churn (as defined below); and 
                
    New revenue attributable to leasing additional space on our sites ( colocations ) and lease amendments.  
                
    Revenue growth from other items, including additional tenant payments to cover costs, such as ground rent or power and fuel costs ( pass-through ) included in certain tenant leases, straight-line revenue and decommissioning. 
       
  Due to our diversified communications site portfolio, our tenant lease rates vary considerably depending upon numerous factors, including, but not limited to, the amount and type of tenant equipment on the tower, remaining tower capacity and tower location. We measure the remaining tower capacity by assessing several factors, including tower height, tower type, environmental conditions, existing equipment on the tower and zoning and permitting regulations in  
  
   31 

effect in the jurisdiction where the tower is located. In many instances, tower capacity can be increased with relatively modest tower augmentation expenditures. 
    
  The majority of our tenant leases with wireless carriers have an initial non-cancellable term of at least ten years, with multiple renewal terms. Accordingly, nearly all of the revenue generated by our property operations during the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods. Based upon foreign currency exchange rates and the tenant leases in place as of   September 30, 2016  , we expect to generate over $32 billion of non-cancellable tenant lease revenue over future periods, absent the impact of straight-line lease accounting. Most of our tenant leases have provisions that periodically increase the rent due under the lease, typically based on an annual fixed escalation (averaging approximately   3%   in the United States) or an inflationary index in our international markets, or a combination of both. In addition, certain of our tenant leases provide for additional revenue to cover costs, such as ground rent or power and fuel costs. 
    
  The revenues generated by our property operations may be affected by cancellations of existing tenant leases. As discussed above, most of our tenant leases with wireless carriers and broadcasters are multiyear contracts, which typically are non-cancellable; however, in some instances, a lease may be cancelled upon the payment of a termination fee. 
    
  Revenue lost from either cancellations or the non-renewal of leases or rent negotiations historically has not had a material adverse effect on the revenues generated by our property operations. We define churn as revenue lost when a tenant cancels or does not renew its lease or, in limited circumstances, when the lease rates on existing leases are reduced. We derive our churn rate for a given period by dividing our revenue lost on this basis by our prior-year period property segment revenue. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , churn represented approximately   1.3%   of our property operations revenue. 
    
  Demand Drivers  . We continue to believe that our site leasing revenue is likely to increase due to the growing use of wireless services and our ability to meet the corresponding incremental demand for our wireless real estate. By adding new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants on our sites, we are able to increase these sites  utilization and profitability. We believe the majority of our site leasing activity will continue to come from wireless service providers. Our site portfolio and our established tenant base provides us with new business opportunities, which have historically resulted in consistent and predictable organic revenue growth as wireless carriers seek to increase the coverage and capacity of their existing networks, while also deploying next generation wireless technologies. In addition, we intend to continue to supplement our organic growth by selectively developing or acquiring new sites in our existing and new markets where we can achieve our risk-adjusted return on investment objectives.  
    
  Consistent with our strategy to increase the utilization and return on investment of our sites, our objective is to add new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants through colocation and lease amendments. Our ability to lease additional space on our sites is primarily a function of the rate at which wireless carriers deploy capital to improve and expand their wireless networks. This rate, in turn, is influenced by the growth of wireless services, the penetration of advanced wireless devices, the financial performance of our tenants and their access to capital and general economic conditions.  
    
  Based on industry research and projections, we expect that a number of key industry trends will result in incremental revenue opportunities for us: 

In less advanced wireless markets where initial voice and data networks are still being deployed, we expect these deployments to drive demand for our tower space as carriers seek to expand their footprints and increase the scope and density of their networks. We have established operations in many of these markets at the early stages of wireless development, which we believe will enable us to meaningfully participate in these deployments. 
                
    Subscribers  use of wireless data continues to grow rapidly given increasing smartphone and other advanced device penetration, the proliferation of bandwidth-intensive applications on these devices and the continuing evolution of the mobile ecosystem. We believe carriers will be compelled to deploy additional equipment on  
     
   32 

existing networks while also rolling out more advanced wireless networks to address coverage and capacity needs resulting from this increasing wireless data usage. 
             
    The deployment of advanced wireless technology across existing wireless networks will provide higher speed data services and further enable fixed broadband substitution. As a result, we expect that our tenants will continue deploying additional equipment across their existing networks. 
                
    Wireless service providers compete based on the quality of their existing wireless networks, which is driven by capacity and coverage. To maintain or improve their network performance as overall network usage increases, our tenants continue deploying additional equipment across their existing sites while also adding new cell sites. We anticipate increasing network densification over the next several years, as existing network infrastructure is anticipated to be insufficient to account for rapidly increasing levels of wireless data usage.  
                
    Wireless service providers continue to acquire additional spectrum, and as a result are expected to add additional sites and equipment to their networks as they seek to optimize their network configuration and utilize additional spectrum. 
       
  As part of our international expansion initiatives, we have targeted markets in various stages of network development to diversify our international exposure and position us to benefit from a number of different wireless technology deployments over the long term. In addition, we have focused on building relationships with large multinational carriers such as Bharti Airtel Limited ( Airtel ), Telef nica S.A. and Vodafone Group PLC. We believe that consistent carrier investments in their networks across our international markets position us to generate meaningful organic revenue growth going forward. 
    
  In emerging markets, such as Ghana, India, Nigeria and Uganda, wireless networks tend to be significantly less advanced than those in the United States, and initial voice networks continue to be deployed in underdeveloped areas. A majority of consumers in these markets still utilize basic wireless services, predominantly on feature phones, while advanced device penetration remains low.  
    
  In more developed urban locations within these markets, early-stage data network deployments are underway. Carriers are focused on completing voice network build-outs while also investing in initial data networks as wireless data usage and smartphone penetration within their customer bases begin to accelerate.  
    
  In markets with rapidly evolving network technology, such as South Africa and most of the countries in Latin America where we do business, initial voice networks, for the most part, have already been built out, and carriers are focused on third generation (3G) and fourth generation (4G) network build outs. Consumers in these regions are increasingly adopting smartphones and other advanced devices, and, as a result, the usage of bandwidth-intensive mobile applications is growing materially. Recent spectrum auctions in these rapidly evolving markets have allowed incumbent carriers to accelerate their data network deployments and have also enabled new entrants to begin initial investments in data networks. Smartphone penetration and wireless data usage in these markets are growing rapidly, which typically requires that carriers continue to invest in their networks in order to maintain and augment their quality of service. 
    
  Finally, in markets with more mature network technology, such as Germany, carriers are focused on deploying 4G data networks to account for rapidly increasing wireless data usage among their customer base. With higher smartphone and advanced device penetration and significantly higher per capita data usage, carrier investment in networks is focused on 4G coverage and capacity. 
    
  We believe that the network technology migration we have seen in the United States, which has led to significantly denser networks and meaningful new business commencements for us over a number of years, will ultimately be replicated in our less advanced international markets. As a result, we expect to be able to leverage our extensive international portfolio of approximately   104,220   communications sites and the relationships we have built with our carrier customers to drive sustainable, long  -  term growth. 
    
  We have master lease agreements with certain of our tenants that provide for consistent, long-term revenue and reduce the likelihood of churn. Our holistic master lease agreements build and augment strong strategic partnerships with  
  
   33 

our tenants and have significantly reduced colocation cycle times, thereby providing our tenants with the ability to rapidly and efficiently deploy equipment on our sites. 
    
  Property Operations Expenses.   Direct operating expenses incurred by our property segments include direct site level expenses and consist primarily of ground rent and power and fuel costs, some or all of which may be passed through to our tenants, as well as property taxes, repairs and maintenance. These segment direct operating expenses exclude all segment and corporate selling, general, administrative and development expenses, which are aggregated into one line item entitled Selling, general, administrative and development expense in our consolidated statements of operations. In general, our property segments  selling, general, administrative and development expenses do not significantly increase as a result of adding incremental tenants to our sites and typically increase only modestly year-over-year. As a result, leasing additional space to new tenants on our sites provides significant incremental cash flow. We may, however, incur additional segment selling, general, administrative and development expenses as we increase our presence in our existing markets or expand into new markets. Our profit margin growth is therefore positively impacted by the addition of new tenants to our sites but can be temporarily diluted by our development activities. 
    
  Services Segment Revenue Growth  . As we continue to focus on growing our property operations, we anticipate that our services revenue will continue to represent a small percentage of our total revenues.  

Non-GAAP Financial Measures  
    
  Included in our analysis of our results of operations are discussions regarding earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and accretion, as adjusted ( Adjusted EBITDA ), Funds From Operations, as defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT FFO ) attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders, Consolidated Adjusted Funds From Operations ( Consolidated AFFO ) and AFFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders. 
    
  We define Adjusted EBITDA as Net income before Income (loss) on equity method investments; Income tax benefit (provision); Other income (expense); Gain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations; Interest expense; Interest income; Other operating income (expense); Depreciation, amortization and accretion; and stock-based compensation expense. 
    
  NAREIT FFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders is defined as net income before gains or losses from the sale or disposal of real estate, real estate related impairment charges, real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion and dividends on preferred stock, and including adjustments for (i) unconsolidated affiliates and (ii) noncontrolling interests. In this section, we refer to NAREIT FFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders as  NAREIT FFO (common stockholders) . 
    
  We define Consolidated AFFO as NAREIT FFO (common stockholders) before (i) straight-line revenue and expense; (ii) stock-based compensation expense; (iii) the deferred portion of income tax; (iv) non-real estate related depreciation, amortization and accretion; (v) amortization of deferred financing costs, capitalized interest, debt discounts and premiums and long-term deferred interest charges; (vi) other income (expense); (vii) gain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations; (viii) other operating income (expense); and adjustments for (ix) unconsolidated affiliates and (x) noncontrolling interests, less cash payments related to capital improvements and cash payments related to corporate capital expenditures. 
    
  We define AFFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders as Consolidated AFFO, excluding the impact of noncontrolling interests on both NAREIT FFO (common stockholders) as well as the other adjustments included in the calculation of Consolidated AFFO. In this section, we refer to AFFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders as  AFFO (common stockholders) .   
    
  Adjusted EBITDA, NAREIT FFO (common stockholders), Consolidated AFFO and AFFO (common stockholders) are not intended to replace net income or any other performance measures determined in accordance with GAAP. None of NAREIT FFO (common stockholders), Consolidated AFFO nor AFFO (common stockholders) represent cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP and, therefore, these measures should not be considered indicative of cash flows from operating activities, as a measure of liquidity or a measure of funds available to fund our cash needs,  
  
   34 

including our ability to make cash distributions. Rather, Adjusted EBITDA, NAREIT FFO (common stockholders), Consolidated AFFO and AFFO (common stockholders) are presented as we believe each is a useful indicator of our current operating performance. We believe that these metrics are useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because (1) each is a key measure used by our management team for decision making purposes and for evaluating our operating segments  performance; (2) Adjusted EBITDA is a component underlying our credit ratings; (3) Adjusted EBITDA is widely used in the telecommunications real estate sector to measure operating performance as depreciation, amortization and accretion may vary significantly among companies depending upon accounting methods and useful lives, particularly where acquisitions and non-operating factors are involved; (4) Consolidated AFFO is widely used in the telecommunications real estate sector to adjust NAREIT FFO (common stockholders) for items that may otherwise cause material fluctuations in NAREIT FFO (common stockholders) growth from period to period that would not be representative of the underlying performance of property assets in those periods; (5) each provides investors with a meaningful measure for evaluating our period-to-period operating performance by eliminating items that are not operational in nature; and (6) each provides investors with a measure for comparing our results of operations to those of other companies, particularly those in our industry. 
    
  Our measurement of Adjusted EBITDA, NAREIT FFO (common stockholders), Consolidated AFFO and AFFO (common stockholders) may not, however, be fully comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA, NAREIT FFO (common stockholders), Consolidated AFFO and AFFO (common stockholders) to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, have been included below.

Selling, General, Administrative and Development Expense ( SG A ) 

_______________ 
           (1) 
    Certain expenses previously reflected in segment SG A for the three and   nine months ended September 30,   2015 have been reclassified and are now reflected as Other SG A. 
       
  Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 

The increases in each of our U.S., Asia and Latin America property segments  SG A were primarily driven by increased personnel costs to support our business, including additional costs associated with the Viom Acquisition in our Asia property segment.  

The increase in other SG A was primarily attributable to an increase in corporate SG A and an increase in stock-based compensation expense of   $1.8 million  . 

The decrease in our services segment SG A was primarily attributable to a decrease in personnel costs from a lower volume of business in our tower services group. 
       
  Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 

The increases in each of our property segments  SG A were primarily driven by increased personnel costs to support our business, including additional costs associated with the transaction with Verizon in our U.S. property segment, the Viom Acquisition in our Asia property segment and the Airtel acquisition in our EMEA property segment. The EMEA and Asia property segments  SG A increases also included increases in bad debt expense of $3.4 million and $1.6 million, respectively. The EMEA and Latin America property segments  SG A increases were partially offset by decreases attributable to the impacts of foreign currency fluctuations.  

The increase in other SG A was primarily attributable to an increase in corporate SG A, partially offset by a decrease in stock-based compensation expense of   $2.4 million  . 

The decrease in our services segment SG A was primarily attributable to a decrease in personnel costs from a lower volume of business in our tower services group. 

40 

Operating Profit 

The growth in operating profit for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   for each of our property segments was primarily attributable to an increase in our segment gross margin. The increases in our U.S., Asia and Latin America property segments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 were partially offset by increases in our segment SG A. The growth in operating profit for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   in our EMEA property segment was partially offset by an increase in our segment SG A, while for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , a slight decrease in our segment SG A contributed to operating profit growth. 
    
  The decrease in operating profit for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   for our services segment was primarily attributable to a decrease in our segment gross margin, partially offset by a decrease in our segment SG A. 
    
  Depreciation, Amortization and Accretion 

The increase in depreciation, amortization and accretion expense was primarily attributable to costs associated with the acquisition, lease or construction of new sites since the beginning of the prior-year period, which resulted in an increase in property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization. 
    
  Other Operating Expenses 

The decrease in other operating expenses for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   was primarily attributable to a decrease of   $11.6 million   in integration, acquisition and merger related expenses, partially offset by an increase of   $10.9 million   in losses on sales or disposals of assets and impairments. 
    
  The decrease in other operating expenses for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was primarily attributable to a decrease of   $12.6 million   in integration, acquisition and merger related expenses, partially offset by an increase of   $9.2 million   in losses on sales or disposals of assets and impairments. 

41 

Other Expense 

The decrease in other expense during the   three months ended September 30, 2016   was primarily due to foreign currency losses of   $12.4 million   in the current period, compared to foreign currency losses of   $69.1 million   in the prior-year period, partially offset by incremental interest expense of   $40.4 million  , due to an increase in our annualized weighted-average cost of borrowing of 52 basis points and a $1.8 billion increase in our average debt outstanding.  
    
  The decrease in other expense during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was primarily due to foreign currency losses of   $29.9 million   in the current period, compared to foreign currency losses of   $121.9 million   in the prior-year period, and a gain on retirement of long-term obligations of   $0.8 million   attributable to the repayment of the Secured Tower Cellular Site Revenue Notes, Series 2012-1 Class A, compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , where we recorded a loss of $78.8 million, primarily due to the redemption of the 7.000% senior notes due 2017. This decrease was partially offset by incremental interest expense of   $84.8 million  , due to a $2.3 billion increase in our average debt outstanding. 
    
  Income Tax Provision 

As a real estate investment trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes ( REIT ), we may deduct earnings distributed to stockholders against the income generated by our REIT operations. In addition, we are able to offset certain income by utilizing our net operating losses ( NOLs ), subject to specified limitations. Consequently, the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations for the three and   nine months ended September 30,     2016   and   2015   differs from the federal statutory rate.  
    
  The decrease in the income tax provision for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was primarily attributable to a one-time charge in 2015 related to the MIP Tower Holdings LLC ( MIPT ) tax election described below, offset by an increase in foreign taxable earnings, largely due to the Viom Acquisition, as well as uncertain tax positions. 
    
  Effective July 25, 2015, the Company filed a tax election, pursuant to which MIPT no longer operates as a separate REIT for federal and state income tax purposes. In connection with this and related elections, the Company incurred a one-time cash tax charge of $93.0 million, net of a one-time deferred income tax benefit during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015.  

42 

Net Income/Adjusted EBITDA and Net Income/NAREIT FFO/ Consolidated AFFO 

43 

_______________ 
           (1) 
    Primarily includes realized and unrealized (gains) losses on foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. 
              (2) 
    Primarily includes integration and acquisition-related costs. 
              (3)  
    As the one-time tax charge incurred in connection with the MIPT tax election is nonrecurring, we do not believe it is an indication of our operating performance and believe it is more meaningful to reflect our AFFO metrics excluding this impact. Accordingly, we present our AFFO metrics for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 excluding this charge.  
       
  Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 
    
  The increase in net income was primarily due to an increase in our operating profit and decreases in income tax provision and foreign currency losses included in other expense, partially offset by increases in depreciation, amortization and accretion expense and interest expense.

The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily attributable to the increase in our gross margin and was partially offset by an increase in SG A of $14.9 million, excluding the impact of stock-based compensation expense. 
    
  The growth in consolidated AFFO and AFFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders was primarily attributable to the increase in our operating profit, partially offset by increases in interest and income tax, including adjustments.  
    
  Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 
    
  The increase in net income was primarily due to an increase in our operating profit, a decrease in foreign currency losses included in other expense, a reduction of   $79.6 million   in loss on retirement of long-term obligations, partially offset by increases in depreciation, amortization and accretion expense and interest expense. 
    
  The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily attributable to the increase in our gross margin and was partially offset by an increase in SG A of $53.0 million, excluding the impact of stock-based compensation expense. 
    
  The growth in consolidated AFFO and AFFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders was primarily attributable to the increase in our operating profit, partially offset by increases in interest and income tax, including adjustments, and an increase in dividends on preferred stock.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  The information in this section updates as of   September 30, 2016   the  Liquidity and Capital Resources  section of the 2015 Form 10-K and should be read in conjunction with that report.  
    
  Overview 
  As a holding company, our cash flows are derived primarily from the operations of, and distributions from, our operating subsidiaries or funds raised through borrowings under our credit facilities and debt or equity offerings.    
  The following table summarizes the significant components of our liquidity (in thousands):   

  Subsequent to   September 30, 2016  , we borrowed an additional   $140.0 million   under our multicurrency senior unsecured revolving credit facility entered into in January 2012 and amended and restated in September 2014, as further amended (the  2014 Credit Facility ). 
  Summary cash flow information is set forth below (in thousands): 

We use our cash flows to fund our operations and investments in our business, including tower maintenance and improvements, communications site construction and managed network installations and tower and land acquisitions. Additionally, we use our cash flows to make distributions, including distributions of our REIT taxable income to maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. We may also repay or repurchase our existing indebtedness from time to time. We typically fund our international expansion efforts primarily through a combination of cash on hand, intercompany debt and equity contributions. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had total outstanding indebtedness of   $18.8 billion   with a current portion of $242.6 million. During the   nine months ended September 30,     2016  , we generated sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our capital expenditures and debt service obligations, as well as our required distributions. We believe cash generated by operating activities during the year ending   December 31, 2016  , together with our borrowing capacity under our credit facilities, will be sufficient to fund our required distributions, capital expenditures, debt service obligations (interest and principal repayments) and signed acquisitions. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had $399.4 million of cash and cash equivalents held by our foreign subsidiaries, of which $149.0 million was held by our joint ventures and minority interest holders. While certain subsidiaries may pay us interest or principal on intercompany debt, it has not been our practice to repatriate earnings from our foreign subsidiaries primarily due to our ongoing expansion efforts and related capital needs. However, in the event that we do repatriate any funds, we may be required to accrue and pay taxes. 
  
   46 

Cash Flows from Operating Activities 
    
  The increase in cash provided by operating activities for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was attributable to an increase in the operating profit of our property segments, decreases in cash paid for taxes and cash used for working capital, partially offset by higher cash paid for interest.  
    
  Cash Flows from Investing Activities 
    
  Our significant investing activities during the   nine months ended September 30,     2016   are highlighted below:  

We spent approximately $1.1 billion for the Viom Acquisition. 

We spent   $489.1 million   for capital expenditures, as follows (in millions): 

_______________ 
           (1) 
    Includes the construction of   1,255   communications sites globally. 
              (2) 
    Includes $13.8 million of capital lease payments included in Repayments of notes payable, credit facilities, senior notes, term loan and capital leases in the cash flow from financing activities in our condensed consolidated statements of cash flows.  
       
  We plan to continue to allocate our available capital, after satisfying our distribution requirements, among investment alternatives that meet our return on investment criteria, while taking into account the repayment of debt, as necessary, consistent with our long-term financial policies. Accordingly, we expect to continue to deploy our capital through our annual capital expenditure program, including land purchases and new site construction, and through acquisitions. We expect that our   2016   total capital expenditures, including expected capital expenditures related to ATC TIPL, will be between   $685 million   and   $785 million  , as follows (in millions):  

_______________  
  (1)    Includes the construction of approximately   1,750   to   2,250   communications sites globally.

Cash Flows from Financing Activities 
    
  Our significant financing activities were as follows (in millions):   

Senior Notes Offerings 
    
  3.300%   Senior Notes and   4.400%   Senior Notes Offering.   On January 12, 2016, we completed a registered public offering of   $750.0 million   aggregate principal amount of   3.300%   senior unsecured notes due 2021 (the    3.300%   Notes ) and   $500.0 million   aggregate principal amount of   4.400%   senior unsecured notes due 2026 (the    4.400%   Notes ). The net proceeds from this offering were approximately   $1,237.2 million  , after deducting commissions and estimated expenses. We used the proceeds to repay existing indebtedness under our multicurrency senior unsecured revolving credit facility entered into in June 2013, as amended (the  2013 Credit Facility ), and for general corporate purposes. 
  The   3.300%   Notes will mature on February 15, 2021 and bear interest at a rate of   3.300%   per annum. The   4.400%   Notes will mature on February 15, 2026 and bear interest at a rate of   4.400%   per annum. Accrued and unpaid interest on the notes will be payable in U.S. Dollars semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, beginning on August 15, 2016. Interest on the notes is computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months and commenced accruing on January 12, 2016.  
    
    3.375%   Senior Notes Offering.   On May 13, 2016, we completed a registered public offering of   $1.0 billion   aggregate principal amount of   3.375%   senior unsecured notes due 2026 (the    3.375%   Notes ). The net proceeds from this offering were approximately   $981.5 million  , after deducting commissions and estimated expenses. We used the proceeds to repay existing indebtedness under the 2013 Credit Facility.   
    
  The   3.375%   Notes will mature on October 15, 2026 and bear interest at a rate of   3.375%   per annum. Accrued and unpaid interest on the notes will be payable in U.S. Dollars semi-annually in arrears on April 15 and October 15 of each year, beginning on October 15, 2016. Interest on the notes is computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months and commenced accruing on May 13, 2016. 
    
  2.250%   Senior Notes and   3.125%   Senior Notes Offering.   On September 30, 2016, we completed a registered public offering of   $600.0 million   aggregate principal amount of   2.250%   senior unsecured notes due 2022 (the    2.250%   Notes ) and   $400.0 million   aggregate principal amount of   3.125%   senior unsecured notes due 2027 (the    3.125%   Notes ). The net proceeds from this offering were approximately   $990.6 million  , after deducting commissions and estimated expenses. We used the proceeds to repay existing indebtedness under our unsecured term loan entered into in October 2013, as amended (the  Term Loan ). 
    
  The   2.250%   Notes will mature on January 15, 2022 and bear interest at a rate of   2.250%   per annum. The   3.125%   Notes will mature on January 15, 2027 and bear interest at a rate of   3.125%   per annum. Accrued and unpaid interest on the notes will be payable in U.S. Dollars semi-annually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year, beginning on January 15, 2017. Interest on the notes is computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30- 
  
   48 

day months and commenced accruing on September 30, 2016. We entered into interest rate swaps, which were designated as fair value hedges at inception, to hedge against changes in fair value of the debt under the   2.250%   Notes resulting from changes in interest rates. As of September 30, 2016, the interest rate on the   2.250%   Notes, after giving effect to the interest rate swap agreements, was   1.75%  .  
    
  We may redeem each series of notes at any time, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes plus a make-whole premium, together with accrued interest to the redemption date. If we redeem the   3.300%   Notes on or after January 15, 2021, the   4.400%   Notes on or after November 15, 2025, the   3.375%   Notes on or after July 15, 2026 or the   3.125%   Notes on or after October 15, 2026, we will not be required to pay a make-whole premium. In addition, if we undergo a change of control and corresponding ratings decline, each as defined in the applicable supplemental indenture, we may be required to repurchase all of the applicable notes at a purchase price equal to   101%   of the principal amount of such notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest (including additional interest, if any), up to but not including the repurchase date. The notes rank equally with all of our other senior unsecured debt and are structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other obligations of our subsidiaries.  
    
  The supplemental indentures contain certain covenants that restrict our ability to merge, consolidate or sell assets and our (together with our subsidiaries ) ability to incur liens. These covenants are subject to a number of exceptions, including that we, and our subsidiaries, may incur certain liens on assets, mortgages or other liens securing indebtedness if the aggregate amount of such liens does not exceed   3.5  x Adjusted EBITDA, as defined in the applicable supplemental indenture. 
    
  Bank Facilities 
    
  2013 Credit Facility.    During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we borrowed an aggregate of   $1.4 billion  , which included borrowings of 38.0 million Euro ($42.7 million as of September 30, 2016) by one of our Germany subsidiaries, and repaid an aggregate of   $2.5 billion   of revolving indebtedness under the 2013 Credit Facility. We primarily used the borrowings to fund the Viom Acquisition. We currently have   $3.2 million   of undrawn letters of credit and maintain the ability to draw down and repay amounts under the 2013 Credit Facility in the ordinary course. 
    
  2014 Credit Facility.    During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we borrowed an aggregate of   $80.0 million   and repaid an aggregate of   $220.0 million   of revolving indebtedness under the 2014 Credit Facility. We currently have   $7.4 million   of undrawn letters of credit and maintain the ability to draw down and repay amounts under the 2014 Credit Facility in the ordinary course. 
    
  Term Loan   During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we repaid   $1.0 billion   of indebtedness under the Term Loan. 
    
  The Term Loan, the 2013 Credit Facility and the 2014 Credit Facility do not require amortization of principal and may be paid prior to maturity in whole or in part at our option without penalty or premium. We have the option of choosing either a defined base rate or the London Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR ) as the applicable base rate for borrowings under the Term Loan, the 2013 Credit Facility and the 2014 Credit Facility. The interest rates range between 1.000% to 2.000% above LIBOR for LIBOR based borrowings or up to 1.000% above the defined base rate for base rate borrowings, in each case based upon our debt ratings. The margin over LIBOR for each of the Term Loan, the 2013 Credit Facility and the 2014 Credit Facility is 1.250%. 
  The 2013 Credit Facility and the 2014 Credit Facility are subject to two optional renewal periods. We must pay a quarterly commitment fee on the undrawn portion of the 2013 Credit Facility and the 2014 Credit Facility, which ranges from 0.100% to 0.400% per annum, based upon our debt ratings, and is currently 0.150%. 
  The loan agreements for each of the Term Loan, the 2013 Credit Facility and the 2014 Credit Facility contain certain reporting, information, financial and operating covenants and other restrictions (including limitations on additional debt, guaranties, sales of assets and liens) with which we must comply. Failure to comply with the financial and operating covenants of the loan agreements could not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds under the revolving credit facilities, but may constitute a default, which could result in, among other things, the amounts outstanding, including all accrued interest and unpaid fees, becoming immediately due and payable. 
  
   49 

Viom indebtedness.    Amounts outstanding and key terms of the Viom indebtedness, primarily assumed by us in connection with the Viom Acquisition, consisted of the following as of   September 30, 2016   (in millions, except percentages): 

The Viom indebtedness includes several term loans, ranging from   one   to   ten   years, which are generally secured by the borrower s short-term and long-term assets. Each of the term loans bear interest at the applicable bank s Marginal Cost of Funds based Lending Rate or base rate, plus a spread. Interest rates on the term loans are fixed until certain annual reset dates. Generally, the term loans can be repaid without penalty on the annual reset dates; earlier repayments require notice to the lenders and are subject to prepayment penalties, typically of   1%   to   2%  . Scheduled repayment terms include either ratable or staggered amortization with repayments typically commencing between six and 36 months after the initial disbursement of funds.  
  The debenture     is secured by the borrower s long-term assets, including property and equipment and intangible assets. The debenture bears interest at a base rate plus a spread of   0.6%  . The base rate is set in advance for each quarterly coupon period. Should the actual base rate be between   9.75%   and   10.25%  , the revised base rate is assumed to be   10.00%   for purposes of the reset. Additionally, the spread is subject to reset   36   and   48   months from the issuance date of April 27, 2015.  The holders of the debenture must reach a consensus on the revised spread and the borrower must redeem all of the debentures held by holders from whom consensus is not achieved. Additionally, the debenture is required to be redeemed by the borrower if it does not maintain a minimum credit rating.  
  The Viom indebtedness includes several working capital facilities, most of which are subject to annual renewal, which are generally secured by the borrower s short-term and long-term assets. The working capital facilities bear interest at rates that are comprised of base rates plus spreads. Generally, the working capital facilities are payable on demand prior to maturity. 
  Viom preference shares.    As of   September 30, 2016  , ATC TIPL had   166,666,666   mandatorily redeemable preference shares (the  Preference Shares ) outstanding, which are required to be redeemed in cash. Accordingly, we recognized debt of   1.67 billion   INR (  $25.0 million  ) related to the Preference Shares. 
  Unless redeemed earlier, the Preference Shares will be redeemed in two equal installments on March 26, 2017 and March 26, 2018 in an amount equal to   ten   INR per share along with a redemption premium, as defined in the investment agreement, which equates to a compounded return of   13.5%   per annum. ATC TIPL, at its option, may redeem the Preference Shares prior to the aforementioned dates, subject to an additional   2%   redemption premium. 
  Stock Repurchase Program.   In March 2011, our Board of Directors approved a $1.5 billion stock repurchase program, pursuant to which we are authorized to repurchase up to an additional $1.1 billion of our common stock. Since September 2013, we have temporarily suspended repurchases under the program.   
  Sales of Equity Securities.   We receive proceeds from sales of our equity securities pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan ( ESPP ) and upon exercise of stock options granted under our equity incentive plans. For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we received an aggregate of   $76.6 million   in proceeds upon exercises of stock options and from the ESPP. 
  Distributions.   As a REIT, we must annually distribute to our stockholders an amount equal to at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (determined before the deduction for distributed earnings and excluding any net capital gain). Generally, we have distributed, and expect to continue to distribute, all or substantially all of our REIT taxable income after taking into consideration our utilization of NOLs. We have distributed an aggregate of approximately $2.9 billion to our common stockholders, including the dividend paid in October 2016, primarily subject to taxation as ordinary income. 
  
   50 

The amount, timing and frequency of future distributions will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on various factors, a number of which may be beyond our control, including our financial condition and operating cash flows, the amount required to maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT and reduce any income and excise taxes that we otherwise would be required to pay, limitations on distributions in our existing and future debt and preferred equity instruments, our ability to utilize NOLs to offset our distribution requirements, limitations on our ability to fund distributions using cash generated through our taxable REIT subsidiaries and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant. 
    
  We have two series of preferred stock outstanding,   5.25%   Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, Series A, par value   $0.01   per share (the  Series A ), with a dividend rate of 5.25%, and   5.50%   Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, Series B, par value   $0.01   per share (the  Series B ), with a dividend rate of 5.50%. Dividends are payable quarterly in arrears, subject to declaration by our Board of Directors. During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we paid dividends of   $3.9375   per share, or   $23.6 million  , to Series A preferred stockholders of record and   $41.25   per share, or   $56.7 million  , to Series B preferred stockholders of record. 
  In addition, in October 2016, we declared dividends of $1.3125 per share, or $7.9 million, payable on November 15, 2016 to Series A preferred stockholders of record at the close of business on November 1, 2016 and $13.75 per share, or $18.9 million, payable on November 15, 2016 to Series B preferred stockholders of record at the close of business on November 1, 2016. 
  During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we paid   $1.53   per share, or   $649.6 million  , to common stockholders of record. In addition, we declared a distribution of   $0.55   per share, or   $234.1 million  , payable on October 17, 2016 to our common stockholders of record at the close of business on September 30, 2016. 
  We accrue distributions on unvested restricted stock units, which are payable upon vesting. As of   September 30,     2016  , the amount accrued for distributions payable related to unvested restricted stock units was   $5.8 million  . During the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , we paid   $2.4 million   of distributions upon the vesting of restricted stock units.

     Additional information regarding our contractual debt obligations is set forth under the caption  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk  in Part I, Item 3 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  
    
  Factors Affecting Sources of Liquidity 
       
  As discussed in the  Liquidity and Capital Resources  section of the 2015 Form 10-K, our liquidity depends on our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities, borrow funds under our credit facilities and maintain compliance with the contractual agreements governing our indebtedness. We believe that the debt agreements discussed below represent those of our material debt agreements with covenants with respect to which our compliance would be material to an investor s understanding of our financial results and the impact of those results on our liquidity. 
            
     Restrictions Under Loan Agreements Relating to Our Credit Facilities  . The loan agreements for the 2014 Credit Facility, the 2013 Credit Facility and the Term Loan contain certain financial and operating covenants and other restrictions applicable to us and our subsidiaries that are not designated as unrestricted subsidiaries on a consolidated basis. These restrictions include limitations on additional debt, distributions and dividends, guaranties, sales of assets and liens. The loan agreements also contain covenants that establish financial tests with which we and our restricted subsidiaries must comply related to total leverage and senior secured leverage, as set forth in the table below. In the event that our debt ratings fall below investment grade, we must maintain an interest coverage ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to Interest Expense (each as defined in the applicable loan agreement) of at least 2.50:1.00. As of   September 30, 2016  , we were in compliance with each of these covenants. 

_______________ 
  (1)    Each component of the ratio as defined in the applicable loan agreement. 
  (2)    Assumes no change to Adjusted EBITDA. 
  (3)    Assumes no change to our debt levels.  
  (4)    Effectively, however, the capacity under this ratio would be limited to the capacity under the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio. 
    
  The loan agreements for our credit facilities also contain reporting and information covenants that require us to provide financial and operating information to the lenders within certain time periods. If we are unable to provide the required information on a timely basis, we would be in breach of these covenants. 
  
   53 

Failure to comply with the financial maintenance tests and certain other covenants of the loan agreements for our credit facilities could not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds under these credit facilities, but may constitute a default under these credit facilities, which could result in, among other things, the amounts outstanding, including all accrued interest and unpaid fees, becoming immediately due and payable. If this were to occur, we may not have sufficient cash on hand to repay such indebtedness. The key factors affecting our ability to comply with the debt covenants described above are our financial performance relative to the financial maintenance tests defined in the loan agreements for these credit facilities and our ability to fund our debt service obligations. Based upon our current expectations, we believe our operating results during the next 12 months will be sufficient to comply with these covenants. 
    
  Restrictions Under Agreements Relating to the 2015 Securitization and the 2013 Securitization  . The indenture and related supplemental indentures (collectively, the  2015 Indenture ) governing the American Tower Secured Revenue Notes, Series 2015-1, Class A (the  Series 2015-1 Notes ) and the American Tower Secured Revenue Notes, Series 2015-2, Class A (the  Series 2015-2 Notes,  and, together with the Series 2015-1 Notes, the  2015 Notes ) issued by GTP Acquisition Partners I, LLC ( GTP Acquisition Partners ) in a private securitization transaction in May 2015 (the  2015 Securitization ) and the loan agreement related to the securitization transaction completed in March 2013 (the  2013 Securitization ) include certain financial ratios and operating covenants and other restrictions customary for transactions subject to rated securitizations. Among other things, American Tower Asset Sub, LLC and American Tower Asset Sub II, LLC (together, the  AMT Asset Subs ) and GTP Acquisition Partners are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets, subject to customary carve-outs for ordinary course trade payables and permitted encumbrances (as defined in the applicable agreement).  
  Under the agreements, amounts due will be paid from the cash flows generated by the assets securing the 2015 Notes or the assets securing the nonrecourse loan that secures the Secured Tower Revenue Securities, Series 2013-1A and Series 2013-2A issued in the 2013 Securitization (the  Loan ), as applicable, which must be deposited into certain reserve accounts, and thereafter distributed, solely pursuant to the terms of the applicable agreement. On a monthly basis, after payment of all required amounts under the applicable agreement, subject to the conditions described in the table below, the excess cash flows generated from the operation of such assets are released to GTP Acquisition Partners or the AMT Asset Subs, as applicable, which can then be distributed to, and used by, us. As of   September 30, 2016  , $102.1 million held in such reserve accounts was classified as restricted cash.  
    
  Certain information with respect to the 2015 Securitization and the 2013 Securitization is set forth below ($ in millions). The debt service coverage ratio ( DSCR ) is generally calculated as the ratio of the net cash flow (as defined in the applicable agreement) to the amount of interest, servicing fees and trustee fees required to be paid over the succeeding 12 months on the principal amount of the 2015 Notes or the Loan, as applicable, that will be outstanding on the payment date following such date of determination.  
  
   54 

_______________ 
           (1) 
    Based on the net cash flow of the applicable issuer or borrower as of   September 30, 2016   and the expenses payable over the next 12 months on the 2015 Notes or the Loan, as applicable.  
              (2) 
    Once triggered, a Cash Trap DSCR condition continues to exist until the DSCR exceeds the Cash Trap DSCR for two consecutive calendar quarters. 
              (3) 
    An amortization period commences if the DSCR is equal to or below 1.15x (the  Minimum DSCR ) at the end of any calendar quarter and continues to exist until the DSCR exceeds the Minimum DSCR for two consecutive calendar quarters.  
              (4) 
    No amortization period is triggered if the outstanding principal amount of a series has not been repaid in full on the applicable anticipated repayment date. However, in such event, additional interest will accrue on the unpaid principal balance of the applicable series, and such series will begin to amortize on a monthly basis from excess cash flow. 
              (5) 
    An amortization period exists if the outstanding principal amount has not been paid in full on the applicable anticipated repayment date and continues to exist until such principal has been repaid in full.  
       
  A failure to meet the noted DSCR tests could prevent GTP Acquisition Partners or the AMT Asset Subs from distributing excess cash flow to us, which could affect our ability to fund our capital expenditures, including tower construction and acquisitions, meet REIT distribution requirements and make preferred stock dividend payments. During an  amortization period , all excess cash flow and any amounts then in the reserve accounts because the DSCR was equal to or below the Cash Trap DSCR would be applied to pay principal of the 2015 Notes or the Loan, as applicable, on each monthly payment date, and so would not be available for distribution to us. Further, additional interest will begin to accrue with respect to any series of the 2015 Notes or subclass of Loan from and after the anticipated repayment date at a per annum rate determined in accordance with the applicable agreement. With respect to the 2015 Notes, upon the occurrence and during an event of default, the applicable trustee may, in its discretion or at the direction of holders of more than 50% of the aggregate outstanding principal of any series of the 2015 Notes, declare such series of 2015 Notes immediately due and payable, in which case any excess cash flow would need to be used to pay holders of such notes. Furthermore, if GTP Acquisition Partners or the AMT Asset Subs were to default on a series of the 2015 Notes or the Loan, the applicable trustee may seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of all or any portion of the 3,603 communications sites that secure the 2015 Notes or the 5,185 wireless and broadcast towers that secure the Loan, respectively, in which case we could lose such sites and the revenue associated with those assets. 
    
  As discussed above, we use our available liquidity and seek new sources of liquidity to repay or repurchase our outstanding indebtedness. In addition, in order to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives and satisfy our distribution requirements, we may need to raise additional capital through financing activities. If we determine that it is desirable or necessary to raise additional capital, we may be unable to do so, or such additional financing may be prohibitively expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness. If we are unable to raise capital when our needs arise, we may not be able to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives, satisfy our REIT distribution requirements, pay preferred stock dividends or refinance our existing indebtedness. 
  In addition, our liquidity depends on our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities. As set forth under the caption  Risk Factors  in Item 1A of the 2015 Form 10-K, we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a small number of tenants and, consequently, a failure by a significant tenant to satisfy its contractual obligations to us could adversely affect our cash flow and liquidity. 
  
   55 

For more information regarding the terms of our outstanding indebtedness, please see note 8 to our consolidated financial statements included in the 2015 Form 10-K. 
   
  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 
  Management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated and condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We evaluate our policies and estimates on an ongoing basis, including those related to impairment of long-lived assets, asset retirement obligations, revenue recognition, rent expense, stock-based compensation, income taxes and accounting for business combinations and acquisitions of assets, which we discussed in the 2015 Form 10-K.  Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. 
  We have reviewed our policies and estimates to determine our critical accounting policies for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . We have made no material changes to the critical accounting policies described in the 2015 Form 10-K. 

Accounting Standards Update

ITEM 3. 
    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 

Interest Rate Risk 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we have one interest rate swap agreement related to debt in Colombia. This swap has been designated as a cash flow hedge, has a notional amount of   $30.4 million   and an interest rate of   5.74%   and expires in April 2021. We also have three interest rate swap agreements related to the 2.250% Notes. These swaps have been designated as fair value hedges, have an aggregate notional amount of   $600.0 million   and an interest rate of one-month LIBOR plus applicable spreads and expire in January 2022. 
   Changes in interest rates can cause interest charges to fluctuate on our variable rate debt. Variable rate debt as of   September 30, 2016   consisted of   $1,840.0 million   under the 2014 Credit Facility,   $137.7 million   under the 2013 Credit Facility,   $1,000.0 million   under the Term Loan,   $600.0 million   under the interest rate swap agreements related to the 2.250% Notes,   $51.4 million   under the South African facility,   $30.4 million   under the interest rate swap agreement related to the Colombian credit facility,   $103.2 million   under the BR Towers debentures and   $39.3 million   under the Brazil credit facility. A 10% increase in current interest rates would result in an additional   $6.3 million   of interest expense for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .  
    
  Foreign Currency Risk 
  We are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily in connection with our foreign subsidiaries and joint ventures internationally. Any transaction denominated in a currency other than the U.S. Dollar is reported in U.S. Dollars at the applicable exchange rate. All assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. Dollars at exchange rates in effect at the end of the applicable fiscal reporting period and all revenues and expenses are translated at average rates for the period. The cumulative translation effect is included in equity as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We may enter into additional foreign currency financial instruments in anticipation of future transactions to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. For the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  ,   39%   of our revenues and   44%   of our total operating expenses were denominated in foreign currencies. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we have incurred intercompany debt that is not considered to be permanently reinvested and similar unaffiliated balances that were denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the subsidiary in which it is recorded. As this debt had not been designated as being a long-term investment in nature, any changes in the foreign currency exchange rates will result in unrealized gains or losses, which will be included in our determination of net income. An adverse change of 10% in the underlying exchange rates of our unsettled intercompany debt and similar unaffiliated balances would result in   $42.0 million   of unrealized losses that would be included in Other expense in our consolidated statements of operations for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . 

ITEM 4. 
    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  We have established disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that material information relating to us, including our consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to the officers who certify our financial reports and to other members of senior management and the Board of Directors. 
  Our management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act )) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of   September 30, 2016   and designed to ensure that the information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the requisite time periods specified in the applicable rules and forms, and that it is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

57 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 
             There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the   three months ended September 30, 2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.  

58 

PART II.  OTHER INFORMATION 
   
                 ITEM 1. 
    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

We periodically become involved in various claims and lawsuits that are incidental to our business. In the opinion of management, after consultation with counsel, there are no matters currently pending that would, in the event of an adverse outcome, have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity. 

ITEM 1A. 
    RISK FACTORS

  Boston, MA 02118 
    
  Dear Hal: 
    
  As we discussed recently, this letter is to confirm that you will be continuing to undertake your current employment duties as, and fulfill the scope of responsibilities for, the position of Executive Vice President, International Operations and President, Latin America and EMEA of American Tower Corporation (   American Tower    or    us    and, with correlative meaning,    our    and    we   ), where you have held your current position since February 2007 and have been employed since March 2001, by and through a relocation to the offices of ATC Brazil Cooperatief U.A., (the    Company   ), an indirectly held, wholly owned subsidiary of American Tower, currently located at Prins Bernhardplein, 200, 1097 JB Amsterdam, The Netherlands and becoming seconded to, or employed by, that organization and/or its Netherlands based subsidiaries and affiliates, as necessary and appropriate to facilitate this change in assignment (this    Assignment   ). During this Assignment you will continue reporting to the Chairman, President and CEO. For expatriate purposes your home location (   Home Location   ) is considered to be Boston (MA), United States, and your host location is Amsterdam, Netherlands. 
    
  Your Annual Salary will remain at the rate of USD $650,000 (Six Hundred Fifty Thousand US Dollars), an amount equal to approximately  503,100 (Five Hundred Three Thousand one Hundred Euros), or approximately  41,925 (Forty-One Thousand Nine Hundred Twenty-Five Euros) per month. You also will remain eligible to receive a discretionary bonus similar to other similarly situated Executive Vice Presidents, which is based upon performance against agreed upon goals and objectives.  
    
  The duration of this Assignment is anticipated to be for a period of twenty-four months (24 months), beginning on June 1, 2016, and ending on May 31, 2018, subject to the provisions of this letter. Prior to the end of this Assignment, your position will be reviewed by you and your Manager and a decision will be made as to whether you shall continue this Assignment in Amsterdam for an extended period of time. Your normal place of work will be the offices of the Company either at its current location Prins Bernhardplein, 200, 1097 JB Amsterdam or such other offices as the Company may open in the Netherlands. The Company s normal hours of work are between 9:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m. Mondays to Fridays, but you agree to work such additional hours as may be necessary for the proper performance of your duties without extra remuneration. 
    
  Your compensation and all reimbursements and allowances contemplated under this letter shall be paid in US Dollars, unless, and only to the extent, it is otherwise mutually agreed. 
    
  You will be eligible for the following allowances and benefits for as long as you remain on assignment under the terms of this letter: 

Allowances  : You shall be eligible for USD $11,550.00 (Eleven Thousand Five Hundred Fifty US Dollars), an amount equal to approximately  10,000 (Ten Thousand Euros) per month which is inclusive of Housing, Educational (for any school age dependent children accompanying you to

Amsterdam), Cost of Living, and Car Allowances. You will also be eligible for a one-time settling in allowance of USD $10,000.00, an amount equal to approximately  8,652 (Eight Thousand Six Hundred Fifty Two Euros).  

Relocation  : Reimbursement of pre-move relocation expenses, including reasonable round trip airfare transportation and expenses for you and your spouse to find housing, reimbursement of household goods shipment, reimbursement of cost of storage of personal effects for duration of assignment if needed, loss on sale of up to two cars, and temporary living in Host Country if needed. 

Home Leave  : Reimbursement of reasonable round trip airfare transportation to your Home Location and reasonable expenses and transit costs en route for you and your dependents two times during each twelve month period with expenses and transit costs that are consistent with the Business Travel and Entertainment Policy. The class of travel will be determined by the International Assignment Policy, which currently states that travel in excess of six hours may be upgraded to business class airfare. Home leave counts towards holiday/flex time and this can be taken at your discretion at any time during the assignment subject to the normal approval process. Travel to locations other than your Home Location will not be reimbursed.  

Visa/Immigration  : Terms and conditions expressed in this letter of assignment are contingent upon receipt of an approved working permit and visa by the corresponding Netherlands immigration authorities. American Tower and the Company, will assist you in securing any necessary visa, registration and immigration paperwork for you and your dependents, and will cover any charges reasonably incurred in this process.  

Repatriation  : Upon completion of this Assignment you and your dependents will be placed back to Boston (MA), United States. 

Other Social Charges  : In the event that there are any other compulsory insurances, taxes or contributions to social services on your part in Netherlands, American Tower or the Company or its affiliate will cover them through direct payment or reimbursement to you, and such payment will be considered as part of the annual tax equalization process. 

Benefits  : As an expatriate on oversees assignment, you will be offered the opportunity to participate in the international medical and dental coverage that American Tower has in place, with coverage provided through Cigna Global Health Benefits. American Tower or the Company will cover the cost of this international medical and dental policy, for you and your dependents, during the duration of this Assignment to the extent it is higher in terms of employee cost than comparable coverage in the United States. You remain eligible to participate in all other U.S. benefit programs, including but not limited to life and disability insurance programs and the 401(k) Plan. Participation in all benefit programs must be in accordance with the terms of each plan and/or program. American Tower reserves the right to amend, update, modify and/or terminate any or all of these programs.  

Emergency Leave  : You will be reimbursed for the cost of reasonable round trip airfare consistent with American Tower s Business Travel and Entertainment Policy should you need to return to United States for a personal or medical emergency, such as a death in the family or serious medical illness during this Assignment. Emergency leave should be communicated with your Manager as soon as possible and approval by your Supervisor should be obtained in advance, where possible. 

Taxes, Tax Equalization and Tax Preparation  : It is the philosophy of American Tower that you pay no more or no less tax than you would in your home country, if you were not on assignment. Therefore,  

William H. Hess 
      Page    3   of   4 

you will have actual or  hypothetical  taxes withheld from your pay, as if you had remained in your home country. Any additional items that might be included as taxable compensation on your behalf due to your assignment, and ultimately result in a higher tax liability, will be the responsibility of American Tower or the Company to pay the taxes. 
    
  Tax equalization is provided to (i) help ensure that you incur no additional tax liability or benefit with respect to base salary, commissions, bonuses and equity paid by American Tower under this agreement, as well as from other personal non-company income and deductions, as a result of having an assignment outside of your home country and (ii) provide tax preparation assistance to ensure compliance with home and host country expatriate tax laws. Each year, a final tax equalization calculation will be prepared to settle your assignment tax obligations. 
    
  The timely gathering and submission of information for filing of tax returns and the payment of income taxes remains your responsibility. To facilitate in the preparation of your home and host country tax returns, American Tower will pay customary and reasonable costs of its designated outside tax consultants for pre-assignment tax counseling, as well as for the preparation of your home and host country tax returns for each year in which you have assignment-related tax impacts. Our designated tax consultants will contact you to discuss any relevant tax implications of this assignment before your arrival in the host country.  
    
  It is your responsibility to comply with home and host country tax laws and other applicable tax requirements while on international assignment. Any tax penalties or interest resulting from improper reporting or delays attributable to your action will be your responsibility. 
    
  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the tax equalization arrangement described above is subject to review and change should your tax status in your home country change during or prior to this Assignment.  
    
  With regard to any provision in this letter that provides for reimbursement of costs and expenses or in-kind benefits, except as permitted by Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,: the right to reimbursement or in-kind benefits shall not be subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit;, the amount of expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits provided during any taxable year, shall not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement, or in-kind benefits to be provided in any other taxable year; and such payments shall be made on or before the last day of the Participant s taxable year following the taxable year in which the expense occurred. 
    
  By signing this agreement, you are authorizing American Tower's designated outside tax consultants to release any pertinent information to American Tower relating to the period of your assignment.  
    
  Termination  : You will be eligible to receive severance benefits afforded to Company Executive Vice Presidents under the American Tower Corporation Severance Program and the policies thereunder. In the event that this Assignment is terminated by American Tower or the Company without Cause (as defined in the American Tower Corporation Severance Program), then American Tower or the Company will reimburse all reasonable expenses associated with your relocation back to your Home Location. Further, though severance would not be applicable, should there be a mutual decision for an early termination of this Assignment such reasonable relocation expenses would be reimbursed.  
    
  The terms contained in this letter will serve as the terms and conditions of your assignment. Once your relocation process has been completed, to the extent there is any material variation from achieving the intended equalization under actual conditions encountered, these terms and conditions of this letter of assignment could be amended, under mutual agreement between you and American Tower. 

William H. Hess 
      Page    4   of   4 

This letter agreement, unless earlier terminated or amended, and its terms and conditions, including, its allowances and benefits, will remain in effect until the above stated ending date, but may be extended by the mutual written agreement of the parties.

AMENDMENT TO CONTRACT OF EMPLOYMENT  
    
  The undersigned: 
    
           1. 
    American Tower Corporation,     a Delaware corporation, having its principal place of business at 116 Huntington Ave., 11   th    Floor, Boston, MA 02116, duly represented by Edmund DiSanto, hereinafter referred to as the  Employer  

Whereas: 

Employer and Employee have agreed to an employment agreement for a period of 2 years starting on June 1, 2016; 
                
    Employee   and Employer   wishes to make use of the so-called 30%-ruling, as laid down in the relevant provisions of the 1964 Dutch Wage Tax Act and the 1965 Dutch Wage Tax Implementation Decree; 
                
    Employer and Employee will therefore file an application for the 30%-ruling; 

Have agreed as follows: 
    
           a) 
    If and to the extent that, based on article 10ea of the Dutch Wage Tax Implementation Decree 1965 ( DWTID 1965 ),  the Employee is eligible for a defined tax-free reimbursement for extra-territorial expenses (under the so called work-related cost scheme) or a tax free reimbursement  in case the regime of tax-free reimbursement and benefits in kind is still applicable, it will be agreed that the remuneration for present employment agreed with the Employee will be reduced for labour law purposes in such a way that 100/70 of the thus agreed remuneration for present employment is equal to the originally agreed remuneration for present employment. 
       
           b) 
    If and to the extent that part (a) is applied, the Employee shall receive from the Employer a reimbursement for extra-territorial expenses equal to 30/70 of the thus agreed remuneration for present employment. 

William Hess 
  September 30, 2016 
    Page 2   of 2 

c) 
    The Employee and the Employer are aware of the fact that implementing the tax free reimbursement for extra-territorial expenses cannot result in a lower taxable salary as referred to in article 10eb of DWTID 1965 and the fact that the tax free reimbursement for extra-territorial expenses may be less than 30/70 of the thus agreed remuneration. 
       
           d) 
    The Employee is aware of the fact that adjustment of the agreed remuneration pursuant to (a) may in view of the applicable regulations have consequences for all remuneration-related benefits and payments   (such as pension payments and social security benefits).

  STATEMENT REGARDING COMPUTATION OF RATIO OF EARNINGS TO FIXED CHARGES 
  AND RATIO OF EARNINGS TO COMBINED FIXED CHARGES AND PREFERRED STOCK DIVIDENDS 
    
  The following table reflects the computation of the ratio of earnings to fixed charges and ratio of earnings to combined fixed charges and preferred stock dividends for the periods presented (in thousands): 

_______________ 
           (1) 
    Interest expense includes amortization of deferred financing costs. Interest expense also includes an amount related to our capital lease with TV Azteca. 
              (2) 
    For the purposes of this calculation,  earnings  consists of income from continuing operations before income taxes and income on equity method investments, as well as fixed charges (excluding interest capitalized and amortization of interest capitalized).  Fixed charges  consists of interest expensed and capitalized, amortization of debt discounts, premiums and related issuance costs and the component of rental expense associated with operating leases believed by management to be representative of the interest factor thereon.

  CERTIFICATION OF PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICER PURSUANT TO SECTION 302 OF THE 
  SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002 
    
  I, James D. Taiclet, Jr., certify that: 
           1. 
    I have reviewed this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q of American Tower Corporation; 
              2. 
    Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report;
