regarding our goals, beliefs, strategies, objectives, plans, including product and service developments, future financial conditions,
results or projections or current expectations. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such
as  may,   will,   should,   expect,   plan,   anticipate, 
 believe,   estimate,   predict,   potential  or  continue,  the negative

NOTE
1: ORGANIZATION, DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS, GOING CONCERN AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION   

NuState
Energy Holdings, Inc. ,  or the Company, currently is a Florida corporation that was incorporated in Nevada in October 1987.
It was formerly known as Jaguar Investments, Inc. between October 1987 and May 2003, Power2Ship, Inc. between May 2003 and November
2006, and Fittipaldi Logistics, Inc. between November 2006 and December 2007.  

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. For the three months ended September 30, 2016 the
Company had a net loss of $686,964 and had net cash used in operating activities of $41,806. In addition, the Company had an accumulated
deficit and a working capital deficit of approximately $42.2 million and $4.3 million, respectively, at September 30, 2016.  These
matters raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.  The Company s ability
to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay
its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due, to fund possible future acquisitions, and to generate
profitable operations in the future. Management plans to provide for the Company s capital requirements by continuing to
issue additional equity and debt securities. The outcome of these matters cannot be predicted at this time and there are no assurances
that, if achieved, the Company will have sufficient funds to execute its business plan or generate positive operating results.
 The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome
of this uncertainty.   

Basis
of Presentation   

The
unaudited interim financial information furnished herein reflects all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring items,
which in the opinion of management are necessary to fairly state NuState Energy Holdings, Inc. s (the  Company 
or  we ,  us  or  our ) financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the dates
and periods presented and to make such information not misleading. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included
in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
have been omitted pursuant to rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ), nevertheless,
management of the Company believes that the disclosures herein are adequate to make the information presented not misleading.  

These
unaudited financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s audited financial statements for the year
ended June 30, 2016, contained in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K/A filed with the SEC on October 14, 2016. The
results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016, are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected
for any other interim period or the fiscal year ending June 30, 2017.  

NOTE
2: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

Use
of Estimates   

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reporting amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reported period. Actual results will differ from those estimates. Included in these estimates are the valuation of
derivative liabilities, stock-based compensation, and deferred tax asset valuation allowance..  

Cash
and Cash Equivalents   

The
Company considers all highly liquid, temporary, cash equivalents with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased,
to be cash equivalents. The Company had no cash equivalents during the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

Concentration
of Credit Risks   

The
Company is subject to a concentration of credit risk from cash.  

The
Company s cash account is held at a financial institution and is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or
FDIC, up to $250,000. During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company had not reached a bank balance exceeding
the FDIC insurance limit.  

Derivative
Liabilities   

The
Company assessed the classification of its derivative financial instruments as of September 30, 2016 and 2015, which consist of
convertible instruments and rights to shares of the Company s common stock, and determined that such derivatives meet the
criteria for liability classification under ASC 815.  

ASC
815 generally provides three criteria that, if met, require companies to bifurcate conversion options from their host instruments
and account for them as free standing derivative financial instruments. These three criteria include circumstances in which (a)
the economic characteristics and risks of the embedded derivative instrument are not clearly and closely related to the economic
characteristics and risks of the host contract, (b) the hybrid instrument that embodies both the embedded derivative instrument
and the host contract is not re-measured at fair value under otherwise applicable generally accepted accounting principles with
changes in fair value reported in earnings as they occur and (c) a separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative
instrument would be considered a derivative instrument subject to the requirements of ASC 815. ASC 815 also provides an exception
to this rule when the host instrument is deemed to be conventional, as described.

NOTE
2: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, continued   

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments   

The
Company accounts, for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, in accordance with ASC Topic 820, Fair
Value Measurements and Disclosures, or ASC 820. ASC 820 establishes a common definition for fair value to be applied to existing
generally accepted accounting principles that require the use of fair value measurements, establishes a framework for measuring
fair value, and expands disclosure about such fair value measurements.  

ASC
820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants at the measurement date. Additionally, ASC 820 requires the use of valuation techniques that maximize
the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. These inputs are prioritized below:  

Level
    1:   
      Observable
    inputs such as quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.   

Level
    2:   
      Observable
    market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data.   

Level
    3:   
      Unobservable
    inputs for which there is little or no market data, which require the use of the reporting entity s own assumptions.   

The
Company s derivative liability at September 30, 2016 and 2015 is classified as Level 3 financial instrument.  

Additional
Disclosures Regarding Fair Value Measurements   

The
carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, other receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses, accrued compensation, note
and convertible promissory notes payable, and liabilities from discontinued operations approximate their fair value due to the
short maturity of these items.  

Convertible
Instruments   

The
Company accounts for convertible instruments (when it has determined that the embedded conversion options should not be bifurcated
from their host instruments) in accordance with ASC 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options. Accordingly, the Company records,
when necessary, discounts to convertible notes for the intrinsic value of conversion options embedded in debt instruments based
upon the differences between the fair value of the underlying common stock at the commitment date of the note transaction and
the effective conversion price embedded in the note. Debt discounts under these arrangements are amortized over the term of the
related debt to their earliest date of redemption. The Company also records deemed dividends for the intrinsic value of conversion
options embedded in preferred shares based upon the differences between the fair value of the underlying common stock at the commitment
date of the note transaction and the effective conversion price embedded in the note.  

ASC
815-40, Contracts in Entity s own Equity, generally provides that, among other things, if an event is not within the entity s
control, such contract could require net cash settlement and shall be classified as an asset or a liability.  

The
Company determines whether the instruments issued in the transactions are considered indexed to the Company s own stock.
During the fiscal years 2015 and 2016 the Company issued convertible securities with variable conversion provisions that resulted
in derivative liabilities.  

Income
Taxes   

The
Company accounts for income taxes pursuant to the provisions of ASC 740-10,  Accounting for Income Taxes,  which requires,
among other things, an asset and liability approach to calculating deferred income taxes. The asset and liability approach requires
the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between
the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is provided to offset any net deferred
tax assets for which management believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred asset will not be realized.  

The
Company follows the provisions of ASC 740-10,  Accounting for Uncertain Income Tax Positions . When tax returns are
filed, it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others
are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained.
In accordance with the guidance of ASC 740-10, the benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the
period during which, based on all available evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be
sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any. Tax positions taken are not offset
or aggregated with other positions. Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured as the
largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing
authority. The portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above
should be reflected as a liability for uncertain tax benefits in the accompanying balance sheet along with any associated interest
and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination. The Company believes its tax positions are all
highly certain of being upheld upon examination. As such, the Company has not recorded a liability for uncertain tax benefits.

Income
Taxes, continued   

The
Company has adopted ASC 740-10-25,    Definition of Settlement  ,  which provides guidance on how an entity
should determine whether a tax position is effectively settled for the purpose of recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits
and provides that a tax position can be effectively settled upon the completion of an examination by a taxing authority without
being legally extinguished. For tax positions considered effectively settled, an entity would recognize the full amount of tax
benefit, even if the tax position is not considered more likely than not to be sustained based solely on the basis of its technical
merits and the statute of limitations remains open. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had not filed tax returns for the tax
years ending June 30, 2008 through 2016 and such returns, when filed, potentially will be subject to audit by the taxing authorities
for a minimum of three years beyond the filing date under the three-year statute of limitations. The Company has not accrued any
potential tax penalties associated with not filing these tax returns. Due to recurring losses, management believes such potential
tax penalties, in any, would not be material in amount.  

Share-Based
Payment   

The
Company accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with ASC Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation, or ASC 718. Under
the fair value recognition provisions of this topic, stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the
fair value of the award and is recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is the
vesting period.  

The
Company has elected to use the Black-Scholes-Merton, or BSM, option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of its options, which
incorporates various subjective assumptions including volatility, risk-free interest rate, expected life, and dividend yield to
calculate the fair value of stock option awards. Compensation expense recognized in the statements of operations is based on awards
ultimately expected to vest and reflects estimated forfeitures. ASC 718 requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant
and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.  

Segment
Reporting   

The
Company operates in one segment, which is to search for possible acquisition targets and merge with an operating company. The
Company s chief operating decision-maker evaluates the performance of the Company based upon expenses by functional areas
as disclosed in the Company s statements of operations.  

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements   

Recent
accounting pronouncements have been issued but deemed by management to be outside the scope of relevance to the Company.  

As
an emerging growth company, we have elected to use the exemption provided for in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act or JOBS
Act allowing us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and
private companies until those standards apply to private companies pursuant to Section 102(b)(1) of the Act.

Basic
and Diluted Earnings Per Share   

Basic
earnings per share are calculated by dividing income available to stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of Common
Stock outstanding during each period. Diluted earnings per share are computed using the weighted average number of shares of Common
Stock and dilutive Common Stock share equivalents outstanding during the period. Dilutive Common Stock share equivalents consist
of shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options and warrants (calculated using the modified-treasury stock method), and
shares underlying convertible promissory notes and convertible preferred stock. Potential common shares includable in the computation
of fully-diluted per-share results are not presented in the financial statements as their affect would be anti-dilutive.  

The
weighted-average potentially dilutive common share equivalents outstanding for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015
are as follows:

NOTE
3: DERIVATIVE LIABILITY   

The
Company accounts for the embedded conversion features included in its convertible instruments as derivative liabilities. The aggregate
fair value of derivative liabilities at September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016 amounted to $385,548 and $636,096, respectively.
For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded a gain related to the change in fair value of the
derivative liability amounting to $250,548 and $5,207, respectively. At each measurement date, the fair value of the embedded
conversion features was based on the Black-Scholes-Merton method using the following assumptions:

Convertible
Notes Payable    

During
the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company had notes payable outstanding in which the conversion rate was
variable and undeterminable. Accordingly, the Company has recognized a derivative liability in connection with such instruments.
The Company uses judgment in determining the fair value of derivative liabilities at the date of issuance and at every balance
sheet thereafter and in determining which valuation method is most appropriate for the instrument (e.g., Black-Scholes-Merton),
the expected volatility, the implied risk free interest rate, as well as the expected dividend rate, if any.  

At
September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016 convertible debentures consisted of the following:

30, 2016, respectively. The Convertible Notes Payable bear interest at rates ranging between 8% and 18% per annum. Interest is
generally payable monthly. The Convertible Notes Payable are generally convertible at rates ranging from $0.005 to $0.0267 per
share, at the holders  option. At September 30, 2016, approximately $1.6 million of convertible promissory notes had matured,
are in default, and remain unpaid.  

Notes
Payable    

The
Company had promissory notes aggregating $280,241 at September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, respectively. The related accrued interest
amounted to approximately $205,000 and $200,000 at September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, respectively. The notes payable bear
interest at rates ranging from 12.5% to 16% per annum which is payable monthly. All promissory notes outstanding as of September
30, 2016 have matured, are in default, and remain unpaid.  

Transactions    

During
the three months ended September 30, 2016 we issued convertible notes to four investors, totaling $40,000. The notes bear interest
at 8% and have a term of sixty days.  

The
Company recognized interest expense of $84,200 and $78,584 during the three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively
which included debt discount amortization of $24,167 and $0 during the three-month period ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

NOTE
6: OBLIGATIONS TO ASC RECAP, LLC   

In
July, 2013, certain of the Company s creditors showed interest in selling their claims against the Company to ASC Recap,
LLC ( ASC ); this group also included both current and past management of the Company. This led to the Company signing
a Liability Purchase Agreement with ASC on July 23, 2013. This Agreement required the Company to issue common shares within five
business days of each purchase at a 25% discount from the market price to ASC in amounts equal to the claims purchased from the
Company s creditors. In addition, under the terms of the Agreement, the Company issued a $25,000 non-interest bearing convertible
promissory note to ASC, as described in Note 5.  

ASC
signed a series of Claim Purchase Agreements with certain creditors of the Company to purchase their claims against the Company
totaling $2,531,565. These claims consisted of notes payable, convertible notes payable, vendor payables and accrued compensation
to the Company s CEO and to a related party. The Claim Purchase Agreements required ASC to settle the creditors  claims
against the Company for a total of $1,305,996. Each Claim Purchase Agreement stipulated that ASC would pay each creditor the agreed-upon
amount in up to twelve (12) monthly installments.  

In
January, 2015, the Company had not issued any shares to ASC as required by the agreement. As a result, ASC filed a complaint in
Leon County, Florida demanding the prescribed issuance of shares from the Company for the purchased claims. A settlement agreement
was reached on February 6, 2015, and on March 12, 2015 ASC Recap filed a motion in Leon County, Florida which forced the Company
to comply. ASC Recap was awarded a $2,531,565 judgement which was to be paid by issuing free trading common stock at a 25% discount
from the market price .  In addition, on May 6, 2015, the Company issued a $125,000 non-interest bearing convertible
promissory note to ASC, as described in Note 4. Between April and June of 2015, the Company issued to ASC 322,220,000 shares of
common stock with an aggregate market value of $365,308, which reduced the recorded liability by $273,981; in July of 2015, the
Company issued 82,980,000 shares of common stock with an aggregate market value of $24,894 (see Note 7).  

On
August 13, 2015 ASC Recap, LLC issued the Company a letter of default related to its agreement to settle outstanding liabilities
and related accrued interest and returned approximately $2,373,000 of liabilities to their original holders, which is detailed
in the table at the end of Note 6. These balances reflect the payments made by ASC to creditors prior to the default.

shares Series C, D, F, H. I. J. and Y were exchanged for shares of Series A preferred stock in November, 2015. These classes of
shares were subsequently cancelled. Issued and outstanding shares of Series C, D, F, H. I. J. and Y of the Company s preferred
stock had a par value of $0.01 per share. All classes rank(ed) prior to any class or series of the Company s common stock
as to the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company or as to the payment of dividends.
All preferred stock shall have no voting rights except if the subject of such vote would reduce the amount payable to the holders
of preferred stock upon liquidation or dissolution of the company and cancel and modify the conversion rights of the holders of
preferred stock as defined in the certificate of designations of the respective series of preferred stock.  

On
October 14, 2015 a former Chairman of the Board of the Company was issued 80 shares of Series F preferred stock with a stated
value of $5,000 and a par value $0.001 per share, and 12 shares of Series H preferred stock, with a stated value of $1,000 and
a par value $0.001 per share in consideration for his forgiveness of $412,000 in accrued compensation. Subsequently, in October
2015, these Series F and Series H shares were exchanged for 1,648,000 shares of Series A preferred stock.  

On
October 28, 2015, preferred shareholders representing a majority of each series of our outstanding preferred stock, voted to cancel
all their shares of preferred stock in exchange for 11,181,340 shares of newly designated Series A preferred stock. The number
of shares of newly issued Series A preferred stock issued to each preferred shareholder was calculated by dividing the total stated
value of their preferred shares by $0.25. The holders of the Series A preferred shares are restricted from converting their shares
to common stock for two years (the  Lock-Up Period ). After the Lock-Up Period, they may convert up to one percent
of their Series A preferred shares into common shares on a one for one basis each month for four years (the  Leak-Out Period ).
However, the conversion price automatically reduces by 86% to $0.035 per share if our common stock is below $0.10 per share. At
the end of the Leak-Out Period, up to all of the remaining Series A preferred shares may be converted to common stock at the shareholders 
discretion.  

On
October 28, 2015 the 87,000 shares of Series Y preferred stock, owned by the Company s former Chairman of the Board, were
exchanged for 87,000 shares of Series A preferred stock. These shares of Series A preferred stock were valued at their fair market
value of $8.70.  

In
November, 2015, we sold 40,000 shares of Series A preferred stock to one investor for $10,000 and sold 100,000 shares of Series
B preferred stock to another investor for $25,000.  

Series
A Preferred Stock   

The
Series A Preferred Stock has a stated value of $0.25 per share. Each one share of Series A Preferred Stock is convertible into
one (1) share of Common Stock. In the event the Common Stock price per share is lower than $0.10 (ten cents) per share then the
Conversion shall be set at $0.035 per share. The Common Stock shares are governed by Lock-Up/Leak-Out Agreements.

2. Management s Discussion and Analysis and Results of Operations   

The
following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the financial statements
and related notes included elsewhere in this report. Certain statements in this discussion and elsewhere in this report constitute
forward-looking statements. See   Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Information   elsewhere
in this report. Because this discussion involves risk and uncertainties, our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated
in these forward-looking statements .    

Overview   

NuState
Energy Holdings, Inc. is a technology company specializing in providing pertinent, real-time information to the worldwide transportation
and security industries. NuState s proprietary software, GPSTrax, is built on an Open Architecture platform for the logistics
and telematics industries.  

We
believe there are many opportunities to leverage and monetize our software technology by licensing it to companies that provide
green technology solutions to medium and large logistics companies. In November 2014, NuState Energy Holdings, Inc. signed a definitive
agreement with The Ronn Motor Group, with offices in Dalian, China and the United States, to license and market GPSTrax in China
and other international markets.  

NuState
is launching a new GPSTrax Value-Added Reseller (VAR) Program, focusing on opportunities in consumer-based solutions such as asset
tracking. The VAR Program will increase awareness, availability and support of the GPSTrax solution at a time when a growing number
of companies are looking to update and optimize their solutions. We expect to generate revenues from this Program during fiscal
2017.  

Our
software technology provides validation and verification of fuel cost consumption reporting and fuel tax credits to logistics
companies. The software also is designed to document the exact amount of reduction of harmful emissions that results from the
alternative energy products. This data will enable users in certain countries to generate emissions credits that are tradable
under the protocol of the Kyoto Treaty.  

Through
our existing relationships in the country of Suriname, NuState is evaluating several projects in the alternative renewable energy
market in Suriname. NuState has been in discussions with AMPS, NV (  AMPS  ), based in Paramaribo, Suriname,
to enter into a license agreement with its partner, The Ronn Motor Group, in relation to the purchase of GPSTrax  for their
multi-million-dollar alternative energy projects. AMPS focuses on providing engineering, procurement and construction management
(EPC) services, Power Transmission   Distribution, Renewable and Conventional Energy as well as Power Management Systems to
Suriname and its fellow Caribbean Community members.  

We
are unable to determine at this time whether we will be successful in capitalizing on the aforementioned opportunities in our
business environment without proper funding.

   RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS   

Discussion
of Results for Three Month Period Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   

Selling,
General, and Administrative Expenses   

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016, selling, general and administrative expenses were $853,311 as compared to $149,224
for the three months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $704,087 or approximately 471.8%. For the three months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015 selling, general and administrative expenses consisted of the following:  

The
increase in selling, general and administrative expenses during fiscal Q1 of 2016, when compared with the prior year, is primarily
due to an increase in stock based compensation of $750,000 and accounting expense of $16,940, related to increased activity, offset
by a decrease in consulting fees of $37,500 and other of $4,728.  

Other
than the one-time stock based compensation expense, we believe that our selling, general, and administrative expenses will continue
at their current rate as we continue to focus our resources on the search for a business opportunity for the remainder of 2016.  

The
change in fair value of derivative liabilities results from the changes in the fair value of the derivative liability due to the
application of ASC 815, resulting in either income or expense, depending on the difference in fair value of the derivative liabilities
between their measurement dates   driven by the
change in the per share price of the Company s common stock  .  

Interest
Expense   

Interest
expense represents stated interest of notes and convertible notes payable, along with the amortization of debt discount. The increase
in interest expense during the three-month period ended September 30, 2016 is primarily due to the increase in interest bearing
promissory notes during the three-month period ending September 30, 2016 when compared to the prior year period and debt discount
amortization expense of $24,167.  

Loss
on Settlement of Debt   

The
loss on debt settlement of $12,135 during the three months ended September 30, 2015 resulted from the return of liabilities from
ASC Recap LLC.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

At
September 30, 2016 we had no assets and at June 30, 2016, our total assets consisted of cash.  

We
do not have any material commitments for capital expenditures.  

The
objective of liquidity management is to ensure that we have ready access to sufficient funds to meet commitments and effectively
implement our growth strategy. Our primary sources are financing activities such as the issuance of notes payable and convertible
notes payable. In the past, we have mostly relied on debt and equity financing to provide for our operating needs.  

We
cannot ascertain that we have sufficient funds from operations to fund our ongoing operating requirements through June 30, 2017.
We may need to raise funds to enhance our working capital and use them for strategic purposes. If such need arises, we intend
to generate proceeds from either debt or equity financing.  

We
intend to finance our operations using a mix of equity and debt financing. We do not anticipate incurring capital expenditures
for the foreseeable future. We anticipate that we will need to raise approximately $180,000 per year in the near term to finance
the recurring costs of being a publicly-traded company. In the long-term, we anticipate we will need to raise a substantial amount
of capital to complete an acquisition. We are unable to quantify the resources we will need to successfully complete an acquisition.
If these funds cannot be obtained, we may not be able to consummate an acquisition or merger, and our business may fail as a result.  

Going
Concern   

The
accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The Company has used net cash in its operating
activities of approximately $41,806 and $87,715 during the thee-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively,
and has a working capital deficit of approximately $4.3 million and $4.5 million at September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2016, respectively.
The Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to obtain the necessary financing to
meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due, to fund possible future
acquisitions, and to generate profitable operations in the future, once a merger with an operating company is consummated. Management
plans may continue to provide for its capital requirements by issuing additional equity securities and debt and the Company will
continue to find possible acquisition targets. The outcome of these matters cannot be predicted at this time and there are no
assurances that if achieved, the Company will have sufficient funds to execute its business plan or generate positive operating
results.  

Three
months ended September 30, 2016   

Net
cash used in operations during the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased by $45,909 or 52% over the same period during
fiscal year 2015. This cash was obtained through the sale of $40,000 of convertible promissory notes.  

Cash
generated from financing activities consists of proceeds of $40,000 from the issuance of convertible notes during the three-month
period.  

Three
months ended September 30, 2015   

Net
cash used in operations during the three months ended September 30, 2015 totaled $87,715. This cash was obtained through the sale
of $110,000 of convertible promissory notes.  

Capital
Raising Transactions   

During
the three months ended September 30, 2016 we issued convertible notes to four investors, totaling $40,000. The notes bear interest
at 8% and have a term of six months.  

Other
outstanding obligations at September 30, 2016   

Convertible
Notes Payable    

The
Company had convertible promissory notes aggregating $1.7 million outstanding at September 30, 2016. The accrued interest amounted
to approximately $1.1 million as of September 30, 2016. The Convertible Notes Payable bear interest at rates ranging between 8%
and 18% per annum. Interest is generally payable monthly. The Convertible Notes Payable are generally convertible at rates ranging
between $0.00125 and $0.30 per share, at the holders  option. At September 30, 2016, all convertible promissory notes have
matured.  

Notes
Payable    

The
Company had promissory notes aggregating $280,241 at September 30, 2016. The related accrued interest amounted to approximately
$205,000 at September 30, 2016. The Notes Payable bear interest at rates ranging between 8% and 16% per annum. Interest is generally
payable monthly. All promissory notes have matured as of September 30, 2016.

Evaluation
of Disclosure Controls and Procedures    

Our
management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer, who is also our principal executive and financial officer,
has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer concluded that, as of September

in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the SEC s rules and forms, including ensuring that such material information is accumulated and communicated
to our Chief Executive Officer to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  

Changes
in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting    

During
the quarter ended September 30, 2016, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

II - OTHER INFORMATION   

Item
1. Legal Proceedings.

September 30, 2016 the Company is not the subject of, or party to, any pending or threatened, legal actions.  

From

However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and an adverse result in these or other matters may arise from time
to time that may harm our business.
