     Table of Contents          INDOOR HARVEST CORP     NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS     (UNAUDITED)        NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES        Basis of presentation      The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). It is management's opinion, however, that all material adjustments (consisting of normal and recurring adjustments) have been made which are necessary for a fair financial statements presentation. The results for the interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year.     Indoor Harvest Corp., or the "Company," is a Texas corporation formed on November 23, 2011. Indoor Harvest Corp., through its brand name Indoor Harvest , is a company specializing in equipment design, development, marketing and direct-selling of commercial grade aeroponics fixtures and supporting systems for use in urban Controlled Environment Agriculture ("CEA") and Building Integrated Agriculture ("BIA").     Indoor Harvest Corp is a Design-Build contractor for the vertical farming and indoor farming industry. The Company's principal lines of business are engineering, procurement and construction services as well as manufacturing a variety of indoor farming fixtures and equipment. The Company provides its products and services worldwide for controlled environment and building integrated agricultural operators.      These unaudited interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed with the SEC on March 30, 2015      Use of estimates      The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.     Significant estimates include, but are not limited to the estimate of percentage of complete on construction contracts in progress at each reporting period which we rely on as a primary basis of revenue recognition, estimated useful lives of equipment for purposes of depreciation and the valuation of common shares issued for services, equipment and the liquidation of liabilities.      Accounts Receivable and Work in progress      Work in process consists of costs recorded and revenue earned on projects recognized on the percentage of completion method for work performed on contracts in progress at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The Company records revenue recognition based on contractual agreements entered into at the inception of construction contracts. Amounts are payable from customers based on milestones established in each contract. Amounts are billed at milestone completion and are reflected as accounts receivable when billed. Costs and estimated earnings are accumulated on projects in process and compared to amounts billed based on the percentage of completion method of accounting (cost to cost). Costs incurred in excess of amounts billed and related profit recognized are reflected as an asset in the balance sheet as costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings. Unearning billings are reflected in the balance sheet as a liability as billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on projects in process.      Loss per Share      Basic earnings per share amounts are calculated based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during each period. Diluted earnings per share is based on the weighted average numbers of shares of common stock outstanding for the periods, including dilutive effects of stock options, warrants granted and convertible preferred stock. Dilutive options and warrants that are issued during a period or that expire or are canceled during a period are reflected in the computations for the time they were outstanding during the periods being reported. Since Indoor Harvest has incurred losses for all periods, the impact of the common stock equivalents would be anti-dilutive and therefore are not included in the calculation.                 7       
     Table of Contents         The Company has the following common stock equivalents for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively:            Fair Value of Financial Instruments      We adopted accounting guidance for financial and non-financial assets and liabilities (ASC 820). The adoption did not have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or liquidity. This standard defines fair value, provides guidance for measuring fair value and requires certain disclosures. This standard does not require any new fair value measurements, but rather applies to all other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. This guidance does not apply to measurements related to share-based payments. This guidance discusses valuation techniques, such as the market approach (comparable market prices), the income approach (present value of future income or cash flow), and the cost approach (cost to replace the service capacity of an asset or replacement cost). The guidance utilizes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. The following is a brief description of those three levels:                      Level 1: Observable inputs such as quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.                        Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, either directly or indirectly. These include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active.                        Level 3: Unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore developed using estimates and assumptions developed by us, which reflect those that a market participant would use.         The following is the major category of liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2016, using quoted prices in active markets for identical liabilities (Level 1); significant other observable inputs (Level 2); and significant unobservable inputs (Level 3):            Reclassifications      Certain expense items have been reclassified in the statement of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, to conform to the reporting format adopted for the three and nine month ended September 30, 2016.      Recent Accounting Pronouncements      We do not believe any other recent pronouncements will have any impact on our presentation of financial position or results of operations.      Derivative Liability       The Company accounts for derivative instruments in accordance with ASC 815, which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other financial instruments or contracts and requires recognition of all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value, regardless of hedging relationship designation. Accounting for changes in fair value of the derivative instruments depends on whether the derivatives qualify as hedge relationships and the types of relationships designated are based on the exposures hedged. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company did not have any derivative instruments that were designated as hedges.     At September 30, 2016, the Company had outstanding convertible notes and warrants that contained embedded derivatives. These embedded derivatives include certain conversion features and reset provisions. (See Note 5 and Note 6).                  8       
     Table of Contents          Beneficial Conversion Feature      For conventional convertible debt where the rate of conversion is below market value, the Company records a "beneficial conversion feature" ("BCF") and related debt discount.     When the Company records a BCF, the relative fair value of the BCF is recorded as a debt discount against the face amount of the respective debt instrument. The discount is amortized to interest expense over the life of the debt.       NOTE 2 - GOING CONCERN       As reflected in the accompanying unaudited financial statements, the Company had a net loss of $1,618,057, net cash used in operations of $472,939 and has an accumulated deficit of $3,539,829, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.     The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on Management's plans which include potential asset acquisitions, mergers or business combinations with other entities, further implementation of its business plan and continuing to raise funds through debt or equity financings. The Company will likely rely upon related party debt or equity financing in order to ensure the continuing existence of the business.     The business plan of the Company is to engage in the design, development, marketing and direct-selling of commercial grade aeroponics fixtures and supporting systems for use in urban Controlled Environment Agriculture ("CEA") and Building Integrated Agriculture ("BIA"). During the next twelve months, the Company's strategy is to: complete ongoing product development; commence product marketing, product assembly and sales; construct a demonstration CEA and BIA farm; and offer design-build services. The Company's long-term strategy is to direct sale, license and franchise their patented technologies and methods.     The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recovery of the recorded assets or the classification of the liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.       NOTE 3 - CONCENTRATIONS       At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had a concentration of accounts receivable of:           For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, the Company had a concentration of sales of:           For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, the Company had a concentration of sales of:                        9       
     Table of Contents           NOTE 4 - WORK IN PROCESS       Work in progress as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 consists of the following:             NOTE 5 - DEBT AND CONVERTIBLE LOAN PAYABLE        Convertible Note Payable      On March 22, 2016 the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement with Firstfire Global Opportunities Fund, LLC, and Rockwell Capital Partners Inc, relating to the issuance and sale of notes of $272,500 in aggregate principal amount including $250,000 actual payment of purchase price plus a 9% original issue discount, and an aggregate total of 50,000 shares of common stock valued at $23,500 ($0.47/share).      The notes carry an interest on the unpaid principal amount at the rate of 3% per annum. Any Principal Amount or Interest which is not paid when due shall bear interest at the rate of 15% per annum from the due date until the same is paid. The notes mature on September 22, 2016 and may be prepaid in whole or in part except otherwise explicitly set forth in the Note. If the Company exercises its right to prepay or repay the Note, the Company shall make payment to the note holders of an amount in cash equal to the sum of 125% multiplied by the Principal Amount plus accrued and unpaid interest on the Principal Amount to the Optional Prepayment Date plus Default Interest, if any.     The notes convert into shares of Common Stock at a price equal to $0.30; provided, however that from and after the occurrence of any Event of Default hereunder, the Conversion Price shall be the lower of: (i) the Fixed Conversion Price or (ii) 45% multiplied by the lowest sales price of the Common Stock in a public market during the ten (10) consecutive Trading Day period immediately preceding the Trading Day that the Company receives a Notice of Conversion (as defined in the Note). For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company received $272,500 proceeds less the $20,000 in debt issue costs and $22,501 in original issuance discount fee pursuant to the terms of this convertible note. For convertible debt, the convertible feature indicated a rate of conversion that was not below market value after debt discounts. As a result, the Company will record a BCF and related debt discount.     On September 22, 2016 the Company identified the embedded derivatives related to the FirstFire Global Opportunities note. Due to the default provisions, the principal was increased by 125% and interest to 15% per annum. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company converted debt and accrued interest, totaling $103,351 into 1,303,341 shares of common stock. The remaining outstanding principal balance as of September 30, 2016 is $100,000.     On September 22, 2016 the Company entered into a default provision with Rockwell Capital Partners, Inc. Due to the default provisions, the principal was increased by 125% and interest to 15% per annum. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company repaid debt and accrued interest, totaling $203,441. As of September 30, 2016, the loan is fully repaid.      On September 26, 2016 the Company entered into a promissory note with Chuck Rifici Holdings, Inc., relating to the issuance of $225,500 in aggregate principal amount including $204,000 actual payment of purchase price plus a 10% original issue discount. In conjunction with the issuance of the Note, the Company also issued one year warrants to purchase 250,000 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $0.30 per share, the warrants were fair valued at $12,612 based upon the fair value of the proceeds received and allocated as debt discount to the total proceeds. During the nine months ended the Company amortized $767 of debt discount related to the warrants (See Note 8). The note bears an interest on the unpaid principal amount at the rate of 8% per annum. The note mature on March 23, 2017 and may be prepaid in whole or in part at any time prior to the due date. If the Company exercises its right to prepay or repay the Note, the Company shall make payment to the note holders of an amount in cash equal to the sum of 115% multiplied by the Principal Amount plus accrued and unpaid interest on the Principal Amount to the Optional Prepayment Date plus Default Interest, if any. In the event of the default the note is convertible into shares of Common Stock. The conversion price equals to 65% multiplied by the lowest sales price of the common stock during the ten consecutive trading days period immediately preceding the trading day that the Company receives a notice of conversion.      For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company accrued $2,816 in accrued interest related to outstanding the notes.              Debt Discount and Original Issuance Costs      During the nine months September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded debt discounts and original issuance costs totaling $380,267 and $0, respectively.     The debt discounts recorded in 2016 and 2015, pertain to beneficial conversion feature on the convertible notes. The notes are required to be bifurcated and reported at fair value on the date of grant.     The Company amortized $331,034 and $0 to interest expense in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 as follows:            Debt Issuance Costs      During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company paid debt issue costs totaling $20,000.   During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company amortized $20,000 and $0 of debt issue costs, respectively.     The following is a summary of the Company's debt issue costs:                    NOTE 6 - DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES       The Company identified the conversion features embedded within its convertible debts as financial derivatives. The Company has determined that the embedded conversion option should be accounted for at fair value.           The Company recorded the debt discount to the extent of the gross proceeds raised, and expensed immediately the remaining value of the derivative as it exceeded the gross proceeds of the note. The Company recorded derivative interest expenses for the year ended September 30, 2016 of $66,980.     The fair value at the commitment and re-measurement dates for the Company s derivative liabilities were based upon the following management assumptions during the current quarter:             NOTE 7 - RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS       On May 9, 2016, the Company entered into a Director Agreement with Pawel Hardej.

Overview       Indoor Harvest Corp, through its brand name Indoor Harvest     , is a full service, state of the art design-build, engineering, procurement and construction firm for the indoor and vertical farming industry. The company provides production platforms, mechanical systems and complete custom designed build outs for both Controlled Environment Agriculture ("CEA") and Building Integrated Agriculture ("BIA"), tailored to the specific needs of virtually any cultivar.     CEA is the process of manipulating any agricultural technology to allow the farmer an ability to manipulate a crop's environment to desired conditions. Technologies include greenhouse production, hydroponics, aquaculture, aquaponics and aeroponics. Controlled variables may include temperature, lighting, humidity, pH and nutrient analysis.     BIA is the process of locating CEA methods on, or in, mixed use buildings to provide synergy with the buildings infrastructure and the agriculture process. Earliest examples of BIA include the use of hydroponics, aeroponics and aquaponics, where waste heat is captured through the buildings existing heating, ventilation and air conditioning system as well as the combined use of solar, rainwater collection and evaporative systems. Current operating examples include such buildings as Eli Zabar's rooftop greenhouse, The Sun Works Center for Environmental Studies, Gotham Greens, Sky Vegetables, Top Sprouts, Cityscape Farms, Dongtan, Masdar City, AeroFarms, Solar 2, Lufa Farms, BrightFarms, FarmedHere, Green Sense Farms, Green Spirit Farms and Big Box Farms. The term building-integrated agriculture was coined by Dr. Ted Caplow in a paper delivered at the 2007 Passive and Low Energy Cooling Conference in Crete, Greece.     We currently offer a vertical farm racking system with integrated LED lighting. Our vertical farm racking system was designed to be used for both aeroponic and hydroponic layered crop production within a CEA or BIA operation. Our racking system will work with any standard 48" X 96" or 24" X 48" third party flood table or aeroponic system. We also offer patent pending aeroponic fixtures that are compatible with our vertical farm racking system. We offer our vertical farm racking system and aeroponic fixtures for use by both horticulture enthusiasts and commercial operators who seek to utilize vertical farming methods within a controlled indoor environment.     Aeroponics is the process of growing plants in an air or mist environment without the use of soil or an aggregate medium (known as geoponics). Aeroponic culture differs from both conventional hydroponics and in-vitro (plant tissue culture) growing. Unlike hydroponics, which uses water as a growing medium and essential minerals to sustain plant growth, aeroponics is conducted without a growing medium. Because water is used in aeroponics to transmit nutrients, it is sometimes considered a type of hydroponics.     The Company generates revenue from vertical farm rack system sales, aeroponic fixture sales and design build construction management services. Our products are designed for the production of aeroponic and hydroponic leafy greens, micro-greens, fruiting plants and herbs. Our fixtures and systems can also be adapted for a variety of other uses such as horticulture research, medicinal plant production, pharmaceutical plant production, plant cloning and hardwood propagation.            In addition to these products, the Company also generates revenue from engineering, procurement and construction management services. Engineering, procurement, and construction management ("EPCM") is a common form of contracting arrangement for very large infrastructure and facility projects. Under an EPCM arrangement, the client would engage the Company to coordinate all design, procurement and construction work to ensure that the whole project is completed as required.     We are an "emerging growth company" ("EGC") that is exempt from certain financial disclosure and governance requirements for up to five years as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act ("the JOBS Act"), that eases restrictions on the sale of securities; and increases the number of shareholders a company must have before becoming subject to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's ("SEC's") reporting and disclosure rules (See "Emerging Growth Companies" section above). We have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(2) of the Jobs Act, that allows us to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards that have different effective dates for public and private companies until those standards apply to private companies. As a result of this election, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with public company effective dates.     Our operational expenditures are primarily related to developing our line of productions, developing our in-house manufacturing and fabrication facilities and the costs related to being a fully reporting company with the Securities and Exchange Commission.       Potential Separation and Sale of Cannabis Operations       On August 22, 2016 we entered into a memorandum of agreement ("MOA") with Head North LLC ("Head North") to provide Head North with an exclusive period to negotiate an acquisition, merger, or joint venture, of our cannabis related operations in exchange for certain funding obligations. On September 2, 2016, the Company received an executed subscription agreement for $375,000 of our Series A Preferred shares related to the terms outlined in our MOA. On September 23, 2016, we issued 30 day notice to Head North that we were terminating the agreement under Section VIII due to default under the terms of the MOA and a failure to fund its subscription.     The Company is currently actively pursuing separating its cannabis and produce operations as part of its growth strategy. As of the date of this Report, the Company is negotiating with multiple new groups for the potential merger, acquisition, or formation of a joint venture, to acquire our assets and operations related to cannabis. There is no guarantee that an agreement will be reached with any group we are currently negotiating with, or that the Company will be successful in its efforts to separate its cannabis and produce operations.       Current Projects       Our current projects involve both Equipment Sales and Design-Build/Engineering, Procurement and Construction Projects, with the status of each as of September 30, 2016 as set forth below.        ___________           [1]    A Rough Order of Magnitude Estimate (ROM estimate) is an estimation of a project's level of effort and cost to complete. A ROM estimate takes place very early in a project's life cycle, during the project selection and approval period and prior to project initiation in most cases, when a project's scope and requirements has not been fully defined. The main purpose of the ROM estimate is to provide decision-makers with the information necessary to make a decision on whether it makes sense to move forward with the project based on the estimated level of effort, in terms of completion time and cost. A ROM estimate is used to reduce the uncertainty of cost outcomes for both the client and the contractor. There is no assurance that the Company will receive as revenues any or all of the total amount of a ROM estimate.           Signed Design-Build, EPCM Agreements       On March 8, 2016, we entered into a design-build, EPCM contract with OD Farms for a 7,000 sq. ft. cannabis production facility in Alaska. The contract includes an EPCM agreement for HVAC, LED lighting and facility controls. On April 21, 2016, we completed initial design work and provided the client with a ROM estimate of $2,009,308 for HVAC, LED lighting, facility controls and equipment schedule. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had closed this project and recorded $35,000 in other revenue for design services and removed the project from current projects pending further instructions from the client.             On July 6, 2016, we entered into Phase Two of our Cannabis Production Pilot Agreement with Canopy Growth Corporation and signed a design-build, EPCM, cost plus contract with Tweed, a subsidiary of Canopy Growth, to construct a High Pressure Aeroponic ( HPA ) production system to include facility integration and controls for the purpose of an economic pilot. The production system will include 13 HPA units and a Nutrient Dispensing System (pump skid). Additional costs for mechanical, electrical, plumbing and controls will be invoiced prior to hardware shipment and onsite installation under a cost plus agreement.      On July 13, 2016, we entered into a design-build, EPCM, maximum guaranteed price agreement, for a 40,000 sq.ft vertical farm project in Johnstown Ontario with IGES Canada ltd., the project includes 676 Low Tide VFRack platforms, integrated LED lighting, facilities mechanical, electrical and plumbing, construction management and equipment start-up and commissioning. Total contract maximum guaranteed price is $11,374,500 with 5% of the total, $568,725 due upon the start of design work. Originally contracted to begin on September 23, 2016, the project start date has been delayed by the client for administrative and seasonal reasons.      On July 27, 2016, we entered into a design-build, EPCM, cost plus agreement, with TexAg Ventures, LLC, to provide full design and engineering, system prototyping and system testing of a custom vertical farming platform. An initial deposit of $35,000 is required to begin prototyping. Design and engineering services were to be provided free and remaining project costs will be deemed construction coordination services and billed at cost plus. As of September 30, 2016, approximately 90% of the design work has been completed.        Current EPCM Sales Pipeline       Our current sales pipeline consists of 9 facility build discussions with 6 in early to mid-stage discussions and 3 in late stage negotiations and 3 new potential projects as of June 30, 2016. The company is pursuing final agreements applicable for the stage of development the client is in. There is no guarantee of success regarding these agreements or that applicable project revenue will be fully recognized until the agreements and final budget negotiations are complete.     Below is a table showing the Company's current sales pipeline status as of September 30, 2016:        __________          [1]    Scoped - Includes projects in which initial meetings have taken place, preliminary design work has been provided based on the clients provided scope of work along with a project ROM estimate. Scoped projects are early to mid-stage in the design-build process and have a high risk of being abandoned by either party.             [2]    DB Phase 1 - Contract Sent - Includes projects that have completed the initial client side discussions and a contract has been provided to the client to develop a detailed scope of work and engineered drawings to develop a project cost estimate. DB Phase 1 projects are early to mid-stage in the design-build process and have a high risk of being abandoned by either party.             [3]    DB Phase 2 - Contract Sent - Includes projects that have completed a DB Phase 1 contract, or where the client has provided a detailed scope of work and drawings where no initial design work is needed. DB Phase 2 contracts are also generally provided to B2B clients. DB Phase 2 projects are mid to late stage in the design-build process and have a medium to low risk of being abandoned by either party.             [4]    ROM Value - See description above. There is no assurance that the Company will receive as revenues any or all of the total amount of a ROM estimate.                  Results of Operations       For the three months ended September 30, 2016 we generated revenue of $21,210 with cost of sales of $11,278 resulting in gross income of $9,932. We did not generate any revenue as of September 30, 2015. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 we generated revenue of $83,376 with cost of sales of $55,199 resulting in gross profit of $28,177.      For the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, we incurred $314,410 and $380,932, respectively, in operating expenses. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, we incurred $1,059,474 and $960,734, respectively, in operating expenses. The increase in our operating expenses are due to increases in costs related to additional payroll costs, building lease and increased operational activities.     Our expenses related to research and development for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 were $6,376 and $5,459, respectively. Our increase for the three months ended September 30, 2016, were for research and development of new products. Our expenses related to research and development for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 were $15,047 and $17,987, respectively. The decrease in research and development expenses for the nine-month period was due to decreased costs associated with our collaborative R D partnerships, in which we share some costs associated with R D with our partners.     As of September 30, 2016 we had total liabilities of $517,055, while at December 31, 2015, we had total liabilities of $110,147. The increase was the result of accrued payroll expenses from hiring new employees, accounts payable and accrued expenses, billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings and convertible notes payable.     Deferred rent payable at September 30, 2016 was $9,082. Deferred rent payable is the sum of the difference between the monthly rent payment and the straight-line monthly rent expense of an operating lease that contains escalated payments in future periods.       Liquidity and Capital Resources       As of September 30, 2016, we had $44,379 in total current assets. We had current liabilities of $488,332 as of September 30, 2016. Accordingly, we had a working capital deficit of $443,953 as of September 30, 2016.     Operating activities used $472,939 in cash for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared with $541,313 used for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.      Investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 used $3,012 in cash, as compared with using $60,957 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.      Financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 generated $403,368 in cash, as compared with $312,699 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Proceeds from financing activities consisted primarily of proceeds from issuance of convertible debt in 2016 and common stock for cash in 2015.       Cash Requirements: Current Operational Activities       Our estimated minimum day-to-day operational costs as set forth above, are estimated to be approximately $430,800 to maintain current operational activities during the next 12 months. Our minimal annual operating expenses includes $352,000 in payroll expenses, our lease agreement for our 10,000 sq. ft. facility of $55,200 per year, our estimated annual utility expenses of $10,800 and $12,800 in miscellaneous operating expenses. In addition, we will have $75,000 in costs related to maintaining our publicly traded status over the next 12 months.          Planned Restructuring              During the next 12 months, we anticipate restructuring our Company by separating our cannabis and produce related operations. The Company currently has no additional planned operational activities beyond supporting its current operational activities until restructuring is complete.        Sources of Funding         Existing Cash and Operational Cash Flow       As of November 15, 2016, we had $71,838 in cash and $2,500 in available credit facilities.     We are actively engaged in a number of current projects which are generating cash flow. In addition to the key projects already discussed, our current sales pipeline consists of 9 facility build discussions with 6 in early to mid-stage discussions and 3 in late stage negotiations. However, we have no final agreements concerning these potential future projects and we may not ever secure final agreements.              Chuck Rifici Holdings Note for $204,000       On September 26, 2016, we entered into a Promissory Note and Warrant Purchase Agreement with Chuck Rifici Holdings, Inc, a Canadian Corporation.

On the Closing Date, the Company issued Notes of aggregate $225,500 in face value, which will, by their principal terms,                      Carry an interest (the  Interest ) on the unpaid principal amount at the rate of 8% per annum. Interest all commence accruing on the date that the Note is fully funded and shall be computed on the basis of a 365-day year and the actual number of days elapsed;                        Mature on March 23, 2017 and may be prepaid in whole or in part except otherwise explicitly set forth in the Note. If the Borrower exercises its right to prepay or repay the Note, the Borrower shall make payment to the Holder of an amount in cash equal to the sum of 115% multiplied by the Principal Amount plus accrued and unpaid interest on the Principal Amount to the Optional Prepayment Date plus Default Interest, if any; and                        Upon an Event of Default, the per share conversion price into which any Principal Amount and interest under this Note shall be convertible into shares of Common Stock, at the option of the holder, hereunder shall be equal to 65% multiplied by the lowest sales price of the Common Stock in a public market during the ten (10) consecutive Trading Day period immediately preceding the Trading Day that the Company receives a Notice of Conversion.           FirstFire and Rockwell Bridge Financing for $250,000       On March 22, 2016, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with Firstfire Global Opportunities Fund, LLC, a Delaware limited liability Company and Rockwell Capital Partners Inc, a Delaware corporation, (the  Buyers ) relating to the issuance and sale of (i) notes of $272,500 in aggregate principal amount including $250,000 actual payment of purchase price plus a 9% original issue discount, and an aggregate total of 50,000 shares of common stock of the Company, par value per share $0.001, to the Buyers, in accordance with and in reliance upon the exemption from securities registration afforded by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended and/or Rule 506 of Regulation D as promulgated by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Act.     On September 23, 2016, the maturity date under the Notes, the then aggregate outstanding principal amount of $406,069 came due under the Notes and the Company was unable to make the required payments. As a result, the Company is in default under the Notes. The Company received notices from the Buyers providing formal notice that an Event of Default, as defined in the Notes, had occurred. Pursuant to the Notices, the Holders demand payment of the Note s principal amount at the Mandatory Default Amount, which is defined as 145% of the outstanding principal amount of the Note, in addition to the payment of all other amounts, costs, expenses and liquidated damages due in respect of this Note. On September 27, 2016, the Company made a cash payment of $203,441 to Rockwell Capital Partners Inc to satisfy the principal and interest of the Rockwell note. No common stock conversions took place under the Rockwell note.     FirstFire Global Opportunities Fund, LLC issued a notice of conversion of the shares described in Item 3.02 below, and, to the extent that the Event of Default remains uncured, interest on the principal amount that remains outstanding equal to 15% per annum. On September 26, 2016, the Company received a notice of conversion of FirstFire of $33,000 of the amount due under its Note, calculated pursuant to this provision. As of the date of this Current Report, the Company believes the Mandatory Default Amount due to FirstFire to be $170,351. Further, amounts due under the FirstFire Note may be converted at the election of the Holder into shares of the Company s common stock at 45% multiplied by the lowest sales price of the Common Stock in a public market during the ten (10) consecutive Trading Day period immediately preceding the Trading Day that the Company receives a Notice of Conversion.        Meeting Cash Requirements       Based upon the assumption of our monthly current operational burn rate remaining unchanged during the fiscal year, the Company currently has sufficient funds through a combination of the Sources of Funding above, to include accounts receivable financing and factoring, to continue our current operations for the next 12 months. There is no assurance we will obtain the anticipated funds from our Sources of Funding. There can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we don't obtain the anticipated funds from our Sources of Funding, and we don't take other measures such as cutting back operational activities, we may not have sufficient funds to continue operations for the next 12 months.            We cannot guarantee we will be successful in our business operations. We cannot guarantee that we will have sufficient financial resources to fund Current Operational Activities. Our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including the financial risks associated with the limited capital resources currently available to us for the implementation of our business strategies. To become profitable and competitive, we must continue to execute our business plan as described above.     We began offering our products and services during the 3rd Quarter of 2015. We have an accumulated deficit and have incurred operating losses since our inception and expect losses to continue during 2016. Our auditor has indicated in their Report that these conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.      Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements      We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.      Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates      For a discussion of our accounting policies and related items, please see the Notes to the Financial Statements, included in Item 1.       Item 3.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures      The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act) that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company's Securities Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including its Chief Executive Officer/Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.     The Company's management, consisting solely of the Company's Chief Executive Officer/Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer/Chief Financial Officer has concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective.      Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting      There have not been any changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act) during the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.
