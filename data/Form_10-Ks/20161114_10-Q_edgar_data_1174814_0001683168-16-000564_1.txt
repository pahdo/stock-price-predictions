NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

US Dollars  

NOTE 1:- NATURE OF OPERATIONS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION  

a.  
      Gold Billion Group Holdings Limited was incorporated in Delaware on November 9, 2000 under the name of Hotel Outsource Management International, Inc. and its subsidiaries are engaged in the distribution, marketing and operation of computerized minibars in hotels located in the United States, Europe, Israel and Canada. On September 5, 2014, all the subsidiaries have been disposed of.   

On July 29, 2015 the Company entered
into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the  Merger Agreement ) pursuant to which the Company merged with its wholly owned
subsidiary, Gold Billion Group Holdings Limited, a Delaware corporation with no material operations ( Merger Sub  and
such merger transaction, the  Merger ). Upon the consummation of the Merger, the separate existence of Merger Sub ceased
and shareholders of the Company became shareholders of the surviving company named Gold Billion Group Holdings Limited. 

As
permitted by the Delaware General Corporation Law Title 8, Section 251(f), the sole purpose of the Merger was to effect a change
of the Company's name from  Hotel Outsource Management International, Inc.  to Gold Billion
Group Holdings Limited. Upon the filing of the Certificate of Merger (the  Certificate of Merger ) with the Secretary
of State of Delaware on July 30, 2015 to effect the Merger, the Company's Articles of Incorporation were deemed amended to reflect
the change in the Company's corporate name.  

On January 11, 2016, subsequent to
the end of the fiscal year, the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding stock of GBGH Hong Kong Limited, a Hong Kong
Corporation, at a consideration of HK$500,000 (approximately US$64,000), and as a result of the transaction, GBGH Hong Kong Limited
( GBGH HK ) became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. On April 6, 2016, the Company issued 16,000,000 shares
of its authorized but previously unissued shares of common stock as the consideration for acquisition of the shares of GBGH HK.
The shares issued by the Company were valued for purposes of the acquisition at HK$0.03125 per share (approximately US$0.004 per
share), or an aggregate of HK$500,000 (approximately US$64,000). As a result of this transaction, the Company s issued
and outstanding common stock increased from 2,949,484 shares to 18,949,484 shares. Prior to their acquisition by the Company, all
of the issued and outstanding shares of GBGH HK were owned by Richcorp Holdings, Ltd. ( Richcorp ), a Samoa corporation,
which was also the principal shareholder of the Company prior to the transaction. Accordingly, following completion of this transaction,
Richcorp, is the owner of 18,308,345 shares, or approximately 96.6%, of the Company s issued and outstanding common stock. 

The Company continues to incur consolidated
losses ($16,230) in the three months ended September 30, 2016. In order to implement the Company's basic business plan, the Company
will need additional funds. 

The financial statements have been
prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a  going concern . The Company has suffered recurring losses from
operations and has a net working capital deficiency that raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue as  going
concern  .The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 

The continuation of the company
as a going concern is dependent upon implementation of management's plans as well as raising additional funds from shareholders
or other.

NOTE 2:- SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  

a.   
       Basis of Presentation and Principle of Consolidation    

The accompanying unaudited condensed
consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles for
interim financial information and with Rule 8-03 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and
footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In the opinion of management, all
adjustments (consisting of normal and recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation have been included. Operating results
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ended
December 31, 2016. The accompanying interim consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto should be read in conjunction
with the Company's audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015 included in the Company's
Form 10-K filed. 

For the quarter ended and as of September
30, 2016, the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of GBGH HK, a wholly-owned subsidiary incorporated in Hong
Kong on June 29, 2015. 

The acquisition of all of the issued
and outstanding stock of GBGH HK on January 11, 2016 was accounted for as a common control business combination under ASC 805-50.
All significant inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated. 

b.   
       Use of Estimates    

The preparation of financial statements
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. The reported amounts of revenues
and expenses during the reporting period may be affected by the estimates and assumptions management is required to make.  Estimates
that are critical to the accompanying consolidated financial statements relate principally to depreciation and recoverability of
long lived assets.  The markets for the Company s products are characterized by intense price competition, rapid
technological development, evolving standards and short product life cycles; all of which could impact the future realization of
its assets. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects of revisions are reflected in the period that they
are determined to be necessary.  It is at least reasonably possible that management s estimates could change in
the near term with respect to these matters. 

c.   
       Foreign Currency Translation    

The Company translates its foreign
operations to U.S. dollar in accordance with ASC 830,   Foreign Currency Matters  . 

The Company's functional currency
and reporting currency is U.S. dollar, except its subsidiary s functional currency is Hong Kong Dollars ( HKD ). 

The Company's subsidiary, whose records
are not maintained in that company's functional currency, re-measure its records into its functional currency as follows: 

Monetary assets and liabilities at exchange rates in effect at the
end of each period    

Nonmonetary assets and liabilities at historical rates    

Revenue and expense items at the average rate of exchange prevailing
during the period    

Gains and losses from these re-measurements
were not significant and have been included in the Company's results of operations. 

The Company's subsidiary, whose functional
currency is not the U.S. dollar, translate their records into U.S. dollar as follows: 

Assets and liabilities at the rate of
exchange in effect at the balance sheet date    

Equities at historical rate    

Revenue and expense items at the average
rate of exchange prevailing during the period

NOTE 2:- SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
(CONTINUED)  

d.   
       Concentrations of Credit Risk and Fair Value of Financial Instruments    

Prior to the disposal of all the
subsidiaries on September 5, 2014, the financial instruments of the Company consist mainly of cash and cash equivalents, short-term
bank deposits, trade receivables, other accounts receivable, short-term bank credit, trade payables, other accounts payable and
notes payable to shareholders and others. 

In view of their short term nature,
the fair value of the financial instruments included in working capital of the Company is usually identical, or close, to their
carrying values. 

Financial instruments that potentially
subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents, and trade receivables. The
majority of the Company's cash and cash equivalents are invested in interest bearing U.S. dollar and U.S. dollar-linked instruments
or in NIS and Euro interest bearing deposits with major Israeli, U.S. and European banks. Such deposits in the United States may
be in excess of insured limits and are not insured in other jurisdictions. Management believes that the financial institutions
that hold the Company's investments are financially sound, and accordingly, minimal credit risk exists with respect to these investments. 

e.   
       Goodwill    

The Company tests goodwill for impairment
on an annual basis, or more frequently if circumstances, such as material deterioration in performance or a significant number
of store closures, indicate reporting unit carrying values may exceed their fair values. When evaluating goodwill for impairment,
the Company may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine if the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than
not greater than its carrying amount. If the Company does not perform a qualitative assessment or if the fair value of the reporting
unit is not more likely than not greater than its carrying amount, the Company calculates the implied estimated fair value of the
reporting unit. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied estimated fair value, an impairment charge to current operations
is recorded to reduce the carrying value to the implied estimated fair value. 

f.   
       Net Loss Per Share of Common Stock    

The Company has adopted ASC Topic
260,   Earnings per Share,   ( EPS ) which requires presentation of basic EPS on the face of the income
statement for all entities with complex capital structures and requires a reconciliation of the numerator and denominator of the
basic EPS computation. In the accompanying financial statements, basic earnings (loss) per share is computed by dividing net loss
by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. 

The Company has no potentially dilutive
securities, such as options or warrants, currently issued and outstanding. 

g.   
       Recent pronouncements    

The Company has considered all new
accounting pronouncements and has concluded that there are no new pronouncements that may have a material impact on results of
operations, financial condition, or cash flows, based on current information.

NOTE 3:- BUSINESS COMBINATION AND GOODWILL  

On 11 January 2016, the Company completed a
purchase of 100% of the shares of GBGH HK for 16,000,000 shares of the Company s common stock. 

Allocation of the purchase price is as follows: 

The Company tests goodwill for impairment on
an annual basis, or more frequently if circumstances, such as material deterioration in performance, indicate reporting until carrying
values exceed their fair values. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the management believed that goodwill has no
impairment because the subsidiary had no operation for the nine months period ended September 30, 2016 and it has plans of business
acquisition in the foreseeable future. 

NOTE 4:- ACCRUED EXPENSES AND OTHER CURRENT
LIABILITIES  

The Company has accrued expenses and other
current liabilities $135,878 and $75,051 as at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 respectively, which are accrued to third-party
service providers. 

NOTE 5:- STOCKHOLDERS  EQUITY  

The capitalization of the Company consists
of the following classes of capital stock as of September 30, 2016: 

Preferred Stock 

The Company has authorized 5,000,000 shares
of preferred stock with a par value of $0.001 per share. No shares of preferred stock have been issued. 

Common Stock 

Authorized Shares of Common Stock 

The Company now has authorized 200,000,000
shares of common stock with a par value of $0.001 per shares. Each common share entitles the holder to one vote, in person or proxy,
on any matter on which action of the stockholders of the corporation is sought. 

Stock Issuances 

During the nine months ended September 30,
2016, the Company had cancelled 250,000 shares of common stock, and issued 1,000,000 common shares for raising capital to fund
operating expenses. Besides, the Company had issued 16,000,000 common shares to Richcorp for acquiring all of the equity interest
in GBGH HK. Please refer to Note 1 for details of the transaction.

EVENTS  

Management has evaluated
subsequent events through the date these financial statements were available to be issued.  Based on our evaluation no
material events have occurred that require disclosure. 

NOTE 7:- CONTINGENT LIABILITIES  

The Company has not filed the required audited
financial statements of GBGH HK for the reverse merger with GBGH HK, details of which are disclosed in Note 1. The Company has
not fulfilled the reporting requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and may be subjected to disciplining action,
subjected to the decision of the relevant authority. 

ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENTS' DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL
CONDITION  

The following discussion and analysis provides
information that we believe is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our financial condition as of September 30, 2016
and our results of operations for the three months ended September 30, 2016. The following discussion should be read in conjunction
with the financial statements for such periods as well as our financial statements included in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 

This report contains forward-looking statements
as that term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements relate to future events or our
future financial performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as  may ,
 will ,  should ,  expects ,  plans ,  anticipates ,  believes ,
 estimates ,  predicts ,  potential  or  continue  or the negative of these terms
or other comparable terminology. These statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other
factors that may cause our or out industry s actual results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially
different from any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking
statements. 

Although we believe that the expectations reflected
in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements.
Except as required by applicable law, including the securities laws of the United States, we do not intend to update any of the
forward-looking statements to conform these statements to actual results. 

Our financial statements are stated and prepared
in US Dollars and are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  

In connection with the issuance of Securities
and Exchange Commission FR-60, the following disclosure is provided to supplement the Company s accounting policies in regard
to significant areas of judgment. Management of the Company is required to make certain estimates and assumptions during the preparation
of consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. These estimates
and assumptions impact the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of
the date of the consolidated financial statements. These estimates also impact the reported amount of net earnings during any
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Because of the size of the financial statement elements to which they
relate, some of our accounting policies and estimates have a more significant impact on our financial statements than others. 

Limited Market Due To Penny Stock 

The Company's stock differs from many stocks,
in that it is a  penny stock . The Securities and Exchange Commission has adopted a number of rules to regulate  penny
stock . These rules include, but are not limited to, Rules 3a5l-l, 15g-1, 15g-2, 15g-3, 15g-4, 15g-5, 15g-6 and 15g-7 under
the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Because our securities probably constitute  penny stock  within
the meaning of the rules, the rules would apply to us and our securities. The rules may further affect the ability of owners of
our stock to sell their securities in any market that may develop for them. There may be a limited market for penny stocks, due
to the regulatory burdens on broker-dealers. The market among dealers may not be active. Investors in penny stock often are unable
to sell stock back to the dealer that sold them the stock. The mark-ups or commissions charged by the broker-dealers may be greater
than any profit a seller may make. Because of large dealer spreads, investors may be unable to sell the stock immediately back
to the dealer at the same price the dealer sold the stock to the investor. In some cases, the stock may fall quickly in value.
Investors may be unable to reap any profit from any sale of the stock, if they can sell it at all. Stockholders should be aware
that, according to the Securities and Exchange Commission Release No. 34- 29093, the market for penny stocks has suffered in recent
years from patterns of fraud and abuse. These patterns include: - Control of the market for the security by one or a few broker-dealers
that are often related to the promoter or issuer; - Manipulation of prices through prearranged matching of purchases and sales
and false and misleading press releases; -  Boiler room  practices involving high pressure sales tactics and unrealistic
price projections by inexperienced sales persons; - Excessive and undisclosed bid-ask differentials and markups by selling broker-dealers;
and the wholesale dumping of the same securities by promoters and broker- dealers after prices have been manipulated to a desired
level, along with the inevitable collapse of those prices with consequent investor losses. Furthermore, the  penny stock 
designation may adversely affect the development of any public market for the Company's shares of common stock or, if such a market
develops, its continuation. Broker-dealers are required to personally determine whether an investment in  penny stock 
is suitable for customers. Penny stocks are securities (i) with a price of less than five dollars per share; (ii) that are not
traded on a  recognized  national exchange; (iii) whose prices are not quoted on the NASDAQ automated quotation system
(NASDAQ-listed stocks must still meet requirement (i) above); or (iv) of an issuer with net tangible assets less than $2,000,000
(if the issuer has been in continuous operation for at least three years) or $5,000,000 (if in continuous operation for less than
three years), or with average annual revenues of less than $6,000,000 for the last three years. Section 15(g) of the Exchange Act
and Rule 15g-2 of the Commission require broker-dealers dealing in penny stocks to provide potential investors with a document
disclosing the risks of penny stocks and to obtain a manually signed and dated written receipt of the document before effecting
any transaction in a penny stock for the investor s account. Potential investors in the Company s common stock are
urged to obtain and read such disclosure carefully before purchasing any shares that are deemed to be  penny stock .
Rule 15g-9 of the Commission requires broker-dealers in penny stocks to approve the account of any investor for transactions in
such stocks before selling any penny stock to that investor. This procedure requires the broker-dealer to (i) obtain from the investor
information concerning his or her financial situation, investment experience and investment objectives; (ii) reasonably determine,
based on that information, that transactions in penny stocks are suitable for the investor and that the investor has sufficient
knowledge and experience as to be reasonably capable of evaluating the risks of penny stock transactions; (iii) provide the investor
with a written statement setting forth the basis on which the broker-dealer made the determination in (ii) above; and (iv) receive
a signed and dated copy of such statement from the investor, confirming that it accurately reflects the investor's financial situation,
investment experience and investment objectives. Compliance with these requirements may make it more difficult for the Company's
stockholders to resell their shares to third parties or to otherwise dispose of them. 

OVERVIEW 

The Company does not currently have any active
business operations.
