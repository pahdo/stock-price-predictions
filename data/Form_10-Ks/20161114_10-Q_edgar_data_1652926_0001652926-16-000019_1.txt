Forward-Looking Statements 
  Certain statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are forward-looking statements.  Forward-looking statements relate to expectations, beliefs, projections, future plans and strategies, anticipated events or trends and similar expressions concerning matters that are not historical facts.  In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as  anticipate,   believe,   could,   estimate,   expects,   intend,   may,   plan,   potential,   project,   should,   will  and  would  or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology.  Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements.  Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof.  We undertake no obligation to publicly revise or update these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report, except as may be required under applicable law.   
  The following are some of the risks and uncertainties, although not all of the risks and uncertainties, that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those presented in our forward-looking statements: 
             
    We are dependent on Resource REIT Advisor, LLC (our "Advisor") to select investments and conduct our operations. Our Advisor has no prior operating history and no prior experience operating a public company.  This inexperience makes our future performance difficult to predict. 
                
    Our executive officers and some of our directors are also officers, directors, managers or key professionals of our Advisor, Resource Securities, Inc. (our "Dealer Manager") and other entities affiliated with Resource Real Estate, Inc. (our "Sponsor").  As a result, these individuals will face conflicts of interest, including significant conflicts created by our Advisor s compensation arrangements with us and other programs sponsored by our Sponsor and conflicts in allocating time among us and these other programs.  These conflicts could result in action or inaction that is not in the best interests of our stockholders. 
                
    We will pay substantial fees to and expenses of our Advisor, its affiliates and participating broker-dealers, which payments increase the risk that our stockholders will not earn a profit on their investment. 
                
    Our Advisor and its affiliates will receive fees in connection with transactions involving the acquisition and management of our investments.  These fees will be based on the cost of the investment, and not based on the quality of the investment or the quality of the services rendered to us.  This may influence our Advisor to recommend riskier transactions to us. 
                
    There is no limit on the amount we can borrow to acquire a single real estate investment, but pursuant to our charter, we may not leverage our assets with debt financing such that our borrowings would be in excess of 300% of our net assets unless a majority of our independent directors find substantial justification for borrowing a greater amount.  
                
    We may lack property diversification if we do not raise substantially more than the minimum offering in our initial public offering. 
                
    Our charter permits us to pay distributions from any source without limitation, including from offering proceeds, borrowings, sales of assets or waivers or deferrals of fees otherwise owed to our Advisor.  To the extent these distributions exceed our net income or net capital gain, a greater proportion of your distributions will generally represent a return of capital as opposed to current income or gain, as applicable.   
                
    We may experience adverse business developments or conditions similar to those affecting certain programs sponsored by our Sponsor, which could limit our ability to make distributions and could decrease the value of an investment in us.   
                
    Our failure to qualify as a real estate investment trust for federal income tax purposes would reduce the amount of income we have available for distribution and limit our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. 
     All forward-looking statements should be read in light of the risks described above and identified in the  Risk Factors  section of our Registration Statement on Form S-11 (File No. 333-207740) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, as the same may be amended and supplemented from time to time.

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

  (unaudited) 

NOTE 1   NATURE OF BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS 
  Resource Apartment REIT III, Inc. (the  Company ) was organized in Maryland on   July 15, 2015  .  The Company is offering up to   $1.1 billion   of shares of its common stock, consisting of up to   $1.0 billion   of shares in its primary offering in any combination of Class A and Class T shares and up to   $100.0 million   of shares pursuant to its distribution reinvestment plan (the "DRIP") in any combination of Class A and Class T shares. The initial offering price for shares in the primary offering is   $10.00   per share for Class A and   $9.47   per share for Class T. The initial offering price for shares offered pursuant to the DRIP is   $9.60   per share for Class A and   $9.09   per share or Class T. The Company will determine its net asset value ("NAV") on a date no later than November 26, 2018 (the "NAV pricing date"). Commencing on the NAV pricing date, if the primary offering is ongoing, the Company will offer Class A and Class T shares in the primary offering at a price equal to the NAV per share for Class A and Class T shares, respectively, plus applicable selling commissions and dealer manager fees, and pursuant to the DRIP at a price equal to   96%   of the new primary offering price. If the Company s primary offering is not ongoing on the NAV pricing date, or on the date of any subsequent NAV pricing, it will offer Class A and Class T shares pursuant to the DRIP at a price equal to   96%   of the most recently determined NAV per share. The Company will update its NAV at least annually following the NAV pricing date and further adjust the per share price in the primary offering and DRIP accordingly. The Company qualifies as an emerging growth company and has adopted a fiscal year ending December 31.  Resource REIT Advisor, LLC (formerly known as Resource Apartment Advisor III, LLC) (the "Advisor ), which is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Resource America, Inc. ( RAI ), operating in the real estate, financial fund management and commercial finance sectors, contributed   $200,000   to the Company in exchange for   20,000   shares of common stock.   
  On September 8, 2016, RAI was acquired by C-III Capital Partners, LLC ("C-III"), a leading commercial real estate services company engaged in a broad range of activities. C-III controls our Advisor and Resource Securities, Inc. ("Resource Securities"), the Company's dealer manager, and Resource Apartment Manager III, LLC, the Company's property manager; C-III also controls all of the shares of common stock held by RAI. 
  The Company s objective is to take advantage of Resource Real Estate, Inc. s (its  Sponsor ) multifamily investing and lending platforms to invest in apartment communities in order to provide the investor with growing cash flow and increasing asset values. The Company intends to acquire underperforming apartments which it will renovate and stabilize in order to increase rents. To a lesser extent, the Company will also seek to originate and acquire commercial real estate debt secured by apartments having the same characteristics. The Company believes multiple opportunities exist within the apartment industry today and will continue to present themselves over the next few years to real estate investors who possess the following characteristics: (i) extensive experience in multifamily investing, (ii) strong management platforms specializing in operational and financial performance optimization, (iii) financial sophistication allowing them to benefit from complex opportunities, and (iv) the overall scale and breadth of a national real estate platform in both the equity and debt markets. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company owns   one   apartment property located in Alexandria, Virginia. 
  On   June 29, 2016  , RAI contributed   $2 million   and was issued   222,222   shares of common stock in the offering.  As a result, the Company satisfied the   $2.0 million   minimum offering amount for its initial public offering.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company has raised aggregated offering proceeds of   $2.4 million   from the sale of   264,722   Class A shares and   10,982   Class T shares of common stock. The Company intends to elect and qualify to be taxed as a real estate investment trust ( REIT ) for U.S. federal income tax purposes under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, commencing with its taxable year ending December 31, 2017.   As such, to maintain its REIT qualification for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Company is generally required to distribute at least 90% of its net income (excluding net capital gains) to its stockholders as well as comply with certain other requirements. Accordingly, the Company generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes to the extent that it annually distributes all of its REIT taxable income to its stockholders. The Company also intends to operate its business in a manner that will permit it to maintain its exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.    
  The consolidated financial statements and the information and tables contained in the notes thereto as of   September 30, 2016  , are unaudited. The consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 was derived from the audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") have been condensed or omitted pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission

("SEC"), pertaining to interim financial statements in Form 10-Q.  However, in the opinion of management, these  interim financial statements include all the necessary adjustments to fairly present the results of the interim periods presented. The results of operations for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   may not necessarily be indicative of the results of operations for the full year ending   December 31, 2016  . 
   
  NOTE 2   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
  Basis of Presentation 
  The accounting and reporting policies of the Company conform to GAAP. 
  Principles of Consolidation 
  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Resource Apartment REIT III Holdings, LLC, Resource Apartment REIT III OP, LP and RRE Payne Place Holdings, LLC. All intercompany accounts have been eliminated in consolidation. 
  Earnings per Share 
    Basic earnings per share are computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted-average common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share take into account the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised and converted to common stock. Due to reported losses for the period presented, convertible shares are not included in the diluted earnings per share calculation.   
  Use of Estimates 
    The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.  Actual results could differ from those estimates 
  Real Estate Investments 
  The Company records acquired real estate at fair value on its acquisition date. The Company considers the period of future benefit of an asset to determine its appropriate useful life.  The Company's estimated useful lives of its assets by class are as follows: 
                 Buildings 
    27.5 years 
      Building improvements 
    3.0 to 27.5 years 
      Tenant improvements 
    Shorter of lease term or expected useful life 
      Lease intangibles 
    Remaining term of related lease 

Impairment of Long Lived Assets 
    When circumstances indicate the carrying value of a property may not be recoverable, the Company will review the asset for impairment.  This review is based on an estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows, excluding interest charges, expected to result from the property s use and eventual disposition. 
  These estimates consider factors such as expected future operating income, market and other applicable trends and residual value, as well as the effects of leasing demand, competition and other factors.  
  If impairment exists, due to the inability to recover the carrying value of a property, an impairment loss will be recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the property for properties to be held and used. For properties

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - Continued

  (unaudited) 

held for sale, the impairment loss is the adjustment to fair value less estimated cost to dispose of the asset. These assessments have a direct impact on net income because recording an impairment loss results in an immediate negative adjustment to net income. 
  Loans Held for Investment 
  The real estate loans receivable will be recorded at cost and reviewed for potential impairment at each balance sheet date.  A loan receivable is considered impaired when it becomes probable, based on current information, that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the loan s contractual terms.  The amount of impairment, if any, is measured by comparing the recorded amount of the loan to the present value of the expected cash flows or the fair value of the collateral.  If a loan is deemed to be impaired, the Company will record a reserve for loan losses through a charge to income for any shortfall.  Failure to recognize impairment would result in the overstatement of the carrying values of the Company s real estate loans receivable and an overstatement of the Company s net income. 
  The Company may acquire real estate loans at a discount due to credit quality.  Revenues from these loans are recorded under the effective interest method.  Under this method an effective interest rate ( EIR ) is applied to the cost basis of the real estate loan receivable.  The EIR that is calculated when the real estate loan receivable is acquired remains constant and is the basis for subsequent impairment testing and income recognition.  If the amount and timing of future cash collections are not reasonably estimable, the Company accounts for the real estate receivable on the cost recovery method.  Under the cost recovery method of accounting, no income is recognized until the basis of the real estate loan receivable has been fully recovered.  
  Interest income from loans receivable will be recognized based on the contractual terms of the debt instrument.  Fees related to any buydown of the interest rate will be deferred as prepaid interest income and amortized over the term of the loan as an adjustment to interest income.  Closing costs related to the purchase of a loan receivable will be amortized over the term of the loan and accreted as an adjustment against interest income. 
  Allocation of Purchase Price of Acquired Assets 
  Upon the acquisition of real properties, it is the Company s policy to allocate the purchase price of properties to acquired tangible assets, consisting of land, building, fixtures and improvements, and identified intangible lease assets and liabilities, consisting of the value of above-market and below-market leases, as applicable, other value of in-place leases and value of tenant relationships, based in each case on their fair values. 
  The Company records above-market and below-market in-place lease values for acquired properties based on the present value (using an interest rate that reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases and (ii) management s estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in-place leases, measured over a period equal to the remaining non-cancelable term of the lease.  The Company amortizes any capitalized above-market or below-market lease values as an increase or reduction to rental income over the remaining non-cancelable terms of the respective leases, which the Company expects will range from   one month   to   ten years  . 
  The Company measures the aggregate value of other intangible assets acquired based on the difference between (i) the property valued with existing in-place leases adjusted to market rental rates and (ii) the property valued as if vacant.  Management s estimates of value are expected to be made using methods similar to those used by independent appraisers (e.g., discounted cash flow analysis). Factors to be considered by management in its analysis include an estimate of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease-up periods considering current market conditions and costs to execute similar leases. 
  The Company also considers information obtained about each property as a result of its pre-acquisition due diligence, marketing and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired.  In estimating carrying costs, management also includes real estate taxes, insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease-up periods. Management also estimates costs to execute similar leases including leasing commissions and legal and other related expenses to the extent that such costs have not already been incurred in connection with a new lease origination as part of the transaction. 
  The total amount of other intangible assets acquired is further allocated to in-place lease values and customer relationship intangible values based on management s evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant s lease and the Company s overall

  (unaudited) 

relationship with that respective tenant.  Characteristics to be considered by management in allocating these values include the nature and extent of the Company s existing business relationships with the tenant, growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant, the tenant s credit quality and expectations of lease renewals (including those existing under the terms of the lease agreement), among other factors. 
  The Company amortizes the value of in-place leases to expense over the initial term of the respective leases.  The value of customer relationship intangibles is amortized to expense over the initial term and any renewal periods in the respective leases, but in no event will the amortization periods for the intangible assets exceed the remaining depreciable life of the building. Should a tenant terminate its lease, the unamortized portion of the in-place lease value and customer relationship intangibles would be charged to expense in that period.   
  The determination of the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired requires the use of significant assumptions with regard to current market rental rates, discount rates and other variables.  The use of inappropriate estimates would result in an incorrect assessment of the fair value of these assets and liabilities, which could impact the amount of the Company s reported net income.  These estimates are subject to change until all information is finalized, which is generally within one year of the acquisition date.  
  Revenue Recognition 
  The Company recognizes minimum rent, including rental abatements and contractual fixed increases attributable to operating leases, on a straight-line basis over the term of the related lease and includes amounts expected to be received in later years in deferred rents.  The Company records property operating expense reimbursements due from tenants for common area maintenance, real estate taxes and other recoverable costs in the period the related expenses are incurred. 
  The Company makes estimates of the collectability of its tenant receivables related to base rents, including straight-line rentals, expense reimbursements and other revenue or income.  The Company  specifically analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debts, customer creditworthiness, current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts.  In addition, with respect to tenants in bankruptcy, the Company will make estimates of the expected recovery of pre-petition and post-petition claims in assessing the estimated collectability of the related receivable.  In some cases, the ultimate resolution of these claims can exceed one year.  These estimates have a direct impact on the Company s net income because a higher bad debt reserve results in less net income. 
  Income Taxes 
  The Company intends to elect and qualify to be taxed as a REIT, commencing with its taxable year ending December 31, 2017. Accordingly, the Company will generally not be subject to corporate U.S. federal or state income tax to the extent that it makes qualifying distributions to its stockholders, and provided it satisfies on a continuing basis, through actual investment and operating results, the REIT requirements including certain asset, income, distribution and stock ownership tests. If the Company fails to qualify as a REIT, and does not qualify for certain statutory relief provisions, it will be subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes and may be precluded from qualifying as a REIT for the subsequent four taxable years following the year in which it lost its REIT qualification. Accordingly, the Company s failure to qualify as a REIT could have a material adverse impact on its results of operations and amounts available for distribution to its stockholders. 
  The dividends paid deduction of a REIT for qualifying dividends to its stockholders is computed using the Company s taxable income as opposed to net income reported on the financial statements. Taxable income, generally, will differ from net income reported on the financial statements because the determination of taxable income is based on tax provisions and not financial accounting principles.   
  The Company may elect to treat certain of its subsidiaries as taxable REIT subsidiaries ( TRSs ). In general, a TRS may hold assets and engage in activities that it cannot hold or engage in directly and generally may engage in any real estate or non-real estate-related business.  A TRS is subject to U.S. federal, state and local corporate income taxes.

  (unaudited) 

While a TRS may generate net income, a TRS can declare dividends to the Company which will be included in the Company s taxable income and necessitate a distribution to its stockholders. Conversely, if the Company retains earnings at a TRS level, no distribution is required and the Company can increase book equity of the consolidated entity.  
  Organization and Offering Costs 
  The Company incurs organization, accounting, and offering costs in pursuit of its financing. Organization and offering costs (other than selling commissions and dealer manager fees) of the Company are initially being paid by the Advisor on behalf of the Company.  
  Pursuant to the advisory agreement between the Company and the Advisor, the Company is obligated to reimburse the Advisor for organization and other offering costs paid by the Advisor on behalf of the Company, up to an amount equal to   4.0%   of gross offering proceeds as of the termination of the initial public offering if the Company raises less than   $500 million   in the primary portion of the initial public offering and   2.5%   of gross offering proceeds as of the termination of the initial public offering if the Company raises   $500 million   or more in the primary portion of the initial public offering. 
  Through   September 30, 2016  , the Advisor has incurred organization and offering costs on behalf of the Company of approximately   $2.3 million  . As of   September 30, 2016  , the Advisor has advanced   $2.3 million   of these costs on behalf of the Company. If the Company raises the maximum offering amount in the primary offering and under the DRIP, organization and offering expenses (excluding selling commissions and the dealer manager fee) are estimated to be approximately   1.0%   of the gross proceeds of the initial public offering. Organization costs are expensed as incurred, which include all expenses incurred by the Company in connection with the formation of the Company, including but not limited to legal fees and other costs to incorporate the Company; and offering costs, which include selling commissions and dealer manager fees, will be deferred and charged to stockholder s equity as proceeds are raised in the offering. There can be no assurance that the Company s plans to raise capital will be successful. 
  Adoption of New Accounting Standards 
  In January 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") No. 2015-01, "Income Statement - Extraordinary and Unusual Items (Subtopic 225-20), Simplifying Income Statement Presentation by Eliminating the Concept of Extraordinary Items". The amendments in ASU No. 2015-01 eliminate from GAAP the concept of extraordinary items. Although the amendment will eliminate the requirements for reporting entities to consider whether an underlying event or transaction is extraordinary, the presentation and disclosure guidance for items that are unusual in nature or occur infrequently will be retained and will be expanded to include items that are both unusual in nature and infrequently occurring. ASU No. 2015-01 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2015. On January 1, 2016, the Company adopted ASU 2015-01 and the adoption had no impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
  In February 2015, FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02, "Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis", which makes certain changes to both the variable interest model and the voting model, including changes to (1) the identification of variable interests (fees paid to a decision maker or service provider), (2) the variable interest entity characteristics for a limited partnership or similar entity and (3) the primary beneficiary determination. ASU 2015-02 is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2016. On January 1, 2016, the Company adopted ASU 2015-02 and the adoption had no impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
  In April 2015, FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, "Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs", which requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected. The Company applied the new guidance on a retrospective basis and adjusted the balance sheet of each individual period presented to reflect the period-specific effects of applying the new guidance. This guidance was effective and was adopted by the Company on January 1, 2016 and the adoption had no impact on its consolidated financial statements. 
  In September 2015, FASB issued ASU 2015-16, "Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments", which eliminates the requirement to retroactively revise comparative financial information for prior periods presented in financial statements due to changes in provisional amounts recorded for acquisitions in subsequent periods.  Upon adoption, disclosure of

the amounts recorded in current-period earnings that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized at the acquisition date are required.  ASU 2015-16 was effective and adopted by the Company on January 1, 2016 and the adoption had no impact on its consolidated financial statements. 

Accounting Standards Issued But Not Yet Effective 
    
  In May 2014, FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers , which will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in GAAP. The core principle of ASU No. 2014-09 is that an entity should recognize revenue for the transfer of goods or services equal to the amount that it expects to be entitled to receive for those goods or services. ASU No. 2014-09 requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments. ASU No. 2014-09 will be effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2018, including interim periods in 2018, and allows for both retrospective and prospective methods of adoption. The Company is in the process of determining the method of adoption and assessing the impact of this guidance on the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
    
  In August 2014, FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, "Presentation of Financial Statements-Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern." Under the new guidance, an entity should evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued. The guidance is effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. Early application is permitted. The adoption of the new requirements is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In February 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, "Leases", which is intended to improve financial reporting about leasing transactions and requires organizations that lease assets to recognize on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases. ASU No. 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is continuing to evaluate this guidance; however, it does not expect the adoption of ASU No. 2016-02 to have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In June 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-03  Financial Instruments - Credit Losses , which requires measurement and 
  recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets held. The standard update is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2019. The Company is continuing to evaluate this guidance; however, it does not expect the adoption of ASU No. 2016-03 to 
  have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In August 2016, FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15 "Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments", which addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing existing diversity in practice.  The guidance is effective for the Company as of January 1, 2018. Early application is permitted. The adoption of the new requirements is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated statement of cash flows.

  NOTE 7   RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
    The Company is externally managed and advised by the Advisor. Pursuant to the terms of the Advisory Agreement, the Advisor provides the Company with its management team, including its officers, along with appropriate support personnel.  The Advisor will be reimbursed for the Company s allocable share of costs for Advisor personnel, including allocable personnel salaries and benefits.  Each of the Company s officers is an employee of Resource Real Estate, Inc., which is the Advisor's parent company, the Company's sponsor and a wholly-owned subsidiary of RAI, or one of its affiliates.  The Company does not expect to have any employees.  The Advisor is not obligated to dedicate any specific portion of its or their time to the Company s business.  The Advisor and any employees of the Sponsor acting on behalf of the Advisor are at all times subject to the supervision and oversight of the Company s board of directors and has only such functions and authority as the Company delegates to it. 
  During the course of the offering, the Advisor will provide offering-related services to the Company and will advance funds to the Company for both operating costs and organization and offering costs.  These amounts will be reimbursed to the Advisor from the proceeds from the offering, although there can be no assurance that the Company s plans to raise capital will be successful. 
  Relationship with the Advisor 
  The Advisory Agreement has a   one  -year term and may be renewed for an unlimited number of successive   one  -year terms upon the approval of the conflicts committee of the Company's Board of Directors. Under the Advisory Agreement, the Advisor will receive fees and will be reimbursed for its expenses as set forth below: 
    Acquisition fees.   The Advisor earns an acquisition fee of   2.0%   of the cost of investments acquired on behalf of the Company, plus any capital expenditure reserves allocated, or the amount funded by the Company to acquire loans, including acquisition expenses and any debt attributable to such investments. 
    Asset management fees.   The Advisor earns a monthly asset management fee equal to   0.083%   (one-twelfth of   1.0%  ) of the cost of each asset at the end of each month, without deduction for depreciation, bad debts or other non-cash reserves. The asset management fee is based only on the portion of the costs or value attributable to the Company s investment in an asset if the Company does not own all of an asset and does not manage or control the asset. 
    Disposition fees.   The Advisor will earn a disposition fee in connection with the sale of a property equal to the lesser of one-half of the aggregate brokerage commission paid, or if none is paid,   2.0%   of the contract sales price.  
    Debt financing fees.   The Advisor will earn a debt financing fee equal to   0.5%   of the amount available under any debt financing obtained for which it provided substantial services. 
    Expense reimbursements.   The Company also will pay directly or reimburse the Advisor for all of the expenses paid or incurred by the Advisor or its affiliates on behalf of the Company or in connection with the services provided to the Company in relation to its public offering, including its distribution reinvestment plan offering. This includes all organization and offering costs of up to   4.0%   of gross offering proceeds if the Company raises less than   $500 million   in the primary offering and   2.5%   of gross offering proceeds if the Company raises more than   $500 million   in the primary offering. Reimbursements also include expenses the Advisor incurs in connection with providing services to the Company, including the Company s allocable share of costs for Advisor personnel and overhead, out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the selection and acquisition of properties or other real estate related debt investments, whether or not the Company ultimately acquires the investment. However, the Company will not reimburse the Advisor or its affiliates for employee costs in connection with services for which the Advisor earns acquisition or disposition fees.

    Construction management fees  . The Manager will earn a construction management fee equal to   5.0%   of actual aggregate costs to construct improvements to a property.

    Expense reimbursement  . During the ordinary course of business, the Manager or other affiliates of RAI may pay certain shared operating expenses on behalf of the Company. The Company is obligated to reimburse the Manager or other affiliates for such shared operating expenses. 
  Relationship with Resource Securities 
  Resource Securities, Inc. ( Resource Securities ), an affiliate of the Advisor, serves as the Company s dealer manager and is responsible for marketing the Company s shares during the public offering.  
    Dealer manager fee and selling commissions.   Pursuant to the terms of the dealer manager agreement with the Dealer Manager, the Company generally pays the Dealer Manager a selling commission of up to   7.0%   of gross primary offering proceeds from the sale of Class A shares and up to   2.0%   of gross primary offering proceeds from the sale of Class T shares and a dealer manager fee of up to   3.0%   of gross primary offering proceeds from the sale of Class A and Class T shares. The Dealer Manager reallows all selling commissions earned and a portion of the dealer manager fee as a marketing fee to participating broker-dealers. No selling commissions or dealer manager fees are earned by the Dealer Manager in connection with sales under the distribution reinvestment plan. Additionally, the Company may reimburse the Dealer Manager for bona fide due diligence expenses.  No selling commissions or dealer manager fees were paid in connection with the sale of approximately   222,222   Class A shares to RAI. 
    Distribution and shareholder servicing fee  . Resource Securities is paid an annual fee of   1.0%   of the purchase price (or, once reported, the NAV) per share of Class T common stock sold in the primary offering for   five   years from the date on which each share is issued up to a total of   5.0%  .

The differences between the Class A and Class T shares relate to the fees and selling commissions payable with respect to each class and the differing distribution amounts and expense allocations due to differing ongoing fees and expenses. The per share amount of distributions on Class T shares will likely be lower than the distributions on the Class A shares for so long as the distribution and shareholder servicing fee applies because this fee is a class-specific expense. The following table summarizes the differences in fees and selling commissions between the classes of common stock: 

(1)    Each outstanding Class T share issued in the primary offering is subject to an annual distribution and shareholder servicing fee for   five    
  years from the date on which such share is issued. The Company will cease paying the distribution and shareholder servicing fee on each 
  Class T share prior to the fifth anniversary of its issuance on the earliest of the following, should any of these events occur: (i) the date at 
  which, in the aggregate, underwriting compensation from all sources equals   10%   of the gross proceeds from the Company's primary offering 
  (i.e., excluding proceeds from sales pursuant to our DRIP); (ii) the date on which the Company lists its common stock on a national securities 
  exchange; and (iii) the date of a merger or other extraordinary transaction in which the Company is a party and in which the common stock 
  is exchanged for cash or other securities. The Company cannot predict if or when any of these events will occur. 
    
  In the case of a Class T share purchased in the primary offering at a price equal to   $9.47  , the maximum distribution and shareholder servicing fee that may be accrued on that Class T share will equal   $0.47  . However, because the Company will only completely cease paying the distribution and shareholder servicing fee on the earliest of the dates described above, such fee will accrue on all outstanding Class T shares that were purchased in the primary offering within the previous   five   years of such date. The expense of the distribution and shareholder servicing fee payable with respect to Class T shares sold in the primary offering will be allocated among all outstanding Class T shares, including those sold under the DRIP and those sold in the primary offering more than   five   years ago on which the Company has ceased paying distribution and shareholder servicing fees. As a result, holders of Class T shares purchased earlier in the offering will bear a greater expense from distribution and shareholder servicing fees than those holders of Class T shares purchased later in the offering. 
    
  Relationship with RAI 
    
    Self-insurance funds held in escrow.   The receivable from related party includes escrow funds held by RAI for self-insurance. The Company's property participates in an insurance pool with other properties directly and indirectly managed by RAI for both property insurance and general liability. RAI holds the escrow funds related to the insurance pools on its books. The insurance pool covers losses up to   $2.5 million   and the pool for the general liability covers losses up to the first   $50,000   per incident. Catastrophic insurance would cover losses in excess of the insurance pool up to   $140.0 million  . Therefore, unforeseen or catastrophic losses in excess of the Company's insured limits could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and operating results. In the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company paid   $1,505   into the insurance pools.

NOTE 8   EQUITY 
  Preferred Stock 
  The Company s charter authorizes the Company to issue   10 million   shares of its   $0.01   par value preferred stock. As of   September 30, 2016  ,   no   shares of preferred stock were issued or outstanding. 
  Convertible Stock 
  The Company s charter authorizes the Company to issue   50,000   shares of its   $0.01   par value convertible stock. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   50,000   shares of   $0.01   par value convertible stock outstanding, which are owned by the Advisor. The convertible stock will convert into shares of the Company s common stock upon the occurrence of (a) the Company having paid distributions to common stockholders that in the aggregate equal   100%   of the price at which the Company originally sold the shares plus an amount sufficient to produce a   6%   cumulative, non-compounded annual return on the shares at that price; or (b) if the Company lists its common stock on a national securities exchange or the Company consummates a merger pursuant to which consideration received by the stockholders is securities of another issuer that are listed on a national securities exchange. 
  Each of these   two   events is a  Triggering Event.   Upon a Triggering Event, the Company's convertible stock will, unless its advisory agreement has been terminated or not renewed on account of a material breach by its Advisor, generally be converted into a number of shares of common stock equal to 1/50,000 of the quotient of:  
           (A) 
    15%   of the amount, if any, by which  
              (1) 
    the value of the Company as of the date of the event triggering the conversion plus the total distributions paid to its stockholders through such date on the then-outstanding shares of its common stock exceeds  
              (2) 
    the sum of the aggregate issue price of those outstanding shares plus a   6%   cumulative, non-compounded, annual return on the issue price of those outstanding shares as of the date of the event triggering the conversion, divided by 
       
  (B) the value of the Company divided by the number of outstanding shares of common stock, in each case, as of the as of the date of the event triggering the conversion. 
    
  On   August 5, 2016  , the Board of Directors of the Company approved the issuance of   50,000   convertible shares in exchange  for   5,000   shares of Class A common stock. 
  Common Stock 
  The Company s charter authorizes the Company to issue   250 million   shares of its   $0.01   par value Class A common stock. As of   September 30, 2016  , there were   264,722   shares of Class A common stock issued and outstanding.         
  The Company's charter authorizes the Company to issue   750 million   shares of its   $0.01   par value Class T common stock. As of   September 30, 2016  , there were   10,982   shares of Class T common stock issued and outstanding.

    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION  
     AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (unaudited) 
  The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements of Resource Apartment REIT III, Inc. and the notes thereto. As used herein, the terms  we,   our  and  us  refer to Resource Apartment REIT III, Inc., a Maryland corporation, and, as required by context, Resource Apartment REIT III OP, LP, a Delaware limited partnership, and to their subsidiaries. 
  Certain statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are forward-looking statements.  Forward-looking statements relate to expectations, beliefs, projections, future plans and strategies, anticipated events or trends and similar expressions concerning matters that are not historical facts.  In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as  anticipate,   believe,   could,   estimate,   expects,   intend,   may,   plan,   potential,   project,   should,   will  and  would  or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology.  Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements.  Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof.  We undertake no obligation to publicly revise or update these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report, except as may be required under applicable law.   
  Overview 
  Resource Apartment REIT III, Inc. is a Maryland corporation that intends to take advantage of its sponsor's multifamily investing and lending platforms to invest in apartment communities in order to provide stockholders with growing cash flow and increasing asset values. We intend to acquire underperforming apartments which we will renovate and stabilize in order to increase rents. To a lesser extent, we will also seek to originate and acquire commercial real estate debt secured by apartments. We cannot predict, however, the ultimate allocation of net proceeds from our initial public offering between property acquisitions and debt investments at this time because this allocation will depend, in part, on market conditions and opportunities and on the amount of financing that we are able to obtain with respect to the types of assets in which we seek to invest. If we are only able to raise the minimum offering or an amount substantially less than our maximum offering, our plan of operation will be scaled down considerably, and we would expect to acquire a limited number of assets. We may make adjustments to our target portfolio based on real estate market conditions and investment opportunities. We will not forego a good investment because it does not precisely fit our expected portfolio composition. Thus, to the extent that Resource REIT Advisor, LLC (formerly known as Resource Apartment Advisor III, LLC) (our "Advisor") presents us with attractive investment opportunities that allow us to meet the real estate investment trust ("REIT") requirements under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, our portfolio composition may vary from what we initially expect.  
   
  Results of Operations 
  We were formed on   July 15, 2015  . We commenced active real estate operations on August 19, 2016 with the acquisition of our first multi-family property. As of   September 30, 2016  , we owned one multifamily property. Our management is not aware of any material trends or uncertainties, favorable or unfavorable, other than national economic conditions affecting our targeted portfolio or the U.S. apartment community industry, which may reasonably be expected to have a material impact on either capital resources or the revenues or incomes to be derived from the operation of such assets or those that we expect to acquire. Rental income for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $25,178  . During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we incurred    $22,095   in rental operating expenses,   $112,711   in acquisition costs,   $4,611   in management fees,   $303,921    in general and administrative expenses and   $10,376   in depreciation and amortization expense. We expect revenue and expenses to increase in future periods as we acquire additional properties.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  We are offering and selling to the public in our public offering up to   $1.1 billion   in shares of common stock, consisting of up to   $1.0 billion   of shares in our primary offering in any combination of Class A and Class T shares and up to   $100.0 million   of shares pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan ("DRIP") in any combination of Class A and Class T shares. The initial offering price for shares in the primary offering is   $10.00   per share for Class A and   $9.47   per share Class T. The initial offering price for shares offered pursuant to the DRIP is   $9.60   per share for Class A and   $9.09   per share Class T. 
  We anticipate deriving the capital required to purchase real estate investments and conduct our operations from the proceeds of our initial public offering and any future offerings we may conduct, from secured or unsecured financings from banks or other lenders and from proceeds from the sale of assets. In addition, our Advisor has and will advance funds to us for certain accrued organization and offering costs. As of   September 30, 2016  , we own one property which is further described in Note 5 to our financial statements. 
  If we are unable to raise substantial funds in the offering than the minimum offering amount, we will make fewer investments resulting in less diversification in terms of the type, number and size of investments we make and the value of an investment in us will fluctuate with the performance of the specific assets we acquire. Further, we will have certain fixed operating expenses, including certain expenses as a publicly offered REIT, regardless of whether we are able to raise substantial funds in our offering. Our inability to raise substantial funds would increase our fixed operating expenses as a percentage of gross income, reducing our net income and limiting our ability to make distributions. As of   September 30, 2016  , we have raised   $2.4 million   in our public offering. 
  We intend to make reserve allocations as necessary to aid our objective of preserving capital for our investors by supporting the maintenance and viability of properties we acquire in the future. If reserves and any other available income become insufficient to cover our operating expenses and liabilities, it may be necessary to obtain additional funds by borrowing, refinancing properties or liquidating our investment in one or more properties, debt investments or other assets we may hold. We cannot assure you that we will be able to access additional funds when we need them or upon acceptable terms. 
  Although there is no limit on the amount we can borrow to acquire a single real estate investment, we may not leverage our assets with debt financing such that our borrowings are in excess of 300% of our net assets unless a majority of our independent directors find substantial justification for borrowing a greater amount. Examples of such a substantial justification include, without limitation, obtaining funds for the following: (i) to repay existing obligations, (ii) to pay sufficient distributions to maintain REIT status, or (iii) to buy an asset where an exceptional acquisition opportunity presents itself and the terms of the debt agreement and the nature of the asset are such that the debt does not increase the risk that we would become unable to meet our financial obligations as they became due. On a total portfolio basis, however, based on current lending market conditions, we expect to leverage our assets in an amount equal to 55% to 60% of the cost of our assets. 
  We may finance the acquisition costs of individual real estate investments, as well as the acquisition costs of all or a group of real estate investments acquired by us, by causing our subsidiaries to borrow directly from third-party financial institutions or other commercial lenders. Under these circumstances, our Advisor anticipates that certain properties acquired will serve as collateral for the debt we incur to acquire those particular properties and that we will seek to obtain nonrecourse financing for the acquisition of the properties. However, there is no guarantee that our Advisor will be successful in obtaining financing arrangements on a property-by-property basis and that the loans would be nonrecourse to us. Additionally, we may obtain corporate-level financing through a line of credit from third-party financial institutions or other commercial lenders. Our assets will serve as collateral for this type of debt incurred to acquire real estate investments. We may also obtain seller financing with respect to specific assets that we acquire. 
  On   August 18, 2016  , the Advisor provided a   $555,000   bridge loan (the "Bridge Loan") to the Company. The Company used the proceeds of the Bridge Loan to partially finance the acquisition of Payne Place. The Bridge Loan, which is scheduled to mature on   February 18, 2016  , incurs interest at an annual rate of LIBOR plus   3%  . The Company has the right to prepay the Bridge Loan at any time in whole or in part without premium or penalty. As of   September 30, 2016   , the outstanding balance of the bridge loan was   $305,000  . Interest expense for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $2,337  . As of   September 30, 2016  , deferred financing costs, net of amortization was   $2,124  . 
  In addition to making investments in accordance with our investment objectives, we expect to use our capital resources to make payments to our Advisor and the dealer manager of our public offering, which is an affiliate of our Advisor. During our organization and offering stage, these payments will include payments to the dealer manager for selling commissions, the dealer manager fee and the distribution and shareholder servicing fee and payments to the dealer manager and our Advisor for reimbursement of organization and offering expenses. However, our Advisor has agreed to reimburse us to the extent that  
  
   23

     (Back to Index)  

organization and offering expenses (excluding underwriting and brokerage discounts and commission) incurred by us exceed   4.0%   of our gross offering proceeds, as of the termination of the offering, if we raise less than   $500 million  . If we raise more than   $500 million   of gross proceeds in the offering, our Advisor has agreed to reimburse us to the extent that organization and offering expenses (excluding underwriting and brokerage discounts and commission) incurred by us exceed   2.5%   of our gross offering proceeds, as of the termination of the offering. During our acquisition and development stage, we expect to make payments to our Advisor in connection with the selection or purchase of real estate investments, the management of our assets and costs incurred by our Advisor in providing services to us. During our acquisition stage, we expect to make payments to our Advisor in connection with the acquisition of real estate investments. In addition, we expect to continue to make payments to our Advisor for the management of our assets and costs incurred by our Advisor in providing services to us. We describe these payments in more detail in Note 7 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements. 
  Critical Accounting Policies 
    For a discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates, see the discussion in our Registration Statement on Form S-11 (File No. 333-207740), as amended, under "Plan of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies," which is hereby incorporated herein by reference.   
  Subsequent Events 
    
  On   October 7, 2016  , our Board of Directors declared cash distributions on the outstanding shares of all classes of our common stock based on daily record dates from   October 10, 2016   through   October 30, 2016  , from   October 31, 2016   through   November 29, 2016   and from   November 30, 2016   through   December 29, 2016  , which distributions the Company paid or expects to pay on   October 31, 2016  ,   November 30, 2016   and   December 30, 2016  , respectively. Distributions for these periods have been or will be calculated based on stockholders of record each day during these periods at a rate of (i)   $0.000547945   per share per day less (ii) the applicable daily distribution and shareholder servicing fees accrued for and allocable to any class of common stock, divided by the number of shares of common stocl of such class outstanding as of the close of business of each respective record date.  
    
  On   October 7, 2016  , our Board of Directors authorized a stock dividend of   0.005   shares of common stock, or   0.5%   of each outstanding share of Class A and Class T common stock, to the stockholders of record at the close of business on   December 31, 2016  . Such stock dividend will be issued on   January 13, 2017  . 
    
  On   October 14, 2016   , the Company paid the Advisor   $215,000   towards the balance due on the Bridge Loan. On   November 1, 2016  , the Company paid the Advisor   $92,921   to satisfy the remaining outstanding balance of the Bridge Loan and accrued interest. 
   
  ITEM 3.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
  We had limited operations as of   September 30, 2016  .  When we commence significant operations, we expect to be exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of incurring long-term debt to acquire properties and other investments. We intend to manage our interest rate risk with the objectives of limiting the impact of interest rate changes on operations and cash flows and lowering overall borrowing costs. We expect that we may enter into derivative financial instruments, such as interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and rate lock arrangements, in order to mitigate our interest rate risk.

PART II.                      OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1.    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
  From time to time, we may become party to legal proceedings, which arise in the ordinary course of our business. We 
  are not currently involved in any legal proceedings of which the outcome is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition, nor are we aware of any such legal proceedings contemplated by governmental authorities. 
   
  ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS 
  There have been no material changes from the risk factors set forth in our prospectus dated   April 29, 2016  , as supplemented or amended.  
   
  ITEM 2.    UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS 
  Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities 
  During the period covered by this report, we did not sell any unregistered securities. 
  Use of Proceeds 
  On   April 28, 2016  , our Registration Statement on Form S-11 (File No. 333-207740), covering our initial public offering of up to   $1.1 billion   in shares of common stock, consisting of up to   $1.0 billion   in our primary offering in any combination of Class A and Class T shares and up to   $100.0 million   of common stock under our distribution reinvestment plan ("DRIP") in any combination of Class A and Class T shares, was declared effective under the Securities Act of 1933. We retained Resource Securities, an affiliate of our Advisor, as the dealer-manager for our offering. The initial offering price for shares in the primary offering is   $10.00   per share for Class A and   $9.47   per share for Class T. The initial offering price for shares offered pursuant to the DRIP is   $9.60   per share for Class A and   $9.09   per share for Class T. As of   September 30, 2016  , our Advisor has incurred costs on our behalf of approximately   $1.3 million  .  
  We expect to use substantially all of the net proceeds from our ongoing initial public offering to invest in and manage a diverse portfolio of commercial real estate assets. As of   September 30, 2016  , a total of   264,722   Class A shares and   10,982   Class T shares have been issued in connection with our public offering resulting in gross offering proceeds of   $2.4 million  . 

From the commencement of the public offering through September 30, 2016, we incurred selling commissions, dealer manager fees, other underwriting compensation and other organization and offering costs in the amounts set forth above.  We pay selling commissions and dealer manager fees to Resource Securities, and Resource Securities reallows all selling commissions and a portion of the dealer manager fees to participating broker-dealers. In addition, we reimburse our Advisor and Resource Securities for certain offering expenses as described in our prospectus, as amended and supplemented.   
    
  We also pay Resource Securities an annual distribution and shareholder servicing fee of 1.0% of the purchase price (or, once reported, the NAV) per share of Class T common stock sold in the primary offering for five years from the date on which each share is issued up to a total of 5.0%.  The distribution and shareholder servicing fee is an ongoing fee that is not paid at the time of purchase and is not intended to be a principal use of offering proceeds; it is therefore not included in the table above. As of    September 30, 2016  , we had accrued approximately   $5,200    in distribution and shareholder servicing fees, which is the maximum amount of the distribution and shareholder servicing fee payable with respect to all Class T shares sold in the primary portion of our initial public offering. 
    
          From the commencement of our ongoing initial public offering through   September 30, 2016  , the net offering proceeds to us, after deducting the total expenses incurred as described above, were approximately   $2.3 million  .  As of   September 30, 2016  , we have used the net proceeds from our ongoing initial public offering and debt financing to acquire approximately   $2.5 million   in  
  
   26 
   (Back to Index)  

     (Back to Index)  

real estate investments.  Of the amount used for the purchase of these investments, approximately   $51,505   is payable to our Advisor, as acquisition fees and acquisition expense reimbursements. 
    
  Share Repurchase Program 
       
  Our common stock is currently not listed on a national securities exchange and we will not seek to list our common stock 
  unless and until such time as our Board of Directors determines that the listing of our common stock would be in the 
  best interests of our stockholders. In order to provide stockholders with the benefit of some interim liquidity, our Board of Directors has adopted a share repurchase program that enables our stockholders to sell their shares back to us after they have held them for at least one year, subject to significant conditions and limitations. The terms of our share repurchase program are more flexible in cases involving the death or disability of a stockholder. We may reject any request for repurchase of shares. Repurchases of shares of our common stock, when requested, generally will be made quarterly. We will limit the number of shares repurchased during any calendar year to 5.0% of the number of shares of our common stock outstanding on December 31 of the previous calendar year. In addition, we are only authorized to repurchase shares using proceeds from our DRIP plus 1.0% of the operating cash flow from the previous fiscal year (to the extent positive) and any additional operating funds, if any, as our Board in its sole discretion may reserve for this purpose. Due to these limitations, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to accommodate all repurchase requests. 
    
  Unless the shares of our common stock are being repurchased in connection with a stockholder s death or qualifying 
  disability, the purchase price for shares repurchased under our share repurchase program will be as set forth below until November 15, 2018 (the "NAV pricing date"), which is two years and 150 days after we satisfied the minimum offering requirement. Prior to the NAV pricing date, and unless the shares are being repurchased in connection with a stockholder s death or qualifying disability, we will initially repurchase shares at a price equal to, or at a discount from, the purchase price paid for the shares being repurchased as follows: 
    
                   Share Purchase Anniversary 
      
    Repurchase Price as a Percentage of Purchase Price 
      Less than 1 year 
      
    No Repurchase Allowed 
      1 year 
      
    92.5% 
      2 years 
      
    95.0% 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, until the NAV pricing date, shares received as a stock distribution will be redeemed at a 
  purchase price of $0.00. In addition, the purchase price per share will be adjusted for any stock combinations, splits, recapitalizations 
  and the like with respect to the shares of common stock and reduced by the aggregate amount of net sale or refinance proceeds 
  per share, if any, distributed to the stockholder prior to the repurchase date. Shares repurchased in connection with a stockholder s death or qualifying disability will be repurchased at a price per share equal to 100% of the amount the stockholder paid for each share, or, once we have established an estimated NAV per share, 100% of such amount, as determined by our Board of Diretors, subject to any special distributions previously made to our stockholders. Shares repurchased in connection with a stockholder s other exigent circumstances, such as bankruptcy, within one year from the purchase date, will be repurchased at a price per share equal to the price per share we would pay had the stockholder held the shares for one year from the purchase date, and at all other times in accordance with the terms described above. A stockholder must have beneficially held the shares for at least one year prior to offering them for sale to us through our share repurchase program, unless the shares are being repurchased in connection with a stockholder s death, qualifying disability, or certain other exigent circumstances. Our Board of Directors reserves the right, in its sole discretion, at any time and from time to time, to waive the one-year holding period requirement in the event of the death or qualifying disability of a stockholder, other involuntary exigent circumstances such as bankruptcy, or a mandatory distribution requirement under a stockholder s IRA. 
  During the period covered by this report, we did not repurchase any of our securities as no securities were eligible for repurchase.

  ESCROW AGREEMENT 
    
  THIS ESCROW AGREEMENT   dated as of April 28, 2016 (this    Agreement   ), is entered into among Resource Securities, Inc. (the    Dealer Manager   ), Resource Apartment REIT III, Inc. (the    Company   ) and UMB Bank, N.A., as escrow agent (the    Escrow Agent    ).

EAST\123889196.1    

NOW, THEREFORE  , in consideration of the foregoing and of the mutual covenants and agreements contained herein, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as follows: 
    
  1.   Proceeds to be Escrowed  .  On or before the date on which the Offering commences, the Company shall establish an escrow account with the Escrow Agent to be invested in accordance with Section 9 hereof (including such abbreviations as are required for the Escrow Agent s systems) (the    Escrow Account   ).  This Agreement shall be effective as of the date the Registration Statement is declared effective by the SEC.  Except as otherwise set forth herein for Pennsylvania Investors, Washington Investors and New York Investors, the escrow period shall commence upon the effectiveness of this Agreement and shall continue until the Termination Date (as defined in Section 7) (the    Escrow Period   ). 
    
  Subject to Section 2 hereof, all checks, wire transfers and other funds received from persons submitting subscriptions for the purchase of Securities (   Investors   , which term shall also include Pennsylvania Investors, Washington Investors and New York Investors, unless the context otherwise requires) in payment for the Securities (   Investor Funds   ) will be delivered to the Escrow Agent within one (1) business day following the day upon which such Investor Funds are received by the Dealer Manager or soliciting dealers retained by the Dealer Manager in connection with the Offering (the    Soliciting Dealers   ), and shall, upon receipt by the Escrow Agent, be retained in escrow by the Escrow Agent and invested as stated herein. 
    
  The Company shall, and shall cause its agents to, cooperate with the Escrow Agent in separately accounting for Investor Funds from Pennsylvania Investors, Washington Investors and New York Investors in the Escrow Account, and the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely upon information provided by the Company or its agents in this regard. 
    
  The Escrow Agent shall have no duty to make any disbursement, investment or other use of Investor Funds until and unless it has good and collected funds. If any checks deposited in the Escrow Account are returned or prove uncollectible after the funds represented thereby have been released by the Escrow Agent, then the Company shall promptly reimburse the Escrow Agent for any and all costs incurred for such, upon request, and the Escrow Agent shall deliver the returned checks to the Company. The Escrow Agent shall be under no duty or responsibility to enforce collection of any check delivered to it hereunder. The Escrow Agent reserves the right to deny, suspend or terminate participation by an Investor to the extent the Escrow Agent deems it advisable or necessary to comply with applicable laws or to eliminate practices that are not consistent with the purposes of the Offering. 
    
  2.    Investors  . During the Escrow Period, Investors will be instructed by the Dealer Manager or any Soliciting Dealers to remit the purchase price in the form of checks payable to the order of, or funds wired in favor of,  UMB Bank, N.A., as escrow agent for Resource Apartment REIT III, Inc.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, Pennsylvania Investors, Washington Investors and New York Investors shall continue to make checks payable to the order of  UMB Bank, N.A., as escrow agent for Resource Apartment REIT III, Inc.  until, respectively, the Pennsylvania Minimum Offering, the Washington Minimum Offering or the New York Minimum Offering is raised. Any  
  
   EAST\123889196.1      2 

checks made payable to a party other than the Escrow Agent shall be returned to the Dealer Manager or Soliciting Dealer that submitted the check. By 12:00 p.m. (EST) of the next business day following the receipt of instruments of payment from the Offering, the Company or the Dealer Manager, as applicable, shall furnish the Escrow Agent with a list of the Investors who have paid for the Securities showing the name, address, tax identification number, the amount of Securities subscribed for purchase, the amount paid and whether such Investors are Pennsylvania Investors, Washington Investors or New York Investors. The information comprising the identity of Investors shall be provided to the Escrow Agent in substantially the format set forth in the list of Investors attached hereto as   Exhibit A   (the    List of Investors   ). The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to conclusively rely upon the List of Investors in determining whether Investors are Pennsylvania Investors, Washington Investors or New York Investors and shall have no duty to independently determine or verify the same. 
    
  When a Soliciting Dealer s internal supervisory procedures are conducted at the site at which the subscription agreement and the check for the purchase of Securities were initially received by Soliciting Dealer from the subscriber, such Soliciting Dealer shall transmit the subscription agreement and such check to the Escrow Agent by the end of the next business day following receipt of the check for the purchase of Securities and subscription agreement. When, pursuant to such Soliciting Dealer s internal supervisory procedures, such Soliciting Dealer s final internal supervisory procedures are conducted at a different location (the    Final Review Office   ), such Soliciting Dealer shall transmit the check for the purchase of Securities and subscription agreement to the Final Review Office by the end of the next business day following Soliciting Dealer s receipt of the subscription agreement and the check for the purchase of Securities. The Final Review Office will, by the end of the next business day following its receipt of the subscription agreement and the check for the purchase of Securities, forward both the subscription agreement and such check to the Escrow Agent. If any subscription agreement solicited by a Soliciting Dealer is rejected by the Dealer Manager or the Company, then the subscription agreement and check for the purchase of Securities will be returned to the rejected subscriber within ten (10) business days from the date of rejection. 
    
  All Investor Funds deposited in the Escrow Account shall not be subject to any liens or charges by the Company or the Escrow Agent, or judgments or creditors  claims against the Company, until and unless released to the Company as hereinafter provided. The Company understands and agrees that the Company shall not be entitled to any Investor Funds on deposit in the Escrow Account and no such funds shall become the property of the Company, or any other entity except as released to the Company pursuant to Sections 3, 4, 5 or 6 hereto.

Any authority delegated by the Advisor to any other Person shall be subject to the limitations on the rights and powers of the Advisor specifically set forth in this Agreement or the Charter. 
   
  4.02 Powers of the Advisor.  Subject to the express limitations set forth in this Agreement and the continuing and exclusive authority of the Board over the management of the Company, the power to direct the management, operation and policies of the Company, including making, financing and disposing of investments, shall be vested in the Advisor, which shall have the power by itself and shall be authorized and empowered on behalf and in the name of the Company to carry out any and all of the objectives and purposes of the Company and to perform all acts and enter into and perform all contracts and other undertakings that it may in its sole discretion deem necessary, advisable or incidental thereto to perform its obligations under this Agreement.

  ARTICLE 5 
  BANK ACCOUNTS 
  The Advisor may establish and maintain one or more bank accounts in the name of the Company (and its Subsidiaries) and may collect and deposit into any such account or accounts, and disburse from any such account or accounts, any money on behalf of the Company and its Subsidiaries, under such terms and conditions as the Board (or the governing body of such Subsidiary) may approve, provided that no funds shall be commingled with the funds of the Advisor.

  FEES 
   
  8.01 Acquisition Fees.  As compensation for the investigation, selection, sourcing and acquisition or origination (by purchase, investment or exchange) of Properties, Loans and other Permitted Investments, the Company shall pay an Acquisition Fee to the Advisor for each such investment (whether an acquisition or origination). With respect to the acquisition or origination of a Property, Loan or other Permitted Investment to be owned by the Company or a Subsidiary, the Acquisition Fee payable to the Advisor shall equal 2.0% of the sum of the amount actually paid or allocated to fund the acquisition, origination, development, construction or improvement of the Property, Loan or other Permitted Investment, inclusive of the Acquisition Expenses associated with such Property, Loan or other Permitted Investment and the amount of any debt associated with, or used to fund the investment in, such Property, Loan or other Permitted Investment.  Acquisition Fees will also include any amounts incurred or reserved for capital expenditures that will be used to provide funds for capital improvements and repairs applied to any real property investment acquired where the Company plans to add value. 
  With respect to the acquisition or origination of a Property, Loan or other Permitted Investment through any Joint Venture or any partnership in which the Company or the Partnership is, directly or indirectly, a partner and which is not deemed a Subsidiary, the Acquisition Fee payable to the Advisor shall equal 2.0% of the portion that is attributable to the Company s direct or indirect investment in such Joint Venture or partnership of the amount actually paid or allocated to fund the acquisition, origination, development, construction or improvement of the Property, Loan or other Permitted Investment, inclusive of the Acquisition Expenses associated with such Property, Loan or other Permitted Investment, plus the amount of any debt associated with, or used to fund the investment in, such Property, Loan or other Permitted Investment.  
  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the payment of Acquisition Fees by the Company shall be subject to the limitations on Acquisition Fees contained in (and defined in) the Charter. The Advisor shall submit an invoice to the Company following the closing or closings of each acquisition or origination, accompanied by a computation of the Acquisition Fee. Generally, the Acquisition Fee payable to the Advisor shall be paid at the closing of the transaction upon receipt of the invoice by the Company. However, the Acquisition Fee may or may not be taken, in whole or in part, as to any year in the sole discretion of the Advisor. All or any portion of the Acquisition Fees not taken as to any fiscal year shall be deferred without interest and may be paid in such other fiscal year as the Advisor shall determine. 
   
  8.02 Asset Management Fees.  The Company shall pay the Advisor as compensation for the services described in Section 3.03 hereof a monthly fee (the  Asset Management Fee ) in an amount equal to: 
  (a)  Prior to the Company s reporting of NAV, one-twelfth of 1.0% of the Cost of Investments, as of the end of the current month. 
  (b)  After the Company s reporting of NAV, one-twelfth of 1.0% of the Appraised Asset Values. 
  The asset management fees payable pursuant to (a) or (b) above are subject to the following adjustments: 
  (1) For any month in which a Property, Loan or other Permitted Investment is disposed of, the Company shall prorate the portion of the Asset Management Fee related to that specific Property, Loan, or other Permitted Investment by using a numerator equal to the number of days owned during the month of disposal, divided by a denominator equal to the total number of days in such month and add the resulting amount to the fee due for such month; and 
  (2) For any month in which a Property, Loan or other Permitted Investment is acquired, the Company shall prorate the portion of the Asset Management Fee related to that specific Property, Loan, or other Permitted Investment by using a numerator equal to the number of days in the month less the number of days owned during the month (including the full day of closing), divided by a denominator equal to the total number of days in such month and deduct the resulting amount from the fee due for such month. 
  The Advisor shall submit a monthly invoice to the Company, accompanied by a computation of the Asset Management Fee for the applicable period. Generally, the Asset Management Fee payable to the Advisor for any month shall be paid on the last day of such month, or within the first three business days following the last day of such month. As an example, the Asset Management Fee calculated with respect to the Property, Loans, or other Permitted Investments owned at the end of the month of January shall be due and payable between January 31 and the third business day of February in any year. 
  The Asset Management Fee may or may not be taken, in whole or in part, as to any year in the sole discretion of the Advisor.  All or any portion of the Asset Management Fees not taken as to any fiscal year shall be deferred without interest and may be paid in such other fiscal year as the Advisor shall determine. 
   
  8.03 Disposition Fees.  If the Advisor or any of its Affiliates provide a substantial amount of services (as determined by the Conflicts Committee) in connection with a Sale, the Advisor or such Affiliate shall receive a fee at the closing (the  Disposition Fee ) equal to the lesser of (i) (A) one-half of the aggregate brokerage commission paid, including the brokerage commission payable pursuant to this clause 8.03(i)(A) or (B) if none is paid, the Competitive Brokerage Commission or (ii) 2.00% of the Contract Sales Price; provided, however, that no Disposition Fee shall be payable to the Advisor for any Sale if such Sale involves the Company selling all or substantially all of its assets in one or more transactions designed to effectuate a business combination transaction (as opposed to a Company liquidation, in which case the Disposition Fee would be payable if the Advisor or an Affiliate provides a substantial amount of services as provided above).  The Company will not pay a disposition fee upon the maturity, prepayment or workout of a loan or other real estate related debt investment; however, if the Company takes ownership of a property as a result of a workout or foreclosure of a loan or the Company provides substantial assistance during the course of a workout, the Company will pay a disposition fee upon the sale of such property or disposition of such loan or other real estate related debt investment.  The payment of any Disposition Fees by the Company shall be subject to the limitations contained in the Company s Charter.  Any Disposition Fee payable under this Section 8.03 may be paid in addition to commissions paid to non-Affiliates, provided that the total commissions (including such Disposition Fee) paid to all Persons by the Company for each Sale shall not exceed an amount equal to the lesser of (i) 6% of the aggregate Contract Sales Price of each Property, Loan or other Permitted Investment or (ii) the Competitive Brokerage Commission for each Property, Loan or other Permitted Investment.  The Advisor shall submit an invoice to the Company following the closing or closings of each disposition, accompanied by a computation of the Disposition Fee. Generally, the Disposition Fee payable to the Advisor shall be paid at the closing of the transaction upon receipt of the invoice by the Company.  However, the Disposition Fee may or may not be taken, in whole or in part, as to any year in the sole discretion of the Advisor.  All or any portion of the Disposition Fees not taken as to any fiscal year shall be deferred without interest and may be paid in such other fiscal year as the Advisor shall determine. 
   
  8.04 Debt Financing Fees.  In the event of any debt financing obtained or assumed by or for the Company or its Subsidiaries (and any Joint Ventures that are not Subsidiaries but for which the Advisor provides substantial services in connection with obtaining such debt financing), the Company will pay to the Advisor a debt financing fee equal to 0.5% of the amount available under the financing.  The Debt Financing Fee includes the reimbursement of the specified cost incurred by the Advisor of engaging third parties to source debt financing, and nothing herein shall prevent the Advisor from entering fee-splitting arrangements with third parties with respect to the Debt Financing Fee.  All or any portion of the Debt Financing Fees not taken as to any fiscal year shall be deferred without interest and may be paid in such other fiscal year as the Advisor shall determine.  In no event will the Debt Financing Fee be paid more than once in respect of the same debt.  For example, upon refinancing, the Advisor would only receive 0.5% of the incremental amount of additional debt financing obtained in the refinancing. 
   
  8.05 Changes to Fee Structure.  In the event of Listing, the Company and the Advisor shall negotiate in good faith to establish a fee structure appropriate for a perpetual-life entity. 
   
  8.06 Limitations on an Internalization Transaction.  The Company may not acquire the Advisor or an Affiliate thereof in order to become self-managed, whether by means of a merger, stock acquisition, or asset purchase (an  Internalization Transaction ) unless the Advisor agrees to proceed with an Internalization Transaction without the payment of any internalization fee or other consideration by the Company, whether in the form of a cash payment or in the form of stock, warrants or options.

The Advisor shall prepare a statement documenting the expenses of the Company during each quarter and shall deliver such statement to the Company within 45 days after the end of each quarter.  
  (ii)  The Company shall not reimburse the Advisor to the extent such reimbursement would cause the total amount spent by the Company on Organization and Offering Expenses to exceed 15% of the Gross Proceeds raised as of the termination of the Offering and provided further that within 60 days after the end of the month in which an Offering terminates, the Advisor shall reimburse the Company to the extent the Company incurred Organization and Offering Expenses exceeding 15% of the Gross Proceeds raised in the completed Offering; the Company shall not reimburse the Advisor for any Organization and Offering Expenses that the Conflicts Committee determines are not fair and commercially reasonable to the Company.

  OTHER ACTIVITIES OF THE ADVISOR 
   
  11.01 Relationship.

Nothing herein contained shall prevent the Advisor from engaging in other activities, including, without limitation, the rendering of advice to other Persons (including other REITs) and the management of other programs advised, sponsored or organized by the Advisor or its Affiliates.  Nor shall this Agreement limit or restrict the right of any manager, director, officer, employee or equityholder of the Advisor or its Affiliates to engage in any other business or to render services of any kind to any other Person.

  11.03 Investment Opportunities and Allocation.  The Advisor shall be required to use commercially reasonable efforts to present a continuing and suitable investment program to the Company that is consistent with the investment policies and objectives of the Company, but neither the Advisor nor any Affiliate of the Advisor shall be obligated generally to present any particular investment opportunity to the Company even if the opportunity is of character that, if presented to the Company, could be taken by the Company.

  (ii)    The Advisor or its Affiliates were acting on behalf of or performing services for the Company.  
  (iii)    Such liability or loss was not the result of  negligence or misconduct by the Advisor or its Affiliates.   

15.03 Limitation on Payment of Expenses.  The Company shall pay or reimburse reasonable legal expenses and other costs incurred by the Advisor or its Affiliates in advance of the final disposition of a proceeding only if (in addition to the procedures required by the Maryland General Corporation Law, as amended from time to time) all of the following are satisfied: (a) the proceeding relates to acts or omissions with respect to the performance of duties or services on behalf of the Company, (b) the legal proceeding was initiated by a third party who is not a stockholder or, if by a stockholder acting in his or her capacity as such, a court of competent jurisdiction approves such advancement and (c) the Advisor or its Affiliates undertake to repay the amount paid or reimbursed by the Company, together with the applicable legal rate of interest thereon, if it is ultimately determined that the particular indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification.

Such engagement shall not commence with respect to any particular Asset until the Owner which owns such Asset, in its sole discretion, has the ability to appoint or hire the Manager. Further, Owner may elect to exclude any Asset from the terms of this Agreement upon written notice to Manager delivered by Owner within ten (10) days following the later of (i) Owner s acquisition of a direct or indirect equity interest in such Asset or (ii) the date on which Owner, in its sole discretion, has the ability to appoint or hire the Manager with respect to such Asset.  Owner has the right to include any previously excluded Asset ten (10) days following delivery of written notice from Owner to Manager.  Manager hereby accepts such appointment on the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth.   
    
  All services performed by Manager under this Agreement shall be performed as an independent contractor of the Owner.  All obligations or expenses incurred hereunder, for the benefit of the Projects and all purchases of or contracts for sales or services in bulk or volume that Manager may obtain for discount or convenience in connection with its operation of other apartment projects, shall be for the account of, on behalf of, and at the expense of the Owner (reasonably allocated between all benefited Projects) except as otherwise specifically provided herein.  The Owner shall not be obligated to reimburse Manager for expenses for: (i) office equipment or office supplies of Manager (unless incurred solely for the Assets), (ii) any overhead expenses of Manager incurred with respect to any offices located at any place other than on the Projects, (iii) costs relating to accounting services performed hereunder, (iv) any salaries of employees of Manager not accounted for in the approved Budget and its supporting payroll schedule, or (v) any travel expenses of employees of Manager in supervising the on-site Project Personnel and the operation of the Projects, unless approved in advance in writing by the Owner.   
    
  Manager shall have the right to subcontract out some or all of the services that it performs hereunder with respect to any or all of the Assets.  In the event that Manager subcontracts out services or if an Owner engages a property manager not affiliated with Manager, Manager shall be entitled to receive the Management Fee for its oversight of such manager, and the amount payable to such third party manager or any subcontracted manager shall be paid out of the Management Fee paid to Manager.  
    
    2.02.       Dealings with Advisor  .     Unless Owner specifically informs Manager to the contrary, Advisor may perform any of the obligations or exercise any of the rights of Owner under this Agreement; provided that any actions that Advisor takes on behalf of Owner pursuant hereto are subject to the terms of the agreements between Advisor and Owner, and this Section 2.02 does not expand or modify the authority of Advisor to act on behalf of Owner.     
    
  2.03.      General Operation  .    Subject to the limitations imposed by the Budget from time to time, Manager shall manage the Projects and Debt Investments in the same manner as is customary and usual in management of comparable investments, and shall provide such services as are customarily provided by operators and servicers of high quality projects and investments of comparable class and standing. 
    
  Manager has received copies of agreements of limited partnership, joint venture partnership agreements and operating agreements of Owner and its affiliates as well as the articles of incorporation, bylaws, and registration statement on Form S-11 (no. 333-207740) of the Company, including all prospectus supplements and post-effective amendments thereto (collectively, the    Ownership Agreements   ) and is familiar with the terms thereof. Advisor agrees to obtain and review copies of all mortgages on all properties and inform Manager of any restrictions relating to property use thereof. Manager will use reasonable care to avoid any act or omission which, in the performance of its duties hereunder, in any way conflicts with the terms of the Ownership Agreements or the mortgages in the absence of the express direction of the Conflicts Committee, and Manager shall promptly notify Owner if any such conflict arises. 
    
  In addition to the other obligations of Manager set forth herein, Manager shall render the following services and perform the following duties for Owner in connection with the Projects and Debt Investments in a commercially diligent and efficient manner:  (a) maintain businesslike relations with tenants whose service requests shall be received, considered, recorded and acted upon in systematic fashion in order to show the action taken with respect to each; (b) collect all monthly rentals due from tenants and rent from users of recreational facilities in the Project, if any; (c) request, demand, collect, and receive any and all charges or rents which become due to Owner, and at Owner s expense and the Company s direction, coordinate and oversee such legal action as may be necessary or desirable to collect rent and/or evict tenants delinquent in payment of monthly rental or other charges (security deposits, late charges, etc.) as more particularly described in Section 2.10 below; (d)  prepare or cause to be prepared for execution by the Owner (and/or the Company, as applicable) all forms, reports and returns, if any, required to be filed by or on behalf of the Owner under applicable federal, state or local laws and any other requirements relating to the employment of personnel (anything contained herein to the contrary notwithstanding, however, Manager shall not be obligated to prepare any of Owner s or the Company s state or federal income tax returns; (e) use all reasonable efforts at all times during the term of this Agreement to operate and maintain the Projects according to the highest standards achievable consistent with the operation of comparable quality units; (f) advertise when necessary, within the constraints of the Budget, the availability of units for rental and display  for rent  or other similar signs upon the Projects, it being understood that Manager may install one or more signs on or about the Project stating that the Project is under management of Manager and may use, in a tasteful manner, Manager s name and logo in any display advertising of the Project; (g) sign, renew and cancel tenant leases for the Project as agent for Owner, in compliance with standards established by Owner and approved by Owner, on the lease form provided by Manager, and on terms based upon criteria approved from time to time by Owner and based upon Manager s recommendations, and (h) monitor the performance of the Debt Investments, including (i) collecting amounts owed to the Owner, (ii) reviewing on an as-needed basis the properties serving, directly or indirectly, as collateral for the Debt Investments, the owners of those properties and the markets in general and (iii) maintaining escrow accounts, monitoring advances, monitoring loan covenants and reviewing insurance compliance. 
    
  It is understood and agreed, however, that Manager shall not, and does not, provide security services to the Projects.  Should the Owner choose to do so, the Owner may direct that Manager, on Owner s behalf, separately contract with a non-affiliated company (a    Security Company   ) providing alarm systems, patrol and/or similar services (   Security Services   ).  Manager shall have no duty to supervise or control performance of Security Services for any Security Company but Manager shall, if requested by Owner, evaluate and report its findings to Owner, as directed.  Without limiting the provisions of Section 6.03 of this Agreement, Owner shall indemnify, defend, protect and hold Manager harmless for, from and against any loss, liability, cost, expense, damage claim or cause of action, including, without limitation, attorneys  fees, court costs and other litigation expenses and costs, arising from any personal injury, loss of property or other matter occurring on or about any Project, relating to the acts or omissions of a Security Company, any claimed inadequacy of Security Services, the failure to provide Security Services or any other matter relating to the security of any Project.  The indemnification obligations of Owner in this Section 2.03 shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement.   
    
  2.04.      Budget  . 
    
  (a)    Manager will submit to Owner for Owner s approval, an initial capital and operating budget for each Project (the    Initial Budge  t ) for the first fiscal year (or partial fiscal year as appropriate) within 14 days after a Project is included under this Agreement.  Manager shall submit to Owner for Owner s approval no later than sixty (60) days prior to the beginning of each successive Fiscal Year the Budget for the ensuing Fiscal Year.  Manager shall provide Owner with such information regarding the Budget as may be, from time to time, reasonably requested by Owner.  Upon receipt of the Budget from Manager, the Company shall promptly deliver the Budget to Owner.  Owner shall approve or object to the Budget.  Manager may proceed under the terms of the proposed Budget for items that are not objected to and may take any action with respect to items not approved if the expenditure is (i) less than Two Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($2,500), (ii) is, in the Manager s reasonable judgment, required to avoid personal injury, significant property damage, a default under any loan encumbering the Project, a violation of applicable law or the suspension of a service or (iii) non-discretionary items such as real estate taxes, insurance or utilities. In the event that the items that are objected to are operational expenditures (but not including real estate taxes, insurance, utilities and similar items that cannot be controlled by Manager), as opposed to capital expenditures, Manager shall be entitled to oversee and supervise the operation of each Project using the prior year s budget for that Project until the approval is obtained.  If the Budget for that Project is not approved, upon the request of Owner, Manager will prepare and deliver to Owner, a revised Budget for the Fiscal Year.  
  (b)    Together with submission of the annual Budget, Manager shall submit to Owner for approval by Owner an operating plan for the general operation of the Projects for the subsequent Fiscal Year, including a proposed list of improvements to the Projects, general insurance plan, marketing plan and plan for the general operation and maintenance of the Projects (the    Operating Plan   ).  Upon the request of Owner, Manager will prepare and deliver to Owner, a revised Operating Plan for the Fiscal Year.   
    
  (c)    In the event there shall be a substantial discrepancy between the actual results of operations for any month and the estimated results of operations for such month as set forth in the Budget or the Operating Plan for any Project, Manager shall, upon request, furnish to Owner within fifteen (15) days after the expiration of such month a written explanation as to why the discrepancy occurred.  If substantial variations have occurred or are anticipated by Manager during the course of any Fiscal Year, Manager, upon Owner s reasonable request, shall prepare and submit to Owner a revised Budget and/or Operating Plan covering the remainder of the Fiscal Year. 
    
         2.05.        Project Personnel  .    Manager shall use reasonable and prudent efforts to investigate, hire, train, instruct, pay, promote, discharge and supervise the work of all its employees involved with the management of the Projects.  Since it is acknowledged that the Projects may need fulltime resident managers on site, it is agreed that a Project Employee (including his/her spouse and dependent children) may live rent-free in an apartment unit designated by Owner, and receive, in addition, salary and normal benefits approved in advance and accounted for in the Budget.  All Project Personnel shall be employees of Manager. 
    
  Owner shall immediately reimburse Manager each pay period for the total aggregate compensation, including salary, and other related costs and fringe benefits, payable with respect to the Project Personnel who shall be accounted for in the approved Budget and supporting payroll schedule, any temporary employees working at each Project, the Project s proportionate share of all costs relating to roving maintenance and similar personnel, but only to the extent reflected in the approved Budget.  The term  fringe benefits  as used herein shall mean and include the employer s contribution of F.I.C.A., unemployment compensation and other employment taxes, worker s compensation, group life and accident and health insurance premiums, 401K contributions, performance bonuses, and disability and other similar benefits paid or payable by the Manager to its employees in other projects operated by Manager, but only to the extent reflected in the approved Budget. 
    
    2.06.      Contracts and Supplies  .    Except as otherwise provided herein, Manager, as sub-agent for Owner and at Owner s expense, and without compensation directly or indirectly to Manager, except as expressly set forth herein, shall enter into written agreements with (i) concessionaires, licensees, or other intended users of the facilities of the Projects, (ii) contractors furnishing services to the Projects, including, but not limited to, utilities, janitorial, trash collection, cleaning, vermin extermination, furnace and air conditioning maintenance, security protection, pest control, landscape and irrigation system maintenance, repair, maintenance, and replacement of elements of the buildings, recreational facilities or common areas (to the extent such work cannot reasonably and less expensively be done by Project  Personnel), and any other services that are reasonably necessary to the maintenance and operation of first-class projects comparable to the Projects (herein called    Customary Services   ).  Manager shall place purchase orders as and when necessary to assure timely and adequate availability of such equipment, tools, appliances, materials and supplies as are necessary to properly maintain and operate the Projects.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, all contracts (and renewals thereof) entered into by Manager, unless Manager has obtained Owner s prior written consent, must be:  (a) cancelable without penalty upon not more than thirty (30) days notice: and (b) have terms of one (1) year or less, and (c) require the provider of such Customary Services pursuant to such contract to comply with Owner s insurance requirements.  Manager shall obtain competitive bids annually for any such contracts and, in connection therewith, shall investigate the competency and history of all potential bidders; develop and submit detailed specifications for work to be performed; solicit and obtain such bids; conduct an analysis of bid results; and shall submit all bids to Owner for review and approval, together with Manager s recommendation with respect thereto.  Manager shall continually inspect the Projects and ensure that all contract specifications are being properly administered, and conduct periodic complete walk-throughs of the Projects with specific Customary Service providers as often as reasonably necessary.  Manager shall use reasonable efforts to purchase all goods, supplies or services at the lowest cost reasonably available from reputable sources in the metropolitan areas where the Projects are located.  In making any contract or purchase, Manager shall use reasonable efforts to obtain favorable discounts for Owner and all discounts, rebates or commissions under any contract or purchase order made hereunder shall inure to the benefit of Owner.  Manager shall make payments under any such contract or purchase order to enable Owner to take advantage of any such discount if Owner provides sufficient funds therefor. 
    
    2.07.      Alterations, Repairs and Maintenance  . 
    
  (a)    Manager shall make or install, or cause to be made and installed at Owner s expense and in the name of Owner, all necessary or desirable repairs, interior and exterior cleaning, painting and decorating, plumbing, alterations, replacements, improvements and other normal maintenance and repair work on and to the Projects as are customarily made by Manager in the operation of first-class apartment projects; provided that no unbudgeted expenditure may be made for such purposes without the prior approval of Owner, except emergency repairs involving manifest danger to life or property, or when necessary to avoid criminal or civil liability, or for the safety of the tenants, or to avoid the suspension of any necessary service to the Projects (   Emergency Repairs   ).  Emergency Repairs may be made by the Manager without prior approval and irrespective of the cost limitations imposed by Section 2.04(a), provided that in each such instance, Manager shall, before causing any such Emergency Repairs to be made, use reasonable efforts under the circumstances to notify Owner of that repair.  All such work shall be performed by Project Personnel unless it is not reasonable for them to do so due to the expertise, time constraints, or other considerations involved, and/or because having them do so is more expensive.

The registration statement and the prospectus contained therein, as finally amended at the effective date of the registration statement (the    Effective Date   ), are respectively hereinafter referred to as the    Registration Statement    and the    Prospectus  ,  except that if the Company files a prospectus or prospectus supplement pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act, or if the Company files a post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement, the term    Prospectus    includes the prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) or the prospectus included in such post-effective amendment.  The term    Preliminary Prospectus    as used herein shall mean a preliminary prospectus related to the Shares as contemplated by Rule 430 or Rule 430A of the Rules and Regulations included at any time as part of the Registration Statement. If a separate registration statement is filed and becomes effective solely with respect to shares of the Company s common stock offered pursuant to the DRP, the terms  Registration Statement  and  Prospectus  shall also refer to such registration statement and prospectus contained therein from and after the date of effectiveness of such registration statement, as such registration statement and prospectus may be amended or supplemented from time to time. 
              (b) 
    On the Effective Date, on the date of the Prospectus and on the date any post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement becomes effective or any amendment or supplement to the Prospectus is filed with the SEC, the Registration Statement and the Prospectus, as applicable, including the financial statements contained therein, complied or will comply in all material respects with the Securities Act and the Rules and Regulations.  On the Effective Date, the Registration Statement did not or will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.  On the date of the Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, as applicable, the Prospectus did not or will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.  Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the Company s representations in this   Section 2(b)   will not extend to such statements contained in or omitted from the Registration Statement or the Prospectus, as amended or supplemented, that are primarily within the knowledge of the Dealer Manager or any of the Dealers (as defined below) and are based upon information furnished by the Dealer Manager in writing to the Company specifically for inclusion therein.   
              (c)

              (f)

              (g)

              (h)

              3. 
    Grant of Authority to the Dealer Manager.  
              (a) 
    Based on the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement, and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, the Company appoints you as the Dealer Manager and principal distributor for the Company during the Offering Period (as defined in   Section 3(b)  ) to find, on a    best efforts    basis, purchasers for the Shares for cash through the distribution channels contemplated herein and in the Prospectus, including the sale of Shares for cash directly to clients and customers identified by the Company on the terms and conditions stated herein and in the Prospectus.

The Offering Period shall in all events terminate upon the sale of all of the Shares.  Upon termination of the Offering Period, the Dealer Manager s appointment and this Agreement shall terminate without obligation on the part of the Dealer Manager or the Company except as set forth in this Agreement.

*  Upon the terms set forth herein or in the Prospectus (as amended and supplemented), the Dealer Manager   may agree to reallow to any Dealer a portion of its dealer manager fee pursuant to a Selected Dealer Agreement and a marketing fee agreement. 
           (c) 
    Except as may be provided in the  Plan of Distribution  section of the Prospectus, which may be amended and supplemented from time to time, the Company will pay to the Dealer Manager an annual distribution and shareholder servicing fee in connection with sales of Class T Shares in the Primary Offering during the term of this Agreement, payable for five  years from the date on which such Class T Share is issued for services and expenses related to the marketing, sale and distribution of such Class T Shares and for providing shareholder services, subject to the limitations set forth below. The annual distribution and shareholder servicing fee of 1% of the purchase price per Class T Share (or, once reported, the amount of the estimated net asset value per Class T Share) will accrue daily as provided in the  The Plan of Distribution  section of the Prospectus. The Company will pay the distribution and shareholder servicing fee to the Dealer Manager monthly in arrears. The Dealer Manager may reallow all or a portion of the distribution and shareholder servicing fee to the Dealer who initially sold the Class T Shares giving rise to such distribution and shareholder servicing fees to the extent the Selected Dealer Agreement with such Dealer provides for such a reallowance. Notwithstanding, if the Dealer Manager is notified that the Dealer who sold such Class T Shares is no longer the broker-dealer of record with respect to such Class T Shares or is not in compliance with the applicable terms of the Selected Dealer Agreement related to the payment of the annual distribution and shareholder servicing fee, then such Dealer s entitlement to the distribution and shareholder servicing fee related to such Class T Shares shall cease, and such Dealer shall not receive the distribution and shareholder servicing fee for any portion of the month in which such Dealer is not the broker dealer of record or otherwise not in compliance on the last day of the month. Thereafter, such distribution and shareholder servicing fee may be reallowed by the Dealer Manager to the then-current broker-dealer of record of the Class T Shares, if any, if such broker-dealer of record has entered into a Selected Dealer Agreement or similar servicing agreement with the Dealer Manager that provides for such reallowance and is in compliance with the applicable terms of such agreement related to the payment of the distribution and shareholder servicing fee.  The Dealer Manager may also reallow some or all of the distribution and shareholder servicing fee to other broker-dealers who provide services with respect to the Class T Shares pursuant to a servicing agreement with the Dealer Manager to the extent such servicing agreement provides for such reallowance, all in accordance with the terms of such servicing agreement. In this regard, all determinations will be made by the Dealer Manager in good faith in its sole discretion. 
     Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Company will cease paying the distribution and shareholder servicing fee with respect to the Class T Shares at the earliest of (i) the date after the termination of the Primary Offering at which, in the aggregate, underwriting compensation from all sources, including the distribution and shareholder servicing fee, equals 10% of the gross proceeds from the Primary Offering, calculated by the Company with the assistance of the Dealer Manager after the termination of the Primary Offering; (ii) the date on which the Company lists its common stock on a national securities exchange; and (iii) the date of a merger or other extraordinary transaction in which the Company is a party and in which the Shares are exchanged for cash or other securities. 
  A distribution and shareholder servicing fee will not be paid on (i) any Class A Shares or (ii) Class T Shares issued under the DRP. 
    
           (d) 
    Upon the terms set forth in the Prospectus, reduced selling commissions will be paid to the Dealer Manager and reduced per share selling prices shall be recovered on large transactions of Class A Shares in accordance with the following tables (based on the initial Primary Offering price of $10.00 per Class A Share), which may be amended and supplemented by the Prospectus: 

The reduced selling price and selling commission will apply to the entire purchase.  All commission rates are calculated assuming a price per share of $10.00 for Class A Shares.  For example, a purchase of 250,000 Class A Shares in a single transaction would result in a purchase price of $2,425,000 ($9.70 per share) and selling commissions of $100,000. 
    
  Upon the terms set forth in the Prospectus, reduced selling commissions will be paid to the Dealer Manager and reduced per share selling prices shall be recovered on large transactions of Class T Shares in accordance with the following tables (based on the initial Primary Offering price of $9.47 per Class T Share), which may be amended and supplemented by the Prospectus: 

The   reduced selling price and selling commission will apply to the entire purchase.  All commission rates are calculated assuming a price per share of $9.47 for Class T Shares.  For example, a purchase of 250,000 Class T Shares in a single transaction would result in a purchase price of $2,345,000 ($9.38 per share) and selling commissions of $23,675. 
    
           (e) 
    As described in the Prospectus, the Dealer Manager agrees to sell up to 5% of the Class A Shares in the Primary Offering to persons identified by the Company pursuant to the Company s  friends and family  program at a 10.0% discount.  The officers, directors and affiliates of the Company and investors designated by the Company as buying under the  friends and family  program may subscribe to Class A Shares for an initial subscription price of $9.00 (based on the initial primary offering price of $10.00 per Class A Share), reflecting that selling commissions and the dealer manager fee will not be payable to you in connection with these purchases. The Dealer Manager agrees to work together with the Company to implement this program and to execute sales under the program according to the procedures agreed upon by the Dealer Manager and the Company. 
       
           (f) 
    In addition, as described in the Prospectus, the Dealer Manager may sell Class A Shares to Dealers, their retirement plans, their representatives and the family members, IRAs and the qualified plans of their representatives at a 7.0% discount. Such purchasers may subscribe to Class A Shares for an initial purchase price of $9.30 per share (based on the initial primary offering price of $10.00 per Class A Share), reflecting that selling commissions will not be payable in connection with these purchases in consideration of the services rendered by such Dealers and representatives in the Offering.  For purposes of this discount, a family member includes such person s spouse, parent, child, sibling, mother- or father-in-law, son- or daughter-in law or brother- or sister-in-law. 
       
           (g) 
    The Company will also reimburse the Dealer Manager for all items of underwriter compensation referenced in the Prospectus, if any, to the extent the Prospectus indicates that they will be paid by the Company, provided that (i) total underwriting compensation may not exceed 10% of gross proceeds from the Offering (excluding proceeds from the offering of Shares pursuant to the DRP), and (ii) total organization and offering expenses may not exceed 15% of gross proceeds from the Offering.  In accordance with FINRA Rule 2310, the Company shall also pay directly or reimburse the Dealer Manager for bona fide invoiced due diligence expenses of the Dealers and non-participating broker dealers, subject to the cap on organization and offering expenses described above. 
       
           (h) 
    Notwithstanding the foregoing, no commissions, payments or amounts whatsoever will be paid to the Dealer Manager under this Section 4 unless or until the Company has accepted the respective subscription in accordance with the terms of the subscription agreement and such investor has been admitted as a stockholder of the Company.  Further, until the Company raises $2 million in the Offering (the    Minimum Offering   ), investments will be held in escrow and no commissions, payments or amounts whatsoever will be paid thereon to the Dealer Manager under this Section 4 unless and until the Minimum Offering has been reached, and then only with respect to such investments from investors as are released to the Company from such escrow.  Until the Company raises $50 million in the Offering (the    Pennsylvania Minimum   ), investments from Pennsylvania investors will be held in a separate escrow and no commissions, payments or amounts whatsoever will be paid thereon to the Dealer Manager under this Section 4 unless and until the Pennsylvania Minimum has been reached, and then only with respect to such investments from Pennsylvania investors as are released to the Company from such escrow.  Until the Company raises $20 million in the Offering (the    Washington Minimum   ), investments from Washington investors will be held in a separate escrow and no commissions, payments or amounts whatsoever will be paid thereon to the Dealer Manager under this Section 4 unless and until the Washington Minimum has been reached, and then only with respect to such investments from Washington investors as are released to the Company from such escrow.  Until the Company raises $2.5 million in the Offering (the    New York Minimum   ), investments from New York investors will be held in a separate escrow and no commissions, payments or amounts whatsoever will be paid thereon to the Dealer Manager under this Section 4 unless and until the New York Minimum has been reached, and then only with respect to such investments from New York investors as are released to the Company from such escrow.  If the Minimum Offering is not reached within the time period specified in the Prospectus, investments will be returned to the investors in accordance with the Prospectus.  If the Pennsylvania Minimum is not obtained within the time period specified in the Prospectus, the investments from Pennsylvania investors will be returned or held for subsequent escrow periods in accordance with the Prospectus.  If the Washington Minimum is not obtained within the time period specified in the Prospectus, the investments from Washington investors will be returned or held for subsequent escrow periods in accordance with the Prospectus.   If the New York Minimum is not reached within the time period specified in the Prospectus, the investments from New York investors will be returned to New York investors in accordance with the Prospectus.   
       
           (i) 
    The Company will not be liable or responsible to any Dealer for direct payment of commissions, dealer manager fees or distribution and shareholder servicing fees  to such Dealer; it is the sole and exclusive responsibility of the Dealer Manager for payment of commissions, reallowance of dealer manager fees and distribution and shareholder servicing fees  to Dealers.  Notwithstanding the above, at its discretion, the Company may act as agent of the Dealer Manager by making direct payment of commissions, reallowance of dealer manager fees or distribution and shareholder servicing fees to such Dealers without incurring any liability therefor.  
       
           5. 
    Covenants of the Company.    The Company covenants and agrees with the Dealer Manager that:

In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies an indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled, to the extent it may wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to participate in the defense thereof, with separate counsel.

If such claims or actions are alleged or brought against more than one indemnified party, then the indemnifying party shall only be obliged to reimburse the expenses and fees of the one law firm that has been selected by a majority of the indemnified parties against which such action is finally brought; and in the event a majority of such indemnified parties are unable to agree on which law firm for which expenses or fees will be reimbursable by the indemnifying party, then payment shall be made to the first law firm of record representing an indemnified party against the action or claim.  Such law firm shall be paid only to the extent of services performed by such law firm and no reimbursement shall be payable to such law firm on account of legal services performed by another law firm.

  Ladies and Gentlemen: 
    
  Resource Apartment REIT III, Inc.  (the    Company   ) is a corporation organized under Maryland law.

  Our firm, Resource Securities, Inc. (the    Dealer Manager   ) has entered into a Dealer Manager Agreement (the    Dealer Manager Agreement   ) with the Company for offers and sales of the Shares pursuant to the terms therein, the form of which is attached hereto as   Exhibit A   and incorporated in this Agreement by reference.  Under the Dealer Manager Agreement, the Dealer Manager has agreed to form a group of FINRA member firms (the    Dealers   ), which will obtain subscriptions for Shares on a  best efforts  basis as provided in the Prospectus.  Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Dealer Manager Agreement.  
    
  You are invited to become one of the Dealers on a non-exclusive basis.  By your acceptance below you agree to act in that capacity and may offer the Shares to your customers in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

1.      Dealer Manager Agreement.

The indemnification agreements contained in Section 8 of the Dealer Manager Agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the Dealer Manager Agreement.

The Final Review Office will in turn by the end of the next business day following receipt by the Final Review Office transmit such checks and subscription documents for deposit to the escrow agent for the Company or, after the Minimum Offering has been achieved, to the Company, except for investments from Pennsylvania, Washington and New York investors.

  3.      Pricing. 
    
    Except as otherwise provided in the  Plan of Distribution  section of the Prospectus (as amended and supplemented), the Shares are to be sold at an initial per Share cash price as follows: 

Distribution Channel 
    Primary Offering      Shares 

DRP Shares 
      Class A Shares 

Sales through a Dealer earning transaction-based compensation 
    $10.00 
    $9.60 
      Sales through all other distribution channels as described in the Prospectus 
    $9.30 
    $9.60 
      Class T Shares 

Sales through a Dealer earning transaction-based compensation 
    $9.47 
    $9.09 

Upon the terms set forth in the Prospectus, pursuant to the Company s volume discount program, Class A Shares shall be sold at reduced prices in accordance with the following tables (based on the initial Primary Offering price of $10.00 per Class A Share), which may be amended and supplemented by the Prospectus: 

The reduced selling price (and the applicable selling commission under the volume discount program) will apply to the entire purchase.  For example, a purchase of 250,000 Class A Shares in a single transaction would result in a purchase price of $2,425,000 ($9.70 per share). 
    
  Upon the terms set forth in the Prospectus, pursuant to the Company s volume discount program, Class T Shares shall be sold at reduced prices in accordance with the following tables (based on the initial Primary Offering price of $9.47 per Class T Share), which may be amended and supplemented by the Prospectus: 

The   reduced selling price (and the applicable selling commission under the volume discount program) will apply to the entire purchase.  For example, a purchase of 250,000 Class T Shares in a single transaction would result in a purchase price of $2,345,000 ($9.38 per share). 
  In addition, as described in the Prospectus, the Dealer Manager may sell Class A Shares to the Dealer, its retirement plans, its representatives and the family members, IRAs and the qualified plans of its representatives at a 7.0% discount.  Such purchasers may subscribe for Class A Shares at a purchase price of $9.30 per share (based on the initial primary offering price of $10.00 per Class A Share), reflecting that selling commissions will not be payable in connection with such purchases in consideration of the services rendered by the Dealer and its representatives in the Offering.  For purposes of these discounts, a family member includes such person s spouse, parent, child, sibling, mother- or father-in-law, son- or daughter-in law or brother- or sister-in-law. 
    
  4.      Dealer s Compensation. 
    
  Except for discounts described in this Section 4 or as otherwise provided in the  Plan of Distribution  section of the Prospectus (as amended and supplemented), the Dealer s selling commission applicable to the public offering price of the Class A Shares and Class T Shares sold by the Dealer, which it is authorized to sell hereunder, is as follows: 

Selling Commissions 

Distribution Channel 
    Primary Offering      Shares 

DRP 
      Class A Shares 

Sales through a Dealer earning transaction-based compensation 
    7.0% 
    0.0% 
      Sales through all other distribution channels as discussed in the Prospectus 
    0.0% 
    0.0% 
      Class T Shares 

Sales through a Dealer earning transaction-based compensation 
    2.0% 
    0.0% 

The preceding commission (for the Dealer distribution channel) shall be adjusted for sales of Class A Shares under the volume discount program in accordance with the following table (based on the initial Primary Offering price of $10.00 per Class A Share), which may be amended and supplemented by the Prospectus:  

The reduced selling commission will apply to the entire purchase.  All commission rates are calculated assuming a price per share of $10.00 for Class A Shares.  For example, a purchase of 250,000 Class A Shares in a single transaction would result in selling commissions of $100,000. 
    
  The preceding commission (for the Dealer distribution channel) shall be adjusted for sales of Class T Shares under the volume discount program in accordance with the following table (based on the initial Primary Offering price of $9.47 per Class T Share), which may be amended and supplemented by the Prospectus: 

The reduced selling commission will apply to the entire purchase.  All commission rates are calculated assuming a price per share of $9.47 for Class T Shares.  For example, a purchase of 250,000 Class T Shares in a single transaction would result in selling commissions of $23,675. 
    
  All selling commissions and dealer manager fees described below shall be based on Shares sold by Dealer and accepted and confirmed by the Company, which commission and dealer manager fees will be paid by the Dealer Manager.  For these purposes, a  sale of Shares  shall occur if and only if a transaction has closed with a subscriber for Shares pursuant to all applicable offering and subscription documents, payment for the Shares has been received by the Company in full in the manner provided in Section 2 hereof, the Minimum Offering, Pennsylvania Minimum, Washington Minimum and New York Minimum, as applicable, have been achieved, the Company has accepted the subscription agreement of such subscriber and the Company has thereafter distributed the commission and dealer manager fee, as applicable, to the Dealer Manager in connection with such transaction.  The Dealer affirms that the Dealer Manager s liability for commissions and dealer manager fees payable is limited solely to the proceeds of commissions or dealer manager fees, as applicable, receivable from the Company and the Dealer hereby waives any and all rights to receive payment of commissions and reallowance of dealer manager fees due until such time as the Dealer Manager is in receipt of the commission or dealer manager fee, as applicable, from the Company.  
    
  Except as may be provided in the  Plan of Distribution  section of the Prospectus, which may be amended and supplemented from time to time, the Company will pay to the Dealer Manager an annual distribution and shareholder servicing fee in connection with sales of Class T Shares in the Primary Offering, payable for five years from the date on which such Class T Share is issued for services and expenses related to the marketing, sale and distribution of such Class T Shares and for providing shareholder services, subject to the limitations set forth below. The Dealer Manager will reallow to Dealer the distribution and shareholder servicing fee with respect to the Class T Shares sold in the Primary Offering by the Dealer during the term of this Agreement as compensation for the Dealer (i) acting as broker-dealer of record with respect to such Class T Shares, and (ii) providing ongoing or regular account or portfolio maintenance for the holder of such Class T Shares, assisting with recordkeeping, assisting and processing distribution payments or providing other similar services as the holder of such Class T Shares may reasonably require in connection with such holder s investment in Class T Shares. Notwithstanding, if the Dealer Manager is notified that the Dealer is no longer the broker-dealer of record with respect to such Class T Shares or no longer satisfies the conditions set forth in (ii) above, 
  then the Dealer s entitlement to the distribution and shareholder servicing fee related to such Class T Shares shall cease, and the Dealer shall not receive the distribution and shareholder servicing fee for any portion of the month in which the Dealer is not eligible on the last day of the month. Thereafter, such distribution and shareholder servicing fee may be reallowed by the Dealer Manager to the then-current broker-dealer of record of the Class T Shares, if any, if such broker-dealer of record has entered into a Selected Dealer Agreement or similar servicing agreement with the Dealer Manager that provides for such reallowance and such broker-dealer is in compliance with the eligibility requirements set forth in such agreement.  The Dealer Manager may also reallow some or all of the distribution and shareholder servicing fee to other broker-dealers who provide services with respect to the Class T Shares pursuant to a servicing agreement with the Dealer Manager to the extent such servicing agreement provides for such reallowance, all in accordance with the terms of such servicing agreement. In this regard, all determinations will be made by the Dealer Manager in good faith in its sole discretion. 
  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Company will cease paying the distribution and shareholder servicing fee with respect to the Class T Shares, and the Dealer Manager will cease reallowing the distribution and shareholder servicing fee to Dealer, at the earliest of (i) the date after the termination of the Primary Offering at which, in the aggregate, underwriting compensation from all sources, including the distribution and shareholder servicing fee, equals 10% of the gross proceeds from the Primary Offering, calculated by the Company with the assistance of the Dealer Manager after the termination of the Primary Offering; (ii) the date on which the Company lists its common stock on a national securities exchange; and (iii) the date of a merger or other extraordinary transaction in which the Company is a party and in which the Shares are exchanged for cash or other securities. 
    
  A distribution and shareholder servicing fee will not be paid on Class A Shares or Class T Shares issued under the DRP. 
    
  In addition, upon the terms set forth herein or in the Prospectus (as amended and supplemented), the Dealer Manager will reallow to Dealer a portion of its dealer manager fee equal to 1.0% of the proceeds from Shares sold by Dealer in the Primary Offering, based on $10.00 price per Class A Share or $9.47 price per Class T Share, as applicable, or for Class A Shares or Class T Shares sold by Dealer in the Primary Offering after the Company has established an estimated net asset value per share, based on the new offering price per Class A Share or Class T Share, as applicable, determined in accordance with the Prospectus (the    Marketing Fee   ), upon the terms and conditions set forth in an Appendix hereto, provided that the Dealer Manager may adjust the amount of the reallowance, in its sole discretion, based upon a number of factors including the number of Shares sold by Dealer in this Offering, Dealer s level of marketing support and bona fide conference fees incurred, each as compared to those of the other Dealers participating in the Offering. 
    
  The Dealer Manager or the Company will pay or reimburse bona fide invoiced due diligence expenses of Dealer, provided, however, that the aggregate of such reimbursements to Dealer and other broker-dealers, together with all other organization and offering expenses, may not exceed 15% of the Company s gross proceeds from the Offering.  
    
  The parties hereby agree that the foregoing commissions, dealer manager fees and distribution and shareholder servicing fees are not in excess of the usual and customary distributors  or sellers  compensation received in the sale of securities similar to the Shares, that Dealer s interest in the Offering is limited to such compensation from the Dealer Manager and Dealer s indemnity referred to in Section 8 of the Dealer Manager Agreement and that the Company is not liable or responsible for the direct payment of such commissions, fees or payments to the Dealer. 
    
  5.      Payment.     
    
  Payment of selling commissions or any reallowance of a portion of the dealer manager fee or distribution and shareholder servicing fee will be made by the Dealer Manager (or by the Company as provided in the Dealer Manager Agreement) to the Dealer within 30 days of the receipt by the Dealer Manager of the applicable payments from the Company.  Dealer acknowledges that, if the Company pays selling commissions or dealer manager fees to the Dealer Manager, the Company is relieved of any obligation for selling commissions or dealer manager fees, as applicable, to the Dealer.  The Company may rely on and use the preceding acknowledgment as a defense against any claim by the Dealer for selling commissions or dealer manager fees the Company pays to Dealer Manager but that Dealer Manager fails to remit to the Dealer.  Payments will be made via electronic transfer in accordance with the instructions that you provide on the last page of this Agreement.  
    
  6.      Right to Reject Orders or Cancel Sales.     
    
  All orders, whether initial or additional, are subject to acceptance by and shall only become effective upon confirmation by the Company.  The Dealer agrees that the Company, in its sole and absolute discretion, may accept or reject any subscription, in whole or in part, for any reason whatsoever, and no commission will be paid to the Dealer with respect to the portion of any subscription that is rejected.   Orders not accompanied by a subscription agreement with the executed signature page and the required check in payment for the Shares may be rejected.  Issuance and delivery of the Shares will be made only after actual receipt of payment therefor.  If any check is not paid upon presentment, or if the Company is not in actual receipt of clearinghouse funds or cash, certified or cashier s check or the equivalent in payment for the Shares, the Company reserves the right to cancel the sale without notice.  In the event an order is rejected, canceled or rescinded for any reason, the Dealer agrees to return to the Dealer Manager any commission or dealer manager fee theretofore paid with respect to such order within 30 days thereafter and, failing to do so, the Dealer Manager shall have the right to offset amounts owed against future commissions or dealer manager fees due and otherwise payable to the Dealer. 
    
  7.      Covenants of the Dealer.     
    
  Dealer covenants and agrees with the Dealer Manager and the Company that: 
    
           (a)  
    Dealer will use its best efforts to sell the Shares for cash on the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and the Prospectus as amended and supplemented. 
       
           (b)  
    Dealer agrees not to rely upon the efforts of the Dealer Manager, which is affiliated with the Company, in determining whether the Company has adequately and accurately disclosed all material facts upon which to provide a basis for evaluating the Company to the extent required by federal or state laws or FINRA.  Dealer further agrees to conduct its own investigation to make that determination independent of the efforts of the Dealer Manager. 
       
           (c)  
    In connection with the Dealer s participation in the offer and sale of Shares (including, without limitation, all initial and additional subscriptions for Shares and any resales and transfers of Shares), the Dealer will comply with all requirements and obligations imposed upon it by (a) the Securities Act, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the    Exchange Act   ), and the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated under both such acts; (b) all applicable state securities laws and regulations as from time to time in effect; (c) the applicable rules of FINRA, including, but not in any way limited to, FINRA Rule 2040, FINRA Rule 2121, FINRA Rule 2310 and FINRA Rule 5141; (d) all applicable rules and regulations relating to the suitability of investors, including, without limitation, the provisions of Articles III.C. and III.E of the Statement of Policy regarding Real Estate Investment Trusts of the North American Securities Administrators Association, Inc.

           (d)  
    The Dealer will not offer Shares in any jurisdiction unless and until (a) the Dealer has been advised in writing by the Company or the Dealer Manager that the Shares are either registered in accordance with, or exempt from, the securities laws of such jurisdiction and (b) the Dealer has all required licenses and registrations to offer shares in that jurisdiction. 
       
           (e)  
    The Dealer will offer Shares (both at the time of an initial subscription and at the time of any additional subscription, including initial enrollments and increased participations in the DRP) only to persons who meet the financial qualifications and suitability standards set forth in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented or in any suitability letter or memorandum sent to the Dealer by the Company or the Dealer Manager.  Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to relieve the Dealer of the Dealer s suitability obligations under FINRA Rule 2111 or FINRA Rule 2310.  Dealer shall not purchase any Shares for a discretionary account without obtaining the prior written approval of Dealer s customer and his or her signature on a subscription agreement.

The Dealer further agrees to make the Suitability Records available to the Dealer Manager and the Company upon request and to make them available to representatives of the SEC and FINRA and applicable state securities administrators upon the Dealer s receipt of a subpoena or other appropriate document request from such agency.

Dealer agrees that it will not show or give to any investor or prospective investor in a particular jurisdiction any material or writing that is supplied to it by the Dealer Manager if such material bears a legend denoting that it is not to be used in connection with the sale of Shares to members of the public in such jurisdiction.  Dealer agrees that it will not use in connection with the offer or sale of Shares any material or writing that relates to another company supplied to it by the Company or the Dealer Manager bearing a legend that states that such material may not be used in connection with the offer or sale of any securities of the Company.   
    
  Dealer agrees to furnish a copy of the Prospectus (as amended and supplemented) required for compliance with the provisions of federal and state securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder, including Rule 15c2-8 under the Exchange Act.

  9.      License and Association Membership. 
           
  Dealer represents and warrants to the Company and the Dealer Manager that it is a properly registered or licensed broker-dealer, duly authorized to offer and sell Shares under federal securities laws and regulations and the securities laws and regulations of all states where it offers or sells Shares and that it is a member of FINRA in good standing.  This Agreement shall automatically terminate if the Dealer ceases to be a member of FINRA in good standing or is subject to a FINRA suspension or if the Dealer s registration or license under the Exchange Act or any state securities laws or regulations is terminated or suspended; the Dealer agrees to notify the Dealer Manager immediately if any of these events occur. 
    
  10.      Anti-Money Laundering Compliance Programs.

  Dealer agrees that its obligation of non-disclosure, non-use and confidentiality of the Due Diligence Information as set forth herein shall terminate upon the termination of the Offering.

    Entire Agreement, Waiver.    
       
           (a) 
    This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the Dealer Manager and you, and shall not be amended or modified in any way except by subsequent agreement executed in writing by the Dealer Manager and you.

           (b) 
    The Dealer Manager and you may waive, but only in writing, any term, condition, or requirement under this Agreement that is intended for its benefit.

           (c) 
    Also, any failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement shall not operate as a waiver of that provision or any other provision of this Agreement.

  19.      Arbitration, Attorney s Fees, Jury Trial and Applicable Law.     
    
  In the event of a dispute concerning any provision of this Agreement (including any provisions of the Dealer Manager Agreement incorporated into this Agreement), either party may require the dispute to be submitted to binding arbitration, conducted on a confidential basis, under the then current commercial arbitration rules of FINRA or the American Arbitration Association (at the discretion of the party requesting arbitration) in accordance with the terms of this Agreement (including the governing law provisions of this section) and pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C.    1   16).  The parties will request that the arbitrator or arbitration panel (   Arbitrator   ) issue written findings of fact and conclusions of law.   The Arbitrator shall not be empowered to make any award or render any judgment for punitive damages, and the Arbitrator shall be required to follow applicable law in construing this Agreement, making awards, and rendering judgments.  The decision of the arbitration panel shall be final and binding, and judgment upon any arbitration award may be entered by any court having jurisdiction.  All arbitration hearings will be held at a mutually agreed upon site.  The parties may agree on a single arbitrator, or, if the parties cannot so agree, each party will have the right to choose one arbitrator, and the selected arbitrators will choose a third arbitrator.  Each arbitrator must have experience and education that qualify him or her to competently address the specific issues to be designated for arbitration.  Notwithstanding the preceding, no party will be prevented from immediately seeking provisional remedies in courts of competent jurisdiction, including but not limited to, temporary restraining orders and preliminary injunctions, but such remedies will not be sought as a means to avoid or stay arbitration.  Except as provided otherwise in Section 8 of the Dealer Manager Agreement, in any action or arbitration to enforce the provisions of this Agreement or to secure damages for its breach, the prevailing party shall recover its costs and reasonable attorney s fees.  Each party to this Agreement hereby waives a trial by jury in any legal action or proceeding relating to this Agreement.

  20.      Severability.     
    
  In the event that any court of competent jurisdiction declares invalid any provision of this Agreement, such invalidity shall have no effect on the other provisions of this Agreement, which shall remain valid and binding and in full force and effect, and to that end the provisions of this Agreement shall be considered severable. 
    
  21.      Counterparts  . 
       
  This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts.  Each counterpart, when executed and delivered, shall be an original contract, but all counterparts, when taken together, shall constitute one and the same agreement. 

Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed or interpreted to constitute the Dealer as an employee, agent or representative of, or in association with or in partnership with, the Dealer Manager, the Company or the other Dealers; instead, this Agreement shall only constitute the Dealer as a dealer authorized by the Dealer Manager to sell the Shares according to the terms set forth in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus as amended and supplemented and in this Agreement. 

This Agreement is made effective between the parties as of the date accepted by you as indicated by your signature to this Agreement.

              1.5. 
    Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed or construed to make the Counterparty an employee, agent, representative or partner of the Dealer Manager or of the Company.  The Counterparty specifically acknowledges and agrees that the Dealer Manager shall have no supervisory responsibilities for the Counterparty or its employees, agents or representatives pursuant to the applicable Rules and Regulations and state securities laws and regulations.

    Submission of Orders  .

    Subject to Section 2.2, subscribers will be instructed to make their checks payable to  UMB Bank, N.A. as Escrow Agent for Resource Apartment REIT III, Inc.  or, after the Company raises $2,000,000.00 in the Offering (the    Minimum Offering   ), to  Resource Apartment REIT III, Inc.,  except with respect to Pennsylvania, Washington and New York investors.  Checks from Pennsylvania investors must be made payable to  UMB Bank, N.A. as Escrow Agent for Resource Apartment REIT III, Inc.  until $50,000,000.00 (or such other amount as set forth in the Prospectus) has been raised in the Offering.  Checks from Washington investors must be made payable to  UMB Bank, N.A. as Escrow Agent for Resource Apartment REIT III, Inc.  until $20,000,000.00 (or such other amount as set forth in the Prospectus) has been raised in the Offering.

              2.2. 
    Counterparty may utilize the custodial or administrative services of a third party that is not acting as an underwriter or participating broker-dealer in the offering of the Shares (a    Third Party Administrator   ).  In such cases, instead of the Counterparty forwarding a subscription document and check from the subscriber, the Third Party Administrator may aggregate funds collected from subscribers and transmit such funds to the Company or Dealer Manager and forward the related subscription documentation.  Counterparty s utilization of any such Third Party Administrator is conditioned on the Company and such Third Party Administrator entering into a prior written agreement, satisfactory to the Company in its sole discretion, addressing the procedures by which such funds and subscription documentation are transmitted to the Company or Dealer Manager. Utilization of the services of a Third Party Administrator will not relieve the Counterparty of any of its obligations set forth in this Agreement. 
              3.

The Counterparty agrees to certify to the Dealer Manager that each purchaser (whether the Beneficiary or IRA Beneficiary in the case of a Bank acting in a trustee or other fiduciary capacity or an investor receiving advisory services from an RIA) has met the financial qualifications set forth in the Prospectus or in any suitability letter or memorandum sent to it by the Company or the Dealer Manager and that the investment in Shares is a suitable and appropriate investment for the investor.  Shares may only be purchased in the states in which the Dealer Manager advises the Counterparty in writing that the Shares are qualified for sale or that such qualification is not required.  The Counterparty will comply with applicable rules and regulations relating to the determination of suitability of investors, including without limitation, the provisions of Articles III.B.3. and III.C. ( Determination that Sale to Shareholder is Suitable and Appropriate ) of the Statement of Policy Regarding Real Estate Investment Trusts of the North American Securities Administrators Association, Inc.

    In order to evidence the above-noted suitability determination, the Counterparty agrees to document in its internal records evidence of the following for each (a) investor who purchases Shares of the Company through the Dealer Manager based upon the advice or discretion of the RIA or (b) Beneficiary or IRA Beneficiary of an account for which Bank purchases shares of the Company, and the Counterparty shall be deemed to certify to the following with respect to each such investor or Beneficiary or IRA Beneficiary, as appropriate: 
              A. 
    That the Subscriber has engaged the services of the RIA with whom the Subscriber has agreed to pay a fee for investment advisory services; and that the RIA has recommended the investment in Shares of the Company to the Subscriber;  
              B. 
    That the Counterparty will not be receiving any commissions in connection with purchases of Shares of the Company made by the Subscriber or on behalf of an account for which Bank is effecting a transaction; 
              C. 
    That the Counterparty has delivered a complete copy of the Prospectus and any supplements or amendments thereto to the Subscriber or Beneficiary (in the case of a Beneficiary having investment discretion over the account for which Bank is serving as a fiduciary) and has taken steps to ensure the Subscriber or such Beneficiary has an understanding of (i) the fundamental risks of an investment in Shares of the Company, (ii) the risk that the Subscriber or such Beneficiary (or the account of such Beneficiary) may lose the entire investment, (iii) the lack of liquidity of Shares of the Company, (iv) the restrictions on transferability of Shares of the Company, (v) the background and qualifications of Resource Apartment Advisor III, LLC and its affiliates, and (vi) the tax consequences of the investment; 
              D. 
    That based upon the Counterparty s review of financial records and other information regarding the Subscriber or an IRA Beneficiary contained in its files, the Counterparty has determined that: (i) the Subscriber or IRA Beneficiary meets the minimum income and net worth standards set forth in the Prospectus; (ii) the Subscriber or IRA Beneficiary can reasonably benefit from investing in the Shares of the Company based on the Subscriber s or IRA Beneficiary's overall investment objectives and portfolio structure; (iii) the Subscriber or IRA Beneficiary (or the account of such IRA Beneficiary) is able to bear the economic risk of the investment based on the Subscriber s or IRA Beneficiary s overall financial situation; and (iv) an investment in Shares of the Company is a suitable and appropriate investment for the Subscriber or IRA Beneficiary based upon a review of the Subscriber s or IRA Beneficiary s age, investment objectives, investment experience, investment time horizon, liquidity needs, risk tolerance, income, net worth, financial situation and needs, tax status, the Subscriber s or IRA Beneficiary s other investments and the foregoing determinations. 
              7.3. 
    In addition to complying with the provisions of subparagraph 7.1 above, and not in limitation of any other obligations of the Counterparty to determine suitability imposed by state or federal law, the Counterparty agrees that it will comply fully with the following provisions: 
              A. 
    The Counterparty shall have reasonable grounds to believe, based upon information provided by the investor concerning his or her investment objectives, other investments, financial situation and needs, and upon any other information known by the Counterparty, that (A) each client of the Counterparty that purchases Shares is or will be in a financial position appropriate to enable him or her to realize to a significant extent the benefits (including tax benefits) of an investment in the Shares, (B) each client of the Counterparty that purchases Shares has a fair market net worth sufficient to sustain the risks inherent in an investment in the Shares (including potential loss and lack of liquidity), and (C) the Shares otherwise are or will be a suitable investment for each client of the Counterparty that purchases Shares, and the Counterparty shall maintain files disclosing the basis upon which the determination of suitability was made; 
              B. 
    The Counterparty shall not execute any transaction involving the purchase of Shares in a discretionary account without prior written approval of the transaction by the investor; 
              C. 
    The Counterparty shall have reasonable grounds to believe, based upon the information made available to it, that all material facts are adequately and accurately disclosed in the Registration Statement and provide a basis for evaluating the Shares; 
              D. 
    In making the determination set forth in subparagraph (C) above, the Counterparty shall evaluate items of compensation, physical properties, tax aspects, financial stability and experience of the sponsor, conflicts of interest and risk factors, appraisals, as well as any other information deemed pertinent by it; 
              E. 
    The Counterparty shall make any additional disclosures to investors as may be required by the laws applicable to the Counterparty, including without limitation disclosure concerning the aggregate compensation payable by investors to the Counterparty and the Dealer Manager in connection with the purchase of Shares hereunder and the arrangements between the Counterparty and the investor to the extent required. 
              7.4. 
    The Counterparty agrees and acknowledges that the Dealer Manager and the Company are relying on certification of the above matters with respect to the suitability of the Subscriber who is, or Beneficiary, the account of which is, purchasing Shares of the Company through the Dealer Manager.   
              7.5. 
    The Counterparty shall maintain, for at least six years, a record of the information obtained to determine that an investment in Shares of the Company is a suitable and appropriate investment for the Subscriber or Beneficiary and that an investor or Beneficiary meets the financial qualification and suitability standards imposed on the offer and sale of Shares (both at the time of an investor s initial subscription and at the time of any additional subscriptions) and to make such records available to the Dealer Manager and the Company during such time period upon their reasonable request.  
              8. 
    Anti-Money Laundering Compliance Programs  . 
              8.1.

    Privacy Laws  .  The Dealer Manager and Counterparty (each referred to individually in this section as a  party ) agree as follows: 
              9.1.

    Except as expressly permitted under the FCRA, the Counterparty shall not disclose any information that would be considered a  consumer report  under the FCRA. 
              9.4. 
    The Counterparty shall be responsible for determining which customers have opted out of the disclosure of nonpublic personal information by periodically reviewing and, if necessary, retrieving a list of such customers (the    List   ) to identify customers that have exercised their opt-out rights.  In the event either party expects to use or disclose nonpublic personal information of any customer for purposes other than servicing the customer, or as otherwise required by applicable law, that party must first consult the List to determine whether the affected customer has exercised his or her opt-out rights.  Each party understands that it is prohibited from using or disclosing any nonpublic personal information of any customer that is identified on the List as having opted out of such disclosures. 
              9.5. 
    The Counterparty agrees to provide all purchasers (or Beneficiaries, if the law governing Bank s relationship to a Beneficiary so dictates) both initial and annual privacy notices as required pursuant to Rule 6(a) of the SEC s Regulation S-P. 
               10.1. 
    The Company and the Dealer Manager will indemnify and hold harmless the Counterparty, its officers and directors and each person, if any, who controls such Counterparty within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act (the    Indemnified Persons   ) from and against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (   Losses   ), joint or several, to which such Indemnified Persons may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such Losses (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon (a) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained (i) in the Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment thereto or in the Prospectus or (ii) in any blue sky application or other document executed by the Company or on its behalf specifically for the purpose of qualifying any or all of the Shares for sale under the securities laws of any jurisdiction or based upon written information furnished by the Company under the securities laws thereof (any such application, document or information being hereinafter called a    Blue Sky Application   ), or (b) the omission or alleged omission to state in the Registration Statement (including the Prospectus as a part thereof) or any post-effective amendment thereto or in any Blue Sky Application a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or (c) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, if used prior to the effective date of the Registration Statement, or in the Prospectus or the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and will reimburse the Indemnified Persons for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Persons in connection with investigating or defending such Loss; and provided that the Company will not be liable in any such case if it is determined that such Counterparty was at fault in connection with the Loss, expense or action.  
              10.2. 
    The Counterparty will indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the Dealer Manager and each of their directors (including any persons named in the Registration Statement with his consent, as about to become a director), each of their officers who has signed the  Registration Statement and each person, if any, who controls the Company and the Dealer Manager within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act (each, a    Counterparty Indemnified Person   ) from and against any Losses to which a Counterparty Indemnified Person may become subject, under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such Losses (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon any unauthorized use of sales materials or use of unauthorized verbal representations concerning the Shares by the Counterparty or the Counterparty s employees, representatives or agents or any other violations of this Agreement or otherwise and will reimburse each Counterparty Indemnified Person, in connection with investigating or defending any such Loss.  This indemnity agreement will be in addition to any liability that the Counterparty may otherwise have. 
              10.3. 
    Promptly, but not later than 10 business days, after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 10 of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against any indemnifying party under this Section 10, notify in writing the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof and the failure of an indemnified party to notify the indemnifying party will relieve it from any liability under this Section 10 as to the particular item for which indemnification is then being sought, but not from any other liability that it may have to any indemnified party.  In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party, and it notifies an indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party will be entitled, to the extent it may wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to participate in the defense thereof, with separate counsel.  Such participation shall not relieve such indemnifying party of the obligation to reimburse the indemnified party for reasonable legal and other expenses (subject to subsection 10.4 below) incurred by such indemnified party in defending itself, except for such expenses incurred after the indemnifying party has deposited funds sufficient to effect the settlement, with prejudice, of the claim in respect of which indemnity is sought.  Any such indemnifying party shall not be liable to any such indemnified party on account of any settlement of any claim or action effected without the consent of such indemnifying party, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.  Any indemnified party shall not be bound to perform or refrain from performing any act pursuant to the terms of any settlement of any claim or action effected without the consent of such indemnified party. 
              10.4. 
    The indemnifying party shall pay all legal fees and expenses of the indemnified party in the defense of such claims or actions; provided, however, that the indemnifying party shall not be obliged to pay legal expenses and fees to more than one law firm in connection with the defense of similar claims arising out of the same alleged acts or omissions giving rise to such claims notwithstanding that such actions or claims are alleged or brought by one or more parties against more than one indemnified party.  If such claims or actions are alleged or brought against more than one indemnified party, then the indemnifying party shall only be obliged to reimburse the expenses and fees of the one law firm that has been selected by a majority of the indemnified parties against which such action is finally brought; and in the event a majority of such indemnified parties is unable to agree on which law firm for which expenses or fees will be reimbursable by the indemnifying party, then payment shall be made to the first law firm of record representing an indemnified party against the action or claim.  Such law firm shall be paid only to the extent of services performed by such law firm and no reimbursement shall be payable to such law firm on account of legal services performed by another law firm. 
              10.5. 
    The indemnity agreements contained in this Section 10 shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of (i) delivery of any Shares and payment therefor; and (ii) any termination of this Agreement.  A successor of the Counterparty or of any of the parties to this Agreement, as the case may be, shall be entitled to the benefits of the indemnity agreements contained in this Section 10.

              11.3. 
    This Agreement and any exhibits hereto represent the entire agreement of the parties and supersedes all prior agreements, if any, between the parties hereto.  The Dealer Manager may amend this Agreement at any time by written notice to the Counterparty, and any such amendment shall be deemed accepted by the Counterparty if, in the case of an RIA, a customer of the RIA places an order for sale of Shares after the RIA has received such notice and, in the case of a Bank, upon placing an order for sale of Shares after it has received such notice. 
              11.4. 
    The terms of this Agreement shall be extended to cover offerings of additional shares of the Company s common stock pursuant to the DRP which are offered pursuant to a separate registration statement (a    DRP Registration Statement   ) and prospectus contained therein.

During the Due Diligence Period, Purchaser, its agents and affiliates, and their respective employees, engineers, analysts, contractors, consultants and representatives (collectively,    Purchaser s Representatives   ) shall have the right to enter upon the Property to perform, at Purchaser s sole cost and expense, inspections and investigations on the Property and to observe, inspect and investigate the physical characteristics and the condition of the Property and improvements in accordance with this Agreement, including, without limitation, the examination of the Property Information.

All of such entries upon the Property shall be at reasonable times during normal business hours and after at least 24 hours prior notice to Seller or Seller s agent, and Seller or Seller s agent shall have the right to accompany Purchaser during any activities performed by Purchaser on the Property.  Upon reasonable prior written notice and request from Purchaser, Seller shall notify tenants of the Property and permit Purchaser to view occupied units, subject to the rights of tenants under their Leases and except to the extent specifically prohibited in such tenants  Leases.  If a sale of the Property from Seller to Purchaser is not consummated for any reason, upon Seller s written request, Purchaser agrees to provide Seller with copies of any and all third party written reports generated in connection with the rights granted herein provided that such third party vendors consent to such distribution and Seller reimburses Purchaser for the actual costs related thereto.  If any inspection or test disturbs the Property, Purchaser will restore the Property to substantially the same condition as existed before the inspection or test.   Purchaser hereby agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold Seller, its employees, tenants, invitees, contractors, and agents (   Indemnified Parties   ) harmless from and against any losses, damages, expenses, liabilities, claims, demands, and causes of action (together with any reasonable legal fees and other costs and expenses incurred by the Indemnified Parties in connection therewith) (collectively,    Losses   ), resulting directly or indirectly from, or in connection with, any entry on the Property (whether or not permitted by this Agreement) by Purchaser or its employees, invitees, contractors, and/or agents, including, without limitation, any Losses resulting, or alleged to be resulting, from personal injury or death, or property damage, or mechanic's or materialmen's liens, but specifically excepting therefrom any Losses arising from (i) the mere discovery or disclosure of existing conditions that are not exacerbated by Purchaser or (ii) the gross negligence and willful misconduct of Seller of any of the Indemnified Parties. 
  2.4      Termination During Due Diligence Period  .  If Purchaser determines, in its sole discretion, before the expiration of the Due Diligence Period that the Property is unacceptable for Purchaser s purposes, for any reason or for no reason, Purchaser shall have the right to terminate this Agreement by giving to Seller notice of termination before the expiration of the Due Diligence Period and the Earnest Money shall be immediately refunded to Purchaser upon request.  In addition, upon such a termination, Purchaser shall immediately return the Property Information to Seller.

  2.5      Purchaser s Reliance on its Investigations  .  To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law and except for Seller s representations and warranties contained herein and any warranties of title contained in the Deed and the Assignment (hereafter defined) delivered at the Closing (   Seller s Warranties   ), this sale is made and will be made without representation, covenant, or warranty of any kind (whether express, implied, or, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, statutory) by Seller.  As a material part of the consideration for this Agreement, Purchaser agrees to accept the Property on an  as is  and  where is  basis, with all faults, and without any representation or warranty, all of which Seller hereby disclaims, except for Seller s Warranties.  Except for Seller s Warranties, no warranty or representation is made by Seller as to fitness for any particular purpose, merchantability, design, quality, condition, operation or income, compliance with drawings or specifications, absence of defects, absence of hazardous or toxic substances, absence of faults, flooding, or compliance with laws and regulations including, without limitation, those relating to health, safety, and the environment.  Purchaser acknowledges that Purchaser has entered into this  
  
   4 

Agreement with the intention of making and relying upon its own investigation of the physical, environmental, economic use, compliance, and legal condition of the Property and that, other than the Seller s Warranties, Purchaser is not now relying, and will not later rely, upon any representations and warranties made by Seller or anyone acting or claiming to act, by, through or under or on Seller s behalf concerning the Property.  The provisions of this   Paragraph 2.5   shall survive any Closing or termination of this Agreement for 6 months.

Purchaser has ordered an updated survey (individually or collectively, as the context may require, the    Survey   ) of the Property. 
  3.2      Title Review and Cure  .  During the Due Diligence Period, Purchaser shall review title to the Property as disclosed by the applicable Title Commitment and the applicable Survey.  Seller shall have no obligation to cure title objections except liens and judgments of an ascertainable amount not created by Purchaser, which liens or judgments Seller shall cause to be released at the Closing or affirmatively insured over by the Title Company.  Seller further agrees to remove any exceptions or encumbrances to title which are created by Seller or its employees, agents, representatives, contractors or subcontractors after the Date of this Agreement without Purchaser s consent.  Purchaser may terminate this Agreement and receive a refund of the Earnest Money if the Title Company revises the Title Commitment after the expiration of the Due Diligence Period to add or modify exceptions in a material adverse manner, if such additions or modifications are not acceptable to Purchaser and are not removed by the Closing Date.  The term    Permitted Exceptions    shall mean: the specific exceptions (exceptions that are not part of the promulgated title insurance form) in the Title Commitment that either (i) Purchaser has not objected to or (ii)  Purchaser has objected to but subsequently waived the objection; items shown on the Survey, which have not been removed as of the end of the Due Diligence Period; real estate taxes for the current year not yet due and payable; and tenants in possession as tenants only under the Leases.

Seller shall execute at Closing an affidavit in such form reasonably acceptable to Seller as the Title Company shall require for the issuance of the Title Policy.  The Title Policy may be delivered after Closing if that is customary in the locality. 
  ARTICLE 4:               OPERATIONS AND RISK OF LOSS 
  4.1      Ongoing Operations  .  During the pendency of this Agreement, Seller (a) shall carry on its business and activities relating to the Property, including leasing of the Property, maintaining the presently existing property insurance and performing ordinary repairs and replacements, substantially in the same manner as it did before the Date of this Agreement, provided that in no event shall Seller be required to make any capital repairs, replacements or improvements to the Property, except as required by the Leases or by applicable law; (b) shall deliver to Purchaser any written notice of every threatened or actual action, suit or proceeding concerning or affecting the Property or any portion thereof or any written notice of Violation (as hereafter defined); and (c) shall not offer for sale or otherwise market the Property. 
  4.2      Performance under Leases and Service Contracts  .  During the pendency of this Agreement, Seller will perform its obligations under the Leases and any service or maintenance agreements relating to the Property (   Service Contracts   ) and other agreements that may affect the Property.  To the extent there are any open permits relating to work performed at the Property prior to Closing, Seller shall remain responsible after Closing for submitting  
  
   5 

information and documentation required to close such permits and to permit the Title Company to issue the Title Policy at Closing. 
  4.3         New Contracts  .  During the pendency of this Agreement, Seller will not enter into any contract that will be an obligation affecting the Property subsequent to the Closing, except (a) Leases and (b) contracts entered into in the ordinary course of business that are terminable without cause on 30-days  notice and without penalty or cancellation fee, without the prior consent of the Purchaser, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. 
  4.4      Termination of Service Contracts  .  During the Due Diligence Period, Purchaser shall notify Seller which Service Contracts Purchaser wishes to assume at Closing.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser shall assume all Service Contracts that are not terminable on 30 days or less notice or that require the payment of a termination charge (unless Purchaser agrees, as applicable, to pay such termination charge or to assume such contract for the duration of the notice period), to the extent that they are assumable and all required consents have been obtained prior to Closing.  Purchaser shall pay any transfer or assignment charges due in connection with its assumption of any Service Contracts solely to the extent such charges are set forth in the Service Contracts or otherwise disclosed to Purchaser in writing prior to the end of the Due Diligence Period.  Notice of termination for all Service Contracts not assumed by Purchaser shall be given by Seller not later than the Closing Date and any charges due thereunder after the Closing Date and through the date of actual termination shall be included as a prorated expense. 
  4.5      Damage or Condemnation  .  Risk of loss resulting from any condemnation or eminent domain proceeding which is commenced or has been threatened before the Closing, and risk of loss to the Property due to fire, flood or any other cause before the Closing, shall remain with Seller.  If before the Closing the Property or any portion thereof shall be materially damaged, or if all or any material portion of the Property shall be subjected to a   bona     fide   threat of condemnation or shall become the subject of any proceedings, judicial, administrative or otherwise, with respect to the taking by eminent domain or condemnation, then Purchaser may terminate this Agreement by written notice to Seller given within 5 days after Purchaser learns of the damage or taking, in which event the Earnest Money shall be returned to Purchaser.  If the Closing Date is within the aforesaid 5-day period, then Closing shall be extended to the next business day following the end of said 5-day period.  If no such election is made, and in any event if the damage or taking is not material, this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and the purchase contemplated herein, less any interest taken by eminent domain or condemnation, shall be effected with no further adjustment except as contemplated in this paragraph.  In such an event, Seller shall assign, transfer and set over to Purchaser all of the right, title and interest of Seller in and to any awards that have been or that may thereafter be made for any taking.  To the extent that any damage to the Property due to casualty exceeds the deductible under Seller s insurance, Seller shall promptly negotiate a settlement (the    Settlement   ) with its adjuster (and the Closing shall be delayed until the date five (5) days after the Settlement is agreed upon) and Seller shall credit Purchaser at Closing with the amount of the Settlement and an amount equal to Seller s deductible, without duplication.  Seller agrees to not agree upon the terms of such Settlement until such terms are approved by Purchaser.  Purchaser shall have the right to participate in the negotiation of the Settlement.  For purposes of this paragraph, the phrases    Material damage    and    materially damaged    means damage reasonably expected to exceed ten percent (10%) of the Purchase Price to repair and    material portion    means a taking reasonably expected to affect a portion of the Property with a value in excess of ten percent (10%) of the Purchase Price.

Seller shall pay at Closing the bills therefor for the period to the day preceding the Closing, and Purchaser shall pay the bills therefor for the period subsequent thereto.  If the utility company will not issue separate bills, Purchaser will receive a credit against the Purchase Price for Seller s portion and will pay the entire bill prior to delinquency after Closing.

Fees and charges under such of the Service Contracts, licenses and permits as are being assigned to and assumed by Purchaser at the Closing, shall be prorated on the basis of the periods to which such Service Contracts, licenses and permits relate. 
  6.2      Final Adjustment After Closing  .  If final prorations cannot be made at Closing for any item being prorated under   Paragraph 6.1  , including Taxes, then Purchaser and Seller agree to allocate such items on a fair and equitable basis as soon as invoices or bills are available, with final adjustment to be made as soon as reasonably possible after the Closing, to the effect that income and expenses are received and paid by the parties on an accrual basis with respect to their period of ownership.  Payments in connection with the final adjustment shall be due within 30 days of written notice.

As of the Closing, Purchaser shall assume Seller s obligations related to such tenant security deposits.  Purchaser will indemnify, defend, and hold Seller harmless from and against all demands and claims made by tenants arising out of the transfer or disposition of any security deposits transferred to Purchaser and will reimburse Seller for any reasonable expenses (including all reasonable attorneys  fees) incurred or that may be incurred by Seller as a result of any such claims or demands by tenants.

ARTICLE 8:               DEFAULT AND DAMAGES 
  8.1      Default by Purchaser  .  If Purchaser shall default in its obligation to close hereunder or otherwise defaults in its obligations hereunder, and such default continues for a period of (5) days after written notice is received by Purchaser (provided such five (5) day cure period shall not apply to Purchaser s obligation to deposit any Earnest Money and in no event shall the Closing Date be extended as a result of such five (5) day cure period), then Purchaser agrees that Seller shall have the right to have the Escrow Agent deliver the Earnest Money to Seller as liquidated damages to recompense Seller for time spent, labor and services performed, and the loss of its bargain.  Purchaser and Seller have considered carefully the loss to Seller occasioned by taking the Property off the market as a consequence of the negotiation and execution of this Agreement, the expenses of Seller incurred in connection with the preparation of this Agreement and Seller s performance hereunder, and the other damages, general and special, which Purchaser and Seller realize and recognize Seller will sustain but which Purchaser and Seller agree would be impracticable or extremely difficult to calculate at this time if Purchaser so defaults.  Based on all those considerations, Purchaser and Seller agree that the Earnest Money, together with the interest thereon, represents a reasonable estimate of Seller s damages.  Seller agrees to accept the Earnest Money as Seller s total damages and relief hereunder if Purchaser defaults in its obligations to close hereunder, Seller waiving all other rights and remedies. 
  8.2      Default by Seller  .  If Seller defaults in its obligation to sell and convey the Property to Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement, or otherwise defaults in its obligations hereunder, and such default continues for a period of five (5) days after written notice is received by Seller, Purchaser s sole remedy shall be to elect one of the following:  (a) to terminate this Agreement, in which event Purchaser shall be entitled to the return by the Escrow Agent to Purchaser of the Earnest Money plus reimbursement for Purchaser s reasonable documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement not to exceed Fifteen Thousand Dollars ($15,000.00) in the aggregate, or (b) to bring a suit for specific performance (but not damages) provided that any suit for specific performance must be brought within 60 days of Seller s default, to the extent permitted by law, Purchaser waiving the right to bring suit at any later date.  Purchaser agrees not to file a lis pendens or other similar notice against the Property except in connection with, and after, the proper filing of a suit for specific performance. 
  ARTICLE 9:               EARNEST MONEY PROVISIONS 
  9.1      Investment and Use of Funds  .  The Escrow Agent shall invest the Earnest Money in government insured interest-bearing accounts satisfactory to Purchaser, shall not commingle the Earnest Money with any funds of the Escrow Agent or others, and shall promptly provide Purchaser and Seller with confirmation of the investments made.  If the Closing under this Agreement occurs, the Escrow Agent shall apply the Earnest Money against the Purchase Price due Seller at Closing. 
  9.2      Contract Terminations  .  Upon a termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, the party with the right to terminate this Agreement (the    Terminating Party   ) may give written notice to the Escrow Agent and the other party (the    Non-Terminating Party   ) of such termination and the reason for such termination.  Such request shall also constitute a request for the release of the Earnest Money to the Terminating Party.  The Non-Terminating Party shall then have five business days in which to object in writing to the release of the Earnest Money to the Terminating Party.  If the Non-Terminating Party provides such an objection, then the Escrow Agent shall retain the Earnest Money until it receives written instructions executed by both Seller and Purchaser as to the disposition and disbursement of the Earnest Money, or until ordered by final court order, decree or judgment, which is not subject to appeal, to deliver the Earnest Money to a particular party, in which event the Earnest Money shall be delivered in accordance with such notice, instruction, order, decree or judgment.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, or anything to the contrary contained herein, in the event Purchaser terminates this Agreement in accordance with the terms of Section 2.4 herein, then Escrow Agent shall promptly, and without the requirement of notice from the Seller, return the Earnest Money to Purchaser. 
  9.3      Interpleader  .  Seller and Purchaser mutually agree that in the event of any controversy regarding the Earnest Money, unless mutual written instructions are received by the Escrow Agent directing the Earnest Money s disposition, the Escrow Agent shall not take any action, but instead shall await the disposition of any proceeding relating to the Earnest Money or, at the Escrow Agent s option, the Escrow Agent may interplead all parties and deposit the  
  
   13 

Earnest Money with a court of competent jurisdiction in which event the Escrow Agent may recover all of its court costs and reasonable attorneys  fees.  Seller or Purchaser, whichever loses in any such interpleader action, shall be solely obligated to pay such costs and fees of the Escrow Agent, as well as the reasonable attorneys  fees of the prevailing party in accordance with the other provisions of this Agreement. 
  9.4      Liability of Escrow Agent  .  The parties acknowledge that the Escrow Agent is acting solely as a stakeholder at their request and for their convenience, that the Escrow Agent shall not be deemed to be the agent of either of the parties, and that the Escrow Agent shall not be liable to either of the parties for any action or omission on its part taken or made in good faith, and not in disregard of this Agreement, but shall be liable for its negligent acts and for any loss, cost or expense incurred by Seller or Purchaser resulting from the Escrow Agent s mistake of law respecting the Escrow Agent s scope or nature of its duties.  Seller and Purchaser shall jointly and severally indemnify and hold the Escrow Agent harmless from and against all costs, claims and expenses, including reasonable attorneys  fees, incurred in connection with the performance of the Escrow Agent s duties hereunder, except with respect to actions or omissions taken or made by the Escrow Agent in bad faith, in disregard of this Agreement or involving negligence on the part of the Escrow Agent.

Any claim brought after Closing shall be actionable or enforceable if and only if:  (i) notice of such claim is given to the party which allegedly made such misrepresentation or breached such covenant, obligation, warranty or agreement within 9 months after the Closing Date; and (ii) the amount of damages or losses as a result of such claim suffered or sustained by the party making such claim exceeds $50,000.00.     
  
   14 

10.7      No Third Party Beneficiary  .  This Agreement is not intended to give or confer any benefits, rights, privileges, claims, actions, or remedies to any person or entity as a third party beneficiary or otherwise. 
  10.8      Entirety and Amendments  .  This Agreement embodies the entire agreement between the parties and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings relating to the Property except for any confidentiality agreement binding on Purchaser, which shall not be superseded by this Agreement.  This Agreement may be amended or supplemented only by an instrument in writing executed by the party against whom enforcement is sought. 
  10.9      Time  .  Time is of the essence in the performance of this Agreement. 
  10.10      Attorneys  Fees  .  Should either party employ attorneys to enforce any of the provisions hereof, the party against whom any final judgment is entered agrees to pay the prevailing party all reasonable costs, charges, and expenses, including attorneys  fees, expended or incurred in connection therewith. 
  10.11      Notices  .  All notices required or permitted hereunder shall be in writing and shall be served on the parties at the addresses set forth in   Paragraph 1.1  .  All notices shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been properly given or served as of (i) the date of personal delivery with acknowledgment of receipt; (ii) three (3) business days after the same is deposited in the United States mail, prepaid, for delivery by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested; or (iii) the first business day after the date delivered to a reputable overnight courier service providing proof of delivery.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, notices to Seller or Purchaser under this Agreement may be delivered by electronic mail with an original copy thereof transmitted to the recipient by one of the means described in subsections (i), (ii), or (iii) above.  Notices sent pursuant to this Section 10.11 shall be deemed effective when actually delivered by electronic mail. 
  10.12      Construction  .  The parties acknowledge that the parties and their counsel have reviewed and revised this Agreement and that the normal rule of construction, to the effect that any ambiguities are to be resolved against the drafting party, shall not be employed in the interpretation of this Agreement or any exhibits or amendments hereto. 
  10.13      Calculation of Time Periods  .  Unless otherwise specified, in computing any period of time described herein, the day of the act or event after which the designated period of time begins to run is not to be included and the last day of the period so computed is to be included, unless such last day is a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday for national banks in the location where the Property is located, in which event the period shall run until the end of the next day which is neither a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday.  The last day of any period of time described herein shall be deemed to end at 5:00 p.m. local time where the Property is located. 
  10.14      Procedure for Indemnity  .  The following provisions govern actions for indemnity under this Agreement.  Promptly after receipt by an indemnitee of notice of any claim, such indemnitee will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnitor, deliver to the indemnitor written notice thereof and the indemnitor shall have the right to participate in such proceeding and, if the indemnitor agrees in writing that it will be responsible for any costs, expenses, judgments, damages, and losses incurred by the indemnitee with respect to such claim, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel mutually satisfactory to the parties; provided, however, that an indemnitee shall have the right to retain its own counsel, with the fees and expenses to be paid by the indemnitor, if the indemnitee reasonably believes that representation of such indemnitee by the counsel retained by the indemnitor would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between such indemnitee and any other party represented by such counsel in such proceeding.  The failure of indemnitee to deliver written notice to the indemnitor within a reasonable time after indemnitee receives notice of any such claim shall relieve such indemnitor of any liability to the indemnitee under this indemnity only if and to the extent that such failure is prejudicial to its ability to defend such action, and the omission so to deliver written notice to the indemnitor will not relieve it of any other liability that it may have to any indemnitee.  If an indemnitee settles a claim without the prior written consent of the indemnitor, then the indemnitor shall be released from liability with respect to such claim unless the indemnitor has unreasonably withheld such consent. 
  10.15      Execution in Counterparts  .  This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, and all of such counterparts shall constitute one Agreement.  To facilitate

Neither party shall by this Agreement or acquiescence to an Exchange desired by the other party have its rights under this Agreement affected or diminished in any manner or be responsible for compliance with or be deemed to have warranted to the exchanging party that its Exchange in fact complies with   1031 of the Code. 
  10.17      WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL  .  TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

EVERY PURCHASER OF ANY INTEREST IN RESIDENTIAL REAL PROPERTY ON WHICH A RESIDENTIAL DWELLING WAS BUILT PRIOR TO 1978 IS NOTIFIED THAT SUCH PROPERTY MAY PRESENT EXPOSURE TO LEAD FROM LEAD-BASED PAINT THAT MAY PLACE YOUNG CHILDREN AT RISK OF DEVELOPING LEAD POISONING.  LEAD POISONING IN YOUNG CHILDREN MAY PRODUCE PERMANENT NEUROLOGICAL DAMAGE, INCLUDING LEARNING DISABILITIES, REDUCED INTELLIGENCE QUOTIENT, BEHAVIORAL PROBLEMS, AND IMPAIRED MEMORY.

  By its execution of this Agreement, Purchaser acknowledges that (a) it has read and understand the foregoing Lead Warning Statement, (b) it has reviewed, or during the Due Diligence Period will review, the Property Information concerning lead-based paint or lead-based paint hazards, and (c) Seller has provided, or Purchaser has independently obtained, a lead hazard information pamphlet in the form prescribed by the Environmental Protection Agency under Section 406 of the Toxic Substances Control Act.  Purchaser shall conduct such studies and tests for lead-based paint during the Due Diligence Period as Purchaser deems appropriate.  By its execution of this Agreement, Seller acknowledges that, to the best of Seller s knowledge, the statements contained herein and the information provided, or to be provided, to the Purchaser pursuant to the terms of this Agreement concerning lead-based paint and lead-based paint hazards are accurate. 
  10.19      Limitation of Liability  .  Purchaser agrees that it will not have any claims or causes of action against any disclosed or undisclosed officer, director, employee, trustee, shareholder, member, partner, principal, parent, subsidiary or other affiliate of Seller, or any officer, director, employee, trustee, shareholder, member, partner or principal of any such parent, subsidiary or other affiliate of Seller, arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.  Except as set forth below, Purchaser agrees not to sue or otherwise seek to enforce any personal obligation against Seller or any such person or party with respect to any matters arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.  This Section shall in no way limit or prevent Purchaser from bringing a suit against Seller for specific performance pursuant to the terms of Section 8.2 above. 
  
   16 

10.20      Section 3-14 Compliance  .  Subject to   Paragraph 2.2  , Purchaser or its designated independent or other auditor may audit Seller s operating statements of the Property, at Purchaser s expense, and Seller shall provide such documentation as Purchaser or its auditor may reasonably request in order to complete such audit.

Purchaser shall be responsible for all out-of-pocket costs associated with this audit.  Seller shall reasonably cooperate (at no cost to Seller) with Purchaser s auditor in the conduct of such audit, which will include verbal requests for information regarding internal controls and follow-up questions on the financial information provided to the Purchaser.  In addition, Seller agrees to provide to Purchaser or any affiliate of Purchaser, if requested by such auditor, historical financial statements for the Property, including (without limitation) income data for the Property and a balance sheet for the last full calendar year of ownership, whether required before or after Closing.  Seller s obligation to maintain its records for use under this Section 10.20 shall be an on-going condition to Closing for Purchaser s benefit until Closing.

  It being further understood, however, that should any default be made in the payment of any amount due on the date on which it shall fall due, or in the performance of any of the agreements, conditions, covenants, terms, provisions or stipulations contained herein, or upon the occurrence of any Event of Default hereunder, then Payee, in its sole discretion and without notice to Maker, may declare immediately due and payable the entire unpaid balance of principal with interest accrued thereon at the rate applicable hereunder to the date of default and thereafter at the Default Rate and all other sums due by Maker hereunder, anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding and payment thereof may be enforced and recovered in whole or in part at any time by one or more of the remedies available at law or in equity.  In such case Payee may also recover all costs of suit and other expenses in connection therewith, together with attorney's fees actually incurred, together with interest

  (i)      WAIVER BY PAYEE 
    
  Payee shall not be deemed, by any act of omission or commission, to have waived any of its rights or remedies hereunder unless such waiver is in writing and signed by Payee, and then only to the extent specifically set forth in writing.  A waiver by Payee with respect to one event shall not be construed as continuing or as a bar to or waiver of any right or remedy with respect to a subsequent event. 
    
  (j)      SEVERABILITY  
    
  If any one or more of the provisions contained in this Note shall for any reason be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision of this Note, but this Note shall be construed as if such provision had never been contained herein, and Payee may, at its option and without notice to Maker, declare immediately due and payable the entire unpaid balance of principal with accrued interest thereof and all other sums due hereunder.

              a) 
    Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared;  
              b) 
    [Paragraph omitted in accordance with SEC transition instructions contained in SEC Release No. 34-47986]; 
              c)

              5)

    All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and  
              b) 
    Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting.
