1.    Basis of Accounting Presentation 
  CPG OpCo LP (the "Partnership") was formed in Delaware on September 26, 2014. The general partner of the Partnership, OpCo GP, is   100.0%   owned by its sole member CPPL. At or prior to the closing of CPPL's IPO the following transactions occurred: 
             
    CEG contributed   $1,217.3 million   of capital to certain subsidiaries of the Predecessor to repay intercompany debt owed to NiSource Finance. CEG entered into new intercompany debt agreements with NiSource Finance for   $1,217.3 million  ; 
                
    CEG and Columbia Hardy contributed substantially all of the subsidiaries in the Predecessor to the Partnership; 
                
    CEG assumed responsibility for all historical current and deferred income taxes other than Tennessee state income taxes that continue to be borne by the Partnership post-IPO, as well as associated regulatory assets and liabilities; 
                
    CEG contributed to CPPL a   7.3%   limited partner interest in the Partnership in exchange for   46,811,398   subordinated units in CPPL and all of CPPL's incentive distribution rights; 
                
    CPPL purchased from the Partnership an additional   8.4%   limited partner interest in exchange for   $1,170.0 million   from the net proceeds of CPPL's IPO, resulting in CPPL owning a   15.7%   limited partner interest in the Partnership; 
                
    The Partnership distributed   $500.0 million   to CEG as a reimbursement of preformation capital expenditures with respect to the assets contributed to the Partnership; 
                
    Following CPPL's IPO, CPPL owns a   15.7%   limited partner interest in the Partnership, Columbia Hardy owns a   0.77%   limited partner interest and CEG owns the remaining   83.53%   limited partner interest. 
     On February 11, 2015, concurrent with the completion of CPPL's IPO, NiSource contributed its subsidiary, CEG, to CPG. Following this contribution, CPG owns and operates, through its subsidiaries, approximately   15,000   miles of strategically located interstate gas pipelines extending from New York to the Gulf of Mexico and one of the nation s largest underground natural gas storage systems, with approximately 300 MMDth of working gas capacity, as well as related gathering and processing assets. CEG owns and operates, through its subsidiaries, substantially all of the natural gas transmission and storage assets of CPG. Prior to July 1, 2015, CPG was a wholly owned subsidiary of NiSource. On July 1, 2015, all the shares of CPG were distributed by NiSource to holders of NiSource common stock completing CPG's separation from NiSource (the "Separation"). As a result of the Separation, CPG became an independent publicly traded company. CPG OpCo LP Predecessor (the  Predecessor ) is comprised of NiSource s Columbia Pipeline Group Operations reportable segment. 
  The Partnership entered into an omnibus agreement with CEG and its affiliates (together with a services agreement with CPGSC) at the closing of CPPL's IPO that addresses (1) centralized corporate, general and administrative services to be provided by CEG for the Partnership and the reimbursement by the Partnership for the Partnership's portion of these services, (2) CPPL's right of first offer for CEG's   84.3%   interest in the Partnership, (3) the indemnification of the Partnership for certain potential environmental and toxic tort claims losses and expenses associated with the operation of the assets and occurring before the closing date of the IPO and (4) the Partnership's requirement to guarantee future indebtedness that CPG incurs. 
  On March 17, 2016, CPG entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the  Merger Agreement ), among CPG, TCPL, US Parent, Taurus Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of US Parent ( Merger Sub ), and, solely for purposes of Section 3.02, Section 5.02, Section 5.09 and Article VIII of the Merger Agreement, TransCanada. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, effective July 1, 2016, Merger Sub was merged with and into CPG (the  Merger ) with CPG surviving the Merger as an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of TransCanada. The Merger did not affect the ownership of the Partnership's general partner or limited partner interests, but the Partnership is indirectly managed by TransCanada after the Merger. The Partnership incurred approximately   $110.4 million   of Merger related costs within operation and maintenance and property and other taxes, including approximately   $101.3 million   of employee related costs. Additionally, as a result of the Merger, the Partnership recognized an impairment charge of   $11.9 million   related to the cancellation of IT system upgrades that were in process prior to the Merger. 
  The Partnership is engaged in regulated interstate gas transportation and storage services for LDCs, marketers, producers and industrial and commercial customers located in northeastern, mid-Atlantic, midwestern and southern states and the District of Columbia along with unregulated businesses such as midstream services, including gathering, treating, conditioning, processing,

compression and liquids handling, and development of mineral rights positions. The regulated services are performed under tariffs at rates subject to FERC approval. 
  For periods subsequent to the closing of CPPL's IPO, the financial statements included in this current report are the financial statements and accounting records of the Partnership. For periods prior to the closing of CPPL's IPO, the financial statements included in this quarterly report are the financial statements and accounting records of the Predecessor. The consolidated and combined financial statements were prepared as follows: 
             
    The Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets (unaudited) consist of the consolidated balance sheet of the Partnership as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 
                
    The Condensed Statements of Consolidated and Combined Operations (unaudited) consist of consolidated results of the Partnership for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015. 
                 
    The Condensed Statements of Consolidated and Combined Comprehensive Income (unaudited) consist of consolidated results of the Partnership for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015. 
                
    The Condensed Statements of Consolidated and Combined Comprehensive Income (unaudited) consist of consolidated results of the Partnership for   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and for the period from February 11, 2015 through   September 30, 2015   and the combined results of the Predecessor for the period from January 1, 2015 through February 10, 2015. 
       The Partnership's Condensed Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements (unaudited) have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC. Certain information and note disclosures normally included in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to those rules and regulations, although the Partnership believes that the disclosures made are adequate to make the information not misleading. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Partnership s audited consolidated and combined financial statements for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . These financial statements reflect all normal recurring adjustments that are, in the opinion of management, necessary to fairly present the Partnership s results of operations and financial position in accordance with GAAP in the United States of America. Amounts reported in the Condensed Statements of Consolidated and Combined Operations (unaudited) are not necessarily indicative of amounts expected for the respective annual periods. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. 
   
  2.    Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  . ASU 2016-15 amends the guidance in ASC 230 on the classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows. The Partnership is required to adopt ASU 2016-15 for periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods, and the guidance is to be applied retrospectively, with early adoption permitted. The Partnership is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of ASU 2016-15 will have on the Condensed Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements (unaudited) or Notes to Condensed Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements (unaudited).

In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).   ASU 2014-09 outlines a single, comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance. The core principle of the new standard is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14 to extend the adoption date for ASU 2014-09 to periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods, and the new standard is to be applied retrospectively, with early adoption permitted on the original effective date of ASU 2014-09 on a limited basis. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-08, which amends the principal-versus-agent implementation guidance and illustrations in ASU 2014-09. Among other things, ASU 2016-08 clarifies that an entity should evaluate whether it is the principal or the agent for each specified good or service promised in a contract with a customer. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-10, which clarifies guidance related to identifying performance obligations and licensing implementation guidance contained in ASU 2014-09. In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-12, which contains narrow scope improvements for certain aspects of ASU 2014-09 including collectability, presentation of sales tax and other similar taxes collected from customers, noncash consideration, contract modifications and completed contracts at transition and transition technical correction. The Partnership is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of ASU 2014-09, and the related ASUs, will have on the Condensed Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements (unaudited) or Notes to Condensed Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements (unaudited). 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842)  . ASU 2016-02 introduces a lessee model that brings most leases on the balance sheet. The new standard also aligns many of the underlying principles of the new lessor model with those in ASC 606, the FASB's new revenue recognition standard (e.g., those related to evaluating when profit can be recognized). Furthermore, ASU 2016-02 addresses other concerns related to the current leases model. For example, ASU 2016-02 eliminates the requirement in current U.S. GAAP for an entity to use bright-line tests in determining lease classification. The standard also requires lessors to increase the transparency of their exposure to changes in value of their residual assets and how they manage that exposure. The Partnership is required to adopt ASU 2016-02 for periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods, with early adoption permitted. The Partnership is currently evaluating the impact the adoption of ASU 2016-02 will have on the Condensed Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements (unaudited) or Notes to Condensed Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements (unaudited). 
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03,   Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.   ASU 2015-03 changes the way entities present debt issuance costs in financial statements by presenting issuance costs on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the related liability rather than as a deferred charge. Amortization of these costs will continue to be reported as interest expense. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-15 to clarify the SEC staff's position on these costs in relation to line-of-credit agreements stating that the SEC staff would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs related to a line-of-credit arrangement as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of such arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit. The Partnership retrospectively adopted ASU 2015-03 and ASU 2015-15 as of January 1, 2016. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Condensed Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements (unaudited) or Notes to Condensed Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements (unaudited). 
  In February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02,   Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis  . ASU 2015-02 amends consolidation guidance by including changes to the variable and voting interest models used by entities to evaluate whether an entity should be consolidated. The Partnership retrospectively adopted ASU 2015-02 as of January 1, 2016. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Condensed Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements (unaudited) or Notes to Condensed Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements (unaudited).

3.    Transactions with Affiliates 
  Prior to CPG's separation from NiSource, the Partnership engaged in transactions with subsidiaries of NiSource, which were deemed to be affiliates of the Partnership. The Partnership continues to engage in transactions with subsidiaries of CPG subsequent to the Separation. These affiliate transactions are summarized in the tables below: 
  Statement of Operations 

Balance Sheet 

Transportation, Storage and Other Revenues  . Prior to the Separation, the Partnership provided natural gas transportation, storage and other services to subsidiaries of NiSource, the Partnership's former affiliates.     Prior to CPPL's IPO, the Predecessor provided similar services to subsidiaries of NiSource. 
  Operation and Maintenance Expense  . The Partnership receives executive, financial, legal, information technology and other administrative and general services from CPGSC. Prior to CPPL's IPO, the Predecessor received similar services from NiSource Corporate Services. Expenses incurred as a result of these services consist primarily of employee compensation and benefits, outside services and other expenses. The expenses are charged directly or allocated using various allocation methodologies based on a combination of gross fixed assets, total operating expense, number of employees and other measures. Management believes the allocation methodologies are reasonable. However, these allocations and estimates may not represent the amounts that would have been incurred had the services been provided by an outside entity. Subsequent to the completion of the Merger, the Partnership incurred merger related operation and maintenance expense of   $78.3 million   primarily related to employee and administrative expenses.  
  Interest Expense and Income  . The Partnership was charged interest for long-term debt of   $7.6 million   and   $7.6 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, offset by associated AFUDC of   $1.8 million   and   $1.7 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The Partnership was charged interest for long-term debt of   $22.8 million   and   $27.3 million   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, offset by associated AFUDC of   $3.7 million   and   $4.1 million   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  The Partnership and its subsidiaries entered into an intercompany money pool agreement with NiSource Finance, which became effective on the date of CPPL's IPO. Following the Separation, the agreement is with CPG. The money pool is available for the Partnership and its subsidiaries' general purposes, including capital expenditures and working capital. This intercompany money pool agreement is discussed in connection with Short-term Borrowings below. Prior to CPPL's IPO, the subsidiaries of the Predecessor participated in a similar money pool agreement with NiSource Finance. CPGSC administers the current money pool agreement. The cash accounts maintained by the subsidiaries of the Partnership and the Predecessor were, prior to the Separation, swept into a NiSource corporate account on a daily basis, creating an affiliated receivable or decreasing an affiliated payable, as

appropriate, between NiSource and the subsidiary. Subsequent to the Separation, cash accounts maintained by subsidiaries of the Partnership were swept into a CPG corporate account on a daily basis, creating an affiliated receivable or decreasing an affiliated payable, as appropriate, between CPG and the subsidiary. The amount of interest expense and income for short-term borrowings was determined by the net position of each subsidiary in the money pool. The money pool weighted-average interest rate at   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   1.68%   and   1.21%  , respectively. For the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the interest expense for short-term borrowings charged was   $2.6 million   and   $0.5 million  , respectively. For the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the interest expense for short-term borrowings charged was   $3.5 million   and   $0.9 million  , respectively. 
  Accounts Receivable  . The Partnership includes in accounts receivable amounts due from the money pool discussed above of   $159.5 million   at   September 30, 2016   for subsidiaries of the Partnership in a net deposit position. The Partnership includes in accounts receivable amounts due from the money pool discussed above of   $140.5 million   at   December 31, 2015   for subsidiaries in a net deposit position. Also included in the balance at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   are amounts due from subsidiaries of CPG for transportation and storage services of   $1.7 million   and   $8.9 million  , respectively. Net cash flows related to the money pool receivables are included as Investing Activities on the Condensed Statements of Consolidated and Combined Cash Flows (unaudited). All other affiliated receivables are included as Operating Activities.  
  Short-term Borrowings  . In connection with the closing of CPPL's IPO, the subsidiaries of the Partnership entered into an intercompany money pool agreement with NiSource Finance with   $750.0 million   of reserved borrowing capacity. Following the Separation, the agreement was with CPG. In furtherance of the money pool agreement, CPG entered into a   $1,500.0 million   revolving credit agreement on December 5, 2014. Effective July 1, 2016, in connection with the Merger, the   $1,500.0 million   CPG revolving credit facility was terminated and replaced by a   $2,000.0 million   revolving credit facility with US Parent. 
  The balance of Short-term Borrowings at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   of   $1,116.5 million   and   $42.1 million  , respectively, includes those subsidiaries of the Partnership in a net borrower position of the money pool discussed above. Net cash flows related to Short-term Borrowings are included as Financing Activities on the Condensed Statements of Consolidated and Combined Cash Flows (unaudited).    
  Accounts Payable  . The affiliated accounts payable balance primarily includes amounts due for services received from CPGSC, and interest payable to CPG.     
  Long-term Debt  . In May 2015, the Partnership's outstanding intercompany debt transferred from NiSource Finance to CPG. The Partnership's long-term financing requirements are satisfied through borrowings from CPG. On January 31, 2016, the Partnership amended its intercompany credit agreement with CPG to extend the maturity date of the note originating on December 9, 2013 from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2020. The Partnership may borrow at any time from the origination date to December 31, 2016 not to exceed   $2.6 billion  . From January 1, 2017 to December 31, 2020, the Partnership may borrow at any time not to exceed   $2.3 billion  . As of the January 2016 amendment, the note carries a fixed interest rate of   4.70%   for the outstanding borrowings as of   September 30, 2016  .     Details of the long-term debt balance are summarized in the table below: 

Dividends  . During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Partnership distributed   $443.6 million   to the limited partners. During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , the Partnership distributed   $582.9 million   to the limited partners, of which   $500.0 million   was a reimbursement of preformation capital expenditures with respect to the assets contributed to the Partnership. There were no restrictions on the payment of distributions by the Partnership.

4.    Gain on Sale of Assets 
  The Partnership recognizes gains on conveyances of mineral rights positions into earnings as any obligation associated with conveyance is satisfied. For the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , gains on conveyances amounted to   $9.7 million   and   $36.0 million  , respectively, and are included in "Gain on sale of assets" on the Condensed Statements of Consolidated and Combined Operations (unaudited). For the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , gains on conveyances amounted to   $15.7 million   and   $49.6 million  , respectively, and are included in "Gain on sale of assets" on the Condensed Statements of Consolidated and Combined Operations (unaudited). Included in the gains on conveyances is a cash bonus payment of   $9.0 million   and   $35.8 million   received by CEVCO from CNX Gas Company LLC during the three and nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, for the lease of Utica Shale and Upper Devonian gas rights in Greene and Washington Counties in Pennsylvania and Marshall and Ohio Counties in West Virginia. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , deferred gains of approximately   $1.3 million   and   $8.1 million  , respectively, were deferred pending performance of future obligations and recorded within "Deferred revenue," on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets (unaudited). 
   
  5.        Goodwill 
  The Partnership tests its goodwill for impairment annually as of May 1 unless indicators, events, or circumstances would require an immediate review. Goodwill is tested for impairment using financial information at the reporting unit level, referred to as the Columbia Gas Transmission Operations reporting unit, which is consistent with the level of discrete financial information reviewed by management. The Columbia Gas Transmission Operations reporting unit includes the following entities: Columbia Gas Transmission (including its equity method investment in the Millennium Pipeline joint venture), Columbia Gulf and the equity method investment in Hardy Storage. All of the Partnership's goodwill relates to NiSource's acquisition of CEG in 2000, which was contributed to the Partnership prior to CPPL's IPO. The Partnership s goodwill assets at   September 30, 2016   were   $1,975.5 million  .  
  The Predecessor completed a quantitative ( step 1 ) fair value measurement of the reporting unit during the   May 1, 2012   goodwill test. The test indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit substantially exceeded the carrying value, indicating that no impairment existed.  
  GAAP allows entities testing goodwill for impairment the option of performing a qualitative ( step 0 ) assessment before calculating the fair value of a reporting unit for the goodwill impairment test. If a step 0 assessment is performed, an entity is no longer required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines that, based on that assessment, it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount. 
  The Partnership applied the qualitative step 0 analysis to its reporting unit for the annual impairment test performed as of   May 1, 2016  . For the current year test, the Partnership assessed various assumptions, events and circumstances that would have affected the estimated fair value of the reporting unit as compared to its base line   May 1, 2012   step 1 fair value measurement. The recent Merger Agreement and acquisition price were incorporated into the current year testing. The results of this assessment indicated that it is not more likely than not that its reporting unit fair value is less than the reporting unit carrying value. 
  The Partnership considered whether there were any events or changes in circumstances subsequent to the annual test that would reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount and necessitate another goodwill impairment test. On November 1, 2016, CPPL announced that it entered into an agreement and plan of merger with CPG, in which CPG will acquire all outstanding common units of CPPL. The acquisition price leads to a similar valuation of the Partnership as that provided for in the Merger Agreement, providing further evidence that it is not more likely than not that the reporting unit fair value is less than the reporting unit carrying value. In consideration of all relevant factors, there were no indicators that would require a subsequent goodwill impairment test during the   third   quarter of   2016  .

6.    Asset Retirement Obligations 
  Changes in the Partnership s liability for asset retirement obligations for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   are presented in the table below: 

(1)    Reflects the removal of amounts related to Crossroads Pipeline Company, which was included in the Predecessor but was not contributed to the Partnership. 
  The asset retirement obligations above relate to the modernization program of pipelines and transmission facilities, the retiring of offshore facilities, polychlorinated biphenyl ("PCB") remediation and asbestos removal at several compressor and measuring stations. The Partnership recognizes that certain assets, which include gas pipelines and natural gas storage wells, will operate for an indeterminate future period when properly maintained. A liability for these asset retirement obligations will be recorded only if and when a future retirement obligation with a determinable life is identified.    
   
  7.    Regulatory Matters 
  Columbia Gas Transmission Modernization Program.   In November 2015, Columbia Gas Transmission commenced the fourth year of the Columbia Gas Transmission long-term system modernization program. Columbia Gas Transmission expects to place approximately   $300.0 million   in modernization investments into service during the year. Recovery of the revenue requirement on approximately   $320.0 million   of investments made in 2015 began on February 1, 2016.  
  In December 2015, Columbia Gas Transmission filed an extension of this settlement and received the FERC's approval of the customer agreement in March 2016. This extension will allow Columbia Gas Transmission to invest an additional   $1.1 billion   over an additional three-year period through 2020. This agreement also expands the scope of facility investments covered by the program. 
  Columbia Gulf.   On January 21, 2016, the FERC issued an Order (the "January 21 Order") initiating an investigation pursuant to Section 5 of the NGA to determine whether Columbia Gulf s existing rates for jurisdictional services are unjust and unreasonable. Columbia Gulf filed a cost and revenue study with the FERC on April 5, 2016, as required by the January 21 Order. The January 21 Order directed that a hearing be conducted pursuant to an accelerated timeline and that an initial decision be issued by February 28, 2017. On June 13, 2016, the FERC trial staff, Columbia Gulf, and all of the active parties filed a Joint Motion to Suspend the Procedural Schedule and Waive Answer Period (the "Motion"). The Motion represents that the parties unanimously support the Motion and requested waiver of the answer period, which was granted. The parties reached an agreement in principle during a June 2, 2016 settlement conference that would fully resolve all matters set for hearing by the FERC. The Motion represents that the parties expect to file an offer of settlement memorializing the agreement in principle no later than July 29, 2016, and suspension of the procedural schedule will promote an efficient and speedy resolution of this matter by allowing the participants to focus their efforts on drafting the necessary settlement documents. Columbia Gulf filed the offer of settlement with the FERC in accordance with the agreement noted above. 
  On August 15, 2016, the administrative law judge issued a Certification of Uncontested Settlement, which noted that no parties objected to the provisions in the offer of settlement. On September 22, 2016, the FERC issued an order approving the uncontested settlement, which requires a reduction in Columbia Gulf s daily maximum recourse rate and addresses Columbia Gulf s treatment of postretirement benefits other than pensions, pension expenses, and regulatory expenses. The order also requires Columbia Gulf to file a general rate case under section 4 of the NGA by January 31, 2020, for rates to take effect by August 1, 2020. Other terms of the settlement are included in FERC Docket No. RP16-302-000. 
  Cost Recovery Trackers and other similar mechanisms.   A significant portion of the transmission and storage regulated companies' revenue is related to the recovery of their operating costs, the review and recovery of which occurs via standard regulatory

proceedings with the FERC under Section 4 of the NGA. However, certain operating costs of the Columbia OpCo regulated transmission and storage companies are significant and recurring in nature, such as fuel for compression and lost and unaccounted for gas. The FERC allows for the recovery of such costs via cost tracking mechanisms. These tracking mechanisms allow the transmission and storage companies' rates to fluctuate in response to changes in certain operating costs or conditions as they occur to facilitate the timely recovery of its costs incurred. The tracking mechanisms involve a rate adjustment that is filed at a predetermined frequency, typically annually, with the FERC and is subject to regulatory review before new rates go into effect. Other such costs under regulatory tracking mechanisms include upstream pipeline transmission, electric compression, operational purchases and sales of natural gas, and the revenue requirement for capital investments made under Columbia Gas Transmission's long-term plan to modernize its interstate transmission system as discussed above. 
   
  8.    Equity Method Investments 
  Certain investments of the Partnership are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. These investments are recorded within "Unconsolidated affiliates" on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets (unaudited) and the Partnership's portion of the results is reflected in "Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates" on the Condensed Statements of Consolidated and Combined Operations (unaudited). In the normal course of business, the Partnership engages in various transactions with these unconsolidated affiliates. Contributions are made to these equity investees to fund the Partnership s share of capital projects. 
  The following table contains contribution and distribution data representing the Partnership's portion based on the Partnership's ownership percentage of each investment: 

During the third quarter of 2015, an additional member joined the Pennant joint venture. The member's initial ownership investment in Pennant is   5.00%  , and by funding specified, disproportionate investment amounts for future growth projects, the member can invest directly in the growth of Pennant. Such funding will potentially increase the member's ownership in Pennant up to   33.33%   over a defined investment period. As a result of the buy-in, Columbia Midstream received   $12.7 million   in cash and recorded a gain of   $2.9 million  , and its ownership interest in Pennant decreased from   50.00%   to   47.50%  . 
   
  9.    Income Taxes 
  The Partnership is a limited partnership and is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, therefore, is not liable for entity-level federal income taxes. Amounts presented for 2015 in the combined financial statements relate to income taxes that have been determined on a separate tax return basis for the period prior to CPPL's IPO. 
  The effective tax rates for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   were   zero   and   5.8%  , respectively. The effective tax rate for   2015   differs from the Federal tax rate of   35%   primarily due to post-IPO income that is not subject to income tax at the partnership level.

10.    Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits 
  CPG provides defined contribution plans and noncontributory defined benefit retirement plans that cover employees of subsidiaries of the Partnership. Prior to the Separation, employees of subsidiaries of the Partnership were covered by defined contribution plans and noncontributory defined benefit retirement plans provided by NiSource. Benefits under the defined benefit retirement plans reflect the employees' compensation, years of service and age at retirement. Additionally, CPG provides health care and life insurance benefits for certain retired employees of subsidiaries of the Partnership. The majority of employees may become eligible for these benefits if they reach retirement age while working for subsidiaries of the Partnership. The expected cost of such benefits is accrued during the employees' years of service. Current rates charged to customers of subsidiaries of the Partnership include postretirement benefit costs. Cash contributions are remitted to trusts, including a grantor trust used to fund benefits of the CPG non-qualified defined benefit plan. 
  Subsidiaries of the Partnership are participants in the consolidated CPG defined benefit retirement plans (the Plans) and, therefore, subsidiaries of the Partnership are allocated a ratable portion of CPG's trusts for the Plans in which its employees and retirees participate. As a result, the Partnership follows multiple employer accounting under the provisions of GAAP. 
  For the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , CPG has made   no   contributions to its pension plans and contributed   $1.0 million   to its other postretirement benefit plans.  
  The following table provides the components of the subsidiaries of the Partnership's allocation of net periodic benefits cost for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

As of July 1, 2016, the CPG pension and other postretirement benefit plans were remeasured as a result of the acquisition by TransCanada. The remeasurement resulted in an increase to the pension benefit obligation, net of plan assets, of   $0.4 million  , a

net decrease to regulatory assets of   $0.9 million  , and an increase to accumulated other comprehensive loss of   $0.1 million  . Net periodic pension cost for the remainder of 2016 increased by   $0.7 million   as a result of the remeasurement. A settlement charge of   $2.6 million   was recorded as a result of the non-qualified pension plan being terminated in connection with Merger. 
  The other postretirement benefits obligation, net of plan assets, decreased by   $10.1 million   as a result of the remeasurement. Additionally, the remeasurement resulted in an increase to regulatory assets of   $8.6 million   and a decrease to regulatory liabilities of   $1.7 million  . The remeasurement resulted in   no   change to accumulated other comprehensive loss. Net periodic other postretirement benefit cost for the remainder of 2016 increased by   $1.0 million   as a result of the remeasurement.  
  The following table provides the key assumptions that were used to calculate the pension and other postretirement benefit obligation and the net periodic benefit cost at the measurement dates of July 1, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

11.    Fair Value 
  The Partnership has certain financial instruments that are not measured at fair value on a recurring basis but nevertheless are recorded at amounts that approximate fair value due to their liquid or short-term nature, including cash and cash equivalents, customer deposits and short-term borrowings-affiliated. The Partnership's long-term debt-affiliated is recorded at historical amounts. 
  The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate fair value. 
  Long-term debt-affiliated.   The fair value of these securities is estimated based on the quoted market prices for similar issues or on the rates offered for securities of the same remaining maturities. On January 31, 2016, the Partnership amended its intercompany credit agreement to extend the maturity date and apply a fixed interest rate. Prior to this amendment, the fair value approximated carrying value as these securities bore interest at variable rates. These fair value measurements are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , there were no changes in the method or significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the financial instruments. 
  The carrying amount and estimated fair values of financial instruments were as follows:

12.    Other Commitments and Contingencies 
  A.    Guarantees and Indemnities.   In the normal course of its business, the Partnership and certain subsidiaries enter into various agreements providing financial or performance assurance to third parties on behalf of the parent or certain subsidiaries. Such agreements include guarantees and stand-by letters of credit. These agreements are entered into primarily to support or enhance the creditworthiness otherwise attributed to the parent or a subsidiary on a stand-alone basis, thereby facilitating the extension of sufficient credit to accomplish the parent or the subsidiaries' intended commercial purposes. The total guarantees and indemnities in existence at   September 30, 2016   and the years in which they expire were: 

Guarantees of Debt.   The Partnership, together with CEG and OpCo GP (the "Guarantors") have guaranteed payment of   $2,750.0 million   in aggregated principal amount of CPG's senior notes. Each Guarantor is required to comply with covenants under the debt indenture and in the event of default the Guarantors would be obligated to pay the debt's principal and related interest. The Partnership does not anticipate that it will have any difficulty maintaining compliance. The guarantees of any Guarantor may be released under certain circumstances. 
  Lines and Letters of Credit.   CPPL maintained a   $500.0 million   senior revolving credit facility, of which   $50.0 million   was available for issuance of letters of credit. The Partnership, together with CPG, CEG and OpCo GP, each fully guaranteed the CPPL credit facility. On June 29, 2016, in anticipation of the Merger, all outstanding borrowings, facility fees and interest were paid in full and the revolving credit facility was terminated. CPG maintained a   $1,500.0 million   senior revolving credit facility, of which   $250.0 million   in letters of credit was available. The Partnership, together with CEG and OpCo GP, each fully guaranteed the CPG credit facility. On July 1, 2016, in connection with the Merger, all existing letters of credit were migrated to a TransCanada credit facility and the CPG revolving credit facility was terminated. 
  CPG's commercial paper program (the  Program ) had a Program limit of up to   $1,000.0 million  . The Partnership, together with CEG and OpCo GP, each agreed, jointly and severally, unconditionally and irrevocably to guarantee payment in full of the principal of and interest (if any) on the promissory notes. On June 30, 2016, in anticipation of the Merger, the Program was terminated. CPG had   no   promissory notes outstanding under the Program at the time of termination. 
  B.    Other Legal Proceedings.   In the normal course of its business, the Partnership has been named as a defendant in various legal proceedings. In the opinion of management, the ultimate disposition of these currently asserted claims will not have a material impact on the Partnership s consolidated and combined financial statements. Please see Item 1 of Part II, Legal Proceedings, for more information. 
  C.    Environmental Matters.   The Partnership's operations are subject to environmental statutes and regulations related to air quality, water quality, hazardous waste and solid waste. The Partnership believes that it is in substantial compliance with those environmental regulations currently applicable to its operations and believes that it has all necessary material permits to conduct its operations. 
  It is the Partnership's continued intent to address environmental issues in cooperation with regulatory authorities in such a manner as to achieve mutually acceptable compliance plans. However, there can be no assurance that fines and penalties will not be incurred. 
  The Partnership records accruals to cover environmental remediation at various sites. The current portion of this accrual is included in  Other accruals  in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets (unaudited). The noncurrent portion is included in  Other noncurrent liabilities  in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets (unaudited).  
  Air 
  The CAA and comparable state laws regulate emissions of air pollutants from various industrial sources, including compressor stations, and also impose various monitoring and reporting requirements. Such laws and regulations may require pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce air emissions or result in an increase of existing air emissions; application for, and strict compliance with, air permits containing various emissions and operational limitations; or the utilization of specific emission control technologies to limit emissions. The actions listed below could require further reductions in emissions from various emission sources. The Partnership will continue to closely monitor developments in these matters.

National Ambient Air Quality Standards.     The federal CAA requires the EPA to set NAAQS for particulate matter and five other pollutants considered harmful to public health and the environment. Periodically, the EPA imposes new or modifies existing NAAQS. States that contain areas that do not meet the new or revised standards must take steps to maintain or achieve compliance with the standards. These steps could include additional pollution controls on boilers, engines, turbines, and other facilities owned by gas transmission operations. 
  The following NAAQS were recently added or modified: 
  Ozone  : On October 1, 2015, the EPA issued a final rule lowering the NAAQS for ground-level ozone to   70 ppb   under both the primary and secondary standards to provide requisite protection of public health and welfare, respectively. The EPA is required to include an adequate margin of safety in establishing the primary ozone standard for protection of public health, whereas the secondary ozone standard is intended to improve protection for trees, plants and ecosystems. The final rule becomes effective sixty days after the rule is published in the Federal Register. The EPA is required to make attainment and non-attainment designations for specific geographic locations under the revised standards by October 1, 2017 and, depending on the severity of the ozone present, non-attainment areas will have until between 2020 and 2037 to meet the health standard. With the EPA lowering the ground-level ozone standard, states may be required to implement more stringent regulations. Based on the current version of the rule, the Partnership does not expect a material impact on its operations. 
  Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2)  : The EPA revised the NO2 NAAQS by adding a one-hour standard while retaining the annual standard. The new standard could impact some Partnership combustion sources. The EPA designated all areas of the country as unclassifiable/attainment in January 2012. After the establishment of a new monitoring network and possible modeling implementation, areas will potentially be re-designated sometime in 2016. States with areas that do not meet the standard will be required to develop rules to bring areas into compliance within five years of designation. Additionally, under certain permitting circumstances, emissions from some existing Partnership combustion sources may need to be assessed and mitigated. The Partnership will continue to monitor this matter and cannot estimate the impact of these rules at this time. 
  Climate Change.   Future legislative and regulatory programs could significantly restrict emissions of greenhouse gases including methane. 
  New Source Performance Standards  : On May 12, 2016, the EPA finalized the rule to regulate fugitive methane emissions for compressor stations in the natural gas transmission and storage sector. The final rule was subsequently published in the Federal Register on June 3, 2016. The Partnership is working with industry groups to litigate and clarify ambiguities within the rule. The Partnership does not have any existing sites that will be impacted by this rule. However, the EPA has announced that it intends to propose additional regulations related to the emission of methane from existing sources in the oil and natural gas sector. 
  Pipeline Safety 
  On March 17, 2016, the federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration ( PHMSA ) announced a proposed rulemaking that would, if adopted, impose more stringent requirements for certain gas lines and gathering lines under varying circumstances. Among other things, the proposed rulemaking would extend certain of PHMSA s current regulatory safety programs for gas pipelines beyond  high consequence areas  to cover gas pipelines found in newly defined  moderate consequence areas  that contain as few as   5   dwellings within the potential impact area; require gas pipelines installed before 1970 that are currently exempted from certain pressure testing obligations to be tested to determine their maximum allowable operating pressures ( MAOP  and require gathering lines in Class I areas, both onshore and offshore, to comply with standards regarding damage prevention, corrosion control (for metallic pipe), public education, MAOP limits, line markers and emergency planning if such gathering lines  nominal design is   8   inches or more. In order to provide clarity and greater certainty on what may constitute a  gathering line,  PHMSA is proposing a new definition of that term under the rulemaking, which term would now encompass  a pipeline, or a connected series of pipelines, and equipment used to collect gas from the endpoint of a production facility/operation and transport it to the furthermost point downstream of the following endpoints  including the  inlet of 1   st    gas processing plant;  the  outlet of  a gas treatment facility (not associated with a processing plant or compressor station); the  [o]utlet of the furthermost downstream compressor  leading to a pipeline, or the  point where separate production fields are commingled.  Other new requirements proposed by PHMSA under the rulemaking would require pipeline operators to: report to PHMSA in the event of certain MAOP exceedances; strengthen PHMSA integrity management requirements; consider seismicity in evaluating threats to a pipeline; conduct hydrostatic testing for all pipeline segments manufactured using longitudinal seam welds; and use more detailed guidance from PHMSA in the selection of assessment methods to inspect pipelines. The Partnership will continue to monitor this matter and cannot estimate the impact of these rules at this time.

On June 22, 2016, President Obama signed new pipeline safety legislation, the  Protecting our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety Act of 2016" (the  PIPES Act ). Extending PHMSA s statutory mandate through 2019, the PIPES Act establishes or continues the development of stringent requirements affecting pipeline safety including: (i) providing PHMSA with additional authority to address imminent hazards by imposing emergency restrictions, prohibitions and safety measures on owners and operators of gas or hazardous liquid pipeline facilities without prior notice or an opportunity for a hearing; (ii) having pipeline operators that experience a spill from a liquids pipeline provide safety data sheets for the spilled liquid to the on-scene coordinator predesignated by the EPA and state and local officials within six hours of a telephonic notice; (iii) obligating PHMSA to develop safety standards for natural gas storage facilities by June 22, 2018; (iv) obligating PHMSA to provide feedback to pipeline operators after an inspection, including a briefing within thirty days and a written report with written preliminary findings within ninety days to the extent practicable; (v) requiring annual internal inspection of certain underwater hazardous liquid pipeline facilities in high consequence areas located at depths greater than   150   feet under the surface of the water; and (vi) requiring PHMSA to complete certain of the outstanding mandates under existing legislation and to report to Congress on the status of overdue rulemakings. The Partnership will continue to monitor this matter and cannot estimate the impact of these rules at this time. 
  On October 3, 2016, PHMSA announced a temporary rule authorizing the agency to issue Emergency Orders to address what it deems imminent safety hazards for both liquid and gas pipes. The new rule allows PHMSA to impose restrictions, prohibitions, and require safety measures without giving operators prior notice or an opportunity for a hearing. In contrast to PHMSA s past practice of issuing Corrective Action Orders to an individual owner, operator, or facility, under the new rule PHMSA can issue an Emergency Order for numerous entities. PHMSA has until March 19, 2017 to issue a permanent final rule, when this temporary rule expires. The Partnership will continue to monitor this matter and cannot estimate the impact of these rules at this time.

  Merger 
  On March 17, 2016, CPG entered into a Merger Agreement, among CPG, TCPL, US Parent, Taurus Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of US Parent ( Merger Sub ), and, solely for purposes of Section 3.02, Section 5.02, Section 5.09 and Article VIII of the Merger Agreement, TransCanada. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, effective July 1, 2016, Merger Sub was merged with and into CPG (the "Merger") with CPG surviving the Merger as an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of TransCanada. The Merger did not affect the ownership of the Partnership's general partner or limited partner interests, but the Partnership is indirectly managed by TransCanada after the Merger. 
  Proposed Merger of CPPL by CPG 
  On November 1, 2016, CPPL announced that it had entered into an agreement and plan of merger with CPG, Pony Merger Sub LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of CPG ( Pony Merger Sub ) and MLP GP. 
  The conflicts committee of the board of directors of MLP GP (the  GP Conflicts Committee ) and the board of directors of the MLP GP (the "GP Board") approved the merger agreement and transactions contemplated by the merger agreement and determined that the merger agreement and the merger transactions are fair and reasonable to and in the best interests of CPPL and to the holders of CPPL common units unaffiliated with CPG, CEG and MLP GP (collectively, the  CPPL unaffiliated unitholders ). The GP Conflicts Committee recommended the GP Board approve the merger agreement and the merger transactions. The GP Board resolved that the merger agreement and the merger transactions be submitted to the unitholders of CPPL at a special meeting of the unitholders for approval. The GP Board recommended that the unitholders of CPPL vote in favor of the proposal to approve the merger agreement and the merger transactions at the special meeting of the unitholders. 
  CPG indirectly owns, through its ownership of CEG, 100% of the membership interests in MLP GP. CEG owns all of the subordinated units ( CPPL subordinated units ) representing a 46.5% limited partner interest in CPPL. Pursuant to the merger agreement, Pony Merger Sub will merge with and into CPPL at the effective time of the merger, with CPPL surviving, such that following the merger, MLP GP will remain a wholly owned subsidiary of CPG and the sole general partner of CPPL, and CPG and CEG will be the only limited partners of CPPL. Each CPPL common unit issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to at the effective time of the merger will be converted into the right to receive (i) $17.00 per CPPL common unit in cash without any interest thereon plus (ii) an additional amount of cash per CPPL common unit without any interest thereon equal to the product of (x) the number of days from and including the first day of the quarter in which the closing occurs through and including the closing date multiplied by (y) $0.00217 per CPPL common Unit (a daily distribution rate equal to the quotient of $0.1975 divided by ninety-one (91)), plus (iii) an amount equal to $0.1975 per CPPL common unit in cash without any interest thereon if the record date for the CPPL s quarterly cash distribution with respect to the quarter immediately preceding the quarter in which the closing occurs shall not have occurred prior to the effective time of the merger (the "Merger Consideration"). Incentive distribution rights of CPPL, which are owned by CEG, will be unchanged and remain outstanding as incentive distribution rights of the surviving entity, and no

consideration will be delivered in respect thereof. CPPL subordinated units, which are owned by CEG, will also be unchanged and remain outstanding as CPPL subordinated units of the surviving entity, and no consideration will be delivered in respect thereof. CPG will be issued CPPL common units at the effective time of the merger equal to the number of public common units being converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. The parties anticipate that the merger will close in the first quarter of 2017 and that CPPL will pay the regular quarterly cash distributions to unitholders at the quarterly per unit distribution rate of $0.1975, with the declaration date and record date for each quarterly distribution to occur no later than 30 days and 42 days, respectively, after the end of each fiscal quarter. 
  Completion of the merger is conditioned upon, among other things: (1) approval of the merger agreement and the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, including the merger, by the affirmative vote or consent of holders, as of the record date of the special meeting of CPPL s unitholders (including CEG), of (a) a majority of the outstanding CPPL common units, voting as a class, (b) a majority of the CPPL common units held by the CPPL unaffiliated unitholders, and (c) a majority of the outstanding CPPL subordinated units, voting as a class; (2) all required filings, consents, approvals, permits and authorizations in connection with the merger having been made or obtained; and (3) the absence of legal injunctions or impediments prohibiting the merger transactions. 
  Pursuant to the merger agreement, CEG delivered a consent to voting the CPPL subordinated units owned beneficially or of record by it or any of its subsidiaries in favor of the merger proposal, including the 46,811,398 CPPL subordinated units currently held by CEG, which units represent 100% of the outstanding CPPL subordinated units. 
  The merger agreement contains provisions granting both CPPL and CPG the right to terminate the merger Agreement for certain reasons, including, among others, if: (1) the merger is not completed on or before August 1, 2017; (2) any governmental authority has issued a final and nonappealable statute, rule, order, decree or regulation enjoining or prohibiting consummation of the merger; (3) under certain conditions, there has been a material breach of any of the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in the merger agreement by a party to the merger agreement which is not cured within 30 days following receipt by the breaching party of written notice from the non-breaching party (a  terminable breach  (4) CPPL does not obtain the requisite unitholder approval of the merger agreement and the merger transactions at a special meeting of unitholders; or (5) either the GP Board, in accordance with the merger agreement, withdraws, modifies or qualifies, or proposes to publicly withdraw, modify or qualify, in a manner adverse to CPG its recommendation to the unitholders of CPPL (the  CPPL Board Recommendation ) or fails to include the CPPL Board Recommendation in the proxy statement to be filed by CPPL in connection with the merger (that taking of any such action being referred to as a  CPPL Change in Recommendation ). 
  All costs and expenses incurred in connection with the merger agreement and the merger transactions will be paid by the party incurring such costs and expenses, except that (1) CPG and CPPL shall each bear and pay one half of the expenses incurred in connection with the proxy statement and Schedule 13E-3 filings, (2) if (a) CPG terminates the merger agreement due to a CPPL Change in Recommendation, (b) either party terminates the merger agreement due to the failure to obtain the requisite unitholder approval of the merger agreement and the merger transactions at a special meeting of unitholders of CPPL and prior to such special meeting, a CPPL Change in Recommendation has occurred, or if CPG terminates the merger agreement due to a terminable breach by CPPL, CPPL will pay the expenses incurred by CPG up to a maximum amount of $10 million, and (3) if CPPL terminates the merger agreement due to a terminable breach by CPG, CPG will pay the expenses incurred by CPPL. 
  Executive Overview 
  We are a fee-based, growth-oriented Delaware limited partnership formed to own, operate and develop a portfolio of pipelines, storage and related midstream assets. On February 11, 2015, concurrent with CPPL's IPO, CEG and Columbia Hardy contributed substantially all of the subsidiaries in the Predecessor to us. On July 1, 2015, all the shares of CPG were distributed by NiSource to holders of NiSource common stock completing CPG's separation from NiSource (the "Separation"). The Partnership's parent company, CEG, was contributed to CPG prior to the Separation. 
  We own substantially all of the natural gas transmission and storage assets of CEG, including approximately 15,000 miles of strategically located interstate pipelines extending from New York to the Gulf of Mexico and an underground natural gas storage system, with approximately 300 MMDth of working gas capacity, as well as related gathering and processing assets. The Partnership's revenue, excluding tracker-related revenues, generated under firm revenue contracts was 95% for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  . As of   September 30, 2016  , these contracts had a weighted average remaining contract life of 4.7 years. 
  We expect the revenues generated from our businesses will increase as we execute on our significant portfolio of organic growth opportunities.

Commercial Growth and Expansion 
  We believe that we are well-positioned to attract volumes to our systems through cost-effective capacity expansions. For example, we have recently completed or we are currently undertaking the following expansions (all amounts listed are inclusive of AFUDC, as applicable): 
             
    Washington County Gathering  . A producer has contracted with us to build an approximately 20 mile gas gathering system in southwestern Pennsylvania. The initial project went into service during the third quarter of 2015 and we expect to invest approximately $120 million through 2021. 
                
    Gibraltar Pipeline Project  . We expect to invest approximately $260 million to construct an approximately 1 MMDth/d dry gas header pipeline in southwest Pennsylvania. We expect this to be the first of multiple phases with an initial in-service date in the fourth quarter of 2016, and a final in-service date in the fourth quarter of 2017. 
                
    Utica Access Project  . We invested approximately $50 million to construct 4.7 miles of 24-inch pipeline to provide 205,000 Dth/d of new firm transportation to provide Appalachian production access to liquid trading points on Columbia Gas Transmission's system. This project was placed into service in the fourth quarter of 2016. 
                
    Millennium Lateral.   We intend to invest approximately $20 million through our ownership stake in Millennium Pipeline to construct approximately 8 miles of 16-inch pipeline to a new power plant situated near Wawayanda, New York. This project will provide up to 127,000 Dth/d of new firm capacity and will be placed into service in the second quarter of 2017. 
                
    Leach XPress  . This project will provide approximately 1.5 MMDth/d of capacity from the Marcellus and Utica production regions to the Leach compressor station located on the Columbia Gulf system, TCO Pool, and other markets on the Columbia Gas Transmission system. We expect the project, which involves an estimated investment of $1.4 billion, to be placed into service in the fourth quarter of 2017. 
                
    Rayne XPress  . This project will transport approximately 1 MMDth/d of southwest Marcellus and Utica production on the Columbia Gulf system from the Leach, Kentucky interconnect with Columbia Gas Transmission towards the Rayne compressor station in southern Louisiana to reach various Gulf Coast markets. We expect the project, which involves an estimated investment of $420 million, to be placed into service in the fourth quarter of 2017. 
                
    Cameron Access Project  . This project, which involves an investment of approximately $300 million, will provide 800,000 Dth/d of transportation capacity on the Columbia Gulf system to the Cameron LNG export terminal in Louisiana. We expect the project to be placed into service in the first quarter of 2018. 
                
    WB XPress  . This project, which involves an investment of approximately $0.9 billion, will expand Columbia Gas Transmission's WB system in order to transport approximately 1.3 MMDth/d of Marcellus production to pipeline interconnects and East Coast markets, including access to the Cove Point LNG terminal. We expect this project to be placed into service in the fourth quarter of 2018. 
                
    Mountaineer XPress  . This approximately $2.0 billion project will provide new takeaway capacity for Marcellus and Utica production. The project will provide up to 2.7 MMDth/d of firm transportation capacity on the Columbia Gas Transmission system. We expect this project to be placed into service in the fourth quarter of 2018.  
                
    Gulf XPress  . Gulf XPress will provide 860,000 Dth/d of firm transportation capacity for Marcellus and Utica production on the Columbia Gulf system. This project involves an investment of approximately $0.7 billion and is expected to be placed into service in the fourth quarter of 2018. 
                
    Central Virginia Connector.   This project will provide 45,000 Dth/d of firm transportation capacity on the Columbia Gas Transmission system to a new point of delivery in Virginia. This approximately $13 million project is expected to be placed into service in the fourth quarter of 2018.    
                
    Millennium Eastern System Upgrade  . We intend to invest approximately $135 million through our ownership stake in Millennium Pipeline to expand eastward flow capacity by 223,000 Dth/d to Ramapo and other nearby points on the system. We expect this project to be placed into service in the fourth quarter of 2018.

In 2013, the FERC approved the modernization settlement entered into by Columbia Gas Transmission and its customers that provides recovery and return on an investment of up to $1.5 billion over a five-year period to modernize its system to improve system integrity and enhance service reliability and flexibility. The modernization program includes, among other things, replacement of aging pipeline and compressor facilities, enhancements to system inspection capabilities and improvements in control systems. Columbia Gas Transmission placed approximately $320 million in modernization investments into service during 2015. In January 2016, the FERC approved Columbia Gas Transmission's third annual filing for recovery of the revenue requirement under this program. In December 2015, Columbia Gas Transmission filed an extension of this settlement and received the FERC's approval of the customer agreement in March 2016. This extension will allow Columbia Gas Transmission to invest an additional $1.1 billion over an additional three-year period through 2020. This agreement also expands the scope of facility investments covered by the program. 
   
  Items Affecting Comparability of our Financial Results 
  The historical financial results discussed below may not be comparable to our future financial results for the following reasons: 
             
    For periods prior to the closing of CPPL's IPO on February 11, 2015, the financial statements included in this Form 10-Q were derived from the financial statements and accounting records of the Predecessor. The Predecessor s results of operations historically included revenues and expenses relating to 100% of NiSource s Columbia Pipeline Group reportable segment. NiSource did not contribute Crossroads Pipeline Company, CPGSC and Central Kentucky Transmission Company to us. Such assets were historically included in NiSource s Columbia Pipeline Group reportable segment, but constituted an immaterial impact on the Predecessor s results of operations. CNS Microwave is not included in the Predecessor but was contributed to us. 
                
    Upon the closing of CPPL's IPO, short-term borrowings-affiliated and a portion of the long-term debt-affiliated (including current portion of long-term debt-affiliated) have been transferred to an affiliate of CPG and the related interest expense is no longer being incurred. 
                
    We are a limited partnership treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and, therefore, are not liable for entity-level federal income taxes. We are subject to state and local income taxes in certain jurisdictions. The Predecessor s tax expense was determined on a separate return basis. Accordingly, we expect our tax expense to be significantly reduced subsequent to CPPL's IPO as compared to that of the Predecessor. 
                
    We incurred additional costs as a result of the Merger. We incurred   $110.4 million   of Merger related costs within operation and maintenance and property and other taxes, including employee related expenses of   $101.3 million  . Additionally we incurred a Merger related impairment charge of   $11.9 million  . These costs are included in "Operation and maintenance" and "Impairment of long-lived assets" on the Condensed Statements of Consolidated and Combined Operations (unaudited).

Results of Operations 
  Three and Nine Months Ended     September 30, 2016    
  The following schedule presents our historical consolidated and combined key operating and financial metrics. 

Three Months Ended September 30,     2016   Compared to   Three Months Ended September 30,     2015    
  Operating Revenues.   Operating revenues were   $326.5 million   for the   third   quarter of   2016  , an   increase   of   $6.5 million   from the same period in   2015  . The   increase   in operating revenues was primarily due to increased demand revenue of $28.6 million largely from the East Side Expansion, Broad Run Connector and Rayne XPress growth projects, and the CCRM. Additionally, there was higher mineral rights royalty revenue of $3.9 million and increased shorter term transportation services of $1.5 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $29.3 million attributable to the recovery of operating costs under certain regulatory tracker mechanisms, which are offset in expense.

Operating Expenses.   Operating expenses were   $326.8 million   for the   third   quarter of   2016  , an   increase   of   $134.8 million   from the same period in   2015  . The   increase   in operating expenses was primarily due to increased costs related to the Merger of $110.4 million, decreased gains on the sale of assets of $29.2 million, primarily due to conveyances of mineral interests, higher impairment charges of $11.3 million due to the cancellation of IT system upgrades and increased depreciation and amortization of $5.4 million, primarily due to higher levels of in-service assets. Additionally, there were increased employee and administrative expenses of $2.6 million and higher outside service costs of $2.5 million. These changes were partially offset by $29.3 million of decreased operating costs under certain regulatory tracker mechanisms, recoveries of which are offset in operating revenues. 
  Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates.   Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates were   $16.0 million   for the   third   quarter of   2016  , an   increase   of   $0.7 million   from the same period in   2015  . Equity earnings increased primarily due to earnings generated by Millennium Pipeline. 
  Other Income (Deductions).   Other income (deductions) in the   third   quarter of   2016     increased   income by   $5.7 million   compared to an   increase   in income of   $2.1 million   in the same period in   2015  . The variance was primarily due to an increase of $7.2 million for the equity portion of AFUDC, partially offset by higher interest expense of $2.1 million due to increased short-term borrowings from the money pool. 
  Throughput.   Throughput totaled   517.3   MMDth for the   third   quarter of   2016  , compared to   421.8   MMDth for the same period in   2015  . The   increase   of   95.5   MMDth was primarily due to increased transportation of Marcellus and Utica natural gas production. 
  Nine Months Ended September 30,     2016   Compared to   Nine Months Ended September 30,     2015    
  Operating Revenues.   Operating revenues were   $1,003.2 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , an   increase   of   $28.4 million   from the same period in   2015  . The   increase   in operating revenues was primarily due to increased demand revenue of $99.7 million largely from the East Side Expansion, Broad Run Connector and Rayne XPress growth projects, and the CCRM. Additionally, there were increased shorter term transportation services of $6.1 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $71.1 million attributable to the recovery of operating costs under certain regulatory tracker mechanisms, which are offset in expense, and lower mineral rights royalty revenue of $6.6 million.  
  Operating Expenses.   Operating expenses were   $722.5 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , an   increase   of   $118.8 million   from the same period in   2015  . The   increase   in operating expenses was primarily due to increased costs related to the Merger of $110.4 million, decreased gains on the sale of assets of $36.8 million, primarily due to conveyances of mineral interests, higher depreciation and amortization of $15.4 million and increased property and other taxes of $3.8 million, both primarily due to higher levels of in-service assets. Additionally, there were higher impairment charges of $11.3 million due to the cancellation of IT system upgrades, increased employee and administrative expenses of $9.1 million and higher outside service costs of $5.8 million. These changes were partially offset by $71.1 million of decreased operating costs under certain regulatory tracker mechanisms, recoveries of which are offset in operating revenues, and lower maintenance expenses of $3.8 million.  
  Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates.   Equity Earnings in Unconsolidated Affiliates were   $48.1 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , an   increase   of   $3.9 million   from the same period in   2015  . Equity earnings increased primarily due to earnings generated by Pennant and Millennium Pipeline. 
  Other Income (Deductions).   Other income (deductions) for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016     increased   income by   $7.1 million   compared to a   reduction   in income of   $5.8 million   in the same period in   2015  . The variance was primarily due to an increase in other income of $14.7 million for the equity portion of AFUDC and a decrease in interest expense of $4.5 million due to the repayment of long-term debt, partially offset by a decrease in interest income of $3.5 million and higher interest expense of $2.6 million due to increased short-term borrowings from the money pool. 
  Income Taxes.   The effective income tax rates were   zero   and   5.8%   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The change in the overall effective tax rates between   2016   and   2015   was due to post-CPPL IPO income that is not subject to income tax at the partnership level. 
  Throughput.   Throughput totaled   1,706.7   MMDth for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to   1,517.2   MMDth for the same period in   2015  . The   increase   of   189.5   MMDth was primarily due to increased transportation of Marcellus and Utica natural gas production.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  Our principal liquidity requirements are to finance our operations and fund capital expenditures. Our ability to meet these liquidity requirements will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future.  
  Our sources of liquidity may include:  
             
    cash generated from our operations;  
                
    issuances of additional partnership units;   
                
    $750.0 million of reserved borrowing capacity under an intercompany money pool with CPG, in which us and our subsidiaries are participants; and  
                
    long-term intercompany borrowings.  
     We believe that cash on hand, cash generated from operations and the issuance of additional ownership interests will be adequate to meet our operating needs. 
  Cash Flow  . Net cash from operating activities, net cash used for investing activities and net cash from financing activities for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , were as follows: 

Operating Activities 
  Net cash from operating activities for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was   $394.1 million  ,   a decrease   of $48.4 million compared to the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The   decrease   in net cash from operating activities was primarily attributable to the difference in the timing of collection of receivables and the payment of payables and costs associated with the Merger. 
  Investing Activities 
  Net cash used for investing activities for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was   $1,093.5 million  , an increase of   $104.0 million   compared to the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . Capital expenditures for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   were   $1,073.0 million  , compared to   $775.9 million   for the comparable period in   2015  . This increase is mainly due to higher spending on various growth projects primarily in the Marcellus and Utica Shale areas and for expenditures under the modernization program. We project   2016   capital expenditures to be approximately   $1.5 billion  . 
  Short-term lendings-affiliated for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   were a   $19.1 million   cash outflow, compared to a   $265.3 million   cash outflow for the comparable period in   2015  . This $246.2 million variance was primarily a result of investing net proceeds from CPPL's IPO into the money pool in 2015. 
  Contributions to equity investees   increased     $4.8 million   compared to the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and 2015, contributions of   $6.2 million   and $1.4 million, respectively, were made to Millennium Pipeline to fund capital projects.  
  Proceeds from disposition of assets decreased $45.2 million primarily due to decreased proceeds received on conveyances of mineral rights positions.

Financing Activities 
  Net cash from financing activities for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   was   $628.9 million  , an increase of $27.3 million compared to the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  . The increase in net cash from financing activities was primarily due to increased short-term borrowings from the CPG money pool to fund capital expenditures, in the current year, and the $500.0 million reimbursement of preformation capital expenditures to CEG, in the prior year. This increase was offset by current year quarterly distributions paid to limited partners of $443.6 million and CPPL's purchase of initial ownership of $1,170.0 million in the prior year. Refer to Note 1,  Basis of Accounting Presentation,  in the Notes to Condensed Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements (unaudited) for more information. 
  Intercompany Credit Agreement Amendment.     On January 31, 2016, we amended our intercompany credit agreement with CPG to extend the maturity date of the note originating on December 9, 2013 from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2020. The outstanding borrowings bear interest at a fixed rate of 4.70%. 
  Money Pool Agreement and CPG Credit Agreement.   We maintain a money pool arrangement with CPG. In furtherance of the money pool agreement, CPG entered into a   $1,500.0 million   revolving credit agreement on December 5, 2014. Effective July 1, 2016, in connection with the Merger, the   $1,500.0 million   CPG revolving credit facility was terminated and replaced by a   $2,000.0 million   revolving credit facility with US Parent. 
  CPG Commercial Paper Program.   CPG's commercial paper program (the  Program ) had a Program limit of up to   $1,000.0 million  . The Partnership, together with CEG and OpCo GP, each agreed, jointly and severally, unconditionally and irrevocably to guarantee payment in full of the principal of and interest (if any) on the promissory notes. On June 30, 2016, in anticipation of the Merger, the Program was terminated. CPG had   no   promissory notes outstanding under the Program at the time of termination. 
  Contractual Obligations.   There were no material changes recorded during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   to our contractual obligations as of   December 31, 2015  . 
   
  Off Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  We do not have any off balance sheet arrangements.

Other Information 
  Critical Accounting Policies 
  Our critical accounting policies disclosed in the "Critical Accounting Policies" section of the Partnership s audited consolidated and combined financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 are discussed below. There were no significant changes to critical accounting policies for the period ended   September 30, 2016  . 
  We apply certain accounting policies based on the accounting requirements discussed below that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on the Partnership s results of operations and Consolidated and Combined Balance Sheets. 
  Basis of Accounting for Rate-Regulated Subsidiaries.     Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") Topic 980,   Regulated Operations  , provides that rate-regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the Consolidated and Combined Balance Sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated and Combined Balance Sheets were $139.1 million and $310.9 million at December 31, 2015, and $158.0 million and $295.6 million at December 31, 2014, respectively.  
  In the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for us to recover our costs in the future, all or a portion of our regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of ASC Topic 980,   Regulated Operations  . In such event, a write-down of all or a portion of our existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under GAAP for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If unable to continue to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 980,   Regulated Operations  , we would be required to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 980-20,   Discontinuation of Rate-Regulated Accounting  . In management s opinion, our regulated companies will be subject to ASC Topic 980,   Regulated Operations   for the foreseeable future. 
  No regulatory assets are earning a return on investment at December 31, 2015. Regulatory assets of $7.2 million are covered by specific regulatory orders and are being recovered as components of cost of service over a remaining life up to 7 years. 
  Pensions and Postretirement Benefits.   CPG has defined benefit plans for both pensions and other postretirement benefits that cover employees of subsidiaries of the Partnership. The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, long-term returns on plan assets and employee longevity, among other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long-term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition.  
  Goodwill.   In accordance with the provisions for goodwill accounting under GAAP, we test our goodwill for impairment annually as of May 1 each year unless indicators, events, or circumstances would require an immediate review. Goodwill is tested for impairment at a level of reporting referred to as a reporting unit, which generally is an operating segment or a component of an operating segment as defined by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB"). Columbia Gas Transmission Operations is a component and has been determined to be a reporting unit. Our goodwill assets at December 31, 2015 and 2014 were $1,975.5 million pertaining to NiSource's acquisition of CEG on November 1, 2000. 
  We completed a quantitative ( step 1 ) fair value measurement of our reporting unit during the May 1, 2012 goodwill test. The test indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit substantially exceeded the carrying value, indicating that no impairment existed under the step 1 annual impairment test. For 2014 and 2015, a qualitative ( step 0 ) test was performed as of May 1 of each respective period. We assessed various assumptions, events and circumstances that would have affected the estimated fair value of the reporting unit in its baseline May 1, 2012 goodwill test. The results of this assessment indicated that it is not more likely than not that its reporting unit fair value is less than the reporting unit carrying value and no impairment is necessary. 
  Although there was no goodwill asset impairment as of May 1, 2015, an interim impairment test could be triggered by the following: actual earnings results that are materially lower than expected, significant adverse changes in the operating environment, an increase in the discount rate, changes in other key assumptions which require judgment and are forward looking in nature, or if the market

capitalization of our parent stays below book value for an extended period of time. We reviewed the market capitalization method due to the recent decline in CPPL's unit price. Following this review, we determined there were no impairment triggers identified subsequent to May 1, 2015. 
  Revenue Recognition.   Revenue is recognized as services are performed. For regulated entities, revenues are billed to customers monthly at rates established through the FERC s cost-based rate-making process or at rates less than those allowed by the FERC. Revenues are recorded on the accrual basis and include estimates for transportation provided but not billed. 
  The demand and commodity charges for transportation of gas under long-term agreements are recognized separately. Demand revenues are recognized monthly over the term of the agreement with the customer regardless of the volume of natural gas transported. Commodity revenues from both firm and interruptible transportation are recognized in the period the transportation services are provided based on volumes of natural gas physically delivered at the agreed upon delivery point. 
  We provide shorter term transportation services, for which cash is received at inception of the service period and is recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as income over the period the services are provided. 
  Storage capacity revenues are recognized monthly over the term of the agreement with the customer regardless of the volume of storage service actually utilized. Injection and withdrawal revenues are recognized in the period when volumes of natural gas are physically injected into or withdrawn from storage. 
  Our subsidiary, CEVCO owns the mineral rights to approximately 460,000 acres in the Marcellus and Utica shale areas. CEVCO leases or contributes the mineral rights to producers in return for royalty interest. Royalties from mineral interests are recognized on an accrual basis when earned and realizable. Royalty revenue was $26.5 million, $43.8 million and $21.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and are included in  Other revenues  on the Statements of Consolidated and Combined Operations. 
  We periodically recognize gains on the conveyance of mineral interest related to the pooling of assets (production rights) in joint undertakings intended to find, develop, or produce oil or gas from a particular property or group of properties. The gains are initially deferred if the Partnership has a substantial obligation for future performance. As the obligation for future performance is satisfied the deferred revenue is relieved and the associated gain is recognized. Gains on the conveyance of mineral interest amounted to $52.3 million, $34.5 million and $7.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and are included in  Gain on sale of assets and impairment, net  on the Statements of Consolidated and Combined Operations.

  ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
  CPG OpCo LP 

Market Risk Disclosures 
  Our quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk disclosed in the "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" section of the Partnership's audited consolidated and combined financial statements for the year ended   December 31, 2015   are discussed below. Our exposures to market risk have not changed materially since   December 31, 2015  . 
  Risk is an inherent part of our business.   The extent to which we properly and effectively identify, assess, monitor and manage each of the various types of risk involved in our businesses is critical to its profitability. We seek to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures, the following principal risks that are involved in our businesses: commodity market risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. Our senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. These include but are not limited to market, operational, financial, compliance and strategic risk types. In recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of our business, our risk management processes, policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification. 
  Commodity Price Risk.   Other than the base gas purchased and used in the natural gas storage facilities, which is necessary to maintain pressure and deliverability in the storage pools, we generally do not take title to the natural gas that we store and/or transport for customers and, accordingly, we are not exposed to commodity price fluctuations on natural gas stored in our facilities or transported through our pipelines by our customers. Base gas purchased and used in natural gas storage facilities is considered a long-term asset and is not re-valued at current market prices. A certain amount of gas is naturally lost in connection with transporting natural gas across our pipeline system and, under our contractual arrangements with our customers, we are entitled to retain a specified volume of natural gas in order to compensate us for such lost and unaccounted for volumes as well as our fuel usage. Except for the base gas in our natural gas storage facilities, which we consider to be a long-term asset, and volume and pricing variations related to the volumes of fuel we purchase to make up for line loss, our current business model is designed to minimize our exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices. As a result, absent other market factors that could adversely impact our operations, changes in the price of natural gas over the intermediate term should not materially impact our operations. We have not historically engaged in material commodity hedging activities relating to our assets. However, we may engage in commodity hedging activities in the future, particularly if we undertake growth projects or engage in acquisitions that expose us to direct commodity price risk. 
  Interest Rate Risk.   We are exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under our intercompany term loan. We entered into a variable interest term loan with NiSource Finance which carries an interest rate of prime plus 150 basis points. The loan was transferred from NiSource Finance to CPG in May 2015. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the outstanding balance on this term loan was $630.9 million and $834.0 million, respectively. An increase or decrease in interest rates of 100 basis points (1%) would have resulted in increased or decreased annual interest expense of $6.3 million and $8.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 
  Credit Risk.   Due to the nature of the industry, credit risk is embedded in our business activities. Our extension of credit is governed by CPG s Corporate Credit Risk Policy. In addition, CPG s Risk Management Committee guidelines are in place which document management approval levels for credit limits, evaluation of creditworthiness, and credit risk mitigation efforts. Exposures to credit risks are monitored by CPG s Corporate Credit Risk function which is independent of operations. Credit risk arises due to the possibility that a customer, supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date. Exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of current obligations net of any posted collateral such as cash, letters of credit and qualified guarantees of support.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
  CPG OpCo LP 
  Environmental Litigation 
  On September 8, 2016, Keith Stutes, in his capacity as District Attorney for the 15   th    Judicial District of the State of Louisiana, and the State of Louisiana (together,  Plaintiffs ) filed an action against certain oil and gas exploration and transportation companies, including Columbia Gulf Transmission, LLC (collectively, the  Defendants ), associated with the development of the Tigre Lagoon Oil   Gas Field in Vermillion Parish in the 15   th    Judicial District Court for the Parish of Vermillion, captioned   Keith Stutes, et al v. Gulfport Energy Corp, et al  . The complaint alleges the Defendants  operations were conducted in violation of the State and Local Coastal Resources Management Act of 1978, as amended (the  CZM Act of 1978 ) and that these activities caused substantial damage to the land and waterbodies located in the Coastal Zone, as defined in the CZM Act of 1978, within Vermillion Parish. It is possible that Columbia Gulf could incur substantial remediation and other costs and expenses in connection with this matter. The amount of any potential judgment, assessments, penalties, fines, costs or expenses that may be incurred in connection with  this litigation cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. 
  Please see Note 12 ( Other Commitments and Contingencies ) to Part I, Item I of this report, which is incorporated by reference into this Part II, Item 1, for a description of the litigation, legal and administrative proceedings and environmental matters.

  I, Stanley G. Chapman, III, certify that: 
           1. 
    I have reviewed this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   of CPG OpCo LP (the "registrant"); 
              2. 
    Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report; 
       
           3. 
    Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report; 
       
           4. 
    The registrant s other certifying officer(s) and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) for the registrant and have: 
       
           a) 
    Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared; 
       
           b) 
    Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and 
       
           c) 
    Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant s most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant s fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant s internal control over financial reporting; and 
       
           5. 
    The registrant s other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant s auditors and the audit committee of the registrant s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions): 
       
           a) 
    All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and 
       
           b) 
    Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting.
