Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Critical Accounting Policies 
    
  Organization and Nature of business   - First Northwest Bancorp, a Washington corporation, became the holding company of First Federal Savings and Loan Association of Port Angeles, on January 29, 2015, upon completion of the Bank's conversion from a mutual to stock form of organization (the "Conversion"). In connection with the Conversion, the Company issued an aggregate of   12,167,000   shares of common stock at an offering price of   $10.00   per share for gross proceeds of   $121.7 million  . An additional   933,360   shares of Company common stock and   $400,000   in cash were contributed to the First Federal Community Foundation ("Foundation"), a charitable foundation that was established in connection with the Conversion, resulting in the issuance of a total of   13,100,360   shares. The Company received   $117.6 million   in net proceeds from the stock offering of which   $58.4 million   were contributed to the Bank upon Conversion. 
    
  Pursuant to the Bank's Plan of Conversion (the "Plan") adopted by its Board of Directors, and as approved by its members, the Company established an employee stock ownership plan ("ESOP") which purchased in the open market, with funds borrowed from the Company,   8%   of the common stock issued in the Conversion for a total of   1,048,029   shares.  
    
  First Northwest's business activities generally are limited to passive investment activities and oversight of its investment in First Federal. Accordingly, the information set forth in this report, including the consolidated unaudited financial statements and related data, relates primarily to the Bank. 
    
  The Bank provides commercial and consumer banking services to individuals and businesses located primarily on the Olympic Peninsula in the State of Washington. These services include deposit and lending transactions that are supplemented with other borrowing and investing activities. 
    
  Basis of presentation   - The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"). Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ("GAAP") for complete financial statements. These unaudited interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   June 30, 2016  . In our opinion, all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) considered necessary for a fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP have been included. Operating results for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ended   June 30, 2017  . In preparing the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near term relate to a determination of the allowance for loan losses ("ALLL"), mortgage servicing rights, fair value of financial instruments, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and the valuation of impaired loans. 
    
  The Company completed its stock offering and became a public company on   January 29, 2015  . The Conversion was accounted for as a change in corporate form with the historic basis of the Bank's assets, liabilities, and equity unchanged as a result. 
    
  Principles of consolidation   - The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of First Northwest Bancorp; its wholly owned subsidiary, First Federal; and First Federal's wholly owned subsidiary, North Olympic Peninsula Services, Inc. ("NOPS"), majority-owned Craft3 Development IV, LLC ("Craft3"), and majority-owned 202 Master Tenant, LLC ("Master Tenant"). NOPS was dissolved on February 12, 2016, at which time the building owned by NOPS and rented in whole to First Federal became the property of the Bank. Craft3 is a partnership investment formed to provide a loan qualifying under the New Markets Tax Credit ("NMTC") rules. The Craft3 partnership was a   seven   year commitment, commensurate with the NMTC period, which expired June 6, 2015. First Federal subsequently entered a membership redemption and assignment agreement which terminated its membership interest in the Craft3 partnership effective September 30, 2015. In August 2016 First Federal entered into a partnership with the Peninsula College Foundation forming 202 Master Tenant, LLC. An initial equity contribution of   $274,000   was made in September 2016 with a final contribution of   $1.1 million   due once a historic tax credit has been granted and all remaining items outlined in the agreement satisfied. All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.

Subsequent Events   - The Company has evaluated subsequent events for potential recognition and disclosure and determined there are no such events or transactions requiring recognition or disclosure. 
    
  Recently issued accounting pronouncements   - In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2016-09,   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  . This ASU includes provisions intended to simplify various aspects related to how share-based payments are accounted for and presented in the financial statements. ASU 2016-09 is effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company has early-adopted this ASU. 
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  . The ASU provides specific guidance on eight classification issues in order to achieve more consistent reporting. The amendments in this ASU are effective for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of ASU No. 2016-15 will not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Reclassifications   - Certain amounts in the unaudited interim consolidated financial statements for prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current unaudited financial statement presentation with no effect on net income or shareholders' equity. 

Note 2 - Securities 
    
  The amortized cost, gross unrealized gains and losses, and estimated fair value of securities classified as available-for-sale and held-to-maturity at   September 30, 2016  , are summarized as follows:

The following shows the unrealized gross losses and fair value of the investment portfolio by length of time that individual securities in each category have been in a continuous loss position as of   June 30, 2016  : 

The Company may hold certain investment securities in an unrealized loss position that are not considered other than temporarily impaired ("OTTI"). At   September 30, 2016  , there were   17   investment securities with   $954,000   of unrealized losses and a fair value of approximately   $56.2 million  . At   June 30, 2016  , there were   15   investment securities with   $1.3 million   of unrealized losses and a fair value of approximately   $65.6 million  . 
    
  We believe that the unrealized losses on our investment securities relate principally to the general change in interest rates and illiquidity, and not credit quality, that has occurred since the initial purchase, and such unrecognized losses or gains will continue to vary with general interest rate level fluctuations in the future. Certain investments in a loss position are guaranteed by government entities or government sponsored entities. The Company does not intend to sell the securities in an unrealized loss position and believes it is not likely it will be required to sell these investments prior to a market price recovery or maturity. 
    
  There were   no   OTTI losses during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   or   2015  .

The amortized cost and estimated fair value of investment securities by contractual maturity are shown in the following tables at the dates indicated. Expected maturities of mortgage-backed securities may differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties; therefore, these securities are shown separately. 

There were no sales of securities available-for-sale during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   or   2015  .

  Loans receivable consisted of the following at the dates indicated: 

Allowance for Loan Losses.   The Company maintains a general allowance for loan losses based on evaluating known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio, including management s continuing analysis of the factors underlying the quality of the loan portfolio. These factors include changes in the size and composition of the loan portfolio, actual loan loss experience, and current and anticipated economic conditions. The reserve is an estimate based upon factors and trends identified by management at the time the financial statements are prepared. 
    
  The following tables summarize changes in the ALLL and loan portfolio by segment and impairment method for the periods shown:

Impaired loans.   A loan is considered impaired when First Federal has determined that it may be unable to collect payments of principal or interest when due under the contractual terms of the loan. In the process of identifying loans as impaired, management takes into consideration factors that include payment history and status, collateral value, financial condition of the borrower, and the probability of collecting scheduled payments in the future. Minor payment delays and insignificant payment shortfalls typically do not result in a loan being classified as impaired. The significance of payment delays and shortfalls is considered by management on a case-by-case basis after taking into consideration the totality of circumstances surrounding the loans and the borrowers, including payment history and amounts of any payment shortfall, length and reason for delay, and likelihood of return to stable performance. Impairment is measured on a loan-by-loan basis for all loans in the portfolio except smaller balance homogeneous loans and certain qualifying troubled debt restructuring ("TDR") loans.

The following table presents the recorded investment in nonaccrual loans by class of loan at the dates indicated: 

Past due loans.     Loans are considered past due if the required principal and interest payments have not been received as of the date such payments were due. There were no loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest at   September 30, 2016   and   June 30, 2016  . 
    
  The following table presents past due loans, net of partial loan charge-offs, by class, as of   September 30, 2016  :

The following table presents past due loans, net of partial loan charge-offs, by class, as of   June 30, 2016  : 

Credit quality indicator.   Federal regulations provide for the classification of lower quality loans and other assets, such as debt and equity securities, as substandard, doubtful, or loss; risk ratings 6, 7, and 8 in our 8-point risk rating system, respectively. An asset is considered substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and pay capacity of the borrower or of any collateral pledged. Substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that First Federal will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full highly questionable and improbable, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values. Assets classified as loss are those considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted. 
    
  When First Federal classifies problem assets as either substandard or doubtful, it may establish a specific allowance to address the risk specifically or First Federal may allow the loss to be addressed in the general allowance. General allowances represent loss allowances that have been established to recognize the inherent risk associated with lending activities but that, unlike specific allowances, have not been specifically allocated to particular problem assets. When an insured institution classifies problem assets as a loss, it is required to charge off such assets in the period in which they are deemed uncollectible. Assets that do not currently expose First Federal to sufficient risk to warrant classification as substandard or doubtful but possess identified weaknesses are designated as either watch or special mention assets; risk ratings 4 and 5 in our risk rating system, respectively. At   September 30, 2016   and   June 30, 2016  , First Federal had   $4.0 million   and   $4.6 million  , respectively, of loans classified as substandard and   no   loans classified as doubtful or loss. Loans not otherwise classified are considered pass graded loans and are rated 1-3 in our risk rating system. 
    
  Additionally, First Federal categorizes loans as performing or nonperforming based on payment activity. Loans that are more than 90 days past due and nonaccrual loans are considered nonperforming.

Troubled debt restructuring.   A TDR is a loan to a borrower who is experiencing financial difficulty that has been modified from its original terms and conditions in such a way that First Federal is granting the borrower a concession of some kind. First Federal has granted a variety of concessions to borrowers in the form of loan modifications. The modifications granted can generally be described in the following categories: 
    
  Rate modification   - A modification in which the interest rate is changed. 
    
  Term modification   - A modification in which the maturity date, timing of payments, or frequency of payments is changed. 
    
  Payment modification   - A modification in which the dollar amount of the payment is changed. Interest-only modifications in which a loan is converted to interest-only payments for a period of time are included in this category. 
    
  Combination modification   - Any other type of modification, including the use of multiple categories above. 
    
  Upon identifying a receivable as a TDR loan, First Federal classifies the loan as impaired for purposes of determining the allowance for loan losses. This requires the loan to initially be evaluated individually for impairment, generally based on the expected cash flows under the new terms discounted at the loan s original effective interest rates. For TDR loans that subsequently  
  
   21 

    FIRST NORTHWEST BANCORP AND SUBSIDIARY 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (Unaudited) 

default, the method of determining impairment is generally the fair value of the collateral less estimated selling costs. Certain qualifying TDR loans are subsequently measured for impairment using the factor for the corresponding segment and risk rating. 
    
  TDR loans may be upgraded in their classification and placed on accrual status once there is a sustained period of repayment performance, usually six months or longer, and there is a reasonable assurance that repayment will continue. First Federal allows reclassification of a troubled debt restructuring back into the general loan pool (as a non-troubled debt restructuring) if the borrower is able to refinance the loan at then-current market rates and meet all of the underwriting criteria of First Federal required of other borrowers. The refinance must be based on the borrower s ability to repay the debt and no special concessions of rate and/or term are granted to the borrower. 
    
  The following is a summary of information pertaining to TDR loans included in impaired loans at the dates indicated:

Note 5 - Federal Taxes on Income 
    
  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. These calculations are based on many complex factors including estimates of the timing of reversals of temporary differences, the interpretation of federal income tax laws, and a determination of the differences between the tax and the financial reporting basis of assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ significantly from the estimates and interpretations used in determining the current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities. 
    
  Under current Federal income tax regulations, charitable contribution deductions are limited to 10% of taxable income. Due to this limitation, the Company currently has a valuation allowance of   $1.9 million   for financial statement reporting purposes related to its contribution to the Foundation. The contribution carryforward and related valuation allowance will expire in 2020. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The Company evaluates whether its deferred tax assets will be realized and adjusts the amount of its valuation allowance, if necessary. 
    
  The effective tax rates were   33.9%   and   25.3%   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The Company's tax rate is reduced from the statutory tax rate in part as a result of permanent tax exclusions of noninterest income from bank-owned life insurance ("BOLI") and tax-exempt interest. 

Note 6 - Earnings per Share 
    
  Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflect the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the earnings of the entity. In addition, nonvested share-based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents are considered participating securities and are included in the computation of earnings per share. Certain of the Company's nonvested restricted stock awards qualify as participating securities. 
    
  The following table presents a reconciliation of the components used to compute basic and diluted earnings per share for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 

As of   September 30, 2016  , the ESOP had purchased   1,048,029   shares in the open market. Unallocated shares are not included as outstanding for either basic or diluted earnings per share calculations. As of   September 30, 2016  , there were   964,461   shares in the ESOP that remain unallocated.

Note 7 - Employee Benefits 
    
  Employee Stock Ownership Plan 
    
  In connection with the Conversion, the Company established an ESOP for eligible employees of the Company and the Bank. Employees of the Company and the Bank who have been credited with at least 1,000 hours of service during a   12  -month period are eligible to participate in the ESOP. 
    
  Pursuant to the Plan, the ESOP purchased in the open market   8%   of the common stock issued in the Conversion for a total of   1,048,029   shares at an average price of $  12.45   per share with funds borrowed from the Company. It is anticipated that the Bank will make contributions to the ESOP in amounts necessary to amortize the ESOP loan payable to the Company over a period of   20   years. At   September 30, 2016  , the weighted average interest rate paid on the ESOP loan payable was   2.46%   per annum. 
    
  Shares purchased by the ESOP with the loan proceeds are held in a suspense account and allocated to ESOP participants on a pro rata basis as principal and interest payments are made annually by the ESOP to the Company. The loan is secured by shares purchased with the loan proceeds and will be repaid by the ESOP with funds from the Bank's discretionary contributions to the ESOP and earnings on the ESOP assets. Payments of principal and interest are due annually on   June 30  . No payment of principal or interest was made during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  . 
    
  As shares are committed to be released from collateral, the Company reports compensation expense equal to the average daily market prices of the shares and the shares become outstanding for EPS computations. The compensation expense is accrued monthly throughout the year. Dividends on allocated ESOP shares are recorded as a reduction of retained earnings; dividends on unallocated ESOP shares are recorded as a reduction of debt and accrued interest. 
    
  Compensation expense related to the ESOP for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was   $195,000   and   $148,000  , respectively. 
    
  Shares held by the ESOP as of the dates indicated are as follows: 

Note 8 - Stock-based Compensation 
    
  On   November 16, 2015  , the Company's shareholders approved the First Northwest Bancorp 2015 Equity Incentive Plan (the "EIP"), which provides for the grant of incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, restricted stock and restricted stock units to eligible participants. The cost of awards under the EIP generally is based on the fair value of the awards on their grant date. The maximum number of shares that may be utilized for awards under the EIP is   1,834,050  . Shares of common stock issued under the EIP may be authorized but unissued shares or repurchased shares. 
    
  During the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  ,   402,500   shares of restricted stock were awarded and   no   stock options were granted. There were no awards or related expenses during the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  . Awarded shares of restricted stock vest over   five years   from the date of grant as long as the eligible participant remains in service to the Company. The Company recognizes compensation expense for the restricted stock awards based on the fair value of the shares at the award date.

For the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , total compensation expense for the EIP was   $256,000  . 
    
  The following table provides a summary of changes in non-vested restricted stock awards for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  : 

As of   September 30, 2016  , there was   $4.8 million   of total unrecognized compensation costs related to non-vested shares granted as restricted stock awards. The cost is expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted-average vesting period of approximately   4.75   years. 

Note 9 - Fair Value Accounting and Measurement 
    
  Fair value is the price to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in the Company s principal market. The Company has established and documented its process for determining the fair values of its assets and liabilities, where applicable. Fair value is based on quoted market prices, when available, for identical or similar assets or liabilities. In the absence of quoted market prices, management determines the fair value of the Company s assets and liabilities using valuation models or third-party pricing services, both of which rely on market-based parameters when available, such as interest rate yield curves, option volatilities and credit spreads, or unobservable inputs. Unobservable inputs may be based on management s judgment, assumptions, and estimates related to credit quality, liquidity, interest rates, and other relevant inputs. 
    
  Any changes to valuation methodologies are reviewed by management to ensure they are relevant and justified. Valuation methodologies are refined as more market-based data becomes available. 
    
  A three-level valuation hierarchy is used in determining fair value that is based on the transparency of the inputs used in the valuation process. The inputs used in determining fair value in each of the three levels of the hierarchy are as follows: 
    
  Level 1   - Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. 
    
  Level 2   - Either: (i) quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; (ii) observable inputs, such as interest rates or yield curves; or (iii) inputs derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. 
    
  Level 3   - Unobservable inputs. 
    
  The hierarchy gives the highest ranking to Level 1 inputs and the lowest ranking to Level 3 inputs. The level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the overall fair value measurement.

Qualitative disclosures of valuation techniques   -     Securities available for sale: where quoted prices are available in an active market, securities are classified as Level 1. Level 1 instruments include highly liquid government bonds, securities issued by the U.S. Treasury, and exchange-traded equity securities.  
    
  If quoted prices are not available, management determines fair value using pricing models, quoted prices of similar securities, which are considered Level 2, or discounted cash flows. In certain cases, where there is limited activity in the market for a particular instrument, assumptions must be made to determine their fair value. Such instruments are classified as Level 3. 
    
  Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis   - Assets and liabilities are considered to be fair valued on a recurring basis if fair value is measured regularly (i.e., daily, weekly, monthly, or quarterly). The following tables show the Company s assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis at the dates indicated: 

Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis   - Assets are considered to be fair valued on a nonrecurring basis if the fair value measurement of the instrument does not necessarily result in a change in the amount recorded on the

consolidated balance sheets. Generally, nonrecurring valuation is the result of the application of other accounting pronouncements that require assets or liabilities to be assessed for impairment or recorded at the lower of cost or fair value.  
    
  The following tables present the Company s assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis at the dates indicated: 

At   September 30, 2016   and   June 30, 2016  , there were no impaired loans with discounts to appraisal disposition value or other unobservable inputs.

The following tables present the carrying value and estimated fair value of financial instruments at the dates indicated: 

Financial assets and liabilities other than investment securities are not traded in active markets. Estimated fair values require subjective judgments and are approximate. The estimates of fair value in the previous table are not necessarily representative of amounts that could be realized in actual market transactions, or of the underlying value of the Company. Fair value estimates, methods, and assumptions are set forth below for the Company's financial instruments: 

29 

    FIRST NORTHWEST BANCORP AND SUBSIDIARY 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (Unaudited) 

Financial instruments with book value equal to fair value   - The fair value of financial instruments that are short-term or reprice frequently and that have little or no risk are considered to have a fair value equal to book value. These instruments include cash and due from banks, interest bearing deposits with banks, FHLB stock, accrued interest receivable, and accrued interest payable. FHLB stock is not publicly traded, however, it may be redeemed on a dollar-for-dollar basis, for any amount the Bank is not required to hold, subject to the FHLB's discretion. The fair value is therefore equal to the book value. 
    
  Securities   - Fair values for investment securities are primarily measured using information from a third-party pricing service. The pricing service uses evaluated pricing models based on market data. In the event that limited or less transparent information is provided by the third-party pricing service, fair value is estimated using secondary pricing services or non-binding third-party broker quotes. 
    
  Loans held for sale   - The fair value of loans held for sale is based on quoted market prices from Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ("Freddie Mac"), which are updated daily and represent prices at which loans are exchanged in high volumes and in a liquid market. 
    
  Loans receivable, net   - Fair values are estimated for portfolios of loans with similar financial characteristics. Loans are segregated by type, including fixed and variable one- to four-family residential real estate, commercial, and consumer loans. There is an accurate and reliable secondary market for one- to four-family residential mortgage production, and available market benchmarks are used to establish discount factors for estimating fair value for these types of loans. Commercial and consumer loans use market benchmarks when available; however, due to the varied term structures and credit issues involved, they mainly rely on cash flow projections and repricing characteristics within the loan portfolio. These amounts are discounted further by embedded probable losses expected to be realized in the portfolio. 
    
  Valuations of impaired loans, real estate owned and repossessed assets are periodically performed by management, and the fair values of these loans are carried at the fair value of the underlying collateral less estimated costs to sell. Fair value of the underlying collateral may be determined using an appraisal performed by a qualified independent appraiser. 
    
  Mortgage servicing rights   - The estimated fair value of mortgage servicing rights is based on market prices for comparable mortgage servicing contracts, when available, or alternatively, is based on a valuation model that calculates the present value of estimated future net servicing income. 
    
  Deposits   - The fair value of deposits with no stated maturity, such as non-interest bearing deposits, savings and interest checking accounts, and money market accounts, is equal to the amount payable on demand as of   September 30, 2016   and   June 30, 2016  . The fair value of certificates of deposit is based on the discounted value of contractual cash flows. The discount rate is estimated using the rates currently offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities. 
    
  Borrowings   - The fair value of FHLB advances and other borrowings are calculated using a discounted cash flow method, adjusted for market interest rates and terms to maturity. 
    
  Off-balance-sheet financial instruments   - Commitments to extend credit represent all off-balance-sheet financial instruments. The fair value of these commitments is not significant.

  General 
  First Northwest Bancorp (or the "Company") is a bank holding company which primarily engages in the business activity of its subsidiary, First Federal Savings and Loan Association of Port Angeles ("First Federal" or the "Bank"). First Federal is a community-oriented financial institution primarily serving the North Olympic Peninsula region of Washington. We have eleven banking locations in Washington State, eight of which are located within Clallam and Jefferson counties, one in Kitsap County, and two in Whatcom County. We anticipate opening a Home Lending Center in Seattle, Washington during the second quarter of fiscal 2017, focused on the origination of loans secured by one- to four-family residential properties, which may be sold into the secondary market or retained in our loan portfolio, subject to management's growth and investment objectives. We offer a wide range of products and services focused on the lending and depository needs of the communities we serve. Historically, lending activities have been primarily directed toward the origination of first lien one- to four-family mortgage loans, and, to a lesser extent, commercial and multi-family real estate loans, construction and land loans (including lot loans), commercial business loans, and consumer loans, consisting primarily of home equity loans and lines of credit. While we have a large concentration of first lien one- to four-family mortgage loans, we have revised our operating strategy to diversify our loan portfolio, expand our deposit product offerings, and enhance our infrastructure. We have increased the origination of higher-yielding commercial real estate, multi-family real estate, and construction loans, and decreased reliance on originating and retaining longer-term, fixed-rate, residential mortgage loans. We may sell conforming single-family owner-occupied fixed-rate mortgage loans into the secondary market to increase noninterest income and improve our interest rate risk, or we may retain select loans in our portfolio to enhance interest income. We offer traditional consumer and business deposit products, including transaction accounts, savings and money market accounts and certificates of deposit for individuals, businesses and nonprofit organizations. Deposits are our primary source of funds for our lending and investing activities. 
    
  First Federal is significantly affected by prevailing economic conditions as well as government policies and regulations concerning, among other things, monetary and fiscal affairs, housing and financial institutions. Deposit  
  
   32 

flows are influenced by a number of factors, including interest rates paid on competing time deposits, available alternative investments, account maturities, and the overall level of personal income and savings. Lending activities are influenced by the demand for funds, the number and quality of lenders, and regional economic cycles. 
    
  Our primary source of pre-tax income is net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income, which is the income that we earn on our loans and investments, and interest expense, which is the interest that we pay on our deposits and borrowings. Changes in levels of interest rates affect our net interest income. A secondary source of income is noninterest income, which includes revenue we receive from providing products and services, including service charges on deposit accounts, mortgage banking income, earnings from bank-owned life insurance, and gains and losses from sales of securities. 
    
  An offset to net interest income is the provision for loan losses, which represents the periodic charge to operations which is required to adequately provide for probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio. As a loan's risk rating improves, property values increase, or recoveries of amounts previously charged off are received, a recapture of previously recognized provision for loan losses may be added to net interest income. 
    
  The noninterest expenses we incur in operating our business consist of salaries and employee benefits and expenses, occupancy and equipment expenses, federal deposit insurance premiums and regulatory assessments, data processing expenses, expenses related to real estate and personal property owned and other miscellaneous expenses.  
    
  Salaries and employee benefits consist primarily of salaries and wages paid to our employees, payroll taxes, expenses for health insurance, retirement plans and other employee benefits, including employee compensation expenses stemming from recognition of expense related to the ESOP and the adoption of the new equity incentive plan. The actual amount of these new stock-related compensation and benefit expenses are based on the fair market value of the shares of common stock at specific points in the future, and it is difficult to determine exactly what those costs will be. 

Critical Accounting Policies 
    
  There are no material changes to the critical accounting policies as disclosed in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   June 30, 2016  . 

Comparison of Financial Condition at   September 30, 2016   and   June 30, 2016 
    
  Assets  .   Total assets increased   $38.4 million  , or   3.8%  , to   $1.05 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , from   $1.01 billion   at   June 30, 2016  , primarily due to an increase of   $44.2 million  , or   7.1%  , in net loans receivable to   $664.1 million   at   September 30, 2016  , from   $619.8 million   at   June 30, 2016  , primarily as a result of commercial loan originations and the purchase of a one- to four-family residential loan pool during the quarter.  
    
  Total loans, excluding loans held for sale, increased   $44.2 million  , or   7.1%  , to   $670.2 million   at   September 30, 2016  , from   $626.0 million   at   June 30, 2016  . The portfolio increase was mainly attributable to an increase in one- to four-family residential loans of   $20.3 million  , or   6.6%  , to   $328.8 million   at   September 30, 2016   from   $308.5 million   at   June 30, 2016  , the result of loan originations of   $17.1 million   and a loan pool purchase of   $30.3 million   offset by normal amortization and prepayment activity during the quarter. The loan pool purchase included jumbo loans secured by residential properties located in Washington State. Commercial real estate loans increased   $18.5 million  , or   11.5%  , to   $179.6 million   at   September 30, 2016   from   $161.2 million   at   June 30, 2016  , multi-family loans increased   $1.9 million  , or   4.1%  , to   $48.0 million   at   September 30, 2016   from   $46.1 million   at   June 30, 2016  , and commercial business loans increased   $112,000  , or   0.7%  , to   $17.0 million   at   September 30, 2016   from   $16.9 million   at   June 30, 2016  , as we continue to focus on increasing our commercial lending activity.  
    
  Additionally, the balance of construction and land loans increased   $2.0 million   during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   to   $52.3 million   at   September 30, 2016   from   $50.4 million   at   June 30, 2016  . Our construction loans are geographically disbursed throughout the State of Washington and, as a result, these loans are susceptible to risks that may be different than the risks of construction lending in our primary market area. We manage all of our construction lending by utilizing a licensed third party vendor to assist us in monitoring our construction projects throughout the state of Washington. There were   $38.2 million   in undisbursed construction commitments at   September 30, 2016  , an increase of   $8.3 million   compared to   $29.9 million   at   June 30, 2016  . Undisbursed construction commitments at   September 30, 2016   included   $16.5 million   of one- to four-family  
  
   33 

residential,   $7.4 million   of multi-family residential, and   $14.3 million   of commercial real estate. Commercial real estate construction commitments include   $10.9 million   of one- to four-family speculative construction projects, of which $7.8 million is located in Kitsap County, $2.1 million in King County, and $907,000 in Thurston County, Washington.  
    
  There was also an increase in other consumer loans of   $1.6 million   during   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , primarily as a result of our indirect auto lending program. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in home equity loans of   $156,000  . We continue to focus on increasing our loan balances as a percentage of earning assets. 
    
  The following tables show our construction commitments by type and geographic concentrations at the dates indicated:

During the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company originated   $56.7 million   of loans, of which   $30.3 million  , or   53.4%  , were originated in the North Olympic Peninsula,   $26.3 million  , or   46.4%  , in the Puget Sound region of Washington, and   $88,000  , or   0.2%  , in other areas in Washington. During the same period, we purchased   $30.3 million   and originated   $17.1 million   of one- to four-family residential loans, of which   $10.2 million   were sold into the secondary market. As lending activity increases from the opening of our Home Lending Center in Seattle, Washington, we intend to retain in our portfolio originations of one- to four-family residential loans in order to meet our loan growth objectives, while selling off excess production into the secondary market, and relying less on the purchase of one- to four-family residential loan pools. 
    
  Our allowance for loan losses increased   $443,000  , or   6.1%  , from   $7.2 million   at   June 30, 2016   to   $7.7 million   at   September 30, 2016  , primarily due to an increase in total loans during the quarter. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans remained the same at   1.2%   of total loans at both   September 30, 2016   and   June 30, 2016  . There was no material change in our allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans during the period as o  ur asset quality has remained stable. We believe our allowance for loan losses is adequate, with normal fluctuations in the balance of nonperforming assets and other credit quality measures expected as we increase our loan portfolio. 

35 

Loans receivable, excluding loans held for sale, consisted of the following at the dates indicated  : 

Nonperforming loans decreased   $400,000  , or   12.1%  , to   $2.9 million   at   September 30, 2016  , from   $3.3 million   at   June 30, 2016  , primarily as a result of a decrease in nonperforming one- to four-family loans of   $270,000  . Real estate owned and repossessed assets increased   $50,000  , or   61.7%  , to   $131,000   at   September 30, 2016   from   $81,000   at   June 30, 2016  . Nonperforming loans to total loans declined from   0.5%   at   June 30, 2016   to   0.4%   at   September 30, 2016  . The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of nonperforming loans increased to   268.1%   at   September 30, 2016   from   222.3%   at   June 30, 2016  . 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , there were   $6.3 million   in restructured loans, of which   $5.7 million   were performing in accordance with their modified payment terms and returned to accrual status. Classified loans, consisting solely of substandard loans, decreased by   $600,000  , or   13.0%  , to   $4.0 million   at   September 30, 2016  , from   $4.6 million   at   June 30, 2016  . Loans 30 days or more past due decreased   $786,000  , or   45.9%  , to   $927,000   at   September 30, 2016  , from   $1.7 million   at   June 30, 2016  . 
  
   36 

The following table represents nonperforming assets at the dates indicated. 

During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , total investment securities decreased   $21.9 million  , or   6.8%  , to   $302.0 million   at   September 30, 2016  , from   $323.9 million   at   June 30, 2016  . Mortgage-backed securities totaled   $207.6 million   at   September 30, 2016  , a decrease of   $16.3 million  , or   7.3%  , from   $223.9 million   at   June 30, 2016  . Other investment securities, including municipal bonds and other asset-backed securities, were   $94.4 million   at   September 30, 2016  , a decrease of   $5.6 million  , or   5.6%  , from   $100.0 million   at   June 30, 2016  . As of   September 30, 2016  , the investment portfolio, including mortgage-backed securities, had an estimated projected average life and average repricing term of   4.2   years and   3.7   years, respectively, based on the interest rate environment at that time. The investment portfolio contains   83.0%   of amortizing securities at   September 30, 2016  , and the projected average life of our securities may vary due to prepayment activity, which, particularly in the mortgage-backed securities portfolio, is generally affected by changing interest rates. Management continues to focus on improving the mix of earning assets by originating loans and decreasing securities as a percentage of earning assets; however, we may purchase investment securities as a source of interest income in lieu of carrying higher cash balances at nominal interest rates. For additional information, see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. 
    
  Liabilities.   Total liabilities increased   $38.9 million  , or   4.7%  , to   $859.2 million   at   September 30, 2016  , from   $820.4 million   at   June 30, 2016  . This increase was primarily the result of deposit account balances increasing   $53.0 million  , or   7.3%  , to   $776.3 million   at   September 30, 2016  , from   $723.3 million   at   June 30, 2016  . Transaction, savings, and money market account deposits increased   $43.7 million  , or   7.7%  , to   $607.9 million   at   September 30, 2016   from   $564.2 million   at   June 30, 2016  , including an increase in personal and business transaction accounts of   $12.1 million   and   $9.4 million  , respectively. Deposit account increases were primarily the result of our continuing efforts to expand commercial and consumer deposit relationships in Silverdale and Bellingham, Washington, as well as within our historic Clallam and Jefferson County, Washington locations. 

Borrowings decreased   $5.6 million  , or   6.9%  , from   $80.7 million   at   June 30, 2016   to   $75.1 million   at   September 30, 2016  , as a result of repayment on our Fed Funds advance account from the FHLB.  
    
  Equity  .   Total shareholders' equity decreased   $467,000  , or   0.2%  , from   $189.7 million   at   June 30, 2016   to   $189.3 million   at   September 30, 2016  , primarily due to a net decrease of $1.1 million related to the repurchase and  
  
   37 

award of shares of restricted common stock under the Company's 2015 Equity Incentive Plan and decreases in unrealized changes in market values of available for sale securities of   $236,000  , partially offset by employee stock ownership plan shares committed to be released of   $195,000   and net income of   $651,000   during the quarter. 

Comparison of Results of Operations for the Three Months Ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015    
    
  General.   The Company recorded net income for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   of   $651,000   compared to net income of   $1.2 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  , a decrease of   $577,000  , or   47.0%  , primarily as a result of an increase in noninterest expense of   $1.5 million  . 
    
  Net Interest Income.   Net interest income increased   $1.1 million   to   $7.4 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , from   $6.3 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  . This increase was primarily the result of an increase in interest income related to the increased average volume of loans receivable. 
    
  The net interest margin increased   28   basis points to   3.06%   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , from   2.78%   for the same period in   2015  . The net interest margin increased due primarily to an increase in the average balance of total loans receivable earning higher yields and a reduction in lower yielding cash and investment alternatives, as well as increases in the average yield of investment and mortgage-backed securities. Reduced borrowing costs related to the prepayment of long-term FHLB advances also contributed to improved margins during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared to the same period one year prior. The average balance of interest-bearing deposits in banks decreased   $17.8 million   to   $15.1 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   from   $32.9 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  . Of the   $1.1 million   increase in net interest income during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  ,   $1.3 million   was the result of an increase in volume offset by a decrease of   $246,000   attributable to changes in rates. Loans receivable was the primary contributor to the increase in net interest income with a   $1.6 million   increase due to volume offset by a   $343,000   decrease due to rate. The yield on average interest-earning assets increased   24   basis points to   3.56%   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to   3.32%   for the same period in the prior year, due primarily to the increase in the average balance of loans receivable and the average yield earned on investment securities. The cost of average interest-bearing liabilities decreased   seven   basis points to   0.68%   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to   0.75%   for the same period in the prior year, due primarily to the decrease in the average balance and rate paid on FHLB borrowings. 
    
  Interest Income.   Total interest income increased   $1.0 million  , or   13.3%  , to   $8.5 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   from   $7.5 million   for the comparable period in   2015  . Interest income on loans increased   $1.2 million  , or   21.8%  , during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , primarily reflecting an increase in the average balance of loans receivable to   $629.3 million   at   September 30, 2016   from   $490.3 million   at   September 30, 2015  , combined with a decrease in average yield to   4.27%   at   September 30, 2016   from   4.49%   at   September 30, 2015  , as higher yielding loans were repaid and replaced with loans at lower average yields. 
    
  Interest income on investment securities decreased   $140,000   to   $649,000   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to   $789,000   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  , primarily the result of a decrease in the average balance of   $41.0 million  , or   30.0%  , to   $95.8 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to   $136.8 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  . The average yield on investment securities for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   increased   40   basis points due primarily to investments purchased with higher yields compared to the same period in   2015  . 
    
  Interest income on mortgage backed securities decreased   $78,000   primarily due to a decrease in the average balance of   $24.3 million   to   $216.0 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   from   $240.3 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  . The average yield on mortgage-backed securities for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   increased   eight   basis points, primarily due to investments purchased with higher yields compared to the same period in   2015  . 

38 

The following table compares average earning asset balances, associated yields, and resulting changes in interest income for the periods shown: 

Interest Expense.   Total interest expense decreased   $38,000  , or   3.1%  , and was   $1.2 million   for both the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and 2015. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities decreased for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015   primarily due to a lower average balance and cost of borrowings offset by increases in the average balance and cost of deposits. The rates paid on money market accounts and certificates of deposit increased as the result of targeted promotional efforts in new and existing market areas. 
    
  The average balance of interest-bearing deposits increased   $65.5 million  , or   11.6%  , to   $631.8 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   from   $566.3 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  , primarily the result of an increase in the average balance of money market accounts and certificates of deposit of   $36.9 million   and   $17.2 million  , respectively. The average balances of both transaction and savings accounts also increased by   $6.3 million   and   $5.0 million  , respectively. These increases are primarily the result of pricing promotions and the development of consumer and commercial customer relationships as we continue to focus on increasing our customer deposit base in new and existing markets. 
    
  Borrowing costs declined   $184,000   to   $542,000   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   from   $726,000   for the comparable period in   2015   due to a decline of   $22.1 million   in the average balance of borrowings. 
    
  The following table details average balances, cost of funds and the change in interest expense for the periods shown:    

Provision for Loan Losses.   The provision for loan losses was   $350,000   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to no provision for loan losses during the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  , due primarily to the growth in our loan portfolio. We continue to see improvement in our asset quality as well, as reflected in the decrease in nonperforming loans, classified loans, and ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans. These improvements are primarily a result of improving economic conditions. Management considers the allowance for loan losses at   September 30, 2016   to be adequate to cover probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio. While management believes the estimates and assumptions used in its determination of the adequacy of the allowance are  
  
   39 

reasonable, there can be no assurance that such estimates and assumptions will not be proven incorrect in the future, or that the actual amount of future provisions will not exceed the amount of past provisions or that any increased provisions that may be required will not adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the determination of the amount of our allowance for loan losses is subject to review by bank regulators, as part of the routine examination process, which may result in the establishment of additional reserves based upon their judgment or information available to them at the time of their examination. 
    
  The following table details activity and information related to the allowance for loan losses for the periods shown: 

Noninterest Income.   Noninterest income increased   $181,000  , or   14.3%  , to   $1.4 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , from   $1.3 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  , primarily as a result of an increase in net gain on sale of loans of   $227,000   due to selling, rather than retaining in portfolio, a portion of our originations of one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. We also had an increase of   $131,000   in the cash surrender value of BOLI that was primarily a result of changes to policies underlying a portion of BOLI. The changes in policies produced a higher return on BOLI than for the comparable period in 2015. We also had significant improvements in returns on the underlying investments held by existing BOLI. The purchase of an additional $10.0 million of BOLI during the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   also contributed to the increase in BOLI income. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in other income of   $166,000  , primarily the result of income of $140,000 recognized during the quarter ended   September 30, 2015   related to the dissolution of our Craft3 subsidiary. 
    
  The following table provides a detailed analysis of the changes in the components of noninterest income for the periods shown: 

Noninterest Expense.   Noninterest expense increased   $1.6 million  , or   26.1%  , to   $7.5 million   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016  , compared to   $5.9 million   for the same period in   2015  , primarily as a result of an increase in compensation and benefits of   $887,000   compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in compensation and benefits expense is partially attributable to stock awards issued during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   as part of our 2015 Equity Incentive Plan, which will be expensed over a five year vesting period, resulting in additional compensation and benefits of   $256,000   compared to the same quarter in 2015. We  
  
   40 

incurred increased compensation and benefits expenses related to the addition of personnel in loan production, staff and management of new branch locations, and support staff and management added in support of our expansion and growth efforts. Real estate owned and repossessed assets expense increased   $381,000   to   $39,000   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to income of   $342,000   for the same period in 2015, primarily the result of a gain on the sale of a commercial real estate property of $352,000 during the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . In addition, occupancy, equipment, depreciation and amortization expense increased due to our market expansion and growth. We expect further increases in noninterest expenses related to the opening and operations of our Home Lending Center in Seattle, Washington, which we anticipate will occur during the second quarter of fiscal 2017. We believe that these expenses are necessary to support and maintain the infrastructure needed for prudent and sustainable growth. 
    
  The following table provides an analysis of the changes in the components of noninterest expense for the periods shown: 

Provision for Income Tax.   An income tax expense of   $334,000   was recorded for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to   $417,000   for the   three months ended     September 30, 2015  . This was generally due to a decrease in income before taxes of   $660,000  . 

41 

Average Balances, Interest and Average Yields/Cost 
  The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, information regarding average balances of assets and liabilities as well as the total dollar amounts of interest income from average interest earning assets and interest expense on average interest bearing liabilities, resultant yields, interest rate spread, net interest margin (otherwise known as net yield on interest earning assets), and the ratio of average interest earning assets to average interest-bearing liabilities. Also presented are the weighted average yields on interest-earning assets, rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities and the resultant spread at   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . Income and all average balances are monthly average balances, which management deems to be not materially different than daily averages. Nonaccruing loans have been included in the table as loans carrying a zero yield. 

42 

Rate/Volume Analysis 
  The following table presents the dollar amount of changes in interest income and interest expense for major components of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. It distinguishes between the changes related to outstanding balances and changes in interest rates. For each category of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, information is provided on changes attributable to (i) changes in volume (i.e., changes in volume multiplied by old rate) and (ii) changes in rate (i.e., changes in rate multiplied by old volume). For purposes of this table, changes attributable to both rate and volume, which cannot be segregated, have been allocated proportionately to the change due to volume and the change due to rate. 

Off-Balance Sheet Activities 
  In the normal course of operations, First Federal engages in a variety of financial transactions that are not recorded in the financial statements. These transactions involve varying degrees of off-balance sheet credit, interest rate and liquidity risks. These transactions are used primarily to manage customers  requests for funding and take the form of loan commitments and lines of credit. For the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and the year ended   June 30, 2016  , we engaged in no off-balance sheet transactions likely to have a material effect on the financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 
  
   43 

Contractual Obligations  
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , our scheduled maturities of contractual obligations were as follows:  

Commitments and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
    
  The following table summarizes our commitments and contingent liabilities with off-balance sheet risks as of   September 30, 2016  : 

Liquidity Management 
    
  Liquidity is the ability to meet current and future financial obligations of a short-term and long-term nature. Our primary sources of funds consist of deposit inflows, loan repayments, maturities and sales of securities and borrowings from the FHLB. While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are usually predictable sources of funds, deposit flows, calls of investment securities and borrowed funds, and prepayments on loans and investment securities are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions and competition, which can cause those sources of funds to fluctuate. 
    
  Management regularly adjusts investments in liquid assets based upon an assessment of expected loan demand, expected deposit flows, yields available on interest-earning deposits and securities, and the objectives of our interest-rate risk and investment policies. 
    
  Our most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents followed by available for sale securities. The levels of these assets depend on our operating, financing, lending and investing activities during any given period. At   September 30, 2016  , cash and cash equivalents totaled   $29.8 million  . Securities classified as available-for-sale, whose aggregate market value exceeds cost, provide additional sources of liquidity and had a market value of   $247.1 million   at   September 30, 2016  . In addition, at   September 30, 2016  , we had FHLB stock of   $4.2 million   and have pledged collateral to support borrowings from the FHLB of   $75.1 million  . We have also established a borrowing arrangement with the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco; however, no collateral has been pledged as of   September 30, 2016  .  

44 

At   September 30, 2016  , we had   $514,000   in loan commitments outstanding and an additional   $75.8 million   in undisbursed loans and standby letters of credit, including   $38.2 million   in undisbursed construction loan commitments.  
    
  Certificates of deposit due within one year of   September 30, 2016   totaled   $57.9 million  , or   34.4%   of certificates of deposit. The large percentage of certificates of deposit that mature within one year reflects customers' hesitancy to invest their funds for longer periods at historically low interest rates. Management believes, based on past experience, that a significant portion of our certificates of deposit will be renewed or rolled into money market accounts. If these maturing deposits are not renewed, however, we will be required to seek other sources of funds, including other certificates of deposit and borrowings. We have the ability to attract and retain deposits by adjusting the interest rates offered. Depending on market conditions, we may be required to pay higher rates on such deposits or other borrowings than we currently pay on certificates of deposit. In addition, we believe that our branch network, which is presently comprised of 11 banking locations throughout our market area, and the general cash flows from our existing lending and investment activities, will afford us sufficient long-term liquidity. For additional information, see the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in Item 1 of this Form 10-Q. 
    
  The Company is a separate legal entity from the Bank and provides for its own liquidity to pay its operating expenses and other financial obligations. At   September 30, 2016  , the Company (on an unconsolidated basis) had liquid assets of   $40.7 million  . 
    
  Capital Resources 
  At   September 30, 2016  , shareholders' equity totaled   $189.3 million  , or   18.1%   of total assets. Our book value per share of common stock was   $14.60   at   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $14.97   at   June 30, 2016  . Consistent with our goals to operate a sound and profitable organization, our policy for First Federal is to maintain its  well-capitalized  status in accordance with regulatory standards. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , the Bank and consolidated Company exceeded all regulatory capital requirements, and the Bank was considered "well capitalized" under FDIC regulatory capital guidelines. 
    
    The following table provides the capital requirements and actual results at   September 30, 2016  . 

In addition to the minimum common equity Tier 1 ("CET1"), Tier 1 and total capital ratios, the Bank now has to maintain a capital conservation buffer consisting of additional CET1 capital above the required minimum levels in order to avoid limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary  
  
   45 

bonuses based on percentages of eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions. This new capital conservation buffer requirement began to be phased in starting in January 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and will increase each year until fully implemented to an amount equal to 2.5% of risk-weighted assets in January 2019. 
    
  Effect of Inflation and Changing Prices 
    
  The consolidated financial statements and related financial data presented in this report have been prepared according to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, which require the measurement of financial and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation. The primary impact of inflation on our operations is reflected in increased operating costs and the effect that general inflation may have on both short-term and long-term interest rates. Unlike most industrial companies, virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution's performance than do general levels of inflation. Although inflation expectations do affect interest rates, interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 

There has not been any material change in the market risk disclosures contained in First Northwest Bancorp s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   June 30, 2016  . 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
    
  (a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. 
    
  An evaluation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange Act )) was carried out under the supervision and with the participation of the Company's Chief Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer), Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial and Accounting Officer), and other members of the Company's management team as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report. The Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of   September 30, 2016  , the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that the information required to be disclosed by the Company in     the reports it files or submits under the Act is (i) accumulated and communicated to the Company's management (including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer) in a timely manner, and (ii) recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms. 
    
  (b) Changes in Internal Controls. 
    
  There have been no changes in the Company's internal control over financial reporting (as defined in 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting. 
    
  The Company intends to continually review and evaluate the design and effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures and to improve its controls and procedures over time and to correct any deficiencies that it may discover in the future. The goal is to ensure that senior management has timely access to all material financial and non-financial information concerning the Company's business. While the Company believes the present design of its disclosure controls and procedures is effective to achieve its goal, future events affecting its business may cause the Company to modify its disclosure controls and procedures. The Company does not expect that its disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting will prevent every error or instance of fraud. A control procedure, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control procedure are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control procedures, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns in controls or procedures can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. The design of any control procedure is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its  
  
   46 

stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control procedure, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.

  I, Laurence J. Hueth, President, Chief Executive Officer and Director of First Northwest Bancorp, certify that:

           4.

           b. 
    Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; 
       
           c. 
    Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and 
       
           d. 
    Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant's most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant's fiscal fourth quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal control over financial reporting; and 
       
           5.
