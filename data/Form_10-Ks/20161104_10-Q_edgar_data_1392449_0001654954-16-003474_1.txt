INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

The
unaudited interim financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the
United States for interim financial information and with the
instructions under Regulation S-X of the Securities and Exchange
Commission ( SEC ) Form 10-Q. Accordingly, they do not
include all the information and footnotes required by generally
accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements.
Therefore, these financial statements should be read in conjunction
with the Company s audited financial statements and notes
thereto for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

The
financial statements included herein are unaudited; however, they
contain all normal recurring accruals and adjustments that, in the
opinion of management, are necessary to present fairly the
Company s financial position as of the period reporting date,
and the results of its operations and cash flows for the fiscal
period end. The results of operations for the fiscal period end are
not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for future
quarters or the full fiscal year. 

FORWARD-LOOKING
STATEMENTS  

This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements
within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934. These statements involve risks and uncertainties, including,
among other things, statements regarding our business strategy,
future revenues and anticipated costs and expenses. Such
forward-looking statements include, among others, those statements
including the words  expects, 
 anticipates,   intends, 
 believes,   may,   will, 
 should,   could,   plans, 
 estimates,  and similar language or negative of such
terms. Our actual results may differ significantly from those
projected in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might
cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not
limited to, those discussed in Item 2  Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations.  You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on
the forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of
this report. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in
the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we do not know
whether we can achieve positive future results, levels of activity,
performance, or goals. Actual events or results may differ
materially. We undertake no obligation to publicly release any
revisions to the forward-looking statements or reflect events or
circumstances taking place after the date of this
document.

1.
Organization 

Mondo
Acquisition II, Inc. was incorporated in the State of Delaware on
October 30, 2006 and changed the name to Green Planet
Bioengineering Co., Ltd. ( Company ) on October 2,
2008. In October 2008, the Company acquired Elevated Throne
Overseas Ltd, incorporated in British Virgin Islands, and its
subsidiaries which was subsequently divested to One Bio, Corp
( ONE ) on April 14, 2010. 

In
March 2012, the Company became a subsidiary of Global Fund Holdings
Corp. ( Global Funds ) an Ontario, Canada
corporation. 

The
Company operates as a public organized shell corporation with the
purpose to acquire or merge with an existing business operation.
The Company s activities are subject to significant risks and
uncertainties, as their ability to implement and execute future
business plans and generate sufficient business revenue is directly
influenced by their ability to secure adequate financing or find
profitable business opportunities. 

2.
Summary of significant accounting policies 

Basis of Presentation 

The
financial statements of the Company have been prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the
United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) and are
unaudited; however, they contain all normal recurring accruals and
adjustments that, in the opinion of management, are necessary to
present fairly the Company s financial position as of the
period reporting date, and the results of its operations and cash
flows for the fiscal period end. The results of operations for the
fiscal period end are not necessarily indicative of the results to
be expected for future quarters or the full fiscal
year. 

Use of Estimates 

The
preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and
expenses for the years reported. Actual results could differ from
those estimates. Significant items that require estimates were
accruals of liabilities. 

Cash and cash equivalents 

Cash
and cash equivalents include all cash, deposits in banks and other
highly liquid investments with initial maturities of three months
or less to be cash equivalents.   Balances of cash and cash
equivalents in financial institutions may at times exceed the
government-insured limits. 

Earnings per share 

Earnings
per share is reported in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 260
  Earnings per
Share   which requires dual presentation of basic
earnings per share ( EPS ) and diluted EPS on the face
of all statements of earnings, for all entities with complex
capital structures. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution
that could occur from common shares issuable through the exercise
or conversion of stock options, restricted stock awards, warrants
and convertible securities. In certain circumstances, the
conversion of these options, warrants and convertible securities
are excluded from diluted EPS if the effect of such inclusion would
be anti-dilutive. Fully diluted EPS is not provided, when the
effect is anti-dilutive. When the effect of dilution on loss per
share is anti-dilutive, diluted loss per share equals the loss per
share .

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   
continued 

Fair Value Measurements 

FASB
ASC Topic 820,   Fair Value
Measurements and Disclosures   defines fair value,
establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with
U.S. GAAP, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.
Investment measured and reported at fair value are classified and
disclosed in one of the following hierarchy: 

Level 1
- Quoted prices are available in active markets for identical
investments as of the period reporting date. 

Level 2
- Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets,
which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the
reporting date, and fair value is determined through the use of
models or other valuation methodologies. 

Level 3
- Pricing inputs are unobservable for the investment and included
situations where there is little, if any, market activity for the
investment. The inputs into the determination of fair value require
significant management judgment or estimation. 

Recent Changes in Accounting Standards 

A
variety of proposed or otherwise potential accounting standards are
currently under study by standard-setting organizations and various
regulatory agencies. Because of the tentative and preliminary
nature of these proposed standards, management has not determined
whether implementation of such proposed standards would be material
to the Company s financial statements. 

3. Going Concern 

The
financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company
will continue as a going concern. The Company is currently a public
shell corporation and has no current business activity. The
Company s ability to continue as a going concern is dependent
on continued support from Global Funds, the majority
stockholder. 

4. Amount Due to a Related Company 

The
Company relies on a related company to advance funds to finance its
operating expenses. The amounts advanced are interest-free,
unsecured and are repayable upon demand. 

5. Preferred stock / Common stock 

Preferred stock 

The Company is authorized under its Articles of Incorporation to
issue 10,000,000 shares of Series A preferred stock with a par
value of $0.001 per share. Each share of the Company s
preferred stock provides the holder with the right to vote 1,000
votes on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders of the
Company and is convertible into 1,000 shares of the Company s
common stock. The preferred stock is non-participating and carries
no dividend. 

Common
stock 

The Company is authorized to issue 250,000,000 shares of common
stock with a par value of $0.001 per share. During the  nine
months ended September 30, 2016, the Company did not issue any
shares of common stock or warrants. 

6.
Stock-based compensation 

There
was no non-cash stock-based compensation recognized for the
 nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.

  MANAGEMENT S
DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS 

General Overview 

The
Company operates as a public reorganized corporation with the
business purpose to acquire or merge with an existing business
operation. 

Results of Operations and Financial Condition for the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2015 

The
Company had no active business operations for the periods ended
September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015. Expenses consist of
accounting, legal and filing fees. 

Liquidity and capital resources 

The
Company had no active business operations for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016. Accordingly, the Company had no liquidity and
capital resources for the period. 

Risk factors 

The
Company s critical accounting policies are still being
applied despite that the Company has no ongoing business
operations. 

Significant Estimates 

Critical
accounting polices include the areas where we have made what we
considered to be particularly subjective or complex judgments in
making estimates and where these estimates can significantly impact
our financial results under different assumptions and
conditions. 

We
prepare our financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. As
such, we are required to make certain estimates, judgments and
assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the
information available. These estimates, judgments and assumptions
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date
of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and
expenses during the periods presented. Actual results could be
different than those estimates. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 

We do
not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are
reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our
financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or
expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or
capital resources that is material to investors. 

Market Risks 

There
has been no material change in market risks since our last Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2015.

  CONTROLS
AND PROCEDURES 

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

Our
management, with the participation of our chief executive officer
and chief financial officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our
disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act), as
of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form
10-Q. 

Based
on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief
financial officer concluded that, as of the fiscal period end, our
disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable
assurance level and are effective to provide reasonable assurance
that information we are required to disclose in reports that we
file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the
SEC s rules and forms, and that such information is
accumulated and communicated to our management, including our chief
executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to
allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting 

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting
that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that have
materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
our internal control over financial reporting. 

Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and
Procedures 

In
designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures,
management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter
how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable
assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. In addition,
the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the
fact that there are resource constraints and that management is
required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of
possible controls and procedures relative to their
costs.
