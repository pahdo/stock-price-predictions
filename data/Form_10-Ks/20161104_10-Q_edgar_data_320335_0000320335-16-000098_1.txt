Note 1 Significant Accounting Policies 
  Basis of Presentation:   The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements of Torchmark Corporation (Torchmark or alternatively, the Company) have been prepared in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q. Therefore, they do not include all of the annual disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). However, in the opinion of management, these statements include all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, which are necessary for a fair presentation of the condensed consolidated financial position at   September 30, 2016  , and the condensed consolidated results of operations, comprehensive income, and cash flows for the periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . The interim period condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the   Consolidated Financial Statements   that are included in the Form 10-K filed with the Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) on February 26, 2016. 
   
  Note 2 New Accounting Standards 
    
  Accounting Pronouncements Adopted 
    
  ASU 2014-15  : In August 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-15,   Presentation of Financial Statements Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40)  . This accounting standard requires management to perform interim and annual assessments of the entity's ability to continue its business operations within one year of the date of issuance of its financial statements. The Company must then provide certain disclosure if there is substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern. As of January 1, 2016, the Company adopted this standard with no impact to the financial statements. 
  ASU 2016-09  : In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09,   Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting   to simplify certain aspects of accounting for share-based payment award transactions including: (a) income tax consequences; (b) classification in the statement of cash flows; and (c) accounting for forfeitures. Torchmark elected to early adopt this standard as of January 1, 2016, as permitted. This new accounting standard primarily affects Torchmark's computations of net income and diluted shares outstanding and thus earnings per share. 
    
  While the intent of the adoption of this guidance is simplification, inherent changes in future share prices and volume of stock option exercises are expected to result in increased volatility in net income and earnings per share in future periods. As provided by the new standard, the adoption is prospective and thus will impact only 2016 and future periods. 
    
  Below is a listing of the effects of the adoption of this guidance: 
             
    Condensed consolidated statement of operations: For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company recorded   $7 million   in excess tax benefits as a component of income taxes, which resulted in an increase in net income as compared with the three months ended   September 30, 2015   when the excess tax benefits of   $5 million   were recorded as a component of additional paid-in capital on the balance sheet. For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company recorded   $14 million   in excess tax benefits as a component of income taxes as compared with   $16 million   recorded as a component of additional paid-in-capital on the balance sheet for the same period in the prior year. 
                
    Weighted average diluted shares: The weighted average diluted shares outstanding were adjusted to exclude excess tax benefits from the assumed proceeds in the diluted shares calculation. This change resulted in diluted weighted average shares outstanding of   121.9 million   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , as compared with   121.1 million   under the previous guidance. For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the weighted average diluted shares outstanding were   122.7 million   as compared with   121.9 million   under the previous guidance.

  (Dollar amounts in thousands except per share data) 
    
  Note 2 New Accounting Standards (continued) 

Condensed consolidated statement of cash flows: The excess tax benefits related to share-based payments of   $14 million   were presented as a component of operating activities in the same manner as other cash flows related to income taxes. In prior years, the excess tax benefits of   $16 million   were presented within financing activities.  
     Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted 
  ASU 2016-02:   In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842),   which requires all lessees to report a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for most leases. For lessors, the standard modifies the classification criteria and the accounting for sales-type and direct financing leases. The standard will become effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2019 and will require recognizing and measuring leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the standard to determine its impact. 
  ASU 2016-13:   In June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13,   Financial Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments   to provide financial statement users with more decision-useful information about the expected credit losses on financial instruments as well as to change the loss impairment methodology for available-for-sale debt securities. This standard will become effective on January 1, 2020. The applicable section of the standard related to debt securities requires a prospective transition. The Company does not expect the adoption to have a significant impact on the financial statements. 
  ASU 2016-15:   In August 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows: Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments   to provide uniformity in the classification of cash receipts and payments recorded in the statement of cash flows including debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs, settlement of zero-coupon bonds, and proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims. This standard will become effective on January 1, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the standard to determine its impact.

Other-Than-Temporary Impairments: 
    
  Based on the Company's evaluation of its fixed maturities available for sale in an unrealized loss position in accordance with the other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI) policy, the Company concluded that there were   no   other-than-temporary impairments during the three or   nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
    
  As of quarter end, previously written down securities remaining in the portfolio were carried at a fair value of   $55 million  , or less than   1%   of the fair value of the fixed maturity available for sale portfolio. Torchmark is continuously monitoring the market conditions impacting its portfolio. Additionally, Torchmark has the ability and intent to hold these investments to recovery, and does not expect to be required to sell any of its securities. 
    
  Unrealized Loss Analysis: 
    
  The following table discloses information about fixed maturities available for sale in an unrealized loss position. 

Torchmark s entire fixed maturity portfolio consisted of   1,555   issues at   September 30, 2016   and   1,565   issues at   December 31, 2015  . The weighted average quality rating of all unrealized loss positions as of   September 30, 2016   was   BB+  .

Note 5 Discontinued Operations 
    
  At December 31, 2015, Torchmark met the criteria to account for its Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Plan business as a discontinued operation. Historically, the business was a reportable segment. Effective July 1, 2016, Torchmark sold its Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Plan business to SilverScript Insurance Company, a subsidiary of CVS Health Corporation (collectively, the "Buyer"). Management believes this sale allows the Company to better focus on its core protection life and health insurance businesses, and provide additional capital. 
    
  The initial purchase price was based on the number of enrollees as of the end of the second quarter and will be adjusted based on the number of enrollees as of January 1, 2017 as determined by the Center for Medicare Services (CMS) in March 2017. Our current estimate of the ultimate net proceeds to be realized from the sale, net of the contingent consideration of   $4.8 million   and the write-off of the   $16 million   of deferred acquisition costs related to the Medicare Part D business, resulted in a gain of   $613 thousand   (  $399 thousand  , net of tax) being recognized in income from discontinued operations as of   September 30, 2016  .  
    
  Torchmark has retained certain assets and liabilities related to the Medicare Part D business including all corresponding profits or losses for the 2016 plan year. The Buyer has assumed the rights and obligations related to the business for all subsequent plan years. To ensure an orderly transition, Torchmark will administer the plans for the remainder of 2016, and the Buyer will be responsible for administration of the plans beginning in 2017. The remaining assets and liabilities reflected on the Torchmark balance sheet related to discontinued operations are receivables and payables  associated with 2016 and 2015 plan years that are expected to be settled in the ordinary course of business during 2016 and 2017.  
    
  The net assets related to discontinued operations at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   were as follows: 

(1)  At   September 30, 2016  , receivables included   $228 million   from Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and   $9 million   from drug manufacturer rebates. At   December 31, 2015  , the comparable amounts were   $193 million   and   $95 million  , respectively.  
  (2)  Balance includes   $4.8 million   contingent purchase price reserve for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  .

Note 6 Income Taxes 
    
  The effective income tax differed from the expected   35%   rate as shown below: 

The effective income tax rates for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   differed from the effective income tax rates for the same periods ended   September 30, 2015   primarily as a result of the Company adopting ASU 2016-09 as of January 1, 2016. As a result of the adoption, the excess tax benefits related to share-based awards are now recorded through income tax expense rather than additional paid-in capital. See    Note 2 New Accounting Standards    for further discussion.

Note 7 Debt Transactions 
    
  Issuance of long term debt.    On April 5, 2016, Torchmark completed the issuance and sale of   $300 million   in aggregate principal of Torchmark s   6.125%   Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2056. The debentures were sold pursuant to Torchmark s shelf registration statement on Form S-3, filed September 25, 2015. The net proceeds from the sale of the debentures were   $290 million  , after giving effect to the underwriting discount and estimated expenses of the offering of the debentures. Torchmark used the net proceeds from the offering of the debentures to repay the   $250 million   outstanding principal, plus accrued interest of   $8 million  , on the   6.375%   Senior Notes that were due June 15, 2016.   The remaining proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, including capital or other financing at our insurance subsidiaries, if necessary.

On May 17, 2016, Torchmark amended its credit facility to include, as a part of the facility, the issuance of a   $100 million   term loan and to extend the maturity date of the entire credit facility to May 2021. The term loan will be repaid on a redemption schedule which provides for quarterly installments that escalate each annual period with a balloon payment of   $75 million   due in May 2021. Interest is computed and paid monthly at   125   basis points plus 1 month LIBOR. In accordance with the agreement, Torchmark is subject to certain covenants regarding capitalization. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company was in full compliance with these covenants.

The following table presents assets at fair value for the defined-benefit pension plans at   September 30, 2016   and the prior-year end. 
  Pension Assets by Component 

The liability for the funded defined-benefit pension plans was   $416 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   $406 million   at   December 31, 2015  . During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company made   $12 million   in cash contributions to the qualified pension plans. Torchmark expects to make total cash contributions to these plans during   2016   in an amount not to exceed   $20 million  . With respect to the Company s non-qualified supplemental retirement plan, life insurance policies on the lives of plan participants have been established with an unaffiliated carrier to fund a portion of the Company s obligations under the plan. These policies and investments deposited with an unaffiliated trustee were previously placed in a Rabbi Trust to provide for payment of the plan obligations. At   September 30, 2016  , the combined value of the insurance policies and investments in the Rabbi Trust to support plan liabilities were   $87 million  , compared with   $79 million   at year end   2015  . Since this plan is non-qualified, the values of the insurance policies and investments are recorded as   Other assets   in the   Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets   and are not included in the chart of plan assets above. The liability for the non-qualified pension plan was   $69 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   $67 million   at   December 31, 2015  . 

Note 9 Earnings Per Share 
  A reconciliation of basic and diluted weighted-average shares outstanding is as follows: 

As discussed earlier in    Note 2 New Accounting Standards   , the Company adopted ASU 2016-09 on January 1, 2016. The adoption resulted in an adjustment to the weighted average diluted shares outstanding to exclude excess tax benefits from the assumed proceeds in the diluted shares calculation.

Note 10 Business Segments 
  Torchmark's reportable segments are based on the insurance product lines it markets and administers: life insurance, health insurance, and annuities. These major product lines are set out as reportable segments because of the common characteristics of products within these categories, comparability of margins, and the similarity in regulatory environment and management techniques. Torchmark's chief operating decision makers evaluate the overall performance of the operations of the Company in accordance with these segments. 
  Annuity revenue is classified as  Other premium.  Management s measure of profitability for each insurance segment is insurance underwriting margin, which is underwriting income before other income and insurance administrative expenses. It represents the profit margin on insurance products before administrative expenses, and is calculated by deducting net policy obligations (claims incurred and change in reserves), commissions and other acquisition expenses from premium revenue. Torchmark further views the profitability of each insurance product segment by the marketing groups that distribute the products of that segment: direct response, independent agencies, or captive agencies. 
  Torchmark s management prefers to evaluate the performance of its underwriting and investment activities separately, rather than allocating investment income to the underwriting results. As such, the investment function is presented as a stand-alone segment. The investment segment includes the management of the investment portfolio, debt, and cash flow. Management s measure of profitability for this segment is excess investment income, which is the income earned on the investment portfolio less the required interest on net policy liabilities and financing costs. Financing costs include the interest on Torchmark s debt. Other income and insurance administrative expense are classified in a separate Other segment. 
  The majority of the Company s required interest on net policy liabilities (benefit reserves less the deferred acquisition cost asset) is not credited to policyholder accounts. Instead, it is an actuarial assumption for discounting cash flows in the computation of benefit reserves and the amortization of the deferred acquisition cost asset. Investment income required to fund the required interest on net policy liabilities is removed from the investment segment and applied to the insurance segments to eliminate the effect of the required interest from the insurance segments.  As a result, the investment segment measures net investment income against the required interest on net policy liabilities and financing costs, while the insurance segments simply measure premiums against benefits and expenses. We believe this presentation facilitates a more meaningful analysis of the Company s underwriting and investment performance as the underwriting results are based on premiums, claims, and expenses and are not affected by unanticipated fluctuations in investment yields. 
    
  As noted, Torchmark s  core operations  are insurance and investment management. The insurance segments issue policies for which premiums are collected for the eventual payment of policy benefits. In addition to policy benefits, operating expenses are incurred including acquisition costs, administrative expenses, and taxes. Because life and health contracts can be long term, premium receipts in excess of current expenses are invested. Investment activities, conducted by the investment segment, focus on seeking quality investments with a yield and term appropriate to support the insurance product obligations. These investments generally consist of fixed maturities, and, over the long term, the expected yields are taken into account when setting insurance premium rates and product profitability expectations. As a result, fixed maturities are generally held for long periods to support the liabilities, and Torchmark generally expects to hold investments until maturity. Dispositions of investments occur from time to time, generally for reasons such as credit concerns, calls by issuers, or other factors. 
    
  Dispositions are sometimes required in order to maintain the Company s investment policies and objectives. Investments are also occasionally written down as a result of other-than-temporary impairment, as discussed in    Note 4 Investments   . Torchmark does not actively trade investments. As a result, realized gains and losses from the disposition and write down of investments are generally incidental to operations and are not considered a material factor in insurance pricing or product profitability. While from time to time these realized gains and losses could be significant to net income in the period in which they occur, they generally have a limited effect on the yield of the total investment portfolio. Further, because the proceeds of the disposals are reinvested in the portfolio, the disposals have little effect on the size of the portfolio and the income from the reinvestments is included in net investment income. Therefore, management removes realized investment gains and losses from results of core operations when evaluating

the performance of the Company. For this reason, these gains and losses are excluded from Torchmark s operating segments. 
  Torchmark accounts for its stock options and restricted stock under current accounting guidance requiring stock options and stock grants to be expensed based on fair value at the time of grant. Management considers stock compensation expense to be an expense of the Parent Company. Therefore, stock compensation expense is treated as a corporate expense in Torchmark s segment analysis.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
   
  Results of Operations 
  Summary of Operations  . Torchmark s operations are segmented into its insurance underwriting and investment operations as described in    Note 10 Business Segments   . The measures of profitability described in    Note 10 Business Segments    are useful in evaluating the performance of the segments and the marketing groups within each insurance segment because each of our distribution channels operates in a niche market. Insurance underwriting margin consists of premium less policy obligations, commissions and other acquisition expenses. These measures enable management to view period-to-period trends, and to make informed decisions regarding future courses of action. 
  The tables in    Note 10 Business Segments    demonstrate how the measures of profitability are determined. Those tables also reconcile our revenues and expenses by segment to major income statement line items for the three month and   nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . Additionally, a table in that note,   Analysis of Profitability by Segment  , provides a summary of the profitability measures that demonstrates year-to-year comparability and reconciles those measures to our net income. That summary represents our overall operations in the manner that management views the business, and is a basis of the following highlights discussion. 
  A discussion of operations by each segment follows later in this report. These discussions compare the first   nine   months of   2016   with the same period of   2015  , unless otherwise noted  .   The following discussions are presented in the manner we view our operations, as described in    Note 10 Business Segments   . 
  Highlights, comparing the first   nine   months of   2016   with the first   nine   months of   2015  .   Net income per diluted common share   increased     9%   to   $3.38   from   $3.09  . The increase is primarily attributed to the adoption of ASU 2016-09 as described in    Note 2 New Accounting Standards   . Included in net income were after-tax realized   gains   of   $5 million   in both   2016     and     2015  . Realized gains and losses are presented more fully under the caption   Realized Gains and Losses   in this report. 
  We use three statistical measures as indicators of future premium growth:  annualized premium in force", "net sales", and  first-year collected premium.  Annualized premium in force is defined as the premium income that would be received over the following twelve months at any given date on all active policies if those policies remain in force throughout the twelve month period. Annualized premium in force is an indicator of potential growth in premium revenue. Net sales is defined as annualized premium issued, net of cancellations in the first thirty days after issue, except for Globe Life Direct Response, where net sales is annualized premium issued at the time the first full premium is paid after any introductory offer has expired. Annualized premium issued is the gross premium that would be received during the policies  first year in force, assuming that none of the policies lapsed or terminated. Although lapses and terminations will occur, we believe that net sales is a useful indicator of the rate of acceleration of premium growth. First-year collected premium is the premium collected during the reporting period for all policies in their first policy year. First-year collected premium takes lapses into account in the first policy year when lapses are more likely to occur, and thus is a useful indicator of how much new premium is expected to be added to premium income in the future. 
  Total premium income   rose     5%   in   2016   to   $2.3 billion  . Total net sales   increased   slightly to   $411 million  , when compared with the same period in   2015  . First-year collected premium was   $340 million   for the   2016   period, compared with   $342 million   for the   2015   period.  
  Life insurance premium income   grew     6%   to   $1.6 billion  . Life net sales   were flat at     $313 million   when compared with the same period in   2015  . First-year collected life premium   grew     5%   during the first   nine   months of   2016   to   $236 million   over the same period in   2015  . Life underwriting margin as a percentage of premium was   down   to   26%   from   27%   as a result of higher than expected Globe Life Direct Response policy obligations. Underwriting income increased   1%   to   $431 million   for the first   nine   months of   2016  , compared with   $425 million   for the same period in   2015  . 
  Health insurance premium income   increased     3%   to   $710 million   over the prior year total of   $690 million  . Health net sales   rose     1%   to   $98 million   for the   nine   month period. First-year collected health premium   fell     11%   to   $104 million  ,   as a result of a high level of group sales in the third and fourth quarters of 2014 that positively affected the 2015 first-year collected premium.   Health margins   were flat   at   22%  , with underwriting income of   $157 million   for the first   nine   months of   2016  . 
  Insurance administrative expenses   were up     5.4%   in   2016   when compared with the prior year period, but   remained flat   as a percentage of premium at   6.2%  .   The increase in administrative expenses is primarily due to investments in

information technology that will enhance our customer experience, improve our data analytic capabilities, improve our agility for future changes and bolster our information security programs. 
  Excess investment income is defined as net investment income less the required interest on net policy liabilities and the interest cost associated with capital funding or  financing costs . Excess investment income per diluted common share is an important measure to management; refer to the   Excess Investment Income   section for further details. Excess investment income   increased     4%   in   2016   to   $1.35   from   $1.30  , while the dollar amount of excess investment income   was flat at     $166 million  . The increase in per share excess investment income resulted from share purchases over the period, as discussed later in this report. Net investment income   rose     $22 million   or   4%   to   $601 million   in   2016  , below the   5%   growth in our average investment portfolio at amortized cost. The average effective yield on the fixed maturity portfolio, which represented   96%   of our investments at amortized cost,   decreased   to   5.80%   in the   2016   period from   5.84%   in the prior period. Required interest   rose     4%   or   $16 million   to   $373 million  , in line with the growth in average net policy liabilities. Financing costs   increased     9%   to     $63 million  . Please refer to the discussion under   Capital Resources   for more information on debt and interest expense. 
  In the first   nine   months of   2016  , we invested new money in our fixed maturity portfolio at an effective annual yield of   4.73%  , compared with   4.71%   in the same period of   2015  . New investments were made with an average rating of   BBB+   and an average life to maturity of   twenty-five   years. Approximately   95%   of the fixed-maturity portfolio at amortized cost was investment grade at   September 30, 2016  . Cash and short-term investments were   $171 million   at that date, compared with   $116 million   at   December 31, 2015  . 
  The net unrealized gain position in our fixed maturity portfolio   grew   from   $506 million   at   December 31, 2015   to   $1.9 billion   during the first   nine   months of   2016  , primarily due to a decrease in Treasury rates during   2016  . The fixed maturity portfolio contains no commercial mortgage-backed securities. We have no direct investments in residential mortgages, nor are we a party to any derivative contracts, including credit default swaps or interest rate swaps. We do not participate in securities lending and we have no off-balance sheet investments. 
   
  We have an on-going share repurchase program which began in 1986 which is reviewed quarterly and is reaffirmed by the Board of Directors on an annual basis. The program was reaffirmed on August 4, 2016. With no specified authorization amount, we determine the amount of repurchases based on the amount of our excess cash flow, general market conditions, and other alternative uses. These purchases are made at the Parent Company with excess cash flow. Excess cash flow is primarily made up of cash received from the insurance subsidiaries less dividends paid to shareholders and interest paid. See further discussion in the   Capital Resources   section below. Share purchases are also made with the proceeds from option exercises by current and former employees in order to reduce dilution. The following chart summarizes share purchases for the   nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  .

The   American Income Exclusive Agency   has historically marketed primarily to members of labor unions. While labor unions are still the core market for this agency, American Income has diversified in recent years by focusing heavily on other affinity groups and referrals to help ensure sustainable growth. The life business of this agency is Torchmark s highest margin life business and it is the   largest   contributor to life premium of any distribution channel at   41%   of Torchmark s total. This group produced premium income of   $678 million  ,   an increase of     10%  . First-year collected premium was   $130 million  ,   an increase of     12%  . Net sales   rose     7%   to   $158 million  . Sales growth in our captive agencies is generally dependent on growth in the size of the agency force. The American Income Agency's average agent count   increased     1%   to   6,603   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared with   6,508   for the same period in   2015  . The average agent count is based on the actual count at the end of each week during the period. Sales increased at a greater rate than agent count due to increased agent productivity. The American Income Agency has been focusing on growing and strengthening agents who train and recruit in order to support sustainable growth of the agency force. To accomplish this, they have placed an increased emphasis on agent training programs and financial incentives that appropriately reward agents at all levels for helping develop and train personnel. The agency continues to provide more home-office and webinar training programs. These programs are designed to provide each agent, from new recruits to top level agents, coaching and instruction specifically designed for each individual s level of experience and responsibility. 
  The   Globe Life Direct Response Unit   offers adult and juvenile life insurance through a variety of direct-to-consumer marketing approaches, which include direct mailings, insert media, and electronic media. These different approaches support and complement one another in the unit s efforts to reach the consumer. The Globe Life Direct Response channel s growth over the years has been fueled by constant innovation. In recent years, electronic media production has grown rapidly as management has aggressively increased marketing activities related to internet and mobile technology, and has focused on driving traffic to the inbound call center. We continually introduce new initiatives in this unit in an attempt to increase response rates. 
  While the juvenile market is an important source of sales, it also is a vehicle to reach the parents and grandparents of juvenile policyholders, who are more likely to respond favorably to a Globe Life Direct Response solicitation for life coverage on themselves than is the general adult population. Also, both juvenile policyholders and their parents are low acquisition-cost targets for sales of additional coverage over time. 
  Globe Life Direct Response s life premium income   rose     5%   to   $591 million  , representing   36%   of Torchmark s total life premium in the first   nine   months of   2016  . Net sales of   $116 million   for this group   decreased     9%  . The sales decline was expected as we have shifted our marketing efforts away from certain segments that no longer meet our profit objectives. First-year collected premium   decreased     6%   to   $76 million  . 
  The   Liberty National Exclusive Agency   markets individual and group life insurance to middle-income customers. Life premium income for this agency was   $203 million   in the first   nine   months of   2016   compared with   $204 million   for the same period in   2015  . First-year collected premium   increased     5%   to   $22 million  . 
  Net sales for the Liberty National Agency   increased     11%   to   $30 million  . This is the largest percentage increase of any of Torchmark's distributions channels. The Liberty National average agent count   increased     10%   to   1,693   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared with   1,533   for the same period in   2015  . We continue to execute our long term plan to grow this agency through expansion from small town markets in the southeast to more densely populated areas with larger pools of potential agent recruits and customers. Expansion of this agency s presence into more heavily populated, less-penetrated areas will help create long term agency growth. Additionally, our prospecting training program has helped to improve the ability of agents to develop new worksite marketing business. 
  The   Other Agencies   distribution channels primarily include independent agencies selling predominantly life insurance. The Other Agencies contributed   $167 million   of life premium income, or   10%   of Torchmark s total in the first   nine   months of   2016  , but contributed only   3%   of net sales for the period.

Life insurance underwriting income before insurance administrative expense was   $431 million   in the first   nine   months of   2016  , compared with   $425 million   for the same period in   2015  . As a percentage of premium, underwriting margins declined to   26%   from   27%  . The decrease in underwriting margin as a percentage of premium was due to higher Globe Life Direct Response net policy obligations. The higher than anticipated net policy obligations in the Globe Life Direct Response Unit primarily relate to policies issued since 2011. The increase is primarily attributed to a spike in claims in certain segments as well as policies where additional prescription drug information was used in the underwriting process in order to improve the overall mortality. To date, improvements in actual mortality have been less than expected, causing higher than expected net policy obligations. 
   
  Health insurance, comparing the first   nine   months of   2016   with the first   nine   months of   2015  .   Health insurance sold by Torchmark includes primarily Medicare Supplement insurance, critical illness coverage, accident coverage, and other limited-benefit supplemental health products. In this analysis, all health coverage plans other than Medicare Supplement are classified as limited-benefit plans. 
  Health premium accounted for   30%   of our total premium in the   2016   period. Health underwriting margin accounted for   26%   of total underwriting margin, reflective of the lower underwriting margin as a percentage of premium for health compared with life insurance. As noted under the caption   Life Insurance  , we have emphasized life insurance sales relative to health, due to life s superior profitability and its greater contribution to excess investment income. 
    
  Health premium   increased     3%   to   $710 million   in the   2016   period. Medicare Supplement premium   increased     2%   to   $355 million  , while other limited-benefit health premium   increased     3%   to   $355 million  .  
  Health net sales   increased     1%   to   $98 million  . Medicare Supplement net sales   decreased     3%   to   $35 million   in   2016  .  Limited-benefit net sales   increased     4%   to   $63 million  . Health first-year collected premium   fell     11%   to   $104 million     as a result of a high level of group sales in the third and fourth quarters of 2014 that positively affected the 2015 first-year collected premium.   Group sales can vary significantly from period to period.

A discussion of health operations by distribution channel follows: 
  The   UA Independent Agency   consists of independent agencies appointed with Torchmark who may also sell for other companies. The UA Independent Agency was Torchmark s   largest   health agency in terms of health premium income. Premium income was   $266 million  , representing   38%   of Torchmark s total health premium. Net sales were   $32 million  , or   33%   of Torchmark s health sales. This agency primarily produces Medicare Supplement insurance, with Medicare Supplement premium income of   $257 million  . The UA Independent Agency represents approximately   72%   of all Torchmark Medicare Supplement premium and   90%   of Medicare Supplement net sales. Medicare Supplement premium in this agency   rose     5%  . Total health premium   increased     4%  . Net sales of the Medicare Supplement product   decreased     4%   in   2016  ; individual sales   were up     9%  , but group sales   declined     30%  . As noted earlier, Group Medicare Supplement sales have historically fluctuated from period to period. 
  The   Family Heritage Agency   primarily markets limited-benefit supplemental health insurance in non-urban areas. Most of their policies include a cash-back feature, such as a return of premium whereby any excess of premiums over claims paid is returned to the policyholder at the end of a specified period stated within the insurance policy. Management expects to grow this agency by continuing the incorporation of Torchmark s recruiting programs. The Family Heritage Agency contributed   $38 million   in net sales in the   nine   months of   2016   and   2015  . Health premium income was   $176 million   for the   nine   month period of   2016  , representing   25%   of Torchmark s health premium compared with   $164 million   or   24%   of health premium in the prior year period. The average agent count was   915   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared with   883   for the same period in   2015  ,   an increase of     4%  .

The   Liberty National Exclusive Agency   represented   21%   of all Torchmark health premium income at   $152 million   in the   nine   months of   2016  . The Liberty Agency markets limited-benefit health supplemental products consisting primarily of critical illness insurance. Much of Liberty s health business is now generated through worksite marketing targeting small businesses of 10 to 25 employees. In   2016  , health premium income in the Liberty Agency   declined     $6 million   to   $152 million   from prior year premium. Liberty s health premium decline has been due primarily to its declining Medicare Supplement block. 
  Other distribution  . Certain of our other distribution channels market health products, although their main emphasis is on life insurance. On a combined basis, they accounted for   16%   of health premium in the   2016   period. The American Income Exclusive Agency primarily markets accident plans. The Direct Response unit markets primarily Medicare Supplements to employer or union-sponsored groups. Direct Response added   $4 million   of Medicare Supplement net sales in   2016  .

Underwriting income for health insurance totaled   $157 million   in   2016  ,   an increase of   2%   when compared with the same period in   2015  . As a percentage of health premium, underwriting margins were flat for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   at   22%   when compared with the same period in   2015  .

Operating expenses, comparing the first   nine   months of   2016   with the first   nine   months of   2015  .   Operating expenses consist of insurance administrative expenses and parent company expenses. Also included is stock compensation expense, which is viewed by us as a parent company expense. Insurance administrative expenses relate to premium income for a given period; therefore, we measure those expenses as a percentage of premium income. Total expenses are measured as a percentage of total revenues. An analysis of operating expenses is shown below. 
    
  Operating Expenses Selected Information 
  (Dollar amounts in thousands)   

  Insurance administrative expenses were   up     5.4%   in   2016   when compared with the prior year period. As a percentage of total premium, insurance administrative expenses were   6.2%   in both   2016   and 2015. Total operating expenses   increased     3.6%  .   The increase in administrative expenses is primarily due to investments in information technology that will enhance our customer experience, improve our data analytic capabilities, improve our agility for future changes and bolster our information security programs.   The decline in stock compensation expense was primarily due to lower expense associated with equity awards. 
   
  Investments (excess investment income), comparing the first   nine   months of   2016   with the first   nine   months of   2015  .   We manage our capital resources including investments, debt, and cash flow through the investment segment. Excess investment income represents the profit margin attributable to investment operations. It is the measure that we use to evaluate the performance of the investment segment as described in    Note 10 Business Segments    in the   Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.   It is defined as net investment income less the required interest on net policy liabilities and the interest cost associated with capital funding or  financing costs.  
  We also view excess investment income per diluted common share as an important and useful measure to evaluate the performance of the investment segment. It is defined as excess investment income divided by the total diluted weighted average shares outstanding, representing the contribution by the investment segment to the consolidated earnings per share of the Company. Since implementing our share repurchase program in 1986, we have used   $6.7 billion   of cash flow to repurchase Torchmark shares (average split-adjusted price per diluted common share of $  15.34  ) after determining that the repurchases provided a greater return than other investment alternatives. Share repurchases reduce excess investment income because of the foregone earnings on the cash that would otherwise have been invested in interest-bearing assets, but they also reduce the number of shares outstanding. In order to put all capital  
  
   36 

     Table of Contents  

resource uses on a comparable basis, we believe that excess investment income per diluted share is an appropriate measure of the investment segment. 
  The following table summarizes Torchmark s investment income, excess investment income, and excess investment income per diluted share. 
  Excess Investment Income 
  (Dollar amounts in thousands) 

(1)  Net of deferred acquisition costs, excluding the attributed unrealized gains and losses thereon. 
    
  Excess investment income   is defined as net investment income less both the required interest attributable to net policy liabilities and the interest on debt. For the   2016   period, excess investment income   was flat at     $166 million   when compared with the same period in   2015  . On a per common share basis, excess investment income   increased     4%   as a result of our share repurchase program. Excess investment income has been negatively impacted during recent years by low interest rates and the turnover of higher yielding assets in the portfolio. It has also been negatively affected by certain aspects of our Medicare Part D business as discussed below and because of the additional interest costs resulting from the issuance of the new 6.125% Junior Subordinated debt security prior to the maturity of the 6.375% Senior Notes as discussed below. Absent the additional financing costs incurred from the debt security, excess investment income would have increased by 2% over the same period in 2015, or 6% on a per share basis. 
  Net investment income     rose     $22 million   or   4%   in   2016  ,   below   the   5%   increase in average invested assets (with fixed maturities at amortized cost) over the same period last year. The effective annual yield on the fixed maturity portfolio was   5.80%   in the first   nine   months of   2016  , compared with   5.84%   a year earlier. The reduction in the average portfolio yield rate was primarily a result of lower new money yield rates available and reinvesting proceeds from bonds that were called in   2016   at yield rates less than the rates we earned on the bonds before they were called. We currently expect that the average turnover of fixed maturity assets during the next five years will not exceed 1% to 2% of the portfolio and that this turnover will not have a material negative impact on investment income. 
  Net investment income has also been negatively affected in   2016   by the CMS requirement for us to cover Medicare Part D claim costs in the current period that are ultimately the responsibility of the government, but are not reimbursed until the following year. We incurred extensive upfront costs in 2015 that will not be reimbursed by CMS until November   2016  . We also experience delays from the time certain claims are paid until related drug rebates are received from various pharmaceutical companies. These delays cause a lag in the timing of investable cash flows that result in lower investment income than would have been earned absent the delays. We expect cash flows to improve in the latter part of 2016 and in 2017 as these receivables are collected. 
  Should interest rates rise, especially long-term rates, Torchmark's net investment income would benefit due to higher interest rates on new purchases. We could withstand an increase in interest rates of approximately 100 to 105 basis points before the net unrealized gains on our fixed maturity portfolio as of   September 30, 2016   would be eliminated (assuming there were no credit related valuation declines). Should interest rates increase further than that, we would  
  
   37 

     Table of Contents  

not be concerned with potential interest rate driven unrealized losses in our fixed maturity portfolio because we have the intent and, more importantly, the ability to hold our fixed maturities to maturity. 
  Required interest on net insurance policy liabilities     r  educes net investment income as it is the amount of net investment income considered by management necessary to  fund  the required interest included in the insurance segments.  As such, it is removed from the investment segment and applied to the insurance segments to offset the effect of the interest required by the insurance segments. As discussed in    Note 10 Business Segments   ,   management believes this provides a more meaningful analysis of the investment and insurance segments. Required interest is based on the actuarial interest assumptions used in discounting the benefit reserve liability and the amortization of deferred acquisition costs for our insurance policies in force. The great majority of our life and health insurance policies are fixed interest-rate protection policies, not investment products, and are accounted for under current accounting guidance for long-duration insurance products which mandates that interest rate assumptions for a particular block of business be  locked in  for the life of that block of business. Each calendar year, we set the discount rate to be used to calculate the benefit reserve liability and the amortization of the deferred acquisition cost asset for all insurance policies issued that year. That rate is based on the new money yields that we expect to earn on cash flow received in the future from policies of that issue year, and cannot be changed. The discount rate used for policies issued in the current year has no impact on the in force policies issued in prior years as the rates of all prior issue years are also locked in. As such, the overall discount rate for the entire in force block is a weighted average of the discount rates being used from all issue years. Changes in the overall weighted-average discount rate over time are caused by changes in the mix of the reserves and the deferred acquisition cost asset by issue year on the entire block of in force business. Business issued in the current year has very little impact on the overall weighted-average discount rate due to the size of our in force business. 
  Required interest on net insurance policy liabilities   increased     $16 million   or   4%   to   $373 million  , in line with the growth in average net interest-bearing insurance policy liabilities. 
  Financing costs   on our debt   increased     9%   to   $63 million   from   $57 million   for the same period in 2015. The additional interest expense resulted primarily from the issuance of our new 6.125% Junior Subordinated Debt security seventy days before the maturity and repayment of our 6.375% Senior Notes. More information concerning debt can be found in the   Capital Resources   section of this report.

Investments (acquisitions), comparing the first   nine   months of   2016   with the first   nine   months of   2015  .   Torchmark s investment policy calls for investing in fixed maturities that are investment grade and meet our quality and yield objectives. We generally prefer to invest in securities with longer maturities because they more closely match the long-term nature of our policy liabilities. We believe this strategy is appropriate because our cash flows from operations and invested assets are positive, stable and predictable. If longer-term securities that meet our quality and yield objectives are not available, we do not relax our quality objectives, but instead, consider investing in shorter or lower yielding securities, taking into consideration the slope of the yield curve and other factors. 
  The following table summarizes selected information for fixed maturity purchases. The effective annual yield shown is the yield calculated to the  worst call date.  For non-callable bonds, the worst-call date is always the maturity date. For callable bonds, the worst-call date is the call date that produces the lowest yield (or the maturity date, if the yield calculated to the maturity date is lower than the yield calculated to each call date).

(1) Total fixed maturity acquisitions include   $15.7 million   of unsettled trades. 
  (2) One-year compounded yield on a tax-equivalent basis. The yield on tax-exempt securities is adjusted to produce a yield equivalent to the pretax yield on taxable securities. 
  Acquisitions in both periods consisted primarily of corporate bonds, with securities spanning a diversified range of issuers, industry sectors, and geographical regions. All of the acquired securities were investment grade. 
  Investments (portfolio composition).   The composition of the investment portfolio at book value on   September 30, 2016   was as follows: 
  Invested Assets At   September 30, 2016    
  (Dollar amounts in thousands) 

Approximately   96%   of our investments at book value are in a diversified fixed-maturity portfolio. Policy loans, which are secured by policy cash values, make up approximately   3%   of our investments. We also have insignificant investments in other long-term investments. As fixed maturities represent such a significant portion of our investment portfolio, the remainder of the discussion of portfolio composition will focus on fixed maturities.

At   September 30, 2016  , fixed maturities had a fair value of   $15.8 billion  , compared with   $13.8 billion   at   December 31, 2015  . The net unrealized gain position in the fixed-maturity portfolio increased from   $506 million   at   December 31, 2015   to   $1.9 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , primarily as a result of a decrease in Treasury rates. The   September 30, 2016   net unrealized gain consisted of gross unrealized gains of   $2.0 billion   offset by   $120 million   of gross unrealized losses, compared with the   December 31, 2015   net unrealized gain which consisted of a gross unrealized gain of   $1.1 billion   and a gross unrealized loss of   $564 million  . 
  Corporate securities, which consist of bonds and redeemable preferred stocks, were the largest component of the fixed maturity portfolio, representing 88% at both amortized cost and fair value. The remainder of the portfolio is invested primarily in securities issued by the U.S. government and U.S. municipalities. The Company holds insignificant amounts in foreign government bonds, collateralized debt obligations, asset-backed securities, and agency mortgage-backed securities. Corporate securities are diversified over a variety of industry sectors and issuers. At   September 30, 2016  , the financial, utility, and energy sectors represented approximately 24%, 14%, and 11%, respectively, of fixed maturities at amortized cost and 24%, 15%, and 10%, respectively, of fixed maturities at fair value. Otherwise, no single sector represented more than 10% of the corporate fixed maturity portfolio at either amortized cost or fair value. The total fixed maturity portfolio consists of 577 issuers, with 206 issuers within the financial, utility, and energy sectors. 
    
  The net unrealized gain of the fixed maturity portfolio increased $1.4 billion from   December 31, 2015  . The financial, utility, energy and basic materials sectors experienced increases of $156 million, $197 million, $256 million, and $180 million, respectively, in net unrealized gains from     December 31, 2015   to   September 30, 2016  .  The fair values of the financial, utility, energy, and basic materials sectors increased approximately 7%, 8%, 18%, and 21%, respectively, while the fair value of the entire portfolio increased 15% for the period. Over the last two quarters, oil and many other commodity prices have increased meaningfully to the benefit of our holdings in the energy and basic materials sectors.  While a sustained period of low prices might lead to some downgrades in ratings, we do not currently anticipate any losses from defaults or write-downs in the foreseeable future. 
  An analysis of the fixed maturity portfolio at   September 30, 2016   by a composite quality rating is shown in the table below. The composite quality rating for each security is the average of the security s ratings as assigned by Moody s Investor Service, Standard   Poor s, Fitch Ratings, and Dominion Bond Rating Service, LTD. The ratings assigned by these four nationally recognized statistical rating organizations are evenly weighted when calculating the average. The composite quality rating is created using a methodology developed by Torchmark Corporation using ratings from the various rating agencies noted above. The composite quality rating is not a Standard   Poor's credit rating. Standard and Poor's does not sponsor, endorse or promote the composite quality rating and shall not be liable for any use of the composite quality rating.

Fixed Maturities by Rating 
  (Dollar amounts in thousands) 

Of the   $13.9 billion   of fixed maturities at amortized cost as of   September 30, 2016  ,   $13.2 billion   or   95%   were investment grade with an average rating of A-. Below-investment-grade bonds were   $753 million   with an average rating of B+. Below-investment-grade bonds at amortized cost were   19%   of our shareholders  equity, excluding the effect of unrealized gains and losses on fixed maturities as of   September 30, 2016  . Overall, the total portfolio was rated A- based on amortized cost, the same as at the end of   2015  . 
  An analysis of the changes in our portfolio of below-investment-grade bonds at amortized cost during the first   nine   months of   2016   is as follows: 
  Below-Investment-Grade Bonds  
  (Dollars amounts in thousands) 

Our investment policy is to acquire only investment-grade obligations. Thus, any increases in below-investment-grade issues are a result of ratings downgrades of existing holdings. Our investment portfolio contains no commercial mortgage-backed securities. We have no direct investments in residential mortgages, nor do we have any counterparty risks as we are not a party to any derivative contracts, including credit default swaps. We do not participate in securities lending, we have no off-balance sheet investments, and we have only insignificant exposures to European Sovereign debt consisting of $2 million of German government bonds. Our exposure to direct obligations of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico at   September 30, 2016   was less than $600 thousand. On June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom voted to depart the European Union (EU) under the referendum commonly referred to as "Brexit." Although the formal separation from the EU will take time, the nature and extent of the effects on interest rates and economic performance are uncertain at this time. We do not expect an increase in other-than-temporary impairments on our limited exposure related to this event.

(1) Tax-equivalent basis. The yield on tax-exempt securities is adjusted to produce a yield equivalent to the pretax yield on taxable securities. 
  (2) Torchmark calculates the average life and duration of the fixed maturity portfolio two ways: (a) based on the next call date which is the next call date for callable bonds and the maturity date for noncallable bonds, and (b) based on the maturity date of all bonds, whether callable or not. 
  (3) Effective duration is a measure of the price sensitivity of a fixed-income security to a particular change in interest rates. 
   
  Realized Gains and Losses, comparing the first   nine   months of   2016   with the first   nine   months of   2015  .   As discussed in    Note 10 Business Segments   , our core business of providing insurance coverage requires us to maintain a large and diverse investment portfolio to support our insurance liabilities. From time to time, investments are disposed of or written down prior to maturity, resulting in realized gains or losses. Because these dispositions and write-downs are outside the course of our normal operations, management removes the effects of such gains and losses when evaluating its overall core operating results. 
  The following table summarizes our tax-effected realized gains (losses) by component.

  (Dollar amounts in thousands, except for per share data) 

Financial Condition 
  Liquidity  . Liquidity provides Torchmark with the ability to meet on demand the cash commitments required by our business operations and financial obligations. Our liquidity is evidenced by positive cash flow, a portfolio of marketable investments, and the availability of a line of credit facility. 
  Insurance subsidiary liquidity  .   The operations of our insurance subsidiaries have historically generated substantial cash inflows in excess of immediate cash needs. Sources of cash flows for the insurance subsidiaries include primarily premium and investment income. Cash outflows from operations include policy benefit payments, commissions, administrative expenses, and taxes. The funds to provide for policy benefits, the majority of which are paid in future periods, are invested primarily in long-term fixed maturities to meet these long-term obligations. In addition to investment income, maturities and scheduled repayments in the investment portfolio are sources of cash. Excess cash available from the insurance subsidiaries  operations is generally distributed as a dividend to the parent company, subject to regulatory restriction. The dividends are generally paid in amounts equal to the subsidiaries  prior year statutory net income excluding realized capital gains. 
  
   43 

     Table of Contents  

Parent Company liquidity  .   An important source of Parent Company liquidity is the dividends from the insurance subsidiaries noted above. These dividends are received throughout the year and are used by the Parent Company to pay dividends on common and preferred stock, interest and principal repayment requirements on Parent Company debt, and operating expenses of the Parent Company. In the first   nine   months of   2016  , the Parent Company received $273 million of cash dividends from subsidiaries, compared with $315 million in   2015  . For the full year   2016  , cash dividends from subsidiaries are expected to total approximately $430 million. 
  Additional sources of liquidity for the Parent Company are cash, intercompany receivables, and a credit facility. At   September 30, 2016  , the Parent Company had $138 million of invested cash and net intercompany receivables. The credit facility is discussed below. 
    
  Credit Facility.   We have a credit facility with a group of lenders allowing for unsecured revolving borrowings and stand-by letters of credit up to $750 million, which could be extended up to $1 billion. We may request the extension, however it is not guaranteed. Up to $250 million in letters of credit can be issued against the facility. The facility serves as a back-up credit line for a commercial paper program under which we may issue commercial paper at any time, with total commercial paper outstanding not to exceed the facility maximum, less any letters of credit issued. Interest on the commercial paper program is charged at variable rates. This facility was amended in May 2016 to extend the maturity date of the facility to May 2021. The amendment also allowed for an additional $100 million term loan to be issued under the facility rate structure. The term loan will be repaid in quarterly escalating installments with a balloon payment of $75 million due in May 2021. Interest on the term loan is computed and paid monthly at   125   basis points plus 1 month LIBOR. In accordance with the agreement, we are subject to certain covenants regarding capitalization. As of   September 30, 2016  , we were in full compliance with these covenants. 
    
  Commercial paper outstanding and any amortization payments of the term loan due within one year are included in short-term debt. The remaining balance of the term loan is included in long-term debt. At December 31, 2015 we had $250 million par value of 6.375% Senior Notes which were also classified as short-term debt. This issue was repaid on June 15, 2016. 
   
  The following table presents certain information about our commercial paper borrowings. 
  Credit Facility - Commercial Paper 
  (Dollar amounts in thousands) 

Our balance of commercial paper outstanding at   September 30, 2016   was   $266 million   compared with   $241 million   at the previous year end. We have had no difficulties in accessing the commercial paper market under this facility during the   nine   month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
  In summary, Torchmark expects to have readily available funds for the foreseeable future to conduct its operations and to maintain target capital ratios in the insurance subsidiaries through internally generated cash flow and the credit facility. In the unlikely event that more liquidity is needed, the Parent Company could generate additional funds through multiple sources including, but not limited to, the issuance of debt, an additional short-term credit facility, and intercompany borrowing.

Consolidated liquidity  .   Consolidated net cash inflows from continuing operations were   $889 million   in the first   nine   months of   2016  , compared with   $849 million   in the same period of   2015  . In addition to cash inflows from continuing operations, our companies received proceeds from maturities, calls, and repayments of fixed maturities available for sale in the amount of   $179 million   during the   2016   period. As previously noted under the caption   Credit Facility,   we have in place a line of credit facility. The insurance companies have no additional outstanding credit facilities.  
  Cash and short term investments were   $171 million   at   September 30, 2016  , compared with   $116 million   at   December 31, 2015  . In addition to these liquid assets, the entire   $15.8 billion   (fair value at   September 30, 2016  ) portfolio of fixed income securities is available for sale in the event of an unexpected need. Approximately 96% of our fixed income securities are publicly traded, freely tradable under SEC Rule 144, or qualified for resale under SEC Rule 144A . We generally expect to hold fixed income securities to maturity, and even though these securities are classified as available for sale, we have the ability and intent to hold any securities which are temporarily impaired until they mature. Our strong cash flows from operations, investment maturities, and credit line availability make any need to sell securities for liquidity highly unlikely. 
  Capital Resources  .   Our insurance subsidiaries maintain capital at a level adequate to support their current operations and meet the requirements of the regulatory authorities and the rating agencies. Our insurance subsidiaries generally target a capital ratio of around 325% of Company Action Level required regulatory capital under Risk-Based Capital (RBC), a measure established by insurance regulatory authorities to monitor the adequacy of capital. The 325% target is considered sufficient because of our insurance companies  strong reliable cash flows and the relatively lower risk of our policy liabilities. Additionally, the ratio exceeds regulatory requirements and has been in line with rating agency expectations for Torchmark.  
  As of December 31, 2015, our insurance subsidiaries had a consolidated RBC ratio of 317%. Although Torchmark does not calculate RBC on a quarterly basis, we are estimating that our 2016 RBC ratio will come in slightly below the 325% ratio as a result of lower beginning of the year capital levels and downgrades in our investment portfolio through June 30th. With the combination of proceeds from our second quarter debt issuances, capital generated from the sale of the Medicare Part D business, and potential upgrades in our investment portfolio, we are comfortable with our ability to meet responsible RBC levels in 2016 and return to our targeted 325% in 2017. 
  On a consolidated basis, Torchmark s capital structure consists of short-term debt (comprised of the commercial paper outstanding discussed above, current maturities of the term loan, and current maturities of funded debt), long-term debt (comprised of long-term maturities of funded debt and long term maturities of the term loan), and shareholders  equity.

The outstanding long-term debt at book value was   $1.1 billion   at   September 30, 2016   and   $744 million   at     December 31, 2015  . The increase in long-term debt this quarter as compared to prior year is attributed to the $250 million reclass of the 6.375% Senior Notes into short-term debt in prior year as a result of the upcoming maturity.

  On April 5, 2016, Torchmark completed the issuance and sale of   $300 million   aggregate principal amount of Torchmark s   6.125%   Junior Subordinated Debentures due 2056. The debentures were sold pursuant to Torchmark s shelf registration statement on Form S-3, filed September 25, 2015. The net proceeds from the sale of the debentures were   $290 million  , after giving effect to the underwriting discount and estimated expenses of the offering of the debentures. Torchmark used the net proceeds from the offering of the debentures to repay the   $250 million   outstanding principal amount plus accrued interest of   $8 million   on its   6.375%   Senior Notes that were due June 15, 2016.   The remaining proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, including capital or other financing at our insurance subsidiaries, if necessary. 
  As previously noted under the caption    Results of Operations      in this report, we acquired   4.2 million   of our outstanding common shares under our share repurchase program during the first   nine   months of   2016  . These shares were acquired at a cost of   $240 million   (average of   $57.58   per share), compared with purchases of   4.9 million   shares at a cost of   $276 million   (average of   $56.50   per share) in the first   nine   months of   2015  . 
  On September 8, 2016, the Company announced that it had declared a quarterly dividend of $0.14 per share. This dividend was paid on November 1, 2016. 
  Shareholders  equity was   $5.1 billion   at   September 30, 2016  . This compares with   $4.1 billion   at   December 31, 2015   and   $4.3 billion   at   September 30, 2015  . During the   nine   months since   December 31, 2015  , shareholders  equity was increased by $898 million of after-tax unrealized gains in the fixed-maturity portfolio, as interest rates have decreased over the period. In addition, shareholders' equity was increased by net income of   $414 million  . Share purchases of   $240 million   noted above during the period reduced shareholders  equity. 
  We are required by GAAP to revalue our available for sale fixed maturity portfolio to fair market value at the end of each accounting period. These changes, net of their associated impact on deferred acquisition costs and income tax, are reflected directly in shareholders  equity.

     Table of Contents  

While GAAP requires our fixed maturity assets to be revalued, it does not permit interest-bearing insurance policy liabilities supported by those assets to be valued at fair value in a consistent manner, with changes in value applied directly to shareholders  equity. However, due to the size of both the investment portfolio and our policy liabilities, this inconsistency in measurement can have a material impact on shareholders  equity. Because of the long-term nature of our fixed maturities and liabilities and the strong cash flows generated by our insurance subsidiaries, we have the intent and ability to hold our securities to maturity. As such, we do not expect to incur realized gains or losses due to fluctuations in the market value of fixed maturities caused by interest rate changes or losses caused by temporarily illiquid markets. Accordingly, management removes the effect of this rule when analyzing Torchmark s balance sheet, capital structure, and financial ratios in order to provide a more consistent and meaningful portrayal of the Company s financial position from period to period. 
   
  The following table presents selected data related to capital resources. Additionally, the table presents the effect of this GAAP requirement on relevant line items, so that investors and other financial statement users may determine its impact on our capital structure.  
  Selected Financial Data 
  (Dollar amounts in thousands, except for per share data) 

(1) Amount added to (deducted from) comprehensive income to produce the stated GAAP item, per accounting rule ASC 320-10-35-1. 
  (2) Includes the value of insurance purchased. 
  (3) Torchmark s debt covenants require that the effect of this accounting rule be removed to determine this ratio. This ratio is computed by dividing total debt by the sum of total debt and shareholders  equity. 
  (4) The 2016 diluted shares outstanding was adjusted to exclude excess tax benefits from the assumed proceeds in the diluted share calculation as a result of the prospective adoption of ASU 2016-09. 
    
  Interest coverage was   10.5   times in the   2016     nine   months, compared with   11.3   times in the   2015   period. Interest coverage is computed by dividing interest expense into the sum of pretax income and interest expense.

Cautionary Statements 
  We caution readers regarding certain forward-looking statements contained in the previous discussion and elsewhere in this document, and in any other statements made by, or on behalf of Torchmark whether or not in future filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Any statement that is not a historical fact or that might otherwise be considered an opinion or projection concerning Torchmark or its business, whether express or implied, is meant as and should be considered a forward-looking statement. Such statements represent management s opinions concerning future operations, strategies, financial results or other developments. We specifically disclaim any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statement because of new information, future developments, or otherwise. 
  Forward-looking statements are based upon estimates and assumptions that are subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control. If these estimates or assumptions prove to be incorrect, the actual results of Torchmark may differ materially from the forward-looking statements made on the basis of such estimates or assumptions. Whether or not actual results differ materially from forward-looking statements may depend on numerous foreseeable and unforeseeable events or developments, which may be national in scope, related to the insurance industry generally, or applicable to Torchmark specifically. Such events or developments could include, but are not necessarily limited to: 
    
           1) 
    Changing general economic conditions leading to unexpected changes in lapse rates and/or sales of our policies, as well as levels of mortality, morbidity, and utilization of health care services that differ from Torchmark s assumptions; 
              2) 
    Regulatory developments, including changes in governmental regulations (particularly those impacting taxes and changes to the Federal Medicare program that would affect Medicare Supplement and Medicare Part D insurance);  
              3) 
    Market trends in the senior-aged health care industry that provide alternatives to traditional Medicare (such as Health Maintenance Organizations and other managed care or private plans) and that could affect the sales of traditional Medicare Supplement insurance; 
              4) 
    Interest rate changes that affect product sales and/or investment portfolio yield; 
              5) 
    General economic, industry sector or individual debt issuers  financial conditions that may affect the current market value of securities we own, or that may impair an issuer s ability to make principal and/or interest payments due on those securities; 
              6) 
    Changes in pricing competition; 
              7) 
    Litigation results; 
              8) 
    Levels of administrative and operational efficiencies that differ from our assumptions; 
              9) 
    Our inability to obtain timely and appropriate premium rate increases for health insurance policies due to regulatory delay; 
              10) 
    The customer response to new products and marketing initiatives; and 
              11) 
    Reported amounts in the financial statements which are based on management s estimates and judgments which may differ from the actual amounts ultimately realized.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk 
  There have been no quantitative or qualitative changes with respect to market risk exposure during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
  Torchmark, under the direction of the Co-Chairmen and Chief Executive Officers and the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, has established disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by Torchmark in the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms. The disclosure controls and procedures are also intended to ensure that such information is accumulated and communicated to Torchmark s management, including the Co-Chairmen and Chief Executive Officers and the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
  As of the end of the fiscal quarter completed   September 30, 2016  , an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of Torchmark management, including the Co-Chairmen and Chief Executive Officers and the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, of Torchmark s disclosure controls and procedures (as those terms are defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based upon their evaluation, the Co-Chairmen and Chief Executive Officers and the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that Torchmark s disclosure controls and procedures are effective as of the date of this Form 10-Q. In compliance with Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (18 U.S.C.  1350), each of these officers executed a Certification included as an exhibit to this Form 10-Q. 
  As of the date of this Form 10-Q for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , there have not been any changes in Torchmark s internal control over financial reporting or in other factors that could significantly affect this control over financial reporting subsequent to the date of their evaluation which have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Torchmark s internal control over financial reporting. No material weaknesses in such internal controls were identified in the evaluation and as a consequence, no corrective action was required to be taken.

Part II   Other Information 
   
  Item 1. Legal Proceedings  
    
  Torchmark and its subsidiaries, in common with the insurance industry in general, are subject to litigation, including claims involving tax matters, alleged breaches of contract, torts, including bad faith and fraud claims based on alleged wrongful or fraudulent acts of agents of Torchmark s subsidiaries, employment discrimination, and miscellaneous other causes of action. Based upon information presently available, and in light of legal and other factual defenses available to Torchmark and its subsidiaries, management does not believe that such litigation will have a material adverse effect on Torchmark s financial condition, future operating results or liquidity; however, assessing the eventual outcome of litigation necessarily involves forward-looking speculation as to judgments to be made by judges, juries and appellate courts in the future. This bespeaks caution, particularly in states with reputations for high punitive damage verdicts. Torchmark s management recognizes that large punitive damage awards bearing little or no relation to actual damages continue to be awarded by juries in jurisdictions in which Torchmark and its subsidiaries have substantial business, creating the potential for unpredictable material adverse judgments in any given punitive damage suit. 
    
  Torchmark subsidiaries are currently the subject of audits regarding the identification, reporting and escheatment of unclaimed property arising from life insurance policies and a limited number of annuity contracts. These audits are being conducted by private entities that have contracted with forty-eight various states through their respective Departments of Revenue, and have not resulted in any financial assessment from any state nor indicated any liability.  The audits are wide-ranging and seek large amounts of data regarding claims handling, procedures, and payments of contract benefits arising from unreported death claims. No estimate of range can be made at this time for loss contingencies related to possible administrative penalties or amounts that could be payable to the states for the escheatment of abandoned property.  

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
  Torchmark has had no material changes to its risk factors. 

Item 2. Changes in Securities, Use of Proceeds and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities 
       
  (c)    Purchases of Certain Equity Securities by the Issuer and Others 

At its August 4, 2016 meeting, the Board of Directors reaffirmed the Company s share repurchase program in amounts and with timing that management, in consultation with the Board, determines to be in the best interest of the Company. The program has no defined expiration date or maximum shares to be repurchased.
