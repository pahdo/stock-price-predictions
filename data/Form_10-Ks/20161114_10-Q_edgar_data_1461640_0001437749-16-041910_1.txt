   Note 1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   
     
    Organization    
  On September 4, 2009, Hometown Bankshares Corporation (the  Company ) acquired all outstanding stock of HomeTown Bank (the  Bank ) in an exchange for shares of the Company on a one-for-one basis to become a single-bank holding company with the Bank becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary. The Bank was organized and incorporated under the laws of the State of Virginia on November 9, 2004 and commenced operations on November 14, 2005. The Bank currently serves Roanoke City, Virginia, the County of Roanoke, Virginia, the City of Salem, Virginia, Christiansburg, Virginia, and surrounding areas. As a state chartered bank which is a member of the Federal Reserve System, the Bank is subject to regulation by the Virginia Bureau of Financial Institutions, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Federal Reserve Board.  
     
    Basis of Presentation    
  The consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2016 and for the periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 included herein, have been prepared by HomeTown Bankshares Corporation, without audit, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission.   
     
  Management believes that all interim adjustments for the periods ended September 30, 2016 are of a normal recurring nature. In the opinion of management, the information furnished in the interim consolidated financial statements reflects all adjustments necessary to present fairly the Company s financial position, results of operations and cash flows for such interim periods. These consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s audited financial statements and the notes thereto as of December 31, 2015, included in the Company s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. Interim financial performance is not necessarily indicative of performance for the full year.   
     
  The accounting and reporting policies of the Company follow generally accepted accounting principles and general practices within the financial services industry.  
     
  The consolidated financial statements of HomeTown Bankshares Corporation include the accounts of its wholly-owned subsidiary HomeTown Bank and the accounts of its subsidiary, HomeTown Residential Mortgage LLC. HomeTown Bank owns a 49% interest in HomeTown Residential Mortgage LLC which originates and sells mortgages secured by personal residences. Due to the marketing support and direction provided by HomeTown Bank to HomeTown Residential Mortgage LLC, along with guarantees of warehouse lines of credit used in its operation, the Company is deemed to exercise control of this entity. The ownership interest in HomeTown Residential Mortgage LLC not owned by the Company is reported as Non-Controlling Interest in a Consolidated Subsidiary. All significant intercompany balances and     transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  
     
  The Company elected the early adoption of ASU 2016-09,  Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvement to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.  The tax effect of the expiration of nonqualified stock options was recognized in the second quarter as a discrete item when the expiration occurred and increased income tax expense by $236 thousand. The Company elected an accounting policy to account for forfeitures when they occur and reverse compensation cost previously recognized, in the period the award is forfeited before the completion of the requisite service period. The Company s other accounting policies and basic principles have not changed since the summary disclosure of these in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. Please refer to Form 10-K for these policies.  
     
   Note 2. Investment Securities   
     
  The amortized cost and fair value of available-for-sale securities as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, are as follows:  

7

U. S. Government and agency securities:     The unrealized losses on twelve of the Company s investments in obligations of the U. S. government were caused by increases in market interest rates over the yields available at the time the securities were purchased.  The contractual terms of those investments do not permit the issuer to settle the securities at a price less than the amortized cost bases of the investments. Because the Company does not intend to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost bases, which may be maturity, the Company does not consider those investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired   at September 30, 2016.  
     
    Mortgage-backed securities and CMO s:     The unrealized losses on fourteen of the Company s investments in government-sponsored entity mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations ( CMOs ) were caused by increases in market interest rates over the yields available at the time the securities were purchased. Because the decline in market value is attributable to changes in interest rates and not credit quality, and because the Company does not intend to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost bases, which may be maturity, the Company does not consider those investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired at September 30, 2016.  
       
    Corporate securities   :  The Company had no investments with unrealized losses in corporate securities at September 30, 2016.   
     
    Municipal securities:     The unrealized losses on nine of the Company s investments in municipal securities were caused by increases in market interest rates over the yields available at the time the securities were purchased. All municipal securities are investment grade. Because the decline in market value is attributable to changes in interest rates, credit spreads, and not credit quality, and because the Company does not intend to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost bases, which may be maturity, the Company does not consider those investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired   at September 30, 2016.  
     
  The following tables demonstrate the unrealized loss position of available-for-sale securities at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. This information summarizes the amount of time individual securities have been in a continuous, unrealized loss position.   

There are thirty-five debt securities with fair values totaling $13.7 million considered temporarily impaired at September 30, 2016.  As of September 30, 2016, the Company does not consider any bond in an unrealized loss position to be other-than-temporarily impaired.  
     
  The Company realized gains of $262 thousand and $5 thousand of losses on sales of securities in the first nine months of 2016. The Company realized gains of $67 thousand and $15 thousand of losses during the same period last year.

Troubled Debt Restructurings  
     
  Troubled debt restructurings ( TDR s ) were comprised of six loans totaling $6.5 million at September 30, 2016.  This compares with $6.7 million in total restructured loans at December 31, 2015. Four of the six loans totaling $6.2 million were not on nonaccrual status at September 30, 2016. The other two loans totaling $238 thousand were on nonaccrual status at the end of the third quarter of 2016.  All TDR s were current with their restructured terms at September 30, 2016.   
     
  No loans were modified in a TDR during the first nine months of 2016.  
     
  The following table presents by class of loan, information related to the loan modified in a TDR during 2015:

The loan identified above in the table restructured into two TDR s during the nine months ended September 30, 2015. It was included in substandard nonaccrual loans and impaired loans at the end of 2014.   

11

Management considers troubled debt restructurings and subsequent defaults in restructured loans in the determination of the adequacy of the Company s allowance for loan losses. When identified as a TDR, a loan is evaluated for potential loss based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate, the loan s observable market price, or the estimated fair value of the collateral, less any selling costs if the loan is collateral dependent. Loans identified as TDRs frequently are on non-accrual status at the time of the restructuring and, in some cases, partial charge-offs may have already been taken against the loan and a specific allowance may have already been established for the loan. As a result of any modification as a TDR, if a specific reserve is associated with the loan it may be increased. Additionally, loans modified in a TDR are closely monitored for delinquency as an early indicator of possible future defaults. If loans modified in a TDR subsequently default, the Company evaluates the loan for possible further impairment. As a result, any specific allowance may be increased, adjustments may be made in the allocation of the total allowance balance, or partial charge-offs may be taken to further write-down the carrying value of the loan. Management exercises significant judgment in developing estimates for potential losses associated with TDRs.

  Other real estate owned related expenses in the consolidated statements of income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 include:  

Note 6. Stock Based Compensation   
     
  The Company recorded stock based compensation expense of $111 thousand and $102 thousand for the years to date September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  
     
  The Company has a 2005 Stock Option Plan (the Plan) pursuant to which the Board of Directors may grant stock options to directors, officers and employees. Under the fair value recognition provisions of relevant accounting guidance, stock-based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is the vesting period.   
     
  The Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options. The fair value of the stock based payment awards is affected by the price of our stock and a number of financial assumptions and variables. These variables include the risk free interest rate, expected dividend rate, expected stock price volatility and the expected life of the options.  On December 18, 2014, the Board of Directors granted 165 thousand shares which will vest over a five year period. Financial assumptions and variables used to determine the fair value of these stock options are; risk free interest rate of 2.01%, an expected term of 7.5 years, an expected stock price volatility of 26% and a dividend rate of 0%. The fair value of the options was determined to be $2.29 per option. Compensation expense will be charged to income ratably over the vesting period and was $58 thousand year to date September 30, 2016 and $56 thousand year to date September 30, 2015. As of September 30, 2016 there was $229 thousand of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock options granted under the Plan. The cost will be recognized over the next 3.25 years. No options were granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. All previously issued options were fully vested at the end of 2012. At the discretion of the Board of Directors, the stock option plan was not modified for the 4% stock dividend distributed on July 11, 2016.  
     
  A summary of option activity under the 2005 stock option plan year to date September 30, 2016 is as follows:  

15

(1) The aggregate intrinsic value of a stock option in the table above represents the total pre-tax intrinsic value (the amount by which the current market value of the underlying stock exceeds the exercise price of the option) that would have been received by the option holders had all option holders exercised their options on September 30, 2016.  
     
  In 2009, the Board of Directors authorized 132,000 shares of common stock for issuance under the Restricted Stock Plan. On July 11, 2016, a 4% stock dividend was distributed and added 5,280 to the total number of shares authorized for issuance and currently raising the total available to 137,280. The plan provides for restricted stock awards to key employees. Restricted shares awarded to employees generally vest over a five year period and compensation expense is charged to income ratably over the vesting period and was $53 thousand and $46 thousand for the years to date September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Compensation is accounted for using the fair market value of the Company s common stock on the date the restricted shares are awarded. The Company granted 11,149* and 9,014* shares of restricted stock under the plan during the years to date September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

   Note 7. Fair Value Measurement   
     
  The Company uses a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Company s market assumptions. The three levels of the fair value hierarchy based on these two types of inputs are as follows:  
     
  Level 1 - Valuation is based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.  
     
  Level 2 - Valuation is based on observable inputs including quoted prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in less active markets, and model-based valuation techniques for which significant assumptions can be derived primarily from or corroborated by observable data in the market.  
     
  Level 3 - Valuation is based on model-based techniques that use one or more significant inputs or assumptions that are unobservable in the market.  
     
  The following describes the valuation techniques used by the Company to measure certain financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis in the consolidated financial statements:  
     
   Securities available for sale:  Securities available for sale are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Fair value measurement is based upon quoted market prices, when available (Level 1). If quoted market prices are not available, fair values are measured utilizing independent valuation techniques of identical or similar securities for which significant assumptions are derived primarily from or corroborated by observable market data. Third party vendors compile prices from various sources and may determine the fair value of identical or similar securities by using pricing models that consider observable market data (Level 2).  

16

The following table presents the balances of financial   assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:  

Certain assets are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Adjustments to the fair value of these assets usually result from the application of lower-of-cost-or-market accounting or write-downs of individual assets.  
     
  The following describes the valuation techniques used by the Company to measure certain assets recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in the consolidated financial statements:  
     
   Impaired Loans:  The Company does not record loans at fair value on a recurring basis. However, from time to time a loan is considered impaired and a specific reserve is established. Loans for which it is probable that payment of interest and principal will not be made in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement are considered impaired. Once a loan is identified as individually impaired, management measures the extent of any loss. The fair value of impaired loans is estimated using one of several methods, including collateral value, market value, and discounted cash flow. Those impaired loans not requiring an allowance represent loans for which the fair value of the expected repayments or collateral exceed the recorded investment in such loans. Impaired loans where an allowance is established based on the fair value of collateral require classification in the fair value hierarchy. If carried at market price based on appraised value less selling costs using observable market data, it is recorded as nonrecurring Level 2. When an appraised value is not available or management determines the fair value of the collateral is further impaired below the appraisal value and there is no observable market price, the Company records the impaired loan as nonrecurring Level 3.   
     
   Loans held for sale:  The carrying value of these loans approximates the fair value. These loans close in the name of the Bank s consolidated joint venture subsidiary HomeTown Residential Mortgage, LLC, but are generally sold within a two-week period.  
       
   Other Real Estate Owned (OREO) : The carrying amount of real estate owned by the Company resulting from foreclosures is estimated at the lesser of cost or the fair value of the real estate based on an observable market price or a current appraised value less selling costs. If carried at market price based on appraised value using observable market data, it is recorded as nonrecurring Level 2. When an appraised value is not available or is not current, or management determines the fair value of the real estate is further impaired below the appraised value or there is no observable market price, the Company records the real estate as nonrecurring Level 3.

  The following methods and assumptions were used by the Company in estimating its fair value disclosures for financial instruments:  
     
  Cash and due from banks: The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheet for cash on hand and amounts due from correspondent banks approximate their fair values. The fair values for certificates of deposit are estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies interest rates currently being offered on certificates of deposit to a schedule of contractual maturities on such time deposits.  

18

Federal funds sold: Federal funds sold consist of overnight loans to other financial institutions and mature within one to three days. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, management believes the carrying value of federal funds sold approximates estimated market value.  
     
  Securities available for sale: Securities available for sale are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Fair value measurement is based upon quoted market prices, when available (Level 1). If quoted market prices are not available, fair values are measured utilizing independent valuation techniques of identical or similar securities for which significant assumptions are derived primarily from or corroborated by observable market data. Third party vendors compile prices from various sources and may determine the fair value of identical or similar securities by using pricing models that consider observable market data (Level 2).  
     
  Restricted equity securities: For these restricted equity securities, the carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value based on the redemption provisions of the related securities.  
     
  Loans held for sale: The carrying value of these loans approximates the fair value. These loans close in the name of the Bank s joint venture subsidiary HomeTown Residential Mortgage, LLC, but are generally sold within a two-week period.  
     
  Loans receivable: For variable-rate loans that reprice frequently and with no significant change in credit risk, fair values are based on carrying amounts. Their fair values are measured utilizing independent valuation techniques of similar securities for which significant assumptions are derived primarily from or corroborated by observable market data. The fair values for other loans are estimated using discounted cash flow analysis, based on interest rates currently being offered for loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit quality.  
     
  Bank owned life insurance: The cash values of these policies are estimates using information provided by insurance carriers. The policies are carried at their cash surrender value, which approximates fair value.   
     
  Deposit liabilities: The fair values disclosed for demand and savings deposits are, by definition, equal to the amount payable on demand at the reporting date. The fair values for certificates of deposit and individual retirement accounts are estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies interest rates currently being offered to a schedule of contractual maturities on such time deposits.  
      
  FHLB borrowings: The fair values for FHLB borrowings are estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies interest rates currently being offered on FHLB borrowings to the contractual maturities on such FHLB borrowings.  
     
  Subordinated notes: The fair values is measured utilizing independent valuation techniques of identical or similar securities for which significant assumptions are derived primarily from or corroborated by observable market data. Third party vendors compile prices from various sources and may determine the fair value of identical or similar securities by using pricing models that consider observable market data (Level 2).  
     
  Other borrowings: The warehouse line of credit is a short term revolving credit facility used to fund mortgage loans originations until the underlying loan is sold.   The warehouse line of credit, federal funds purchased, borrowings under repurchase agreements mature within 30 days and approximate their fair values.  
     
  Accrued interest: The carrying amount of accrued interest receivable and payable approximates fair value.  
     
  Off-balance sheet financial instruments: The fair values of commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit are estimated using the fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the fair value of loan commitments and standby letters of credit were deemed to be immaterial.

These forward-looking statements may include: statements of goals, intentions, earnings expectations, and other expectations; estimates of risks and of future costs and benefits; assessments of probable loan and lease losses; assessments of market risk; and statements of the ability to achieve financial and other goals. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by words such as  believe,   expect,   anticipate,   intend,   outlook,   estimate,   forecast,   project  and other similar words and expressions. Forward-looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties, which change over time. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made. The Company does not assume any duty and does not undertake to update its forward-looking statements. Because forward-looking statements are subject to assumptions and uncertainties, actual results or future events could differ, possibly materially, from those that the Company anticipated in its forward-looking statements; and future results could differ materially from historical performance.  
     
  The Company s forward-looking statements are subject to the following principal risks and uncertainties: general economic conditions and trends, either nationally or locally; conditions in the securities markets; changes in interest rates; changes in deposit flows, and in the demand for deposit, loan, and investment products and other financial services; changes in real estate values; changes in the quality or composition of the Company s loan or investment portfolios; changes in competitive pressures among financial institutions or from non-financial institutions; the Company s ability to retain key members of management; changes in legislation, regulation, and policies; and a variety of other matters which, by their nature, are subject to significant uncertainties. The Company provides greater detail regarding some of these factors in its Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. The Company s forward-looking statements may also be subject to other risks and uncertainties, including those that it may discuss elsewhere in this report or in its other filings with the SEC.

  The following is a discussion of factors that significantly affected the financial condition and results of operations of HomeTown Bankshares Corporation. This discussion should be read in connection with the financial statements presented herein.  
     
    Critical Accounting Policies    
     
  The Company s significant accounting policies are set forth in Note 1 of the Notes to Financial Statements in the Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2015. The Company s financial position and results of operations are affected by management s application of accounting policies, including estimates, assumptions and judgments made to arrive at the carrying value of assets and liabilities and amounts reported for revenues and expenses.  
     
  The allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the losses that may be sustained in our loan portfolio. The allowance is based on two basic principles of accounting: (i) that losses be accrued when they are probable of occurring and are capable of estimation and (ii) that losses on impaired loans be accrued based on the differences between the value of collateral less cost to sell, present value of future cash flows or values that are observable in the secondary market and the loan balance. The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level, which, in management s judgment, is adequate to absorb credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio.  

23

The amount of the allowance is based on management s evaluation of the collectability of the loan portfolio, including the nature of the portfolio, credit concentrations, trends in historical loss experience, specific impaired loans, economic conditions, and other risks inherent in the portfolio. Management reviews the past due reports and risk-rated loans and discusses individually the loans on these reports with the responsible loan officers. Management uses these tools and provides a detailed quarterly analysis of the allowance based on the Company s historical loan loss experience, risk-rated loans, past dues, concentrations of credit, unsecured loans, loan exceptions, and economic trends. These are generally grouped by homogeneous loan pools. Allowances for impaired loans are generally determined based on collateral values less cost to sell, or the present value of estimated cash flows. This allowance, then, is designated as a specific reserve. Although management uses available information to recognize losses on loans, because of uncertainties associated with local economic conditions, collateral values, and future cash flows on impaired loans, it is reasonably possible that a material change could occur in the allowance for loan losses in the near term. However, the amount of the change that is reasonably possible cannot be estimated. The allowance is increased by a provision for loan losses, which is charged to expense, and reduced by charge-offs, net of recoveries. Changes in the allowance relating to impaired loans are charged or credited to the provision for loan losses. Past due status is determined based on contractual terms.  
     
    Discussion of Operations    
       
   Executive Summary   
     
  HomeTown Bankshares Corporation financial results for the third quarter of 2016 rebounded to more normal levels following lower results last quarter. The Company reported net income attributable to HomeTown Bankshares Corporation of $903 thousand for the third quarter compared to $224 thousand for the second quarter and $801 thousand for the first quarter. Profitability was lower in the second quarter due predominantly to additional loan loss provision expense related to one loan and the reversal of tax benefits that could not be realized.   

Three Months Ended September 30, 2016    
     
  Net income attributable to HomeTown Bankshares was $903 thousand for the third quarter of 2016, and was $48 thousand or 5.6% higher than the same quarter last year. Higher net interest income and noninterest income was partially negated by increased noninterest expense.   
     
  Net interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 totaled $4.1 million, and was $215 thousand or 5.5% greater than the third quarter of 2015. The expansion of earning assets by $60.3 million provided $517 thousand in additional interest income, while lower loan yields negatively impacted net interest income by $113 thousand. Average loans for the quarter were $398 million, $41.6 million or 11.7% more than the third quarter of 2015. Excess funds from increased liquidity were placed in interest bearing bank accounts until needed to fund further loan growth and the expansion of the investment portfolio. Average interest bearing deposits with banks were $15.4 million greater for the third quarter of 2016 than for the same quarter in 2015.   
     
  Deposits and proceeds from the subordinated notes issued in December 2015 funded the expansion of earning assets. Proceeds from the issuance of subordinated notes in the fourth quarter of 2015 partially funded the growth of earning assets at a cost of $134 thousand for the third quarter of 2016. The average interest bearing and non-interest bearing deposits for the third quarter of 2016 totaled $442 million, an increase of $56.6 million over the average for the same quarter in 2015. Average subordinated debt for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $7.2 million compared to none for the three months ended September 30, 2015.   
     
  The net interest margin was 3.49%, 3.55%, and 3.77% for the three months ended September 30, 2016, June 30, 2016, and September 30, 2015, respectively. While deposits were the major source of funds, their levels fluctuate. The subordinated notes were issued at the end of 2015 to provide a more stable source of liquidity to fund earning asset growth. The cost of the subordinated notes accounted for 11 basis points of the 28 basis points drop for the third quarter of 2016 compared to the same quarter last year. The remainder of the decrease in the net interest margin was due to spread compression as the yield on earning assets declined while the cost of funds rose. The downward pressure on rates stemming from competition in the market-place coupled with maturing seasoned loans at higher interest rates contributed to lower loan yields.   

24

(1) Yields are reported on a tax equivalent basis assuming a federal income tax rate of 34 percent.  

25

A provision for loan losses of $111 thousand was recorded for the three months ended September 30, 2016 to provide coverage for the growth in loans, compared to none being recorded in any quarter of the prior year. See discussion under Allowance for Loan Losses for additional information.   
     
  Noninterest income for the third quarter of 2016 was $835 thousand, and was $154 thousand more than the same period last year. Service charges on deposit accounts, and ATM and interchange income were up $78 thousand for 2016 compared to 2015 due to deposit growth and changes late in the third quarter of 2015 in the fee structure to be more in line with industry norms. Mortgage banking income was $90 thousand more than the prior year due to a higher dollar volume of mortgages processed and sold.    
     
  For the three months ended September 30, 2016, noninterest expense was $3.5 million, $149 thousand or 4.5% more than the $3.3 million recorded in the same quarter last year. Salaries and employee benefits for the three months ended September 30, 2016 were $131 thousand or 8.0% more than the same three months of 2015. Increases in salaries from the addition of new employees and annual raises were partially offset by increased deferrals of salaries related to loan origination costs and the reduction of bonuses in the wake of the weak second quarter earnings. The Bank took advantage of the opportunity to hire two former Valley Bank employees at the beginning of the current year and start a Private Wealth division that has contributed to loan and deposit growth. Advertising and marketing expense for the third quarter of 2016 varied favorably from the prior year by $71 thousand. Efforts were accelerated in the first part of 2015 to take advantage of competitive opportunities in the local banking market created by the acquisition of Valley Bank by a North Carolina headquartered financial institution. HomeTown Bank is now the largest community bank headquartered in the Roanoke Valley. Professional fees were $55 thousand more for the third quarter of 2016 compared to the third quarter of 2015 due primarily to investor related costs of the stock dividend distributed on July 11, 2016 and conversion of the remaining preferred stock to common shares at the end of June 2016. Bank Franchise Tax was $26 thousand more for the third quarter of 2016 than the same quarter last year. The increase in the Bank s equity from retained earnings, the capital infusion of $6.0 million from the proceeds of the subordinated notes issued at the end of 2015, and the reduction in real estate taxes paid on foreclosed properties which are deducted from capital on the Bank Franchise return, were all factors contributing to the increase in the Bank Franchise Tax in 2016. The third quarter of 2015 included writedowns of foreclosed properties of $140 thousand compared to none in the third quarter of the current year. The Board of Directors fees were raised in 2016 in recognition of the Company s growth in asset size and were $43 thousand more quarter over quarter.  
     
    Nine     months Ended September 30, 2016    
     
  Net income attributable to HomeTown Bankshares for the year through September 30, 2016 was $1.9 million, $566 thousand less than the earnings for the same period in 2015. Profitability was lower in 2016 due predominantly to additional loan loss provision expense to replenish the reserve for the partial charge off of $606 thousand of a loan extended in 2008. The loan had performed as agreed until the second quarter of 2016. The specific loan loss provision attributed to this loan reduced net income by $400 thousand after taxes. In addition, the Company incurred additional tax expense of $236 thousand due to the expiration of stock options in the second quarter that were issued in 2006 and were never exercised. This charge was due to the reversal of tax benefits recorded previously that cannot be realized due to the options expiring. These were the primary contributors to the reduction in earnings through September 30, 2016. Net interest income and noninterest income varied favorably from the prior year, and were partially negated by higher noninterest expense.   

26

Net interest income was up $544 thousand or 4.8% to $12.0 million for the first nine months of 2016 over the same period last year. The impact of the higher loan volume surpassed the effect of lower interest rates on loans and increased interest income for the first nine months of 2016. As anticipated, the cost of the $7.5 million capital raise in December 2015 had a near-term impact on earnings and accounted for 12 basis points of the total 25 basis point decline in the net interest margin year over year. CD promotions in August 2016 to retain maturing CDs and in June 2015 to provide additional liquidity contributed to higher costs of time deposits for the first nine months of 2016 compared to the first nine months of last year.   Management decreased the average level of Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings by $9.3 million. Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings are generally more expensive than interest bearing deposits, and reducing reliance on them as a funding source favorably impacted the funding mix.   
     
  The low interest rate environment is expected to continue to put pressure on the margin. The Federal Open Market Committee in its November 2, 2016 press release continued to state that   the Committee expects that economic conditions will evolve in a manner that will warrant only gradual increases in the federal funds rate; the federal funds rate is likely to remain, for some time, below levels that are expected to prevail in the longer run.  The Company currently expects one rate increase later this year and two next year. Many economists felt the Federal Reserve signaled after its September meeting that it would raise rates relatively soon, as long as economic growth continued.

The year to date provision for loan losses totaled $979 thousand for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to none for the same period in 2015. One loan that originated in 2008 and had performed as agreed until the second quarter of 2016 was partially charged off in the amount of $606 thousand. Additional loan loss provision expense was required to replenish the reserve for the partial charge off. Further, in 2016, additional provision for loan losses has been required to cover loan growth. See discussion under Allowance for Loan Losses for additional information.   
     
  For the year to date through September 30, 2016, noninterest income totaled $2.3 million, an increase of $408 thousand or 21.4% over the same period last year. Securities gains of $257 thousand were recorded in the first nine months of 2016 versus $52 thousand in 2015. Volatility created by the Brexit referendum led to a surge in trading activity creating opportunities to realize gains in the bond markets. Proceeds were reinvested in higher yielding corporate bonds. Excluding gains on the sales of securities, noninterest income increased $203 thousand or 10.9% from the same period last year. Service charges on deposit accounts, and ATM and interchange income were up $209 thousand for the first nine months of 2016 compared to 2015 due to deposit growth and changes late in the third quarter last year in the fee structure to be more in line with industry norms. Mortgage banking varied favorably from the prior year by $68 thousand or 12.6% due to increased number of closings and median loan amount. Other income was $74 thousand lower for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period last year. Favorable variances from the continued growth of merchant processing income, and a vendor signing incentive, partially offset the loss of $115 thousand in rental income from the sale of a building adjacent to a branch for a gain in the last quarter of 2015.   
     
  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, noninterest expense was $10.1 million, $445 thousand or 4.6% more than the $9.7 million recorded in the first nine months of last year. Salaries and employee benefits through September 2016 were $294 thousand or 6.1% more than the same period last year. The numbers of full time equivalent employees were 99 and 91 at September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, respectively. The increase was due to several factors including the addition of Private Wealth which contributed to loan and deposit growth in 2016. Other factors included unfilled open positions in the prior year, and new positions to accommodate growth, as well as annual merit raises. Higher wages were partially offset by the deferral of more loan origination costs, in accordance with ASC 310-20 due to a higher volume of new loans and renewals. Advertising and marketing expense through September 2016 varied favorably by $262 thousand with the prior year. As discussed in the quarter to quarter comparison, the marketing effort was more intense in 2015 in the wake of Valley Bank s acquisition by a North Carolina financial institution. Bank Franchise Taxes were up in correlation with increased equity and a reduction in real estate taxes on foreclosed properties.   
     
  Net income before taxes for the first nine months of 2016 was $472 thousand less than last year; however, income tax expense was $95 thousand more than the same nine month period in 2015. The Company incurred additional tax expense of $236 thousand in 2016 due to the expiration of stock options in the second quarter of 2016 that were issued in 2006 and were never exercised. This charge was due to the reversal of tax benefits recorded previously that cannot be realized due to the options expiring.

Financial Condition    
       
  The Company s management, under the direction of the Asset/Liability Committee (ALCO) of the Board of Directors, reviews the mix of monetary assets and liabilities to ensure the Company maintains an adequate level of liquidity while maximizing interest rate spreads.  
     
  Assets surpassed the half million threshold last quarter and increased to $508 million at September 30, 2016. The balance at September 30 was $28.3 million or 5.9% more than at year end 2015.  The continuing expansion of the loan portfolio by $36.3 million during the nine months since December 31, 2015, accounted for most of the asset growth.   
     
  The Company s liabilities at September 30, 2016 totaled $459 million compared to $433 million at December 31, 2015, an increase of $26.4 million or 6.1%.  Total deposits rose $40.4 million during the same period to $440 million at September 30, 2016. Core deposits, which exclude brokered deposits and retail CD s over $250 thousand, totaled $398 million at the end of the third quarter and was $42.7 million more than at year end 2015.   
     
  At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the stockholders  equity of HomeTown Bankshares was $47.9 million and $46.0 million, respectively, an increase of $1.8 million or 4.0%. The change in stockholders  equity in the first nine months of 2016 was mainly the result of net income.     
     
     Non-performing Assets    
     
   Non-performing assets consist of nonaccrual loans, restructured loans, and repossessed and foreclosed assets.  

Nonaccrual loans totaled $935 thousand at September 30, 2016 compared to $426 thousand at December 31, 2015. A loan with a balance of $577 thousand was placed on nonaccrual status, when the number of days past due exceeded 90 days. The other two borrowers with nonaccrual loans totaling $358 thousand were making payments and were not past due at the end of the quarter; however, they are remaining on nonaccrual until performance warrants return to accrual status.   
     
  The loan that was partially charged down $606 thousand to $1.3 million was placed on nonaccrual in June 2016. This loan was collateralized by a hotel, and the sale of the underlying collateral was completed in August 2016. The proceeds paid off the $1.3 million nonaccrual balance.   
       
  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 the Bank sold $1.4 million of foreclosed properties. One property on the books at $1.3 million was sold for a loss of $91 thousand after being held by the bank for almost two years. Through September 2016, the Bank added $481 thousand to other real estate owned, of which one property comprised $473 thousand of the total added. At December 31, 2015, the related loan for this addition was included in  Current  in Note 3 and  Pass  in Note 4. The borrower was an independent church and the membership voted to disband in the first quarter of 2016, prompting the Bank to negotiate a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure. Additional collateral in the form of an assigned note receivable was received and subsequently collected as part of the negotiation. No loss was recognized when the loan was transferred to other real estate.   Writedowns of $140 thousand on other real estate were recorded in the first nine months of 2015.  
     
  Troubled debt restructurings ( TDR s ) were comprised of six loans totaling $6.5 million at September 30, 2016.  Four of the six loans totaling $6.2 million were accruing interest at the end of the third quarter. All six loans were performing in accordance with their restructured terms at September 30, 2016. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, no loans were modified in a TDR compared to one loan modified into two restructured loans for the same period in 2015. See Note 3 for more information.   
     
  The major classifications of other real estate owned in the consolidated balance sheets at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are included in Note 5, and the activity in other real estate owned for the first nine months of 2016 and 2015 is also included in Note 5.

Allowance for Loan Losses    
     
  The allowance for loan losses is increased by charges to income and decreased by charge-offs, net of recoveries. The allowance consists of three components: specific, general, and unallocated. Their adequacy is evaluated separately. Management s periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance is based on the Company s past loan loss experience, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay, the estimated value of any underlying collateral, and current economic conditions. Based on the Company s allowance for loan losses calculation and analysis at the end of the first nine months of 2016, a provision of $979 thousand was recorded. As alluded to previously in this document, one loan that originated in 2008 and had performed as agreed until the second quarter of 2016 was partially charged off in the amount of $606 thousand. Total net charge offs for the year through September 30, 2016 were $733 thousand. The increase in net charge offs was the main reason behind the higher provision for loan losses in 2016. Loan growth absorbed much of the remaining available unallocated and contributed to the need for a higher provision in 2016.   
       
  Specific reserves are determined on a loan by loan basis and relate to loans classified as impaired. Management classifies loans as impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement.   Included in potentially impaired loan category are current  watch list  credits plus any additional credits which have been past due three or more times within the past 12-month period. Management individually reviews these potentially impaired loans based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) related to receivables and makes a determination if the loan in fact is impaired. Management does not consider a loan impaired during a period of delay in payment if management expects the ultimate collection of all amounts due. If a loan is found to be impaired, an allowance is established when the collateral value less estimated cost to dispose, discounted cash flows, or observable market price of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan.   Specific reserves for loans individually evaluated for impairment totaled $17 thousand at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  Impaired loans totaled $7.4 million at September 30, 2016, and were $474 thousand less than the balance at year end 2015.  One borrower with loans totaling $871 thousand at December 31, 2015 was upgraded and is no longer classified as impaired at September 30, 2016. The loan with a balance of $577 thousand that was placed on nonaccrual status was also added to impaired loans. The remaining decrease was the result of the receipt of loan payments.   
     
  The percentage of the allowance for loan losses to total loans was 0.88% and 0.90% at September 30, 2016, and December 31, 2015, respectively.  Unallocated reserves were $37 thousand at September 30, 2016 and $87 thousand at December 31, 2015. Some surplus or unallocated reserve is desirable given the inherent weakness in this type of predictive analysis. Net charges offs as a percent of average loans were 0.25% through September 30, 2016. Nonperforming loans were 0.23% and 0.12% of total loans at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The allowance for loan losses to nonaccrual loans was 379% at September 30, 2016 and 775% at December 31, 2015.   
     
    Liquidity    
     
  Liquidity is identified as the ability to generate or acquire sufficient amounts of cash when needed and at a reasonable cost to accommodate  
  withdrawals, payments of debt, and increased loan demand. Liquid assets include cash, federal funds sold, securities classified as available for sale as well as loans and securities maturing within one year. As a result of the Company s management of liquid assets and the ability to generate liquidity through liability funding, management believes the Company maintains overall liquidity sufficient to satisfy its depositors  requirements and meet its customers  credit needs.   
     
  The Company s management, under the direction of the Asset/Liability Committee of the Board of Directors, reviews the mix of monetary assets and liabilities to ensure the Company maintains an adequate level of liquidity at all times. This ensures that the Company s sources of funds, primarily net fluctuations in customer deposits, investment securities and correspondent banking relationships, must be balanced with the Company s obligations, commitments, and operational requirements, to maintain overall liquidity in conjunction with the maximization of interest rate spreads.   
     
  The Company s asset based liquidity position, cash and due from bank balances, federal funds sold, loans held for sale, securities available for sale, net of securities pledged and cash balance requirements totaled $65.1 million at September 30, 2016, compared to $73.0 million at December 31, 2015, and $72.8 million at September 30, 2015.   Higher levels of commercial noninterest bearing deposits contributed to higher levels of liquidity at the end of the third quarter 2015. Commercial deposits are by their nature highly volatile, and withdrawals may result in less liquidity in the future. To provide a more stable source of liquidity, at the end of the fourth quarter 2015, the Company issued $7.5 million in subordinated notes. Liquidity has trended downward as the funds from the debt issuance have been invested in earning assets and used for general operating purposes. Surges and declines in commercial deposits will continue to impact liquidity in an unpredictable manner. Commercial noninterest bearing deposits were $9.6 million higher at September 30, 2016 than at December 31, 2015, and $3.9 million higher than one year ago.   
     
  The Company s primary source of funding is its retail deposit base. The Company aggressively markets in its trade area and seeks demand deposits through service-related tactics and savings and time deposits through competitive pricing tactics. If this funding source is not attractive either for reasons of maturity or pricing, alternative funding sources include Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) advances, brokered deposits, fed funds purchased and lines of credit. The Company is approved to borrow 25% of total assets from the FHLB subject to providing qualifying collateral.  At September 30, 2016, the Company had borrowed $9.0 million of the $27.1 million of lendable collateral value, leaving $18.1 million of unused credit immediately available. The Company had $36.5 million of fed funds lines of credit available at September 30, 2016. At the end of the third quarter of 2016, there were no advances on the fed funds or guidance lines.   

30

Capital    
       
  To enable future growth of the Company, there must be an adequate level of capital. Management reviews the Company s capital to ensure that the amount, composition and quality of the Company s assets and liabilities satisfy regulatory requirements, meet or exceed industry standards, and support projected Company growth. The Company s stock is traded on the NASDAQ Capital Market under the symbol  HMTA.   
     
  At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had stockholders  equity of $48.3 million and $46.4 million, respectively, an increase of $1.9 million or 4.1%. The 4% common stock dividend declared by the Board of Directors on May 10, 2016 to holders of record June 9, 2016 was distributed on July 11, 2016. The stock dividend increased the number of shares issued and outstanding by 134,177 to a total of 5,763,944 on July 11, 2016. The stock dividend shifted $1.3 million from retained earnings to common stock and surplus.   
     
  The remaining preferred shares were converted to common stock in June, 2016 eliminating the dividend of 6% per year in future quarters. Each share of Series C preferred stock converted into 166.4 shares of common stock, which was comprised of the conversion factor of 160 plus the benefit of the 4% stock dividend of 6.4 additional shares.    
     
  The ability to pay cash dividends to common stockholders is limited by regulatory restrictions and the need to maintain sufficient capital in the Company and in our subsidiaries. The Company must consider different factors to ensure that any future cash dividends to common stockholders would be prudent relative to the organization s financial position and not based on overly optimistic earnings scenarios. The Company had $657 thousand of retained earnings at September 30, 2016. No cash dividends were paid to common stockholders in the first nine months of 2016.  
     
  The Basel III capital framework represents the most comprehensive overhaul of the U.S. banking capital framework in over two decades. This new capital framework and related changes to the standardized calculations of risk-weighted assets are complex and create additional compliance burdens.   Basel III rules became effective for the Company on January 1, 2015 with full compliance with all of the requirements being phased in over a multi-year schedule. The Basel III Capital Rules require significantly more capital and adopted more demanding regulatory capital risk weightings and calculations. As a result of the Basel III Capital Rules, many community banks could be forced to limit banking operations and activities, and growth of loan portfolios, in order to focus on retention of earnings to improve capital levels. The Company believes that it maintains sufficient levels of Tier 1 and Common Equity Tier 1 capital to comply with the Basel III Final Rules. However, increased capital requirements imposed by the Basel III Capital Rules may require the Company to limit its banking operations, retain net income to improve regulatory capital levels, which could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.   
     
  The table presents the Bank s capital amounts and ratios calculated using the Basel III rules in effect at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.   
     
    Risk Based Capital Analysis    
     
   Capital Analysis   

The Bank s total capital increased $2.7 million from December 31, 2015 to September 30, 2016, primarily as the result of retaining the $2.4 million of the year to date September 30, 2016 net income attributable to the bank and noncontrolling interest.   
     
  The Company meets eligibility criteria of a small bank holding company in accordance with the Federal Reserve Board s Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement issued in February 2015, and is no longer obligated to report consolidated regulatory capital. In July 2013, the Federal Reserve Bank issued revised final rules that made technical changes to its market risk capital rules to align it with the Basel III regulatory capital framework and meet certain requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act. The final new capital rules required the Bank to comply with the following new minimum capital ratios, effective January 1, 2015: (1) a new common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5% of risk-weighted assets; (2) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6% of risk-weighted assets (increased from the previous requirement of 4%); (3) a total capital ratio of 8% of risk-weighted assets (unchanged from current requirement); and, (4) a leverage ratio of 4% of total assets.  Beginning January 1, 2016, a capital conservation buffer of .625% became effective. The capital conservation buffer will be gradually increased through January 1, 2019 to 2.5%. Banks will be required to maintain capital levels that meet the required minimum plus the capital conservation buffer in order to make distributions or discretionary bonus payments.

The Bank s actual capital amounts and ratios are also presented in the following tables:   

Financial Instruments with Off-Balance-Sheet Risk    
     
  In the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers, the Company is a party to financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk. These financial instruments involve commitments to extend credit. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated balance sheets.  
     
  The Company s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instruments for commitments to extend credit is represented by the contractual amount of those instruments. The same credit policy is used in making commitments as is used for on-balance-sheet risk.  
     
  At September 30, 2016 outstanding commitments to extend credit including letters of credit were $98.8 million. There are no commitments to extend credit on impaired loans.  
     
  Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no breach of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. The commitments may expire without ever being drawn upon; therefore, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash outlays for the Company.  
     
    Recent Accounting Pronouncements    
     
  In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15,  Presentation of Financial Statements   Going Concern (Subtopic 205-40): Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.  This update is intended to provide guidance about management s responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity s ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. Management is required under the new guidance to evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date the financial statements are issued when preparing financial statements for each interim and annual reporting period. If conditions or events are identified, the ASU specifies the process that must be followed by management and also clarifies the timing and content of going concern footnote disclosures in order to reduce diversity in practice. The amendments in this ASU are effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2014-15 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.   
     
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,  Financial Instruments   Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.  The amendments in ASU 2016-01, among other things: 1) Requires equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting, or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. 2) Requires public business entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes. 3) Requires separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset (i.e., securities or loans and receivables). 4) Eliminates the requirement for public business entities to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost. The amendments in this ASU are effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company is currently assessing the impact that ASU 2016-01 will have on its consolidated financial statements.  

32

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842).  Among other things, in the amendments in ASU 2016-02, lessees will be required to recognize the following for all leases (with the exception of short-term leases) at the commencement date: (1) A lease liability, which is a lessee s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis; and (2) A right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee s right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. Under the new guidance, lessor accounting is largely unchanged. Certain targeted improvements were made to align, where necessary, lessor accounting with the lessee accounting model and Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early application is permitted upon issuance. Lessees (for capital and operating leases) and lessors (for sales-type, direct financing, and operating leases) must apply a modified retrospective transition approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. The modified retrospective approach would not require any transition accounting for leases that expired before the earliest comparative period presented. Lessees and lessors may not apply a full retrospective transition approach. The Company is currently assessing the impact that ASU 2016-02 will have on its consolidated financial statements.  
     
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-07,  Investments - Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323): Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting.  Among other things, the amendments in ASU 2016-07, eliminate the requirement that when an investment qualifies for use of the equity method as a result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence, an investor must adjust the investment, results of operations, and retained earnings retroactively on a step-by-step basis as if the equity method had been in effect during all previous periods that the investment had been held. The amendments require that the equity method investor add the cost of acquiring the additional interest in the investee to the current basis of the investor's previously held interest and adopt the equity method of accounting as of the date the investment becomes qualified for equity method accounting. Therefore, upon qualifying for the equity method of accounting, no retroactive adjustment of the investment is required. The amendments require that an entity that has an available-for-sale equity security that becomes qualified for the equity method of accounting recognize through earnings the unrealized holding gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive income at the date the investment becomes qualified for use of the equity method. The amendments are effective for all entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016. The amendments should be applied prospectively upon their effective date to increases in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence that result in the adoption of the equity method. Early Adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact that ASU 2016-07 will have on its consolidated financial statements.  
     
  During March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,  Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Shares-Based Payment Accounting.  The amendments in this ASU simplify several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions including: (a) income tax consequences; (b) classification of awards as either equity or liabilities; and (c) classification on the statement of cash flows. The amendments are effective for public companies for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. The Company elected early adoption of ASU 2016-09 in the second quarter of 2016.   
     
  During June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,  Financial Instruments   Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.  The amendments in this ASU, among other things, require the measurement of all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Financial institutions and other organizations will now use forward-looking information to better inform their credit loss estimates. Many of the loss estimation techniques applied today will still be permitted, although the inputs to those techniques will change to reflect the full amount of expected credit losses. In addition, the ASU amends the accounting for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities and purchased financial assets with credit deterioration. The amendments in this ASU are effective for SEC filers for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019. For public companies that are not SEC filers, the amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020. The Company is currently assessing the impact that ASU 2016-13 will have on its consolidated financial statements.  
     
  During August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments , to address diversity in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. The amendments are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The amendments should be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented. If retrospective application is impractical for some of the issues addressed by the update, the amendments for those issues would be applied prospectively as of the earliest date practicable. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The Company does not expect the adoption of ASU 2016-15 to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.  
     
   ITEM 3.         QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK   
     
  Not applicable to smaller reporting companies.  

33

ITEM 4.         CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   
     
  As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.)  Based upon that evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls and procedures were effective.  
       
  The Company s management is also responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation of it that occurred during the Company s last fiscal quarter that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION   
     
   Item 1.         Legal Proceedings.   
     
  In the normal course of business, the Company becomes involved in litigation arising from the banking, financial and other activities it conducts.
