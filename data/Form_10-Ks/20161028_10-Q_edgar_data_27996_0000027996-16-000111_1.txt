Note 1: Consolidated financial statements 
    
  The consolidated balance sheet as of   September 30, 2016  , the consolidated statements of comprehensive income for the quarters and   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the consolidated statement of shareholders  equity for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , and the consolidated statements of cash flows for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   are unaudited. The consolidated balance sheet as of   December 31, 2015   was derived from audited consolidated financial statements, but does not include all disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the United States of America. In the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary for a fair statement of the consolidated financial statements are included. Adjustments consist only of normal recurring items, except for any discussed in the notes below. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year. The consolidated financial statements and notes are presented in accordance with instructions for Form 10-Q, and do not contain certain information included in our annual consolidated financial statements and notes. The consolidated financial statements and notes appearing in this report should be read in conjunction with the consolidated audited financial statements and related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   (the  2015 Form 10-K ). 
    
  During the quarter ended June 30, 2016, we identified an error in the balance sheet presentation of borrowings under our credit facility and the related asset for debt issuance costs. These amounts were previously presented as current items in our consolidated balance sheets, and we determined that they should have been presented as non-current. This change also corrects the presentation of the cash flows associated with borrowings under our credit facility. Previously these cash flows were presented on a net basis. The change in the balance sheet presentation requires that they be presented on a gross basis. 
    
  We assessed the materiality of this error on prior periods' financial statements in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 99,   Materiality  , codified in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 250,   Presentation of Financial Statements  . We concluded that the error was not material to any prior annual or interim period and therefore, amendments of previously filed reports are not required. In accordance with ASC 250, we have corrected the error for all prior periods presented by revising the consolidated financial statements appearing herein. Periods not presented herein will be revised, as applicable, in future filings. The revisions had no impact on total assets, total liabilities, shareholders' equity, net income or net cash used by financing activities. 
    
  The impact of this revision on our unaudited consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 was as follows: 

The impact of this revision on our unaudited consolidated statement of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was as follows:

Note 2: New accounting pronouncements 
    
  Recently adopted accounting pronouncements     In June 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-12,   Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period  . The standard requires that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period should be treated as a performance condition. As such, the performance target should not be reflected in estimating the grant-date fair value of the award. We adopted this standard on January 1, 2016. As our accounting treatment for these awards was in compliance with the new guidance, adoption of this standard had no impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03,   Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.   The standard requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the consolidated balance sheets as a direct reduction from the carrying amount of the debt liability. We adopted this standard on January 1, 2016, applying it retrospectively. The consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 reflects the reclassification of debt issuance costs of   $2,249   from other non-current assets to long-term debt. The amount of debt issuance costs included in long-term debt as of   September 30, 2016   was   $1,906  . In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-15,   Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements   Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to Staff Announcement at June 18, 2015 EITF Meeting  . This standard adds SEC paragraphs pursuant to the SEC Staff announcement at the June 18, 2015 Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) meeting about the presentation and subsequent measurement of debt issuance costs associated with line-of-credit arrangements. Under this guidance, the SEC Staff would not object to presenting such costs as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred costs ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings under the arrangement. Debt issuance costs of   $1,528   as of   September 30, 2016   and   $2,003   as of December 31, 2015 related to our line-of-credit arrangement. We continue to include these costs within other non-current assets, amortizing them over the term of the arrangement. 
    
  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-05,   Customer's Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement  . The standard provides guidance to customers about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license. If the arrangement does include a software license, the software license element of the arrangement should be accounted for in the same manner as the acquisition of other software licenses. We adopted this standard on January 1, 2016, applying it prospectively to all arrangements entered into or materially modified on or after January 1, 2016. Adoption of this standard did not have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial position. 
    
  In May 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-07,   Disclosures for Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or its Equivalent)  . Under the standard, investments measured at net asset value (NAV) as a practical expedient for fair value are excluded from the fair value hierarchy. As such, they are not assigned a fair value measurement level in financial statement disclosures of fair value. This standard was effective for us on January 1, 2016. It impacts the disclosures included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K regarding the plan assets of our postretirement benefit plan. As such, we will reflect this new guidance in the disclosures included in our Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2016, applying the guidance retrospectively to all periods presented. 
    
  In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11,   Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory  . The standard requires that inventory within the scope of the guidance be measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Previously, inventory was measured at the lower of cost or market. We elected to early adopt this standard on January 1, 2016, applying it prospectively. Application of this standard did not have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial position. 
    
  In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16,   Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments.   When recording the purchase price allocation for a business combination in the financial statements, an acquirer may record preliminary amounts when measurements are incomplete as of the end of a reporting period. When the required information is received to finalize the purchase price allocation, the preliminary amounts are adjusted. These adjustments are referred to as measurement-period adjustments. This standard eliminates the requirement to restate prior period financial statements for measurement-period adjustments. Instead, it requires that the cumulative impact of a measurement-period adjustment be recognized in the reporting period in which the adjustment is identified. We adopted this standard on January 1, 2016, applying it prospectively. Application of this standard did not have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial position.

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  .  The standard is intended to simplify various aspects of the accounting and presentation of share-based payments. We elected to early adopt this standard as of January 1, 2016. Adoption of this standard had the following impacts on our consolidated financial statements: 

Consolidated statements of comprehensive income     The new standard requires that the tax effects of share-based compensation be recognized in the income tax provision. Previously, these amounts were recognized in additional paid-in capital. Net tax benefits related to share-based compensation awards of   $234   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   and   $1,745   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   were recognized as reductions of income tax expense in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. These tax benefits reduced our effective income tax rate   0.3   points for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   and   0.7   points for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . In addition, in calculating potential common shares used to determine diluted earnings per share, GAAP requires us to use the treasury stock method. The new standard requires that assumed proceeds under the treasury stock method be modified to exclude the amount of excess tax benefits that would have been recognized in additional paid-in capital. These changes were applied on a prospective basis and resulted in an increase in diluted earnings per share of   $0.03   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  . These changes had   no   impact on diluted earnings per share for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  . 
       
  In recording share-based compensation expense, the standard allows companies to make a policy election as to whether they will include an estimate of awards expected to be forfeited or whether they will account for forfeitures as they occur. We have elected to include an estimate of forfeitures in the computation of our share-based compensation expense. As this treatment is consistent with previous guidance, this election had no impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

Consolidated statements of cash flows     The standard requires that excess tax benefits from share-based employee awards be reported as operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Previously, these cash flows were included in financing activities. We elected to apply this change on a prospective basis, resulting in an increase in net cash provided by operating activities and in net cash used by financing activities of   $2,069   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  . 
       
  The standard requires that employee taxes paid when an employer withholds shares for tax-withholding purposes be reported as financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Previously, these cash flows were included in operating activities. This change was required to be applied on a retrospective basis. As such, the consolidated statement of cash flows for the prior period was restated. This change resulted in an increase in net cash provided by operating activities and in net cash used by financing activities of   $2,333   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   $1,236   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,   Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments  . The standard is intended to reduce diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows. We elected to early adopt this standard as of July 1, 2016. As our consolidated statement of cash flows presentation was in compliance with the new guidance, adoption of this standard had no impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  Accounting pronouncements not yet adopted     In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers  . The standard provides revenue recognition guidance for any entity that enters into contracts with customers to transfer goods or services or enters into contracts for the transfer of non-financial assets, unless those contracts are within the scope of other accounting standards. The standard also expands the required financial statement disclosures regarding revenue recognition. The new guidance is effective for us on January 1, 2018. In addition, in March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08,   Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net)  , in April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10,   Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing,   and in May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12,   Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients  . These standards are intended to clarify aspects of ASU No. 2014-09 and are effective for us upon adoption of ASU No. 2014-09. We are currently assessing the impact of these standards on our consolidated financial statements, as well as the method of transition that we will use in adopting the new guidance. 
    
  In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01,   Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities  . The standard is intended to improve the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial

instruments. The guidance is effective for us on January 1, 2018. We do not expect the application of this standard to have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial position. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leasing  . The standard is intended to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by requiring the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities for virtually all leases and by requiring the disclosure of key information about leasing arrangements. The guidance is effective for us on January 1, 2019, and requires adoption using a modified retrospective approach. We are currently assessing the impact of this standard on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,   Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments  . The standard introduces new guidance for the accounting for credit losses on instruments within its scope, including trade and loans receivable and available-for-sale debt securities. The guidance is effective for us on January 1, 2020, and requires adoption using a modified retrospective approach. We do not expect the application of this standard to have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial position.

As such, the amounts on-hand are reported as funds held for customers in the consolidated balance sheets, with a corresponding liability included in accrued liabilities. The asset and liability of   $18,743   were recorded as acquisition measurement-period balance sheet adjustments during 2016. In addition, this cash included   $12,532   related to the September 2016 acquisition of Payce, Inc., a payroll services provider (see Note 6).

In March 2016, we acquired selected assets of New England Art Publishers, Inc., doing business as Birchcraft Studios, a supplier of personalized invitations, holiday cards, all-occasion cards and social announcements.  
                
    In June 2016, we acquired selected assets of L.A.M. Enterprises, Inc., a provider of printed and promotional products. 
       
  During the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , we completed several acquisitions which are included within our Small Business Services segment and for which we expect to finalize the allocation of the purchase price by the end of 2016 when our valuation of all of the acquired assets and liabilities is completed, as well as the determination of the estimated useful lives of the acquired customer lists. These acquisitions were as follows: 

In April 2016, we acquired selected assets of 180 Fusion LLC, a digital marketing services provider. The preliminary allocation of the purchase price based upon the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed resulted in tax-deductible goodwill of   $575  . The acquisition resulted in goodwill as we expect it will enhance our Small Business Services product set by providing valuable marketing tools to our customers, thus, enhancing customer acquisition and loyalty. 
                
    In June 2016, we acquired selected assets of Liquid Web, LLC, a web hosting services provider. 
                
    In June 2016, we acquired selected assets of National Document Solutions, LLC, a provider of printing, promotional products, office products, scanning and document management solutions. 
                
    In July 2016, we acquired selected assets of  Inkhead, Inc., a provider of customized promotional products.  The preliminary allocation of the purchase price based upon the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed resulted in tax-deductible goodwill of   $4,421  . The acquisition resulted in goodwill as it enables us to diversify our promotional product offerings and bring these offerings to our customer base. 
                
    In August 2016, we acquired selected assets of BNBS, Inc., doing business as B B Solutions, a provider of printing, promotional and office products and services. 
                
    In September 2016, we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of Payce, Inc., a provider of payroll processing, payroll tax filing and related payroll services. The preliminary allocation of the purchase price based upon the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed resulted in tax-deductible goodwill of   $7,979  . The acquisition resulted in goodwill as we expect Payce's expertise, customer mix and operational strength to enhance our existing portfolio of small business services. 
       
  Also during the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , we acquired the operations of several small business distributors which are included in our Small Business Services segment. The assets acquired consisted primarily of customer list intangible assets. As these distributors were previously part of our Safeguard  distributor network, our revenue was not impacted by these acquisitions and the impact to our costs was not significant. We expect to finalize the allocations of the purchase price by the end of 2016 when our valuations of the acquired customer lists are completed, including the determination of the related estimated useful lives.

As our acquisitions were not significant to our operating results both individually and in the aggregate, pro forma results of operations are not provided. The following illustrates the preliminary allocation as of   September 30, 2016   of the aggregate purchase price for the above acquisitions to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed: 

(1)    Consists of pre-acquisition amounts owed to us by certain of the acquired businesses. 
    
  Further information regarding the calculation of the estimated fair values of the intangibles acquired can be found in Note 8. 
  During the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , we finalized purchase accounting for the acquisition of Datamyx LLC, which was acquired in October 2015. Further information regarding this acquisition can be found under the caption  Note 5: Acquisitions  in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in the 2015 Form 10-K. The adjustments recorded during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   increased goodwill   $172   from the preliminary amount recorded as of December 31, 2015, with the offset to various assets and liabilities, primarily property, plant and equipment and other current assets. 
    
  During the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  , we acquired selected assets of Range, Inc., a marketing services provider; Verify Valid LLC, a provider of electronic check payment services; Tech Assets, Inc., a provider of shared hosting websites to small businesses using cPanel web hosting technology; and FMC Resource Management Corporation, a marketing services provider, as well as the operations of   eight   small business distributors,   five   of which were previously part of our Safeguard distributor network. The assets acquired consisted primarily of customer list intangible assets and goodwill. Payments for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, as presented on the consolidated statement of cash flows for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  , included payments of   $46,796   for these acquisitions and   $4,137   for holdback payments for prior year acquisitions. Further information regarding our 2015 acquisitions can be found under the caption  Note 5: Acquisitions  in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in the 2015 Form 10-K. 

Note 7: Derivative financial instruments 
    
  We have entered into interest rate swaps, which we designated as fair value hedges, to hedge against changes in the fair value of a portion of our long-term debt. At the time we entered into these swaps in 2012, we were targeting a mix of fixed and variable rate debt, where we receive a fixed rate and pay a variable rate based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). The interest rate swaps related to our long-term debt due in 2020 have a notional amount of   $200,000   and meet the criteria for using the short-cut method for a fair value hedge based on the structure of the hedging relationship. As such, changes in the fair value of the derivatives and the related long-term debt are equal. The fair value of these interest rate swaps was included in other non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets and was   $109   as of   September 30, 2016   and   $4,842   as of   December 31, 2015  . As the short-cut method is being used to account for these hedges, the consolidated balance sheets included a decrease in long-term debt of   $109   as of   September 30, 2016   and   $4,842   as of   December 31, 2015   due to fair value adjustments.

Note 8: Fair value measurements 
    
  Annual asset impairment analyses     We evaluate the carrying value of goodwill and our indefinite-lived trade name as of   July 31   of each year and between annual evaluations if events occur or circumstances change that would indicate a possible impairment. Our policy on impairment of indefinite-lived intangibles and goodwill, which is included under the caption "Note 1: Significant accounting policies" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in the 2015 Form 10-K, explains our methodology for assessing impairment of these assets. In completing the 2016 annual goodwill impairment analysis, we elected to perform a qualitative assessment for all of our reporting units to which goodwill is assigned, with one exception. We elected to perform a quantitative analysis for our Financial Services Commercial reporting unit as the previous  quantitative analysis completed as of July 31, 2015 indicated that the estimated fair value of this reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately   13%  . This relatively small percentage was primarily due to the fact that the reporting unit had been recently acquired. 
    
  Our qualitative analysis evaluated factors including, but not limited to, economic, market and industry conditions, cost factors and the overall financial performance of the reporting units. We also considered the quantitative analysis we completed as of July 31, 2014. In completing the 2016 qualitative analysis, we noted no changes in events or circumstances which would have required us to complete the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment analysis for any of the reporting units analyzed. The quantitative analysis completed for the Financial Services Commercial reporting unit indicated that its estimated fair value exceeded its carrying value by approximately   49%   as of July 31, 2016. Total goodwill for this reporting unit was approximately   $45,000   as of September 30, 2016. In completing the 2016 annual impairment analysis of our indefinite-lived trade name, we elected to perform a quantitative assessment which indicated that the calculated fair value of the asset exceeded its carrying value of   $19,100   by approximately   $32,000   as of July 31, 2016. We recorded   no   impairment charges as a result of our 2016 annual impairment analyses. 
    
  2016 acquisitions     For all acquisitions, we are required to measure the fair value of the net identifiable tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired, excluding goodwill and deferred income taxes. Information regarding the acquisitions completed during the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   can be found in Note 6. The identifiable net assets acquired during the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   were comprised primarily of customer lists with an aggregate fair value of   $48,982   and internal-use software with an aggregate fair value of   $10,250  . Fair value of the customer lists was estimated by discounting the estimated cash flows expected to be generated by the assets. Assumptions used in the calculations included same-customer revenue growth rates and estimated customer retention rates based on the acquirees' historical information. A portion of the fair value of the acquired software was estimated using the cost of reproduction method. The primary components of the software were identified and the estimated cost to reproduce the software was calculated based on data provided by the acquirees. The fair value of the remainder of the software was estimated using the relief from royalty method, which calculates the cost savings associated with owning rather than licensing the technology. Assumed royalty rates were applied to projected revenue for the remaining useful life of the software to estimate the royalty savings. Information regarding the useful lives of acquired intangibles can be found in Note 3. 
    
  Recurring fair value measurements     Funds held for customers included available-for-sale marketable securities (Note 3). These securities consisted of a mutual fund investment that invests in Canadian and provincial government securities, as well as investments in Canadian guaranteed investment certificates (GICs) with maturities of   one year   or less. The mutual fund is not traded in an active market and its fair value is determined by obtaining quoted prices in active markets for the underlying securities held by the fund. The fair value of the GICs approximated cost due to their relatively short duration. Unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated balance sheets. The cost of securities sold is determined using the average cost method. Realized gains and losses are included in revenue in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income and were not significant for the quarters or   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  
    
  Other current assets as of December 31, 2015 included available-for-sale marketable securities (Note 3). These securities were sold during the first quarter of 2016, and consisted of a Canadian money market fund that was not traded in an active market. As such, the fair value of this investment was determined by obtaining quoted prices in active markets for the underlying securities held by the fund. Because of the short-term nature of the underlying investments, the cost of these securities approximated their fair value.   No   gains or losses on sales of these marketable securities were realized during the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  .

We have elected to account for a long-term investment in domestic mutual funds under the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities. The fair value option provides companies an irrevocable option to measure many financial assets and liabilities at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings. The investment is included in long-term investments in the consolidated balance sheets. Long-term investments also include the cash surrender values of company-owned life insurance policies. Realized and unrealized gains and losses, as well as dividends earned by the mutual fund investment, are included in selling, general and administrative (SG A) expense in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. This investment corresponds to a liability under an officers  deferred compensation plan that is not available to new participants and is fully funded by the investment in mutual funds. The liability under the plan equals the fair value of the investment in mutual funds. Thus, as the value of the investment changes, the value of the liability changes accordingly. As changes in the liability are reflected within SG A expense in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income, the fair value option of accounting for the investment in mutual funds allows us to net changes in the investment and the related liability in the statements of comprehensive income. The cost of securities sold is determined using the average cost method. During the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , net realized gains were not significant. We recognized net unrealized losses of   $160   during the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   $333   during the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  The fair value of interest rate swaps (Note 7) is determined at each reporting date by means of a pricing model utilizing readily observable market interest rates. The change in fair value is determined as the change in the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted using the LIBOR rate. Our interest rate swaps relate to our long-term debt due in 2020 and meet the criteria for using the short-cut method for a fair value hedge based on the structure of the hedging relationship. As such, the changes in the fair value of the derivative and related long-term debt are equal.  
    
  Liabilities for contingent consideration relate to acquisitions completed during 2015. Information concerning these acquisitions can be found under the caption "Note 5: Acquisitions" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in the 2015 Form 10-K. Under the agreement related to the acquisition of Verify Valid, we are required to make annual contingent payments over a period of up to   eight years  , based on the revenue generated by the business. A specified payment percentage for each year is applied to the revenue generated by the business in that year to determine the amount of the payment.   There is no maximum amount of contingent payments specified in the agreement  . Under the agreement related to the acquisition of a small business distributor, we are required to make annual contingent payments over a period of up to   three years  , based on the gross profit generated by the business. A specified payment percentage for each year is applied to the gross profit generated by the business in that year to determine the amount of the payment. The maximum contingent payment in any year of the agreement is   $925  . The fair value of the liabilities for contingent payments is estimated by discounting to present value the probability-weighted contingent payments expected to be made. Assumptions used in the calculations include the discount rate, projected revenue or gross profit based on our most recent internal forecast, and factors indicating the probability of achieving the forecasted revenue or gross profit. The liabilities are remeasured each reporting period. Increases or decreases in projected revenue or gross profit and the related probabilities may result in a higher or lower fair value measurement. Changes in fair value resulting from changes in the timing, amount of, or likelihood of contingent payments are included in SG A expense in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Changes in fair value resulting from accretion for the passage of time are included in interest expense in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.  
    
  Information regarding recurring fair value measurements completed during each period was as follows:

Our policy is to recognize transfers between fair value levels as of the end of the reporting period in which the transfer occurred. There were   no   transfers between fair value levels during the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  .  
    
  Changes in accrued contingent consideration during the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   were as follows: 

Fair value measurements of other financial instruments     The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instrument for which it is practicable to estimate fair value. 
    
  Cash and cash included within funds held for customers   The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets approximate fair value because of the short-term nature of these items. 
    
  Loans and notes receivable from distributors   We have receivables for loans made to certain of our Safeguard distributors. In addition, we have acquired the operations of several small business distributors, which we then sold to our Safeguard distributors. In most cases, we entered into notes receivable upon the sale of the assets to the distributors. The fair value of these loans and notes receivable is calculated as the present value of expected future cash flows, discounted using an estimated interest rate based on published bond yields for companies of similar risk.  
    
  Long-term debt   The carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets for the amount drawn on our credit facility approximates fair value because our interest rate is variable and reflects current market rates. The fair value of our long-term notes due in 2020 is based on significant observable market inputs other than quoted prices in active markets. The fair value of long-term debt included in the table below does not reflect the impact of hedging activity or debt issuance costs. The carrying amount of long-term debt includes the change in fair value of hedged long-term debt, as well as unamortized debt issuance costs related to our notes due in 2020 (Note 11).

  (dollars and shares in thousands, except per share amounts) 

The net restructuring charges are reflected in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income as follows: 

During the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , the net restructuring accruals included severance charges related to employee reductions across functional areas as we continue to reduce costs, primarily within our sales and marketing, information technology and fulfillment functions. These charges were reduced by the reversal of restructuring accruals recorded in previous periods, as fewer employees received severance benefits than originally estimated. Other restructuring costs, which were expensed as incurred, included items such as information technology costs, employee and equipment moves, training and travel related to our restructuring activities. 
    
  Restructuring accruals of   $2,648   as of   September 30, 2016   and   $3,864   as of   December 31, 2015   are included in accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. The majority of the employee reductions are expected to be completed by the fourth quarter of 2016, and we expect most of the related severance payments to be paid by mid-2017, utilizing cash from operations. The remaining payments due under operating lease obligations will be paid by the end of 2016. As of   September 30, 2016  , approximately   25   employees had not yet started to receive severance benefits.  
    
  Accruals for our restructuring initiatives, summarized by year, were as follows:

Note 11: Debt 
    
  Debt outstanding was comprised of the following: 

Our senior notes due in 2020 include covenants that place certain restrictions on the issuance of additional debt and limitations on certain liens. If our ratio of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) to interest expense, as defined in such instruments, falls below   two   to one, there would be additional limitations on our ability to issue additional debt. The notes due in 2020 also include limitations on our ability to issue redeemable stock and preferred stock, make loans and investments, and consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets. Absent certain defined events of default under our debt instruments, and as long as our ratio of EBITDA to interest expense is in excess of   two   to one, our debt covenants do not restrict our ability to pay cash dividends at our current rate. There are currently no limitations on the amount of dividends and share repurchases under the terms of our credit facility agreement. However, if our leverage ratio, defined as total debt less unrestricted cash to EBITDA, should exceed   2.75   to one, there would be an annual limitation on the amount of dividends and share repurchases under the terms of this agreement. 
    
  In   November 2012  , we issued   $200,000   of   6.0%   senior notes maturing on   November 15, 2020  . The notes were issued via a private placement under Rule 144A of the Securities Act of 1933. These notes were subsequently registered with the SEC via a registration statement that became effective on April 3, 2013. Interest payments are due each May and November. The notes are guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries and place a limitation on restricted payments, including share repurchases and increases in dividend levels. The limitation on restricted payments does not apply if the notes are upgraded to an investment-grade credit rating. Financial information for the guarantor subsidiaries can be found in Note 15. Proceeds from the offering, net of offering costs, were   $196,340  . These proceeds were used to retire our senior notes that were due in June 2015. In October 2016, we issued a notice to redeem all of these notes on November 15, 2016 at a redemption price of   103%   of the principal amount. The fair value of these notes was   $206,758   as of   September 30, 2016  , based on quoted prices that are directly observable. As discussed in Note 7, we entered into interest rate swaps to hedge these notes. 
    
  In   March 2011  , we issued   $200,000   of   7.0%   senior notes that were scheduled to mature on   March 15, 2019  . The notes were issued via a private placement under Rule 144A of the Securities Act of 1933. These notes were subsequently registered with the SEC via a registration statement that became effective on January 10, 2012. Proceeds from the offering, net of offering costs, were   $196,195  . These proceeds were used to retire a portion of our senior, unsecured notes due in 2012. In March 2015, we retired all of these notes, realizing a loss on early debt extinguishment of   $8,917   during the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  , consisting of a contractual call premium and the write-off of related debt issuance costs. This retirement was funded utilizing our credit facility and a short-term bank loan that we have since repaid. 
    
  We had capital lease obligations of   $1,756   as of   September 30, 2016   and   $2,109   as of   December 31, 2015   related to information technology hardware. The lease obligations will be paid through   August 2020  . The related assets are included in property, plant and equipment in the consolidated balance sheets. Depreciation of the leased assets is included in depreciation expense in the consolidated statements of cash flows. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had a   $525,000   revolving credit facility, which is scheduled to expire in   February 2019  . Our quarterly commitment fee ranges from   0.20%   to   0.40%   based on our leverage ratio. As of   September 30, 2016  ,   $418,000   was drawn on our revolving credit facility at a weighted-average interest rate of   1.95%  . As of   December 31, 2015  ,   $434,000    
  
   23

  (dollars and shares in thousands, except per share amounts) 

was drawn on our revolving credit facility at a weighted-average interest rate of   1.89%  . In September 2016, we amended the credit agreement governing our credit facility to include a new term loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of   $200,000   in order to retire our senior notes due in 2020, which we expect to redeem on November 15, 2016. The term loan facility will be fully drawn on the date that it is funded and amounts repaid may not be reborrowed. Interest will be calculated at a variable rate and will be paid quarterly. Aggregate principal payments of   $21,250   will be due in 2017 and   $26,250   will be due in 2018, with the remainder due in February 2019 at the expiration of the credit agreement. We may prepay the term loan in full or in part at our discretion.  
    
  All borrowings under our credit agreement are collateralized by substantially all of our personal and intangible property. The credit agreement governing our credit facility contains customary covenants regarding limits on levels of subsidiary indebtedness and capital expenditures, liens, investments, acquisitions, certain mergers, certain asset sales outside the ordinary course of business, and change in control as defined in the agreement. The agreement also contains financial covenants regarding our leverage ratio, interest coverage and liquidity.  
    
  In   March 2015  , we entered into a   $75,000   short-term variable rate bank loan. Proceeds from this loan, net of related costs, were   $74,880   and were used, along with a draw on our credit facility, to retire all   $200,000   of our   7.0%   senior notes that were scheduled to mature on   March 15, 2019  . During December 2015, we elected to repay this loan in full. 
    
  Daily average amounts outstanding under our credit facility and short-term borrowings were as follows: 

As of   September 30, 2016  , amounts were available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility as follows: 

(1)    We use standby letters of credit to collateralize certain obligations related primarily  to our self-insured workers  compensation claims, as well as claims for environmental matters, as required by certain states. These letters of credit reduce the amount available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility. 

Note 12:  Other commitments and contingencies 
    
  Indemnifications     In the normal course of business, we periodically enter into agreements that incorporate general indemnification language. These indemnifications encompass third-party claims arising from our products and services, including, without limitation, service failures, breach of security, intellectual property rights, governmental regulations and/or employment-related matters. Performance under these indemnities would generally be triggered by our breach of the terms of the contract. In disposing of assets or businesses, we often provide representations, warranties and/or indemnities to cover various risks, including, for example, unknown damage to the assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition. We do not have the ability to estimate the potential liability from such indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions. While we do not believe that any liability under these indemnities would likely have a material adverse effect on our financial position, annual results of operations or  
  
   24

  (dollars and shares in thousands, except per share amounts) 

annual cash flows, inherent uncertainties exist regarding the scope and nature of such indemnities that could lead to material unfavorable outcomes. We have recorded liabilities for known indemnifications related to environmental matters.  
    
  Environmental matters     We are currently involved in environmental compliance, investigation and remediation activities at some of our current and former sites, primarily printing facilities of our Financial Services and Small Business Services segments that have been sold. Remediation costs are accrued on an undiscounted basis when the obligations are either known or considered probable and can be reasonably estimated. Remediation or testing costs that result directly from the sale of an asset and which we would not have otherwise incurred are considered direct costs of the sale of the asset. As such, they are included in our measurement of the carrying value of the asset sold. 
    
  Accruals for environmental matters were   $3,329   as of   September 30, 2016   and   $5,952   as of   December 31, 2015  , primarily related to facilities that have been sold. These accruals are included in accrued liabilities and other non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. Accrued costs consist of direct costs of the remediation activities, primarily fees that will be paid to outside engineering and consulting firms. Although recorded accruals include our best estimates, our total costs cannot be predicted with certainty due to various factors such as the extent of corrective action that may be required, evolving environmental laws and regulations and advances in environmental technology. Where the available information is sufficient to estimate the amount of the liability, that estimate is used. Where the information is only sufficient to establish a range of probable liability and no point within the range is more likely than any other, the lower end of the range is recorded. We do not believe that the range of possible outcomes could have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. The consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   included a benefit from environmental matters of   $1,759  . During the quarter ended June 30, 2016, we reversed a portion of the liability for one of our sold facilities as we determined that it was no longer probable that a portion of the estimated environmental remediation costs for this location would be incurred. Environmental expense was   $915   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  .  
    
   We purchased an insurance policy during 2002 that covers up to   $10,000   of third-party pollution claims through 2032 at certain owned, leased and divested sites. We also purchased an insurance policy during 2009 that covers up to   $15,000   of third-party pollution claims through April 2019. This policy covers liability for claims of bodily injury or property damage arising from pollution events at the covered facilities. The policy also provides remediation coverage should we be required by a governing authority to perform remediation activities at the covered sites.   No   accruals have been recorded in our consolidated financial statements for any of the events contemplated in these insurance policies. We do not anticipate significant net cash outlays for environmental matters during 2016.  
    
  Self-insurance     We are self-insured for certain costs, primarily workers' compensation claims and medical and dental benefits for active employees and those employees on long-term disability. The liabilities associated with these items represent our best estimate of the ultimate obligations for reported claims plus those incurred, but not reported, and totaled   $6,766   as of   September 30, 2016   and   $6,457   as of   December 31, 2015  . These accruals are included in accrued liabilities and other non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. Our workers' compensation liability is accounted for on a present value basis. The difference between the discounted and undiscounted liability was not significant as of   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Our self-insurance liabilities are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future events and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. 
    
  Litigation     On September 2, 2014, one of our suppliers filed a petition for binding arbitration under the Commercial Rules of the American Arbitration Association, alleging that it is entitled to additional payment from us under our reseller agreement and seeking damages of up to approximately   $43,000  . We did not record a liability for damages in connection with this matter in our consolidated balance sheets. In March 2016, the arbitrator rejected all of the supplier's claims and ruled in our favor.  
    
  Recorded liabilities for legal matters were not material to our financial position, results of operations or liquidity, and we do not believe that any of the currently identified claims or litigation will materially affect our financial position, results of operations or liquidity upon resolution. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings could occur. If an unfavorable ruling were to occur, it may cause a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity for the period in which the ruling occurs or in future periods.

Note 14: Business segment information 
    
  We operate   three   reportable business segments: Small Business Services, Financial Services and Direct Checks. Our business segments are generally organized by type of customer served and reflect the way we manage the company. Small Business Services promotes and sells products and services to small businesses via direct response mail and internet advertising; referrals from financial institutions, telecommunications clients and other partners; networks of distributors and independent dealers; a direct sales force that focuses on selling to and through major accounts; and an outbound telemarketing group. Financial Services' products and services are sold primarily through a direct sales force, which executes product and service supply contracts with our financial institution clients nationwide, including banks, credit unions and financial services companies. In the case of check supply contracts, once the financial institution relationship is established, consumers may submit their check orders through their financial institution or over the phone or internet. Direct Checks sells products and services directly to consumers using direct marketing, including print advertising and search engine marketing and optimization strategies. All three segments operate primarily in the United States. Small Business Services also has operations in Canada and portions of Europe. 
    
  Our product and service offerings are comprised of the following: 
    
  Checks     We remain one of the largest providers of checks in the United States. During 2015, checks represented   40.1%   of our Small Business Services segment's revenue,   59.7%   of our Financial Services segment's revenue and   84.6%   of our Direct Checks segment's revenue. 
    
  Marketing solutions and other services     We offer products and services that help small businesses and/or financial institutions promote their businesses and acquire customers, as well as various other service offerings. Our Small Business Services segment offers services designed to fulfill the marketing and sales needs of small businesses, including logo and web design; hosting and other web services; search engine optimization; marketing programs, including email, mobile, social media and other self-service marketing solutions; and digital printing services. In addition, Small Business Services offers specialized services, including fraud protection and security, payroll services and electronic checks, as well as promotional solutions such as postcards, brochures, retail packaging supplies, apparel, greeting cards and business cards. Financial Services offers a suite of financial technology ("FinTech") solutions focused on enabling financial institutions to better manage the customer life cycle for their retail and commercial customers. These FinTech solutions include outsourced marketing campaign targeting and execution, digital channel onboarding, loyalty and rewards, technology-enabled treasury services, financial performance management, and fraud protection and security services. Our Direct Checks segment provides fraud protection and security services, as well as package insert programs under which companies' marketing materials are included in our check packages.  
    
  Forms     Our Small Business Services segment provides printed forms to small businesses, including deposit tickets, billing forms, work orders, job proposals, purchase orders, invoices and personnel forms. This segment also offers computer forms compatible with accounting software packages commonly used by small businesses. Forms sold by our Financial Services and Direct Checks segments include deposit tickets and check registers. 
    
  Accessories and other products     Small Business Services offers products designed to supply small business owners with the customized documents necessary to efficiently manage their business, including envelopes, office supplies, stamps and labels. Our Financial Services and Direct Checks segments offer checkbook covers and stamps.

  (dollars and shares in thousands, except per share amounts) 

The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in the 2015 Form 10-K. We allocate corporate costs for our shared services functions to our business segments, including costs of our executive management, human resources, supply chain, finance, information technology and legal functions. Generally, where costs incurred are directly attributable to a business segment, primarily within the areas of information technology, supply chain, finance and legal, those costs are charged directly to that segment. Because we use a shared services approach for many of our functions, certain costs are not directly attributable to a business segment. These costs are allocated to our business segments based on segment revenue, as revenue is a measure of the relative size and magnitude of each segment and indicates the level of corporate shared services consumed by each segment. Corporate assets are not allocated to the segments and consist of property, plant and equipment; internal-use software; and inventories and supplies related to our corporate shared services functions of manufacturing, information technology and real estate, as well as long-term investments. 
    
  We are an integrated enterprise, characterized by substantial intersegment cooperation, cost allocations and the sharing of assets. Therefore, we do not represent that these segments, if operated independently, would report the operating income and other financial information shown.  
    
  The following is our segment information as of and for the quarters ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  :

The following is our segment information as of and for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  : 

Note 15: Supplemental guarantor financial information 
    
  Our long-term notes due in 2020 (Note 11), as well as obligations under our credit facility, are jointly and severally guaranteed on a full and unconditional basis, subject to the release provisions described herein, by certain 100%-owned subsidiaries. The subsidiary guarantees with respect to our long-term notes are subject to release upon the occurrence of certain events: the sale of all or substantially all of a subsidiary's assets, when the requirements for defeasance of the guaranteed securities have been satisfied, when the subsidiary is declared an unrestricted subsidiary, or upon satisfaction and discharge of the indenture. 
    
  The following supplemental condensed consolidating financial information reflects the summarized financial information of Deluxe Corporation, the guarantors on a combined basis and the non-guarantor subsidiaries on a combined basis. Separate financial statements of the guarantors are not presented because the guarantors are jointly, severally, fully and unconditionally liable under the guarantees, subject to the release provisions described herein, and we believe that the condensed consolidating financial statements presented are sufficient to provide an understanding of the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of the guarantors. During the quarter ended June 30, 2016, we identified an error in the balance sheet presentation of borrowings under our credit facility and the related asset for debt issuance costs. These amounts were previously presented as current items in our consolidated balance sheets, and we have determined that they should have been presented as non-current. This change also corrects the presentation of the cash flows associated with borrowings under our credit facility. Previously these cash flows were presented on a net basis. The change in the balance sheet presentation requires that they be presented on a gross basis. Prior period consolidated amounts, as well as those for Deluxe Corporation, have been revised to reflect these changes. Further information about the revision can be found in Note 1.  
    
  We are an integrated enterprise, characterized by substantial intersegment cooperation, cost allocations and the sharing of assets. Therefore, we do not represent that the financial information presented is indicative of the financial position, results of operations or cash flows that the entities would have reported if they had operated independently. The condensed consolidating financial statements should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements.

Note 16: Subsequent events 
    
  In October 2016, we issued a notice to redeem all   $200,000   of our senior notes due in 2020 on November 15, 2016 at a redemption price of   103%   of the principal amount. We plan to utilize borrowings under our recently expanded credit facility to fund the redemption (see Note 11). In conjunction with the redemption, we plan to terminate our   $200,000   of interest rate swaps (see Note 7). 
    
  In October 2016, we acquired selected assets of Data Support Systems, Inc. for aggregate estimated cash payments of   $21,000  , subject to post-closing adjustments, and including estimated contingent consideration. Data Support Systems is a provider of image-based software for payments reconciliation and back-office case management and will be included in our Financial Services segment. The allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed has not yet been determined. 

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW 
    
  We provide a suite of customer life cycle management solutions that help our customers acquire and engage their customers across multiple channels. To promote and sell a wide range of products and services, we use printed and electronic marketing; a direct sales force; referrals from financial institutions, telecommunication clients and other partners; purchased search results from online search engines; and networks of distributors and independent dealers. Our Small Business Services segment provides products and services to approximately 4.5 million small business customers and our Direct Checks segment has provided products and services to more than six million consumers. Through our Financial Services segment, we provide products and services to approximately 5,100 financial institution clients. We operate primarily in the United States. Small Business Services also has operations in Canada and portions of Europe. Our product and service offerings are comprised of the following: 
    
  Checks     We remain one of the largest providers of checks in the United States. During 2015, checks represented   40.1%   of our Small Business Services segment's revenue,   59.7%   of our Financial Services segment's revenue and   84.6%   of our Direct Checks segment's revenue. 
    
  Marketing solutions and other services     We offer products and services that help small businesses and/or financial institutions promote their businesses and acquire customers, as well as various other service offerings. Our Small Business Services segment offers services designed to fulfill the marketing and sales needs of small businesses, including logo and web design; hosting and other web services; search engine optimization; marketing programs, including email, mobile, social media and other self-service marketing solutions; and digital printing services. In addition, Small Business Services offers specialized services, including fraud protection and security, payroll services and electronic checks, as well as promotional solutions such as postcards, brochures, retail packaging supplies, apparel, greeting cards and business cards. Financial Services offers a suite of financial technology ("FinTech") solutions focused on enabling financial institutions to better manage the customer life cycle for their retail and commercial customers. These FinTech solutions include outsourced marketing campaign targeting and execution, digital channel onboarding, loyalty and rewards, technology-enabled treasury services, financial performance management, and fraud protection and security services. Our Direct Checks segment provides fraud protection and security services, as well as package insert programs under which companies' marketing materials are included in our check packages.  
    
  Forms     Our Small Business Services segment is a leading provider of printed forms to small businesses, including deposit tickets, billing forms, work orders, job proposals, purchase orders, invoices and personnel forms. This segment also offers computer forms compatible with accounting software packages commonly used by small businesses. Forms sold by our Financial Services and Direct Checks segments include deposit tickets and check registers. 
    
  Accessories and other products     Small Business Services offers products designed to provide small business owners with the customized documents necessary to efficiently manage their business, including envelopes, office supplies, stamps and labels. Our Financial Services and Direct Checks segments offer checkbook covers and stamps. 
    
  Throughout the past several years, we have focused on opportunities to increase revenue, while maintaining strong operating margins. These opportunities have included new product and service offerings, brand awareness and positioning initiatives, investing in technology for our service offerings, enhancing our internet capabilities, improving customer  
  
   37 

segmentation, adding new small business customers, and reducing costs. In addition, we invested in various acquisitions that extend the range of products and services we offer to our customers, primarily marketing solutions and other services offerings. Information about our acquisitions can be found under the captions  Note 6: Acquisitions  and "Note 16: Subsequent events" of the Condensed Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in Item 1 of this report and under the caption "Note 5: Acquisitions" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 (the "2015 Form 10-K"). During the remainder of 2016, we plan to continue our focus in these areas, with an emphasis on profitable revenue growth and increasing the mix of marketing solutions and other services revenue. We also plan to continue small-to-medium-sized acquisitions that complement our large customer bases, with a focus on marketing solutions and other services.  
    
  Earnings for the first nine months of 2016, as compared to the first nine months of 2015, benefited from price increases and continuing initiatives to reduce our cost structure, primarily within our sales, marketing and fulfillment organizations. These increases in earnings were partially offset by volume reductions for both personal and business checks, due primarily to the continuing decline in check usage, as well as increased investments in revenue growth opportunities. 
    
  Certain amounts included in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015 and our consolidated statement of cash flows for the first nine months of 2015 have been revised to correct the presentation of borrowings under our credit facility and the related asset for debt issuance costs. Further information can be found under the caption  Note 1: Consolidated financial statements  of the Condensed Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in Item 1 of this report. 
    
  Our Strategies 
    
  Details concerning our strategies were provided under the caption "Business Segments" appearing in Item 1 of the 2015 Form 10-K. We made no significant changes to our strategies during the first nine months of 2016. 
    
  Consistent with our strategies, during the first nine months of 2016, we acquired selected assets of several businesses and the outstanding common stock of one business in our Small Business Services segment. Further information regarding these acquisitions can be found under the captions "Note 6: Acquisitions" and "Note 16: Subsequent events" of the Condensed Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in Item 1 of this report. 
    
  Cost Reduction Initiatives 
    
  As discussed in the   Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   section of the 2015 Form 10-K, we anticipated that we would realize net cost reductions of approximately   $50 million   in 2016, as compared to our 2015 results of operations. We are currently on track to realize these cost reductions, primarily from our sales, marketing and fulfillment organizations. Approximately 70% of these savings are expected to impact selling, general and administrative (SG A) expense, with the remaining 30% affecting cost of revenue. 
    
  Outlook for 2016 
    
  We anticipate that consolidated revenue will be between   $1.850 billion   and   $1.860 billion   for 2016, compared to   $1.773 billion   for 2015. In Small Business Services, we expect revenue to increase between 4% and 5% compared to 2015 revenue of   $1.152 billion  . Volume declines in core business products and the negative impact of foreign exchange rates are expected to be more than offset by growth in our online, dealer and major accounts channels, price increases, and growth in our marketing solutions and other services offerings, as well as the impact of continued small tuck-in acquisitions. In Financial Services, we expect revenue to increase between 9% and 10% compared to 2015 revenue of   $455.4 million  . We expect continued growth in marketing solutions and other services, including incremental revenue from the acquisitions of Datamyx in October 2015 and FISC Solutions in December 2015, as well as growth in Wausau Financial Systems and Deluxe Rewards revenue and the impact of small tuck-in acquisitions. We expect these revenue increases to be partially offset by year-over-year secular check order declines of approximately 4%, as well as the impact of expected contract renewal allowances. In Direct Checks, we expect revenue to decline approximately 8%, compared to 2015 revenue of   $165.5 million  , driven primarily by secular check order volume declines resulting from reduced check usage. 
    
  We expect that 2016 diluted earnings per share will be between   $4.78   and   $4.83  , including charges of   $0.17   per share related to a loss on early debt extinguishment we expect in the fourth quarter of 2016, as well as restructuring costs and transaction costs related to acquisitions. This compares to   $4.36   for 2015, which included total charges of   $0.23   per share related to the loss on early debt extinguishment in the first quarter of 2015, as well as restructuring costs and transaction costs related to acquisitions. We expect that the benefits of our cost reduction activities will be partially offset by a continued  
  
   38 

sluggish economy and increases in medical expenses, material costs and delivery rates, as well as continued investments in revenue growth opportunities, including brand awareness, marketing solutions and other services offers, and enhanced internet capabilities. We estimate that our annual effective tax rate for 2016 will be approximately   33%  , consistent with   33.3%   for 2015.  
    
  We anticipate that net cash provided by operating activities will be between   $315 million   and   $320 million   in 2016, compared to   $310 million   in 2015, driven by stronger operating performance and lower interest payments, partially offset by higher income tax, contract acquisition and employee medical payments. We anticipate contract acquisition payments of approximately   $25 million   in 2016, and we estimate that capital spending will be approximately   $43 million   in 2016, as we continue to invest in key revenue growth initiatives and order fulfillment and information technology infrastructure. 
    
  We believe that cash generated by operating activities, along with availability under our credit facility, will be sufficient to support our operations for the next 12 months, including dividend payments, capital expenditures, required interest payments, and periodic share repurchases, as well as possible small-to-medium-sized acquisitions. We expect to maintain a disciplined approach to capital deployment that focuses on our need to continue investing in initiatives to drive revenue growth, including small-to-medium-sized acquisitions and continued expansion of our distributor and major accounts channels. We anticipate that our board of directors will maintain our current dividend level. However, dividends are approved by the board of directors on a quarterly basis, and thus are subject to change. As of   September 30, 2016  ,   $94.2 million   was available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility. To the extent we generate excess cash, we plan to reduce the amount outstanding under our credit facility. In September 2016, we amended the credit agreement governing our credit facility to provide a new term loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of   $200.0 million  . On November 15, 2016, we expect to use this term loan, as needed, to redeem our remaining senior notes of   $200.0 million   at a redemption price of   103%   of the principal amount. This redemption is expected to result in a loss on early debt extinguishment of approximately   $0.11   per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2016. In conjunction with the redemption, we plan to terminate our   $200.0 million   of interest rate swaps. We believe our increasing cash flow, strong balance sheet and flexible capital structure position us well to continue advancing our transformation. 

BUSINESS CHALLENGES/MARKET RISKS 
    
  Information regarding business challenges/market risks was provided in the   Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   section of the 2015 Form 10-K. There were no significant changes in these items during the first nine months of 2016. 

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
    
  Consolidated Revenue 

(1)    Orders is our company-wide measure of volume and includes both products and services. 
       
  The increase in total revenue for the   third   quarter and first nine months of 2016, as compared to the same periods in 2015, was primarily due to growth in marketing solutions and other services revenue of $21 million for the   third   quarter of 2016 and $65 million for the first nine months of 2016, including incremental revenue from businesses acquired during 2016 and 2015. Information regarding our acquisitions can be found under the caption  Note 6: Acquisitions  of the Condensed Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in Item 1 of this report and under the caption "Note 5: Acquisitions" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in the 2015 Form 10-K. In addition, revenue benefited from previous price increases. These revenue increases were partially offset by lower order volume for both personal and business checks, as well as contract renewal allowances within Financial Services. 

39 

Service revenue represented   20.3%   of total revenue for the first nine months of 2016 and   17.8%   for the first nine months of 2015. As such, the majority of our revenue is generated by product sales. We do not manage our business based on product versus service revenue. Instead, we analyze our products and services based on the following categories: 

The number of orders decreased for the   third   quarter and first nine months of 2016, as compared to the same periods in 2015, due primarily to the continuing decline in check and forms usage, partially offset by growth in marketing solutions and other services, including the impact of acquisitions in 2016 and 2015. Revenue per order increased for the   third   quarter and first nine months of 2016, as compared to the same periods in 2015, primarily due to the benefit of previous price increases and favorable product and service mix, partially offset by the impact of Financial Services contract renewal allowances. 
    
  Consolidated Cost of Revenue 

Cost of revenue consists primarily of raw materials used to manufacture our products, shipping and handling costs, third-party costs for outsourced products and services, payroll and related expenses, information technology costs, depreciation and amortization of assets used in the production process and in support of our service offerings, and related overhead. 
    
  The increase in total cost of revenue for the   third   quarter and first nine months of 2016, as compared to the same periods in 2015, was primarily attributable to the growth in revenue, including an increase in outsourced product costs of $2 million for the   third   quarter of 2016 and $13 million for the first nine months of 2016, primarily resulting from investments to expand our distributor and major accounts channels. In addition, the businesses acquired in 2015 in our Financial Services segment incurred incremental costs of approximately $4 million for the   third   quarter of 2016 and $13 million for the first nine months of 2016, and delivery rates and material costs increased in 2016. Partially offsetting these increases in total cost of revenue were the impact of lower order volume for both personal and business checks, as well as manufacturing efficiencies and other benefits resulting from our continued cost reduction initiatives of approximately $4 million for the   third   quarter of 2016 and $12 million for the first nine months of 2016. In addition, during the first nine months of 2016, we reduced by $2 million a liability for environmental remediation costs related to a manufacturing facility which we previously sold. 
    
  Consolidated Selling, General   Administrative Expense 

The increase in SG A expense for the   third   quarter and first nine months of 2016, as compared to the same periods in 2015, was driven primarily by incremental operating expenses of the businesses we acquired in 2015 in our Financial Services segment of approximately $7 million for the   third   quarter of 2016 and $21 million for the first nine months of 2016, as well as investments in revenue growth opportunities, including investments to expand our major accounts channel. These increases were partially offset by various expense reduction initiatives of approximately $8 million for the   third   quarter of 2016 and $21  
  
   40 

million for the first nine months of 2016, primarily within our sales and marketing organizations, as well as lower incentive compensation expense. 
    
  Net Restructuring Charges 

We recorded net restructuring charges related to the cost reduction initiatives discussed under   Executive     Overview  . The net charges for each period relate primarily to costs of our restructuring activities, such as employee severance benefits, information technology costs, employee and equipment moves, training and travel. Further information can be found under   Restructuring Costs  . 
    
  Loss on Early Debt Extinguishment   

During the first quarter of 2015, we retired all   $200.0 million   of our   7.0%   senior notes due in   March 2019  , realizing a pre-tax loss of   $8.9 million  , consisting of a contractual call premium and the write-off of related debt issuance costs. We funded the retirement utilizing our credit facility and a short-term bank loan that we have since repaid. On November 15, 2016, we expect to redeem all $200.0 million of our senior notes due in 2020 at a redemption price of   103%   of the principal amount. This redemption is expected to result in a loss on early debt extinguishment of approximately   $0.11   per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2016.  
    
  Interest Expense 

The increase in interest expense for the   third   quarter of 2016, as compared to the   third   quarter of 2015, was primarily due to our higher weighted-average debt level in 2016 and the slight increase in our weighted-average interest rate. 
    
  The slight decrease in interest expense for the first nine months of 2016, as compared to the first nine months of 2015, was driven by changes in our debt structure. In March 2015, we retired   $200.0 million   of long-term debt with an interest rate of   7.0%  . We utilized our credit facility and a short-term bank loan, which we have since repaid, to fund this redemption. Amounts outstanding under our credit facility carried a weighted-average interest rate of   1.9%   during the first nine months of 2016. Partially offsetting the decrease in interest expense resulting from our lower weighted-average interest rate, was our higher weighted-average debt level in 2016. 
    
  Income Tax Provision 

The decrease in our effective tax rate for the   third   quarter and first nine months of 2016, as compared to the same periods in 2015, was primarily due to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09,   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting,   which reduced income tax expense   $0.2 million   for the   third   quarter of 2016 and   $1.7 million   for the first nine months of 2016. This resulted in a reduction in our effective income tax rate of   0.3   points for the   third    
  
   41 

quarter of 2016 and   0.7   points for the first nine months of 2016. Further information regarding the adoption of this accounting standard can be found under the caption "Note 2: New accounting pronouncements" of the Condensed Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in Item 1 of this report. In addition, our effective tax rate for the   third   quarter and first nine months of 2016 included the benefit of the federal research and development credit, which we were not able to record in the same periods in 2015, as legislation extending the credit had not yet been enacted. Partially offsetting these decreases in our effective income tax rate for the third quarter of 2016 were a number of individually minor items which increased our effective income tax rate. We expect that our annual effective tax rate for 2016 will be approximately   33%  . 

RESTRUCTURING COSTS 
    
  We have recorded expenses related to our restructuring activities, including accruals consisting primarily of employee severance benefits, as well as costs that are expensed when incurred, including information technology costs, employee and equipment moves, training and travel. Our restructuring activities are driven by our cost reduction initiatives and include employee reductions in various functional areas, as well as the closing of facilities. During the first nine months of 2016, we closed a call center, a fulfillment facility and a sales office. During 2015, we closed two call centers, a sales office, a warehouse, a fulfillment facility and one facility that contained both fulfillment and call center functions. Restructuring costs have been reduced by the reversal of severance accruals when fewer employees receive severance benefits than originally estimated.   
    
  Net restructuring charges for each period were as follows: 

The majority of the employee reductions included in our restructuring accruals are expected to be completed by the fourth quarter of 2016, and we expect most of the related severance payments to be paid by mid-2017, utilizing cash from operations. 
    
  As a result of our employee reductions and facility closings, we expect to realize cost savings of approximately   $3 million   in total cost of revenue and   $11 million   in SG A expense in 2016, in comparison to our 2015 results of operations, which represents a portion of the estimated   $50 million   of total net cost reductions we expect to realize in 2016. Expense reductions consist primarily of labor and facility costs. Information about the other initiatives driving our cost savings can be found in   Executive Overview  . 
    
  Further information regarding our restructuring charges can be found under the caption  Note 9: Restructuring charges  of the Condensed Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in Item 1 of this report. 

SEGMENT RESULTS 
    
  Additional financial information regarding our business segments appears under the caption  Note 14: Business segment information  of the Condensed Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in Item 1 of this report.  

42 

Small Business Services 
    
  This segment's products and services are promoted through direct response mail and internet advertising; referrals from financial institutions, telecommunications clients and other partners; networks of distributors and independent dealers; a growing direct sales force that focuses on selling to and through major accounts; and an outbound telemarketing group. Results for this segment were as follows: 

The increase in total revenue for the   third   quarter and first nine months of 2016, as compared to the same periods in 2015, was due primarily to growth in marketing solutions and other services revenue of $9 million for the   third   quarter of 2016 and $26 million for the first nine months of 2016, including incremental revenue from businesses acquired in 2016 and 2015. Information about our acquisitions can be found under the caption  Note 6: Acquisitions  of the Condensed Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in Item 1 of this report and under the caption "Note 5: Acquisitions" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in the 2015 Form 10-K. In addition, revenue benefited from previous price increases. These increases in revenue were partially offset by a decrease in business check and forms volume, as well as an unfavorable currency exchange rate impact of $3 million for the first nine months of 2016.  
    
  The decrease in operating income for the third quarter of 2016, as compared to the third quarter of 2015, was primarily due to increased investments in revenue growth opportunities, including investments to expand our major accounts channel and brand awareness initiatives, as well as increased delivery rates and material costs in 2016. Partially offsetting these decreases in operating income were price increases, benefits of our cost reduction initiatives and lower incentive compensation expense. 
    
  The increase in operating income for the first nine months of 2016, as compared to the first nine months of 2015, was primarily due to price increases and benefits of our cost reduction initiatives. Partially offsetting these increases in operating income were increased investments in revenue growth opportunities, including investments to expand our major accounts channel. In addition, delivery rates and material costs increased in 2016 and commission expense increased approximately $3 million due primarily to increased financial institution commission rates. 
    
  Financial Services 
    
   Financial Services' products and services are sold primarily through a direct sales force, which executes product and service supply contracts with our financial institution clients nationwide, including banks, credit unions and financial services companies. In the case of check supply contracts, once the financial institution relationship is established, consumers may submit their check orders through their financial institution or over the phone or internet. Results for this segment were as follows: 

The increase in revenue for the   third   quarter and first nine months of 2016, as compared to the same periods in 2015, was driven by growth in marketing solutions and other services of $13 million for the   third   quarter of 2016 and $40 million for the first nine months of 2016, including incremental revenue from the acquisitions of Datamyx LLC and FISC Solutions in 2015 of $11 million for the   third   quarter of 2016 and $35 million for the first nine months of 2016. In addition, Wausau Financial Systems revenues increased $1 million for the   third   quarter of 2016 and $5 million for the first nine months of 2016. Information about our acquisitions can be found under the caption "Note 5: Acquisitions" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in the 2015 Form 10-K. Additionally, revenue benefited from previous price increases. Partially offsetting these revenue increases was lower check order volume due to the continued decline in check usage, as well as the impact of contract renewal allowances. 

43 

The increase in operating income for the   third   quarter and first nine months of 2016, as compared to the same periods in 2015, was primarily due to previous price increases, the benefit of our continuing cost reduction initiatives and compensation expense in 2015 for an earn-out agreement related to a 2013 acquisition. Partially offsetting these increases in operating income was the impact of lower check order volume, contract renewal allowances and increased delivery and material costs in 2016. The operating results of our acquisitions, including acquisition-related amortization, reduced Financial Services' operating margin 2.2 points for the   third   quarter of 2016 and 2.0 points for the first nine months of 2016. 
    
  Direct Checks 
    
  Direct Checks sells products and services directly to consumers using direct marketing, including print advertising and search engine marketing and optimization strategies. Direct Checks sells under various brand names, including Checks Unlimited , Designer  Checks, Checks.com, Check Gallery , The Styles Check Company , and Artistic Checks , among others. Results for this segment were as follows: 

The decrease in revenue for the   third   quarter of 2016, as compared to the the   third   quarter of 2015, was primarily due to a reduction in orders stemming from the continued decline in check usage. Partially offsetting the volume decline was higher revenue per order, driven by price increases and other initiatives to improve revenue per order. 
    
  The decrease in revenue for the first   nine months   of 2016, as compared to the first   nine months   of 2015, was primarily due to a reduction in orders stemming from the continued decline in check usage. Partially offsetting the volume decline was higher revenue per order, primarily driven by an improved call center incentive plan. 
    
  The decrease in operating income for the   third   quarter and first nine months of 2016, as compared to the same periods in 2015, was due primarily to lower order volume and increased delivery rates and material costs in 2016, as well as increased  restructuring costs in 2016. These decreases in operating income were partially offset by the benefits from our cost reduction initiatives, including lower advertising expense, as well as higher revenue per order. 

CASH FLOWS AND LIQUIDITY 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we held cash and cash equivalents of   $80.1 million  . The following table shows our cash flow activity for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated statements of cash flows appearing in Item 1 of this report. 

The   $11.0 million   decrease in net cash provided by operating activities for the first nine months of 2016, as compared to the first nine months of 2015, was primarily due to a   $10.4 million   increase in income tax payments, a   $7.3 million   increase in contract acquisition payments and the payment in 2016 of an incentive related to a 2013 acquisition. These decreases in cash provided by operating activities were partially offset by stronger operating performance and a   $4.2 million   decrease in interest payments due primarily to the retirement of long-term notes in March 2015. 

44 

Included in net cash provided by operating activities were the following operating cash outflows: 

(1)    Amounts reflect compensation based on total company performance. 
    
  Net cash used by investing activities for the first nine months of 2016 was   $14.7 million   higher than the first nine months of 2015, driven primarily by a   $13.7 million   increase in payments for acquisitions and a   $2.7 million   increase in capital asset purchases. Partially offsetting this increase in cash used by investing activities was proceeds from the sale of Canadian marketable securities during 2016.  
    
  Net cash used by financing activities for the first nine months of 2016 was   $32.0 million   lower than the first nine months of 2015 due primarily to a decrease of   $189.4 million   in payments on long-term debt driven primarily by the 2015 redemption of   $200.0 million   of long-term notes due in 2019. Partially offsetting this decrease in net cash used by financing activities was a decrease of $157.5 million in amounts borrowed under our credit facility and short-term borrowings, as we utilized these borrowings in 2015 to redeem the long-term notes due in 2019. 
    
  Significant cash inflows, excluding those related to operating activities, for each period were as follows: 

Significant cash outflows, excluding those related to operating activities, for each period were as follows: 

As of   September 30, 2016  , our subsidiaries located in Canada held cash and cash equivalents of   $65.0 million  . Deferred income taxes have not been recognized on unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, as these amounts are intended to be reinvested indefinitely in the operations of those subsidiaries. If we were to repatriate all of the Canadian cash and cash equivalents into the United States at one time, we would incur a federal tax liability of approximately   $6.5 million  , based on current federal tax law. 
    
  We anticipate that net cash provided by operating activities will be between   $315 million   and   $320 million   in 2016, compared to   $310 million   in 2015, driven by stronger operating performance and lower interest payments, partially offset by higher income tax, contract acquisition and employee medical payments. We anticipate that net cash provided by operating activities in 2016 will be utilized for dividend payments, capital expenditures of approximately   $43 million  , periodic share repurchases and small-to-medium-sized acquisitions. We intend to focus our capital spending on key revenue growth initiatives and investments in order fulfillment and information technology infrastructure. As of   September 30, 2016  ,   $94.2 million   was  
  
   45 

available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility. We believe that cash generated by operating activities, along with availability under our credit facility, will be sufficient to support our operations for the next 12 months, including dividend payments, capital expenditures and required interest payments, as well as periodic share repurchases and small-to-medium-sized acquisitions. To the extent we generate excess cash, we plan to reduce the amount outstanding under our credit facility. 

CAPITAL RESOURCES 
    
  Our total debt was   $617.7 million   as of   September 30, 2016  , a decrease of   $11.3 million   from   December 31, 2015  . We have entered into interest rate swaps to hedge against changes in the fair value of a portion of our long-term debt. Further information concerning our outstanding debt and related interest rate swaps can be found under the captions  Note 11: Debt  and  Note 7: Derivative financial instruments  of the Condensed Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in Item 1 of this report. Information regarding our debt service obligations can be found under   Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, Guarantees and Contractual Obligations   in the 2015 Form 10-K. 
    
  Our capital structure for each period was as follows: 

We have an outstanding authorization from our board of directors to purchase up to   10 million   shares of our common stock. This authorization has no expiration date, and   0.2 million   shares remained available for purchase under this authorization as of   September 30, 2016  . During the first nine months of   2016  , we repurchased   0.7 million   shares for   $44.9 million  . In May 2016, our board of directors approved an additional authorization for the repurchase of up to   $300.0 million   of our common stock, effective at the conclusion of our previous authorization. The additional authorization also has no expiration date. Information regarding changes in shareholders' equity can be found in the consolidated statement of shareholders' equity appearing in Item 1 of this report. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had a   $525.0 million   revolving credit facility, which is scheduled to expire in   February 2019  . Our quarterly commitment fee ranges from   0.20%   to   0.40%   based on our leverage ratio. In September 2016, we amended the credit agreement governing our credit facility to include a new term loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of   $200.0 million   in order to retire our senior notes due in 2020, which we expect to redeem on November 15, 2016. The term loan facility will be fully drawn on the date that it is funded and amounts repaid may not be reborrowed.  
    
  Borrowings under our credit agreement are collateralized by substantially all of our personal and intangible property. The credit agreement governing our credit facility contains customary covenants regarding limits on levels of subsidiary indebtedness and capital expenditures, liens, investments, acquisitions, certain mergers, certain asset sales outside the ordinary course of business, and change in control as defined in the agreement. The agreement also contains financial covenants regarding our leverage ratio, interest coverage and liquidity. We were in compliance with all debt covenants as of   September 30, 2016  , and we expect to remain in compliance with all debt covenants throughout the next 12 months. 

46 

As of   September 30, 2016  ,   $418.0 million   was drawn on our revolving credit facility at a weighted-average interest rate of   2.0%  . As of   December 31, 2015  ,   $434.0 million   was drawn on our revolving credit facility at a weighted-average interest rate of   1.9%  . As of   September 30, 2016  , amounts were available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility as follows: 

(1)    We use standby letters of credit to collateralize certain obligations related primarily to our self-insured workers  compensation claims, as well as claims for environmental matters, as required by certain states. These letters of credit reduce the amount available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility. 

OTHER FINANCIAL POSITION INFORMATION 
    
  Acquisitions     The impact of acquisitions on our consolidated balance sheet as of   September 30, 2016   can be found under the caption  Note 6: Acquisitions  of the Condensed Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in Item 1 of this report. 
    
  Contract acquisition costs     Other non-current assets include contract acquisition costs of our Financial Services segment. These costs, which are essentially pre-paid product discounts, are recorded as non-current assets upon contract execution and are amortized, generally on the straight-line basis, as reductions of revenue over the related contract term. Changes in contract acquisition costs during the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   can be found under the caption "Note 3: Supplemental balance sheet information" of the Condensed Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in Item 1 of this report. Cash payments for contract acquisition costs were   $17.2 million   for the first nine months of 2016 and   $9.8 million   for the first nine months of 2015. We anticipate cash payments of approximately   $25 million   for the year ending December 31, 2016.  
    
  The number of checks being written has been declining, which has contributed to increased competitive pressure when attempting to retain or acquire clients. Both the number of financial institution clients requesting contract acquisition payments and the amount of the payments has fluctuated from year to year. Although we anticipate that we will selectively continue to make contract acquisition payments, we cannot quantify future amounts with certainty. The amount paid depends on numerous factors, such as the number and timing of contract executions and renewals, competitors  actions, overall product discount levels and the structure of up-front product discount payments versus providing higher discount levels throughout the term of the contract.  
    
  Liabilities for contract acquisition payments are recorded upon contract execution. These obligations are monitored for each contract and are adjusted as payments are made. Contract acquisition payments due within the next year are included in accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. These accruals were   $12.0 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   $9.0 million   as of   December 31, 2015  . Accruals for contract acquisition payments included in other non-current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets were   $32.3 million   as of   September 30, 2016   and   $29.2 million   as of   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Funds held for customers     Funds held for customers was   $92.2 million   as of   September 30, 2016  , an increase of   $38.8 million   from   December 31, 2015  . The increase was driven by acquisitions. In December 2015, we acquired FISC Solutions, which provides cash receipt processing services. A portion of the cash receipts are remitted to our clients the business day following receipt. As such, the amounts on-hand are reported as funds held for customers in the consolidated balance sheets, with a corresponding liability included in accrued liabilities. The asset and liability of   $18.7 million   were recorded as acquisition measurement-period balance sheet adjustments during 2016. In addition, we acquired funds held for customers, and assumed the related liability, of   $12.5 million   related to the September 2016 acquisition of Payce, Inc., a payroll services provider. 

47 

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS, GUARANTEES AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS 
    
  It is not our general business practice to enter into off-balance sheet arrangements or to guarantee the performance of third parties. In the normal course of business we periodically enter into agreements that incorporate general indemnification language. These indemnifications encompass third-party claims arising from our products and services, including, without limitation, service failures, breach of security, intellectual property rights, governmental regulations and/or employment-related matters. Performance under these indemnities would generally be triggered by our breach of terms of the contract. In disposing of assets or businesses, we often provide representations, warranties and/or indemnities to cover various risks, including, for example, unknown damage to the assets, environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate, liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities, and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition. We do not have the ability to estimate the potential liability from such indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions. While we do not believe that any liability under these indemnities would likely have a material adverse effect on our financial position, annual results of operations or annual cash flows, inherent uncertainties exist regarding the scope and nature of such indemnities that could lead to material unfavorable outcomes. We have recorded liabilities for known indemnifications related to environmental matters. Further information regarding our environmental liabilities, as well as liabilities related to self-insurance and litigation, can be found under the caption  Note 12: Other commitments and contingencies  of the Condensed Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in the Item 1 of this report. 
    
  We are not engaged in any transactions, arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other third parties that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our liquidity or on our access to, or requirements for, capital resources. In addition, we have not established any special purpose entities. 
    
  A table of our contractual obligations was provided in the   Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   section of the 2015 Form 10-K. There were no significant changes in these obligations during the first nine months of 2016. 

RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
    
  We did not enter into any material related party transactions during the first nine months of 2016 or during 2015. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
    
  A description of our critical accounting policies was provided in the   Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   section of the 2015 Form 10-K. There were no changes in these policies during the first nine months of 2016. 
    
  During the third quarter of 2016, we completed the annual impairment analysis of goodwill and our indefinite-lived trade name. In completing the 2016 annual goodwill impairment analysis, we elected to perform a qualitative assessment for all 
  of our reporting units to which goodwill is assigned, with one exception. We elected to perform a quantitative analysis for our Financial Services Commercial reporting unit as the previous quantitative analysis completed as of July 31, 2015 indicated that the estimated fair value of this reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately   13%  . This relatively small percentage was primarily due to the fact that the reporting unit had been recently acquired. 
    
  Our qualitative analysis evaluated factors including, but not limited to, economic, market and industry conditions, cost factors and the overall financial performance of the reporting units. We also considered the quantitative analysis we completed as of July 31, 2014 in which the estimated fair values of our reporting units' net assets exceeded their carrying values by approximate amounts between $74.0 million and $1.13 billion, or by amounts between 47% and 482% above the carrying values of their net assets. In completing our 2016 qualitative analysis, we noted no changes in events or circumstances which would have required us to complete the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment analysis for any of the reporting units analyzed. In addition, the quantitative analysis completed for our Financial Services Commercial reporting unit indicated that its fair value exceeded its carrying value by approximately   49%  . This impairment assessment is sensitive to changes in forecasted cash flows, as well as our selected discount rate of 10%. Changes in the reporting unit's results, forecast assumptions and estimates could materially affect the estimation of the fair value of this reporting unit. Total goodwill for this reporting unit was approximately   $45.0 million   as of September 30, 2016. 

48 

In completing the annual impairment analysis of our indefinite-lived trade name, we elected to perform a quantitative assessment. This assessment indicated that the estimated fair value of the asset exceeded its carrying value of   $19.1 million   by approximately   $32.0 million  . In this analysis, we assumed a discount rate of 10.0% and a royalty rate of 1.5%. A one-half percentage point increase in the discount rate would reduce the indicated fair value of the asset by approximately $3.0 million and a one-half percentage point decrease in the royalty rate would reduce the indicated fair value of the asset by approximately $17.0 million. 

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 
    
  Information regarding accounting pronouncements adopted during the first nine months of 2016 and those not yet adopted can be found under the caption  Note 2: New accounting pronouncements  of the Condensed Notes to Unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in Item 1 of this report. 

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS 
    
  The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the Reform Act) provides a  safe harbor  for forward-looking statements to encourage companies to provide prospective information. We are filing this cautionary statement in connection with the Reform Act. When we use the words or phrases  should result,   believe,   intend,   plan,   are expected to,   targeted,   will continue,   will approximate,   is anticipated,   estimate,   project,   outlook,  "forecast" or similar expressions in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, in future filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in our press releases and in oral statements made by our representatives, they indicate forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Reform Act. 
    
  We want to caution you that any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf are subject to uncertainties and other factors that could cause them to be incorrect. Known material risks are discussed in Item 1A of the 2015 Form 10-K and are incorporated into this Item 2 of this report on Form 10-Q as if fully stated herein. Although we have attempted to compile a comprehensive list of these important factors, we want to caution you that other factors may prove to be important in affecting future operating results. New factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of these factors, nor can we assess the impact each factor or combination of factors may have on our business.  
    
  You are further cautioned not to place undue reliance on those forward-looking statements because they speak only of our views as of the date the statements were made. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.  

Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
    
  We are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of the borrowing activities used to support our capital structure, maintain liquidity and fund business operations. We do not enter into financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. The nature and amount of debt outstanding can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements, market conditions and other factors. As of   September 30, 2016  , our total debt was comprised of the following: 

(1)    For the amount drawn on our revolving credit facility, fair value equals carrying value because our interest rate is variable and reflects current market rates. For our long-term notes, fair value is based on significant observable market inputs other than quoted prices in active markets. Capital lease obligations are presented at their carrying amount.  
    
   (2)    The carrying value has been reduced by unamortized debt issuance costs of   $1.9 million   and includes a decrease of   $0.1 million   related to the cumulative change in the fair value of hedged debt. 

49 

We have entered into interest rate swaps to hedge against changes in the fair value of a portion of our long-term debt. As of   September 30, 2016  , interest rate swaps with a notional amount of   $200.0 million   were designated as fair value hedges. The carrying amount of long-term debt as of   September 30, 2016   included a   $0.1 million   decrease related to adjusting the hedged debt for changes in its fair value. The interest rate swaps outstanding as of   September 30, 2016   related to our long-term debt due in 2020 and meet the criteria for using the short-cut method of accounting for a fair value hedge based on the structure of the hedging relationship. As such, changes in the fair value of the derivative and the related long-term debt are equal.  
    
  Based on the daily average amount of outstanding variable rate debt in our portfolio, a one percentage point change in our weighted-average interest rates would have resulted in a   $4.6 million   change in interest expense for the first nine months of 2016. 
    
  We are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Investments in, loans and advances to foreign subsidiaries and branches, as well as the operations of these businesses, are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the Canadian dollar. The effect of exchange rate changes is expected to have a minimal impact on our earnings and cash flows, as our foreign operations represent a relatively small portion of our business. We have not entered into hedges against changes in foreign currency exchange rates. 
    
  Information regarding business challenges/market risks was provided in the   Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   section of the 2015 Form 10-K. 

Item 4.  Controls and Procedures. 
    
  (a)    Disclosure Controls and Procedures     As of the end of the period covered by this report,   September 30, 2016   (the  Evaluation Date ), we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act )). Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (i) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in applicable rules and forms, and (ii) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 
    
  (b)   Internal Control Over Financial Reporting    There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with our evaluation during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

  We record provisions with respect to identified claims or lawsuits when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Claims and lawsuits are reviewed quarterly and provisions are taken or adjusted to reflect the status of a particular matter. We believe the recorded reserves in our consolidated financial statements are adequate in light of the probable and estimable outcomes. Recorded liabilities were not material to our financial position, results of operations or liquidity, and we do not believe that any of the currently identified claims or litigation will materially affect our financial position, results of operations or liquidity upon resolution. However, litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings could occur. If an unfavorable ruling were to occur, it may cause a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity in the period in which the ruling occurs or in future periods. 

Item 1A.  Risk Factors. 
    
  Our risk factors are outlined in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 (the  2015 Form 10-K ). There have been no significant changes to these risk factors since we filed the 2015 Form 10-K.

Item 2.  Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. 
    
  The following table shows purchases of our own equity securities, based on trade date, that were completed during the third quarter of 2016: 

(1)    Amounts do not include shares which may be purchased under an additional authorization approved by our board of directors in May 2016 for the repurchase of up to $300 million of our common stock. 
    
  In August 2003, our board of directors approved an authorization to purchase up to 10 million shares of our common stock. This authorization has no expiration date and   232,994   shares remained available for purchase under this authorization as of   September 30, 2016  . In May 2016, our board of directors approved an additional authorization for the repurchase of up to   $300 million   of our common stock, effective at the conclusion of our previous authorization. This authorization also has no expiration date. 
    
  While not considered repurchases of shares, we do at times withhold shares that would otherwise be issued under equity-based awards to cover the withholding taxes due as a result of the exercising or vesting of such awards. During the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , we withheld   1,086   shares in conjunction with the vesting and exercise of equity-based awards.

  (d)   Participations  .  By the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or an amendment to a Letter of Credit increasing the amount thereof) and without any further action on the part of the Issuing Bank or the Revolving Lenders, the Issuing Bank hereby grants to each Revolving Lender, and each Revolving Lender hereby acquires from the Issuing Bank, a participation in such Letter of Credit equal to such Revolving Lender s Applicable Percentage of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit.  In consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Revolving Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Issuing Bank, such Revolving Lender s Applicable Percentage of each LC Disbursement made by the Issuing Bank and not reimbursed by the Borrower on the date due as provided in   clause (e)   of this Section, or of any reimbursement payment required to be refunded to the Borrower for any reason.

  (e)   Reimbursement  .  If the Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit, the Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement by paying to the Administrative Agent in Dollars the amount equal to such LC Disbursement, calculated as of the date the Issuing Bank made such LC Disbursement not later than 11:00 a.m., Chicago time, on the date that such LC Disbursement is made, if the Borrower shall have  
  
   27 

received notice of such LC Disbursement prior to 9:00 a.m., Chicago time, on such date, or, if such notice has not been received by the Borrower prior to such time on such date, then not later than 11:00 a.m., Chicago time, on the Business Day immediately following the day that the Borrower receives such notice,   provided   that, if such LC Disbursement is not less than $1,000,000, the Borrower may, subject to the conditions to borrowing set forth herein, request in accordance with   Section 2.03   or   2.05   that such payment be financed with an ABR Revolving Borrowing or Swingline Loan in an equivalent amount of such LC Disbursement and, to the extent so financed, the Borrower s obligation to make such payment shall be discharged and replaced by the resulting ABR Revolving Borrowing or Swingline Loan.  If the Borrower fails to make such payment when due, the Administrative Agent  shall  notify  each  Revolving  Lender  of  the  applicable  LC  Disbursement, the payment then due from the Borrower in respect thereof and such Revolving Lender s Applicable Percentage thereof.  Promptly following receipt of such notice, each Revolving Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent its Applicable Percentage of the payment then due from the Borrower, in the same manner as provided in   Section 2.07   with respect to Loans made by such Lender (and   Section 2.07   shall apply,   mutatis     mutandis  , to the payment obligations of the Revolving Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the Issuing Bank the amounts so received by it from the Revolving Lenders. Promptly following receipt by the Administrative Agent of any payment from the Borrower pursuant to this paragraph, the Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to the Issuing Bank or, to the extent that Revolving Lenders have made payments pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse the Issuing Bank, then to such Revolving Lenders and the Issuing Bank as their interests may appear.

  (f)   Obligations Absolute  .  The Borrower s obligation to reimburse LC Disbursements as provided in   clause (e)   of this Section shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of (i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit or this Agreement, or any term or provision therein, (ii) any draft or other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment by the Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit, or (iv) any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or provide a right of setoff against, the Borrower s obligations hereunder.  Neither the Administrative Agent, the Revolving Lenders nor the Issuing Bank, nor any of their Related Parties, shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or transfer of any Letter of Credit or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in the preceding sentence), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to any Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the control of the Issuing Bank;   provided   that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse the Issuing Bank from liability to the Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to special, indirect, consequential or  punitive damages, claims in  respect  of  which are  hereby  waived by  the Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by the Borrower that are caused by the Issuing Bank s failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and other documents presented under a Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof.  The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Issuing Bank (as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), the Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination.   In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to documents presented which appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, the Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such Letter of Credit. 
    
  (g)   Disbursement Procedures  . The Issuing Bank shall, promptly following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit. The Issuing Bank  
  
   28 

shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower by telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of such demand for payment and whether the Issuing Bank has made or will make an LC Disbursement thereunder;   provided   that any failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse the Issuing Bank and the Revolving Lenders with respect to any such LC Disbursement. 
    
  (h)   Interim Interest  .  If the Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement, then, unless the Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement in full on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and including the date such LC Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that the Borrower reimburses such LC Disbursement, at the rate per annum then applicable to ABR Revolving Loans;   provided   that, if the Borrower fails to reimburse such LC Disbursement when due pursuant to   clause (e)   of this Section, then   Section 2.13(c)   shall apply.   Interest accrued pursuant to this paragraph shall be for the account of the Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any Revolving Lender pursuant to   clause     (e)   of this Section to reimburse the Issuing Bank shall be for the account of such Revolving Lender to the extent of such payment. 
    
  (i)   Replacement of Issuing Bank  .   The Issuing Bank may be replaced at any time by written agreement among the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the replaced Issuing Bank and the successor Issuing Bank.  The Administrative Agent shall notify the Revolving Lenders of any such replacement of the Issuing Bank.  At the time any such replacement shall become effective, the Borrower shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account of the replaced Issuing Bank pursuant to   Section 2.12(b)  . From and after the effective date of any such replacement, (i) the successor Issuing Bank shall have all the rights and obligations of the Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued thereafter and (ii) references herein to the term  Issuing Bank  shall be deemed to refer to such successor or to any previous Issuing Bank, or to such successor and all previous Issuing Banks, as the context shall require.  After the replacement of an Issuing Bank hereunder, the replaced Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and shall continue to have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit then outstanding and issued by it prior to such replacement, but shall not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit.

If any Event of Default shall occur and be continuing, on the Business Day that the Borrower receives notice from the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders (or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated, Revolving Lenders with LC Exposure representing greater than 50% of the total LC Exposure) demanding the deposit of cash collateral pursuant to this paragraph, the Borrower shall deposit in an account with the Administrative Agent, in the name of the Administrative Agent and for the benefit of the Revolving Lenders (the    LC Collateral Account   ), an amount in cash equal to 105% of the amount of the LC Exposure as of such date   plus   any accrued and unpaid interest thereon;   provided   that the obligation to deposit such cash collateral shall become effective immediately, and such deposit shall become immediately due and payable, without demand or other notice of any kind, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default with respect to the Borrower described in   clause (h)   or (i) of   Article VII  .  Such deposit shall be held by the Administrative Agent as collateral for the payment and performance of the Secured Obligations. The Administrative Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such account and the Borrower hereby grants the Administrative Agent a security interest in the LC Collateral Account.  Other than any interest earned on the investment of such deposits, which investments shall be made at the option and sole discretion of the Administrative Agent and at the Borrower s risk and expense, such deposits shall not bear interest. Interest or profits, if any, on such investments shall accumulate in such account. Moneys in such account shall be applied by the Administrative Agent to reimburse the Issuing Bank for LC Disbursements for which it has not been reimbursed and, to the extent not so applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of the Borrower for the LC Exposure at such time or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated (but subject to the consent of Revolving Lenders with LC Exposure  representing greater than 50% of the total LC Exposure), be applied to satisfy other Secured Obligations.  If the Borrower is required to provide an amount of cash collateral hereunder as a result of the occurrence of an Event of Default, such amount (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to the Borrower within three (3) Business Days after all Events of Default have been cured or waived. If the Borrower is required to provide an amount of cash collateral hereunder pursuant to   Section 2.11  , such amount (to the extent not applied is aforesaid) shall be returned to the Borrower as and to the extent that, after giving effect to such return, the Total Revolving Credit  
  
   29 

Exposure would not exceed the aggregate Revolving Commitments and no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing. 
    
  (k)   Existing Letters of Credit  .  Certain letters of credit issued for the account of the Borrower by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., and outstanding on the Effective Date are identified on   Schedule 2.06   (the    Existing Letters of Credit   ).  As of the Effective Date, (i) the Existing Letters of Credit shall be deemed to be Letters of Credit issued pursuant to and in compliance with this   Section 2.06  , (ii) the undrawn amount of the Existing Letters of Credit and the unreimbursed amount of LC Disbursements with respect to the Existing Letters of Credit shall be included in the calculation of LC Exposure and (iii) the provisions of this   Section 2.06   and   Section 2.12(b)   shall apply to the Existing Letters of Credit, and the Borrower and the Revolving Lenders hereby expressly acknowledge their respective obligations hereunder with respect to the Existing Letters of Credit. 
    
  SECTION 2.07.   Funding of Borrowings  .  (a)  Each Lender shall make each Loan to be made by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of immediately available funds by 12:00 p.m., Chicago time, to the account of the Administrative Agent most recently designated by it for such purpose by notice to the Lenders in an amount equal to such Lender s Applicable Percentage of the requested Borrowing;   provided   that Swingline Loans shall be made as provided in   Section 2.05  .   The Administrative Agent will make such Loans available to the Borrower by promptly crediting the amounts so received, in like funds, to an account of the Borrower designated by the Borrower in the applicable Borrowing Request;   provided   that ABR Revolving Loans made to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as provided in   Section 2.06(e)   shall be remitted by the Administrative Agent to the Issuing Bank. 
    
  (b) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender s share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with   clause (a)   of this Section and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount.  In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation or (ii) in the case of the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to ABR Loans;   provided  , that, to the extent the Borrower pays such interest, the Borrower shall not be required to pay any additional interest thereon it would otherwise be required to pay pursuant to   Section 2.13  .  If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender s Loan included in such Borrowing. 
    
  SECTION 2.08.   Interest Elections  .  (a)   Each Borrowing initially shall be of the Type specified in the applicable Borrowing Request and, in the case of a Eurodollar Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period as specified in such Borrowing Request.   Thereafter, the Borrower may elect to convert such Borrowing to  a  different Type or  to  continue such Borrowing and, in  the  case of  a Eurodollar Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods therefor, all as provided in this Section.  The Borrower may elect different options with respect to different portions of the affected Borrowing, in which case each such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing.  This Section shall not apply to Swingline Borrowings, which may not be converted or continued. 
    
  (b) To make an election pursuant to this Section, the Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such election by telephone by the time that a Borrowing Request would be required under   Section 2.03   if the Borrower were requesting a Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election to be made on the effective date of such election. Each such telephonic Interest Election Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by hand delivery or telecopy to the Administrative Agent of a written Interest Election Request signed by the Borrower.   Notwithstanding any contrary provision herein, this Section shall not be construed to permit the Borrower to elect an Interest Period for Eurodollar Loans that does not comply with   Section 2.02(d). 

30 

(c) Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request shall specify the following information in compliance with   Section 2.02  : 
    
  (i)         the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request applies and, if different options are being elected with respect to different portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting Borrowing (in which case the information to be specified pursuant to   clauses (iii)   and (  iv  ) below shall be specified for each resulting Borrowing); 
    
  (ii)        the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest Election Request, which shall be a Business Day; 
    
  (iii)        whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a Eurodollar Borrowing; and 
    
  (iv)       if the resulting Borrowing is a Eurodollar Borrowing, the Interest Period to be applicable thereto after giving effect to such election, which Interest Period shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term  Interest Period . 
    
  If any such Interest Election Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing but does not specify an Interest Period, then the Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of seven days  duration. 
    
  (d) Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of such Lender s portion of each resulting Borrowing. 
    
  (e) If the Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest Election Request with respect to a Eurodollar Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period such Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing.  Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders, so notifies the Borrower, then, so long as an Event of Default is continuing (i) no outstanding Borrowing may be converted to or continued as a Eurodollar Borrowing and (ii) unless repaid, each Eurodollar Borrowing shall be converted to a ABR Borrowing having an interest period of seven days  duration at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto. 
    
  SECTION 2.09.   Termination and Reduction of Commitments  .   (a)   Unless previously terminated, (i) the Term Loan Commitments shall terminate on the Term Loan Commitment Termination Date and (ii) the Revolving Loan Commitments and all other commitments hereunder shall terminate on the Maturity Date. 
    
  (b) The Borrower may at any time terminate, or from time to time reduce, the Revolving Commitments or, prior to the Term Loan Commitment Termination Date, the Term Loan Commitments;   provided   that (i) each reduction of the Revolving Commitments shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of $1,000,000 and not less than $5,000,000, (ii) each reduction of the Term Loan Commitments shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of $5,000,000 and not less than $25,000,000 and (iii) the Borrower shall not terminate or reduce the Revolving Commitments if, after giving effect to any concurrent prepayment of  the  Loans  in  accordance with    Section  2.11  ,  the  Total  Revolving Credit Exposure would exceed the aggregate Revolving Commitments. 
    
  (c) The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of any election to terminate or reduce the Commitments under   clause (b)   of this Section at least three (3) Business Days prior to the effective date of such termination or reduction, specifying such election and the effective date thereof. Promptly following receipt of any notice, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof.  Each notice delivered by the Borrower pursuant to this Section shall be irrevocable;   provided   that a notice of termination of the Commitments delivered by the Borrower may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Borrower (by notice to the Administrative Agent on or prior to the specified effective date) if such condition is not satisfied.  Any termination or reduction of the Commitments shall  
  
   31 

be permanent.  Each reduction of the Commitments shall be made ratably among the Lenders in accordance with their respective Commitments. 
    
  SECTION 2.10.   Repayment and  Amortization of  Loans; Evidence of  Debt  .  (a) The Borrower hereby unconditionally promises to pay (i) to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Revolving Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Revolving Loan on the Maturity Date and (ii) to the Swingline Lender the then unpaid principal amount of each Swingline Loan on the fifth Business Day after such Swingline Loan is made;   provided   that on each date that a Revolving Borrowing is made, the Borrower shall repay all Swingline Loans then outstanding and the proceeds of any such Borrowing shall be applied by the Administrative Agent to repay any Swingline Loans outstanding.  The Borrower shall repay Term Loans on each date set forth below in  the aggregate principal amount set forth opposite such date (as adjusted from time to time pursuant to   Section 2.11(a)   and   Section 2.11(b)  ) (it being understood that no principal payments shall be required on a date specified below if the Term Loans have not been drawn prior to such date): 

To the extent not previously repaid, all unpaid Term Loans shall be paid in full in Dollars by the Borrower on the Maturity Date. 
    
  (b) Each Lender shall  maintain in  accordance with  its  usual practice an  account or accounts evidencing the indebtedness of the Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Loan made by such Lender, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such Lender from time to time hereunder. 
    
  (c) The Administrative Agent shall maintain accounts in which it shall record (i) the amount of each Loan made hereunder, the Class and Type thereof and the Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each Lender hereunder and (iii) the amount of any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each Lender s share thereof. 
    
  (d) The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to   clause (b)   or (  c  ) of this Section shall be   prima     facie   evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein;   provided   that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. 
    
  (e) Any Lender may request that Loans made by it be evidenced by a promissory note. In such event, the Borrower shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable to the order of such Lender (or, if requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its registered assigns) and in a form approved by the Administrative Agent.  Thereafter, the Loans evidenced by such promissory note and interest thereon shall at all times (including after assignment pursuant to   Section 9.04  ) be represented by one or more promissory notes in such form payable to the order of the payee named therein (or, if such promissory note is a registered note, to such payee and its registered assigns). 
    
  SECTION 2.11.   Prepayment of Loans  . (a) The Borrower shall have the right at any time and from time to time to prepay any Borrowing in whole or in part, subject to prior notice in accordance with the provisions  
  
   32 

of this   Section 2.11  .  The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent (and, in the case of prepayment of a Swingline Loan, the Swingline Lender) by telephone (confirmed by telecopy) of any prepayment hereunder (i) in the case of prepayment of a Eurodollar Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., Chicago time, three (3) Business Days before the date of prepayment, (ii) in the case of prepayment of an ABR Borrowing, not later than 11:00 a.m., Chicago time, one (1) Business Day before the date of prepayment or (iii) in the case of prepayment of a Swingline Loan, not later than 11:00 a.m., Chicago time, on the date of prepayment.  Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the prepayment date and the principal amount of each Borrowing or portion thereof to be prepaid;   provided   that, if a notice of prepayment is given in connection with a conditional notice of termination of the Commitments as contemplated by   Section 2.09  , then such notice of prepayment may be revoked if such notice of termination is revoked in accordance with   Section 2.09  .  Promptly following receipt of any such notice relating to a Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof.  Each partial prepayment of any Borrowing shall be in an amount that would be permitted in the case of an advance of a Borrowing of the same Type as provided in   Section 2.02  .  Each prepayment of a Revolving Borrowing shall be applied ratably to the Revolving Loans included in the prepaid Revolving Borrowing, each voluntary prepayment of a Term Loan Borrowing shall be applied ratably to the Term Loans included in the prepaid Term Loan Borrowing in such order of application as directed by the Borrower and  each  mandatory  prepayment of  a  Term  Loan  Borrowing  shall  be  applied  in  accordance  with   Section 2.11(b)  .   Prepayments shall be accompanied by (i) accrued interest to the extent required by   Section 2.13   and (ii) break funding payments pursuant to   Section 2.16  . 
    
  (b) In the event and on each occasion that any Net Cash Proceeds are received by or on behalf of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in respect of any Prepayment Event, the Borrower shall, immediately after such Net Cash Proceeds are received, prepay the Term Loans in the inverse order of maturity in an aggregate amount equal to 100% of such Net Cash Proceeds;   provided   that, if the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent a certificate of a Financial Officer to the effect that the Borrower or its relevant Subsidiaries intend to apply the Net Cash Proceeds from any Prepayment Event (or a portion thereof specified in such certificate), within 270 days after receipt of such Net Cash Proceeds, to acquire (or replace or rebuild) real property, equipment or other tangible assets (excluding inventory) to be used in the business of the Borrower and/or its Subsidiaries, and certifying that no Default has occurred and is continuing, then no prepayment shall be required pursuant to this paragraph in respect of the Net Cash Proceeds specified in such certificate;   provided     further   that to the extent of any such Net Cash Proceeds therefrom that have not been so applied by the end of such 270 day period, at which time a prepayment shall be required in an amount equal to such Net Cash Proceeds that have not been so applied;   provided  ,   further   that the Borrower shall not be permitted to make elections to use Net Cash Proceeds to acquire (or replace or rebuild) real property, equipment or other tangible assets (excluding inventory) with respect to Net Cash Proceeds in any fiscal year in an aggregate amount in excess of 
  $75,000,000. 
    
  (c) If at any time the sum of the aggregate principal amount of all of the Revolving Credit Exposures exceeds the aggregate Revolving Commitments, the Borrower shall immediately repay Borrowings or cash collateralize LC Exposure in an account with the Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 2.06(j), as applicable, in an aggregate principal amount of all Revolving Credit Exposures to be less than or equal to the aggregate Revolving Commitments. 
    
  SECTION 2.12.   Fees  .  (a)The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender a commitment fee, which shall accrue at the Applicable Rate on the daily unused amount of the Revolving Commitment of such Revolving Lender during the period from and including the Effective Date to but excluding the date on which such Revolving Commitment terminates;   provided  , that for the purpose of calculating the commitment fee payable hereunder by the Borrower, such Lender s Applicable Percentage of the total Swingline Exposure at such time shall not be considered as part of the used portion of its Commitment.  Accrued commitment fees shall be payable quarterly in arrears on the last day of March, June, September and December of each year and on the date on which the Revolving Commitments terminate, commencing on the first such date to occur after the date hereof. The Borrower also agrees to pay the Administrative Agent for the account of each Lender a ticking fee, which shall accrue at the Applicable Rate on the average daily unused amount of the Term Loan Commitment. Ticking fees shall accrue during the period commencing on the date that is sixty (60) days after the Amendment No. 3 Effective

Any other fees payable to the Issuing Bank pursuant to this paragraph shall be payable within ten (10) days after demand.  All participation fees and fronting fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). 
    
  (c) The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for its own account, fees payable in the amounts and at the times separately agreed upon between the Borrower and the Administrative Agent. 
    
  (d) All fees payable hereunder shall be paid on the dates due, in immediately available funds, to the Administrative Agent (or to the Issuing Bank, in the case of fees payable to it) for distribution, in the case of commitment fees, participation fees and ticking fees, to the applicable Lenders. Fees paid shall not be refundable under any circumstances. 
    
  SECTION 2.13.   Interest  .  (a)  The Loans comprising each ABR Borrowing (including each Swingline Loan) shall bear interest at the Alternate Base Rate   plus   the Applicable Rate. 
    
  (b) The Loans comprising each Eurodollar Borrowing shall bear interest at the Adjusted 
  LIBO Rate for the Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing   plus   the Applicable Rate. 
    
  (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, during the occurrence and continuance of an Event of Default, the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders may, at their option, by notice to the Borrower (which notice may be revoked at the option of the Required Lenders notwithstanding any provision of   Section 9.02   requiring the consent of  each Lender directly affected thereby  for reductions in interest rates), declare that (i) all Loans shall bear interest at 2%   plus   the rate otherwise applicable to such Loans as provided in the preceding paragraphs of this Section or (ii) in the case of any other amount outstanding hereunder, such amount shall accrue at 2%   plus   the rate applicable to such fee or other obligation as provided hereunder. 
    
  (d) Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date  for  such  Loan  and,  in  the  case  of  Revolving  Loans,  upon  termination  of  the  Revolving Commitments;   provided   that (i) interest accrued pursuant to   clause (c)   of this Section shall be payable on demand, (ii) in the event of any repayment or prepayment of any Loan (other than a prepayment of an ABR Revolving Loan prior to the end of the Revolving Availability Period), accrued interest on the principal amount repaid or prepaid shall be payable on the  
  
   34 

date of such repayment or prepayment and (iii) in the event of any conversion of any Eurodollar Loan prior to the end of the current Interest Period therefor, accrued interest on such Loan shall be payable on the effective date of such conversion. 
  (e) All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days, except that interest computed by reference to the Alternate Base Rate at times when the Alternate Base Rate is based on the Prime Rate shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year), and in each case shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day).  The applicable Alternate Base Rate, Adjusted LIBO Rate or LIBO Rate shall be determined by the Administrative Agent, and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 
    
  SECTION 2.14.   Alternate Rate of Interest  . If prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a Eurodollar Borrowing: 
    
  (a) the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the LIBO Rate, as applicable, for such Interest Period; or 
    
  (b) the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders that the Adjusted LIBO Rate or the LIBO Rate, as applicable, for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining their Loans included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period; 
    
  then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Borrower and the Lenders by telephone or telecopy as promptly as practicable thereafter and, until the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of any Borrowing to, or continuation of any Borrowing as, a Eurodollar Borrowing shall be ineffective and any such Eurodollar Borrowing shall be repaid on the last day of the then current Interest Period applicable thereto and (ii) if any Borrowing Request requests a Eurodollar Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be made as an ABR Borrowing. 
    
  SECTION 2.15.   Increased Costs  . (a) If any Change in Law shall: 
    
  (i)         impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, liquidity or similar requirement (including any compulsory loan requirement, insurance charge or other assessment) against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender (except any such reserve requirement reflected in the Adjusted LIBO Rate) or the Issuing Bank; 
    
  (ii)        impose on any Lender or the Issuing Bank or the London interbank market any other condition, cost or expense (other than Taxes) affecting this Agreement or Eurodollar Loans made by such Lender or any Letter of Credit or participation therein; or 
    
  (iii)      subject the Administrative Agent, any Lender, the Issuing Bank or any other recipient  of  any  payment  hereunder  to  any  Taxes  (other  than  (A) Indemnified  Taxes, (B) Excluded  Taxes  and  (C) Other  Taxes)  on  its  loans,  loan  principal,  letters  of  credit, commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto; 
    
  and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Person of making, continuing, converting into or maintaining any Loan or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan or to increase the cost to such Person of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Person hereunder, whether of principal, interest or otherwise, then the Borrower will pay to such Person, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Person for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered. 
    
  (b) If any Lender or the Issuing Bank determines that any Change in Law regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender s or the Issuing Bank s capital or on the capital of such Lender s or the Issuing Bank s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement  
  
   35 

or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by the Issuing Bank, to a level below that which such Lender or the Issuing Bank or such Lender s or the Issuing Bank s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender s or the Issuing Bank s policies and the policies of such Lender s or the Issuing Bank s holding company with respect to capital adequacy and liquidity), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank or such Lender s or the Issuing Bank s holding company for any such reduction suffered. 
    
  (c) A certificate of a Lender or the Issuing Bank setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank or its holding company, as the case may be, as specified in   clause (a)   or (  b  ) of this Section shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  The Borrower shall pay such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such certificate within ten (10) days after receipt thereof. 
    
  (d) Failure  or  delay  on  the  part  of  any  Lender  or  the  Issuing  Bank  to  demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender s or the Issuing Bank s right to demand such compensation;   provided   that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender or the Issuing Bank pursuant to this Section for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than 180 days prior to the date that such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender s or the Issuing Bank s intention to claim compensation therefor;   provided     further   that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the 180-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof. 
    
  SECTION 2.16.   Break Funding Payments  .   In  the event of  (a) the payment of  any principal of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of Default or as a result of any prepayment pursuant to   Section 2.11  ), (b) the conversion of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (c) the failure to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any Eurodollar Loan on the date specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto (regardless of whether such notice may be revoked under   Section 2.11   and is revoked in accordance therewith) or (d) the assignment of any Eurodollar Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to   Section 2.19  , then, in any such event, the Borrower shall compensate each Lender for the loss, cost and expense attributable to such event.  Such loss, cost or expense to any Lender shall be deemed to include an amount determined by such Lender to be the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest which would have accrued on the principal amount of such Loan had such event not occurred, at the Adjusted LIBO Rate that would have been applicable to such Loan, for the period from the date of such event to the last day of the then current Interest Period therefor (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, for the period that would have been the Interest Period for such Loan),   over   (ii) the amount of interest which would accrue on such principal amount for such period at the interest rate which such Lender would bid were it to bid, at the commencement of such period, for deposits in Dollars of a comparable amount and period from other banks in the eurodollar market.  A certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within ten (10) days after receipt thereof. 
    
  SECTION 2.17.   Taxes  .  (a)  Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower hereunder shall be made free and clear of and without deduction for any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes;   provided   that if the Borrower shall be required to deduct any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from such payments, then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section) the Administrative Agent, Lender or Issuing Bank (as the case may be) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made, (ii) the Borrower shall make such deductions and (iii) the Borrower shall pay the full amount deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law. 

36 

(b) In addition, the Borrower shall pay any Other Taxes imposed on or incurred by the Administrative  Agent,  a  Lender  or  the  Issuing  Bank  to  the  relevant  Governmental  Authority  in accordance with applicable law. 
    
  (c) The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, each Lender and the Issuing Bank, within ten (10) days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes paid by the Administrative Agent, such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, on or with respect to any payment by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower hereunder (including Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section) and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.   A  certificate as  to  the  amount of  such payment or  liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender or the Issuing Bank, or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender or the Issuing Bank, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. 
    
  (d) As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes by the Borrower to a Governmental Authority, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent. 
    
  (e) Unless not legally entitled to do so: 
    
  (i) any Lender, if requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such forms or other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements; 
    
  (ii) any Foreign Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of any Tax with respect to payments hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, on or prior to the date on which such Foreign  Lender  becomes  a  Lender  under  this  Agreement  (and  from  time  to  time thereafter,  as   may  be  necessary  in  the  determination  of  the  Borrower  or  the Administrative Agent, each in the reasonable exercise of its discretion), such properly completed and duly executed forms or other documentation prescribed by applicable law as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding; 
  (iii)  without  limiting  the  generality  of  the  foregoing,  in  the  event  that  the Borrower is resident for tax purposes in the United States, any Foreign Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter, as may be necessary in the determination of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, each in the reasonable exercise of its discretion), whichever of the following is applicable: 
    
  (A) properly completed and duly executed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN-E, as applicable, claiming eligibility for benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party, or

  (C)  in  the  case  of  a  Foreign  Lender  claiming  the  benefits  of  the exemption for  portfolio interest  under Section 881(c) of the Code, (A) a duly executed certificate to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not (i) a  bank  within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (ii) a ten-percent shareholder (within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code)

  (D) properly completed and duly executed copies of any other form prescribed  by  applicable  law  as  a  basis  for  claiming  exemption  from  or  a reduction in any Tax, 
    
  in each case together with such supplementary documentation as may  be  prescribed  by applicable law to permit the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made, if any; 
    
  (iv)  without  limiting  the  generality  of  the  foregoing,  in  the  event  that  the Borrower is resident for tax purposes in the United States, any Foreign Lender that does not act or ceases to act for its own account with respect to any portion of any sums paid or payable to such Lender under any of the Loan Documents (for example, in the case of a typical participation by such Lender) shall deliver to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient), on or prior to the date such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender, or on such later date when such Foreign Lender ceases to act for its own account with respect to any portion of any such sums paid  or  payable,  and  from  time  to  time  thereafter,  as  may  be  necessary  in  the determination of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent (each in the reasonable exercise of its discretion): 
    
  (A) duly executed and properly completed copies of the forms and statements required to be provided by such Foreign Lender under   clause (iii)  , above, to establish the portion of any such sums paid or payable with respect to which such Lender acts for its own account and may be entitled to an exemption from or a reduction of the applicable Tax, and 
    
  (B) duly executed and properly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8IMY (or any successor forms) properly completed and duly executed by such Foreign Lender, together with any information, if any, such Foreign Lender chooses to transmit with such form, and any other certificate or statement of exemption required under the Internal Revenue Code or the regulations thereunder, to establish that such Foreign Lender is not acting for its own account with respect to a portion of any such sums payable to such Foreign Lender; 
    
  (v)  without  limiting  the  generality  of  the  foregoing,  in  the  event  that  the Borrower is resident for tax purposes in the United States, any Lender that is not a Foreign Lender and is not an exempt recipient (as defined in section 6049(b)(4) of the Code  and  the  United  States  Treasury  Regulations  thereunder)  shall  deliver  to  the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such numbers of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter as prescribed by applicable law or upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), duly executed and properly completed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-9; and 
    
  (vi) without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Lender hereby agrees, from time to time after the initial delivery by such Lender of such forms, whenever a lapse  in  time  or  change  in  circumstances  renders  such  forms,  certificates  or  other evidence so delivered obsolete or inaccurate in any material respect, that such Lender shall promptly (1) deliver to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower two original copies of renewals, amendments or additional or successor forms, properly completed and duly executed by such Lender, together with any other certificate or statement of exemption required in order to confirm or establish that such Lender is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of any Tax with respect to payments to such Lender under the Loan Documents and, if applicable, that such Lender does not act for its own account with respect to any portion of such payment, or (2) notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower of its inability to deliver any such forms, certificates or other evidence. 
  
   38 

(f) If a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal  withholding tax  imposed  by  FATCA if  such  Lender  were  to  fail  to  comply  with  the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this   Section 2.17(f)  ,  FATCA  shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement. 
    
  (g) Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within ten (10) days after demand therefor, for (i) any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to  the  extent  that  the  Borrower  has  not  already  indemnified  the  Administrative  Agent  for  such Indemnified Taxes  and  without  limiting  the  obligation  of  the  Borrower  to  do  so),  (ii)  any  Taxes attributable to such Lender's failure to comply with the provisions of   Section 9.04(c)   relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority.  A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error.  Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under any Loan Document or otherwise payable by the Administrative Agent to the Lender from any other source against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this   Section 2.17(g)  . 
    
  (h) If the Administrative Agent or a Lender determines, in its sole discretion, that it has received a refund of any Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower or with respect to which the Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this   Section 2.17  , it shall pay over such refund to the Borrower (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Borrower under this   Section 2.17   with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of the Administrative Agent or such Lender and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund);   provided  , that the Borrower, upon the request of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Borrower (  plus   any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent or such Lender in the event the Administrative Agent or such Lender is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. This Section shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes which it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person. 
    
  (i) For purposes of determining withholding Taxes imposed under FATCA, from and after the Amendment No. 3 Effective Date, the Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall treat (and the Lenders authorize the Administrative Agent to treat) the Obligations as not qualifying as a  grandfathered obligation  within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.1471-2(b)(2)(i). 
    
  SECTION 2.18.   Payments Generally; Allocations of Proceeds; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Set-offs  . 
    
  (a) The Borrower shall make each payment required to be made by it hereunder (whether of principal, interest, fees or reimbursement of LC Disbursements, or of amounts payable under   Section 2.15  ,   2.16   or   2.17  , or otherwise) prior to 11:00 a.m., Chicago time on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without set-off or counterclaim.  Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of calculating interest thereon.  All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent at its offices at 10 South Dearborn Street, 7th  
  
   39 

Floor, Chicago, Illinois 60603, except payments to be made directly to the Issuing Bank or Swingline Lender as expressly provided herein and except that payments pursuant to   Sections 2.15  ,   2.16  ,   2.17   and 9.03 shall be made directly to the Persons entitled thereto.   The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof.  If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension.   All payments hereunder shall be made in Dollars. 
    
  (b) Any proceeds of Collateral received by the Administrative Agent (i) not constituting a specific payment of principal, interest, fees or other sum payable under the Loan Documents (which shall be applied as required hereunder or otherwise as specified by the Borrower) or (ii) after an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent so elects or the Required Lenders so direct, such funds shall be applied ratably   first  , to pay any fees, indemnities, or expense reimbursements including amounts then due to the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Bank from the Borrower,   second  , to pay any fees or expense reimbursements then due to the Lenders from the Borrower,   third  , to pay interest then due and payable on the Loans ratably,   fourth  , to prepay principal on the Loans and unreimbursed LC Disbursements and any other amounts owing with respect to Banking Services Obligations and Swap Obligations ratably,   fifth  , to pay an amount to the Administrative Agent equal to one hundred five percent (105%) of the aggregate undrawn face amount of all outstanding Letters of Credit and the aggregate amount of any unpaid LC Disbursements, to be held as cash collateral for such Obligations, and   sixth  , to the payment of any other Secured Obligation due to the Administrative Agent or any Lender by the Borrower.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, amounts received from any Loan Party shall not be applied to any Excluded Swap Obligation of such Loan Party. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, unless so directed by the Borrower, or unless a Default is in existence, none of the Administrative Agent or any Lender shall apply any payment which it receives to any Eurodollar Loan of a Class, except (a) on the expiration date of the Interest Period applicable to any such Eurodollar Loan or (b) in the event, and only to the extent, that there are no outstanding ABR Loans of the same Class and, in any event, the Borrower shall pay the break funding payment required in accordance with   Section 2.16  .  The Administrative Agent and the Lenders shall have the continuing and exclusive right to apply and reverse and reapply any and all such proceeds and payments to any portion of the Secured Obligations. 
    
  (c) At the election of the Administrative Agent, all payments of principal, interest, LC Disbursements, fees, premiums, reimbursable expenses (including, without limitation, all reimbursement for fees and expenses pursuant to   Section 9.03  ), and other sums payable under the Loan Documents, may be paid from the proceeds of Borrowings made hereunder whether made following a request by the Borrower pursuant to   Section 2.03   or a deemed request as provided in this Section or may be deducted from any deposit account of the Borrower maintained with the Administrative Agent.   The Borrower hereby irrevocably authorizes (i) the Administrative Agent to make a Borrowing for the purpose of paying each payment of principal, interest and fees as it becomes due hereunder or any other amount due under the Loan Documents and agrees that all such amounts charged shall constitute Loans (including Swingline Loans) and that all such Borrowings shall be deemed to have been requested pursuant to   Section 2.03   or   2.05  , as applicable and (ii) the Administrative Agent to charge any deposit account of the Borrower maintained with the Administrative Agent for each payment of principal, interest and fees as it becomes due hereunder or any other amount due under the Loan Documents. 
    
  (d) If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other similarly situated Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the applicable Lenders ratably in accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans;   provided   that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed  
  
   40 

to apply to any payment made by the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender  as  consideration  for  the  assignment  of  or  sale  of  a  participation  in  any  of  its  Loans  or participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans to any assignee or participant, other than to the Borrower or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply). The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation. 
    
  (e) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the relevant Lenders or the Issuing Bank hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the relevant Lenders or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount due.  In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the relevant Lenders or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation. 
    
  (f) If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to   Section 2.05(c)  ,   2.06(d)   or (  e  ),   2.07(b)  ,   2.18(e)   or   9.03(c)  , then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), (i) apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender and for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the Swingline Lender or the Issuing Bank to satisfy such Lender s obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid and/or (ii) hold any such amounts in a segregated account as cash collateral for, and application to, any future funding obligations of such Lender under such Sections; in the case of each of (i) and (ii) above, in any order as determined by the Administrative Agent in its discretion. 
    
  SECTION 2.19.   Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders  .  (a)  If (i) any Lender requests compensation under   Section 2.15  , or (ii) the Borrower is required to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to   Section 2.17  , or (iii) any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to   Section 2.15   or   2.17  , as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender.  The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment. 
    
  (b) If any Lender requests compensation under   Section 2.15  , or if the Borrower is required to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to   Section 2.17  , or if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in   Section 9.04  ), all its interests, rights and obligations under the Loan Documents to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment);   provided   that (i) the Borrower shall have received the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent (and if a Revolving Commitment is being assigned, the Issuing Bank and the Swingline Lender), which consent shall not  unreasonably be  withheld, (ii)  such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts) and (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under   Section 2.15   or payments required to be made pursuant to   Section 2.17  , such assignment will result in a  
  
   41 

reduction in such compensation or payments.  A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such  assignment and delegation cease to apply. 
    
  SECTION 2.20.   Expansion Option  .    The  Borrower may  from time  to  time  elect to increase the Revolving Commitments or enter into one or more tranches of term loans (each an    Incremental Term Loan   ), in each case in minimum increments of $15,000,000 so long as after giving effect thereto, the aggregate amount of such increases and all such Incremental Term Loans from and after the Amendment No. 3 Effective Date does not exceed $175,000,000. The Borrower may arrange for any such increase or tranche to be provided by one or more Lenders (each Lender so agreeing to an increase in its Commitment, or to participate in such Incremental Term Loans, an    Increasing Lender   ), or by one or more new banks, financial institutions or other entities (each such new bank, financial institution or other entity, an    Augmenting Lender      provided   that no Ineligible Institution may be an Augmenting Lender), which agree to increase their existing Revolving Commitments, or to participate in such Incremental Term Loans, or provide new Revolving Commitments, as the case may be;   provided   that (i) each Augmenting Lender and Increasing Lender, shall be subject to the approval of the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the Issuing Bank and (ii) (x) in the case of an Increasing Lender, the Borrower and such Increasing Lender execute an agreement substantially in the form of   Exhibit C   hereto, and (y) in the case of an Augmenting Lender, the Borrower and such Augmenting Lender execute an agreement substantially in the form of   Exhibit D   hereto.  No Lender shall have any obligation to provide any such increase and each Lender may refuse to provide such increase in its absolute and sole discretion. No consent of any Lender (other than the Lenders participating in the increase or any Incremental Term Loan) shall be required for any increase in Revolving Commitments or Incremental Term Loan pursuant to this   Section 2.20  .  Increases and new Revolving Commitments and Incremental Term Loans created pursuant  to  this    Section 2.20    shall  become  effective  on  the  date  agreed  by  the  Borrower,  the Administrative  Agent   and   the   relevant   Increasing   Lenders   or   Augmenting   Lenders,   and   the Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender thereof.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no increase in the Revolving Commitments (or in the Revolving Commitment of any Lender) or tranche of Incremental Term  Loans  shall  become  effective  under  this  paragraph  unless,  (i) on  the  proposed  date  of  the effectiveness of such increase or Incremental Term Loans, (A) the conditions set forth in clauses (a) and (b) of   Section 4.02   shall be satisfied or waived by the Required Lenders and the Administrative Agent shall have received a certificate to that effect dated such date and executed by a Financial Officer of the Borrower and (B) the Borrower shall be in compliance (on a Pro Forma Basis) with the covenants contained in   Section 6.12   and (ii) the Administrative Agent shall have received documents and opinions consistent with those delivered on the Effective Date as to the organizational power and authority of the Borrower to borrow hereunder after giving effect to such increase.  On the effective date of any increase in the Revolving Commitments or any Incremental Term Loans being made, (i) each relevant Increasing Lender and Augmenting Lender shall make available to the Administrative Agent such amounts in immediately available funds as the Administrative Agent shall determine, for the benefit of the other Lenders, as being required in order to cause, after giving effect to such increase and the use of such amounts to make payments to such other Lenders, each Revolving Lender s portion of the outstanding Revolving Loans of all the Lenders to equal its Applicable Percentage of such outstanding Revolving Loans, and (ii) except in the case of any Incremental Term Loans, the Borrower shall be deemed to have repaid and reborrowed all outstanding Revolving Loans as of the date of any increase in the Revolving Commitments (with such reborrowing to consist of the Types of Revolving Loans, with related Interest Periods if applicable, specified in a notice delivered by the Borrower, in accordance with the requirements of   Section 2.03  ).   The deemed payments made pursuant to clause (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence shall be accompanied by payment of all accrued interest on the amount prepaid and, in respect of each Eurodollar Loan, shall be subject to indemnification by the Borrower pursuant to the provisions of   Section 2.16   if the deemed payment occurs other than on the last day of the related Interest Periods.  The Incremental Term Loans (a) shall rank pari passu in right of payment with the Revolving Loans and the existing Term Loans, (b) shall not mature earlier than the Maturity Date (but may have amortization prior to such date) and (c) shall be treated substantially the same as (and in any event no more favorably than) the Revolving Loans and the existing Term Loans; provided that (i) the terms and conditions applicable to any tranche of Incremental Term Loans maturing after the Maturity Date may provide for material additional or different financial or other covenants or prepayment requirements applicable only during periods after the Maturity Date and (ii) the Incremental Term Loans may be priced differently than the Revolving Loans and the existing Term Loans.   Incremental Term Loans may be made hereunder pursuant to an amendment or restatement (an    Incremental Term Loan  
  
   42 

Amendment   ) of this Agreement and, as appropriate, the other Loan Documents, executed by the Borrower, each Increasing Lender participating in such tranche, each Augmenting Lender participating in such tranche, if any, and the Administrative Agent.  The Incremental Term Loan Amendment may, without the consent of any other Lenders, effect such amendments to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as may be necessary or appropriate, in the reasonable opinion of the Administrative Agent, to effect the provisions of this   Section 2.20  .  Nothing contained in this Section 2.20 shall constitute, or otherwise be deemed to be, a commitment on the part of any Lender to increase its Revolving Commitment hereunder, or provide Incremental Term Loans, at any time.  In connection with any increase of the Revolving Commitments or Incremental Term Loans pursuant to this Section 2.20, any Augmenting Lender becoming a party hereto shall (1) execute such documents and agreements as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request and (2) in the case of any Augmenting Lender that is organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside of the United States of America, provide to the Administrative Agent, its name, address, tax identification number and/or such other information as shall be necessary for the Administrative Agent to comply with  know your customer  and anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including without limitation, the Patriot Act. 
    
  SECTION 2.21.   Defaulting Lenders  .  Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then the following provisions shall apply for so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender: 
    
  (a) fees  shall cease to  accrue on  the  unfunded portion of  the  Commitment of  such Defaulting Lender pursuant to   Section 2.12(a)  ; 
    
  (b) the Commitment and Revolving Credit Exposure of such Defaulting Lender shall not be included in determining whether all Lenders or the Required Lenders have taken or may take any action hereunder (including any consent to any amendment or waiver pursuant to   Section 9.02  ); provided that, except as otherwise provided in   Section 9.02  ,   this clause (b)   shall not apply to the vote of a Defaulting Lender in the case of an amendment, waiver or other modification requiring the consent of such Lender or each Lender directly affected thereby; 
    
  (c) if any Swingline Exposure or LC Exposure exists at the time a Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender then: 
    
  (i)         all or any part of such Swingline Exposure and LC Exposure of such Defaulting Lender shall be reallocated among the non-Defaulting Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable Percentages  but only to the extent (x) such reallocation does not cause the aggregate Revolving  Credit  Exposure  of  any  non-Defaulting  Lender  to  exceed  such  non-Defaulting Lender s Revolving Commitment, (y) the sum of all non-Defaulting Lenders  Revolving Credit Exposures   plus   such Defaulting Lender s Swingline Exposure and LC Exposure does not exceed the total of all non-Defaulting Lenders  Revolving Commitments and (z) the conditions set forth in   Section 4.02   are satisfied at such time; 
    
  (ii)        if the reallocation described in   clause (i)   above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Borrower shall within one (1) Business Day following notice by the Administrative Agent (x)   first  , prepay such Swingline Exposure and (y)   second  , cash collateralize for the benefit of the Issuing Bank only the Borrower s obligations corresponding to such Defaulting Lender s LC Exposure (after giving effect to any partial reallocation pursuant to   clause (i)   above) in accordance with the procedures set forth in   Section 2.06(j)   for so long as such LC Exposure is outstanding;

  (iv)       if the LC Exposure of the non-Defaulting Lenders is reallocated pursuant to   Section 2.21(c)  , then the fees payable to the Lenders pursuant to   Sections 2.12(a)   and   2.12(b)   shall be adjusted in accordance with such non-Defaulting Lenders  Applicable Percentages; or 

43 

(v)        if  any  Defaulting  Lender s  LC  Exposure  is  neither  cash  collateralized  nor reallocated pursuant to   Section 2.21(c)  , then, without prejudice to any rights or remedies of the Issuing Bank or any Lender hereunder, all letter of credit fees payable under   Section 2.12(b)   with respect to such Defaulting Lender s LC Exposure shall be payable to the Issuing Bank until such LC Exposure is cash collateralized and/or reallocated; and 
    
  (d) so long as any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, the Swingline Lender shall not be required to fund any Swingline Loan and the Issuing Bank shall not be required to issue, amend or increase any Letter of Credit, unless it is satisfied that the related exposure and the Defaulting Lender s then outstanding LC Exposure will be 100% covered by the Revolving Commitments of the non- Defaulting Lenders and/or cash collateral will be provided by the Borrower in accordance with   Section 2.21(c)  , and participating interests in any such newly issued or increased Letter of Credit or newly made Swingline Loan shall be allocated among non-Defaulting Lenders in a manner consistent with   Section 2.21(c)(i)   (and Defaulting Lenders shall not participate therein). 
    
  If (i) a Bankruptcy Event or a Bail-In Action with respect to a Parent of any Lender shall occur following the Amendment No. 3 Effective Date and for so long as such event shall continue or (ii) the Swingline Lender or the Issuing Bank has a good faith belief that any Lender has defaulted in fulfilling its obligations under one or more other agreements in which such Lender commits to extend credit, the Swingline Lender shall not be required to fund any Swingline Loan and the Issuing Bank shall not be required to issue, amend or increase any Letter of Credit, unless the Swingline Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, shall have entered into arrangements with the Borrower or such Lender, satisfactory to the Swingline Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, to defease any risk to it in respect of such Lender hereunder. 
    
  In the event that the Administrative Agent, the Borrower, the Issuing Bank and the Swingline Lender each agrees that a Defaulting Lender has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, then the Swingline Exposure and LC Exposure of the Lenders shall be readjusted to reflect the inclusion of such Lender s Commitment and on such date such Lender shall purchase at par such of the Loans of the other Lenders (other than Swingline Loans) as the Administrative Agent shall determine may  be  necessary in  order  for  such  Lender  to  hold  such  Loans  in  accordance with  its Applicable Percentage.

  In case of the pendency of any proceeding with respect to any Loan Party under any Federal, state or foreign bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or similar law now or hereafter in effect, the Administrative Agent (irrespective of whether the principal of any Loan or any LC Disbursement shall then be due and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Administrative Agent shall have made any demand on the Borrower) shall be entitled and empowered (but not obligated) by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise:

  (b) collect and receive any monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same; 
    
  and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such proceeding is hereby authorized by each Lender, the Issuing Bank and each other Secured Party to make such payments to the Administrative Agent and, in the event that the Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Lenders, the Issuing Bank or the other Secured Parties, to pay to the Administrative Agent any amount due to it, in its capacity as the Administrative Agent, under the Loan Documents (including under Section 9.03). 
    
  The Borrower, on its behalf and on behalf of its Subsidiaries, and each Lender, on its behalf and on the behalf of its affiliated Secured Parties, hereby irrevocably constitute the Administrative Agent as the holder of an irrevocable power of attorney (  fond  de pouvoir   within the meaning of Article 2692 of the Civil Code of Qu bec) in order to hold hypothecs and security granted by the Borrower or any Subsidiary on property pursuant to the laws of the Province of Quebec to secure obligations of the Borrower or any Subsidiary under any bond, debenture or similar title of indebtedness issued by the Borrower or any Subsidiary in connection with this Agreement, and agree that the Administrative Agent may act as the bondholder and mandatary with respect to any bond, debenture or similar title of indebtedness that may be issued by the Borrower or any Subsidiary and pledged in favor of the Secured Parties in connection with this Agreement.

The Agent Parties (as defined below) do not warrant the adequacy of such Electronic Systems and  expressly disclaim liability for  errors or  omissions in  the Communications.

  SECTION 9.02.   Waivers; Amendments  .  (a)  No failure or delay by the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender in exercising any right or power hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power.  The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders hereunder and under the other Loan Documents are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have.  No waiver of any provision of any Loan Document or consent to any departure by the Borrower therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by   clause (b)   of this Section, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan or issuance of a Letter of Credit shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default or Event of Default, regardless of whether the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Issuing Bank may have had notice or knowledge of such Default or Event of Default at the time. 
    
  (b) Except  as  provided  in    Section 2.20    with  respect  to  an  Incremental  Term  Loan Amendment, neither this Agreement nor any provision hereof may be waived, amended or modified except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Borrower and the Required Lenders or by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent with the consent of the Required Lenders;   provided   that no such agreement shall (i) increase the Commitment of any Lender without the written consent of such Lender, (ii) reduce the principal amount of any Loan or LC Disbursement or reduce the rate of interest thereon, or reduce any fees payable hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender directly affected thereby, (iii) postpone the scheduled date of payment of the principal amount of any Loan or LC Disbursement, or any interest thereon, or any fees payable hereunder, or reduce the amount of, waive or excuse any such payment, or postpone the scheduled date of expiration of any Commitment, without the written consent of each Lender directly affected thereby, (iv) change   Section 2.18(b)   or (  d  ) in a manner that would alter the pro rata sharing of payments required thereby, without the written consent of each Lender, (v) change any of the provisions of this Section or the definition of  Required Lenders  or any other provision hereof specifying the number or percentage of Lenders required to waive, amend or modify any rights hereunder or make any determination or grant any consent hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender (it being understood that, solely with the consent of the parties prescribed by   Section 2.20   to be parties to an Incremental Term Loan Amendment, Incremental Term Loans may be included in the determination of Required Lenders on substantially the same basis as the Commitments and the Revolving Loans are included on the Effective Date), (vi) release all or substantially all of the Subsidiary Guarantors from their obligations under the Subsidiary Guaranty without the written consent of each Lender, or (viii) except as provided in   clause (d)   of this Section or in any Collateral Document, release all or substantially all of the Collateral, without the written consent of each Lender;   provided     further   that no such agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender hereunder without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender, as the case may be. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no consent with respect to any  
  
   68 

amendment, waiver or other modification of this Agreement shall be required of any Defaulting Lender, except with respect to any amendment, waiver or other modification referred to in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of the first proviso of this paragraph and then only in the event such Defaulting Lender shall be directly affected by such amendment, waiver or other modification. 
    
  (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement and any other Loan Document may be amended (or amended and restated) with the written consent of the Required Lenders, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower to each relevant Loan Document (x) to add one or more credit facilities (in addition to the Incremental Term Loans pursuant to an Incremental Term Loan Amendment) to this Agreement and to permit extensions of credit from time to time outstanding thereunder and the accrued interest and fees in respect thereof to share ratably in the benefits of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents with the Revolving Loans, Incremental Term Loans and the accrued interest and fees in respect thereof and (y) to include appropriately the Lenders holding such credit facilities in any determination of the Required Lenders and Lenders. 
    
  (d) The Lenders hereby irrevocably authorize the Administrative Agent, at its option and in its sole discretion, to release any Liens granted to the Administrative Agent by the Loan Parties on any Collateral (i) upon the termination of all the Commitments, payment and satisfaction in full in cash of all Secured Obligations (other than Unliquidated Obligations), and the cash collateralization of all Unliquidated Obligations in a manner satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, (ii) constituting property being sold, leased, transferred or disposed of if the Borrower certifies to the Administrative Agent that the sale, lease, transfer or disposition is made in compliance with the terms of this Agreement (and the Administrative Agent may rely conclusively on any such certificate, without further inquiry), (iii) constituting property leased to the Borrower or any Subsidiary under a lease which has expired or been terminated in a transaction permitted under this Agreement, (iv) constituting property of a Subsidiary that is no longer required to be a Subsidiary Guarantor pursuant to   Section 5.09(e)    or (v) as required to effect any sale or other disposition of such Collateral in connection with any exercise of remedies of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders pursuant to Article VII.  Any such release shall not in any manner discharge, affect, or impair the Obligations or any Liens (other than those expressly being released) upon (or obligations of the Loan Parties in respect of) all interests retained by the Loan Parties, including the proceeds of any sale, all of which shall continue to constitute part of the Collateral. 
    
  (e) Notwithstanding anything to  the contrary contained herein or  in  any other Loan Document, the Administrative Agent is hereby irrevocably authorized by each Lender (without requirement of notice to or consent of any Lender) to take any action requested by the Borrower having the effect of releasing the Subsidiary Guaranty (i) to the extent necessary to permit consummation of any proposed sale, lease, transfer or other disposition of assets not prohibited by any Loan Document or that has been consented to in accordance with   Section 9.02(b)  , (ii) with respect to a Subsidiary that is no longer required to be a Subsidiary Guarantor pursuant to   Section 5.09(e)   or (iii) at such time as the Loans, the Letters of Credit and the other Obligations under the Loan Documents  shall have been paid in full, the Commitments have been terminated and no Letters of Credit shall be outstanding.  Following such termination, the Administrative Agent shall execute (at the Borrower s expense) any documents or instruments reasonably requested and prepared by the Borrower to evidence such termination. 
    
  (f) If, in connection with any proposed amendment, waiver or consent  requiring the consent of  each Lender  or  each Lender directly affected thereby,  the consent of the Required Lenders is obtained, but the consent of other necessary Lenders is not obtained (any such Lender whose consent is necessary but not obtained being referred to herein as a    Non-Consenting Lender   ), then the Borrower may elect to replace a Non-Consenting Lender as a Lender party to this Agreement, provided that, concurrently with such replacement, (i) another bank or other entity which is reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall agree, as of such date, to purchase for cash the Loans and other Obligations due to the Non-Consenting Lender pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption and to become a Lender for all purposes under this Agreement and to assume all obligations of the Non- Consenting Lender to be terminated as of such date and to comply with the requirements of   clause (b)   of   Section 9.04  , and (ii) the Borrower shall pay to such Non-Consenting Lender in same day funds on the day of such replacement (1) all interest, fees and other amounts then accrued but unpaid to such Non- Consenting Lender by the Borrower hereunder to and including the date of termination, including without limitation payments due to such Non-Consenting  
  
   69 

Lender under   Sections 2.15   and   2.17  , and (2) an amount, if any, equal to the payment which would have been due to such Lender on the day of such replacement under   Section 2.16   had the Loans of such Non-Consenting Lender been prepaid on such date rather than sold to the replacement Lender. 
    
  (g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein the Administrative Agent may, with the consent of the Borrower only, amend, modify or supplement this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents to cure any ambiguity, omission, mistake, defect or inconsistency. 
    
  SECTION 9.03.   Expenses; Indemnity; Damage Waiver  .  (a)  The Borrower shall pay (i) following receipt of written invoices and statements of account, all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent and its Affiliates, including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements  of  counsel  for  the  Administrative  Agent,  in  connection  with  the  syndication  and distribution (including, without limitation, via the internet or through a service such as Intralinks) of the credit facilities provided for herein, the preparation and administration of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents or any amendments, modifications or waivers of the provisions hereof or thereof (whether  or  not  the  transactions  contemplated  hereby  or  thereby  shall  be  consummated),  (ii)  all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Issuing Bank in connection with the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or any demand for payment thereunder and (iii) all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender, including the fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender, in connection with the enforcement or protection of its rights in connection with this Agreement and any other Loan Document, including its rights under this Section, or in connection with the Loans made or Letters of Credit issued hereunder, including all such out-of-pocket expenses incurred during any workout, restructuring or negotiations in respect of such Loans or Letters of Credit. 
    
  (b) The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and each Lender, and each Related Party of any of the foregoing Persons (each such Person being called an    Indemnitee   ) against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses, including the fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for any Indemnitee, incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee arising out of, in connection with, or as a result  of  (i)  the  execution  or  delivery  of  any  Loan  Document  or  any  agreement  or  instrument contemplated thereby, the performance by the parties hereto of their respective obligations thereunder or the consummation of the Transactions or any other transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds therefrom (including any refusal by the Issuing Bank to honor a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit if the documents presented in connection with such demand do not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit), (iii) any actual or alleged presence or release of Hazardous Materials on or from any property owned or operated by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or any Environmental Liability related in any way to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or (iv) any actual or prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other theory, whether or not brought by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, equity holders, Affiliates creditors or any other Person, and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto;   provided   that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses are determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee or the breach in bad faith, by such indemnified person of its express obligations hereunder or under any other Loan Document pursuant to a claim initiated by the Borrower.   To the extent permitted by applicable law, any Person seeking to be indemnified under this   Section 9.03(b)   shall, upon obtaining knowledge thereof, use commercially reasonable efforts to give prompt written notice to the Borrower of the commencement of any action or proceeding giving rise to such indemnification claim, provided that the failure to give such notice shall not relieve the Borrower of any indemnification obligations hereunder. 
    
  (c) To the extent that the Borrower fails to pay any amount required to be paid by it to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender under   clause (a)   or   (b)   of this Section, each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender, as the case may be, such Lender s Applicable Percentage (determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid amount (it being understood that the Borrower s failure to pay any such  
  
   70 

amount shall not relieve the Borrower of any default in the payment thereof);   provided   that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender in its capacity as such. 
    
  (d) Subject to the obligations of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders under   Section 9.12   which are not hereby waived, to the extent permitted by applicable law, the Borrower shall not assert, and hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee (i) for any damages arising from the use by others of information or other materials obtained through telecommunications, electronic or other information transmission systems (including the Internet), or (ii) on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby or thereby, the Transactions, any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds thereof. 
    
  (e) All amounts due under this Section shall be payable not later than fifteen (15) days after written demand therefor. 
    
  SECTION 9.04.   Successors and Assigns  .  (a) The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby (including any Affiliate of the Issuing Bank that issues any Letter of Credit), except that (i) the Borrower may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of each Lender (and any attempted assignment or transfer by the Borrower without such consent shall be null and void) and (ii) no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer its rights or obligations hereunder except in accordance with this Section.

  (A) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender or an Approved Fund or an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender s Commitment or Loans of any Class, the amount of the Commitment or Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent) shall not be less than $5,000,000 (in the case  
  
   71 

of Revolving Commitments and Revolving Loans) or $1,000,000 (in the case of a Term Loan) unless each of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent otherwise consent,   provided   that no such consent of the Borrower shall be required if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing; 
    
  (B) each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender s rights and obligations under this Agreement,   provided   that this clause shall not be construed to prohibit the assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender s rights and obligations in respect of one Class of Commitments or Loans;

  For the purposes of this   Section 9.04(b)  , the terms  Approved Fund  and  Ineligible Institution  have the following meanings: 
    
     Approved Fund    means any Person (other than a natural person) that is engaged in making, purchasing, holding or investing in bank loans and similar extensions of credit in the ordinary course of its business and that is administered or managed by (a) a Lender, (b) an Affiliate of a Lender or (c) an entity or an Affiliate of an entity that administers or manages a Lender.

Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this   Section 9.04   shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with   clause (c)   of this Section.

Subject to   clause (c)(ii)   of this Section, the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of   Sections 2.15  ,   2.16   and   2.17   to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to   clause (b)   of this Section.  To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of   Section 9.08   as though it were a Lender,   provided   such Participant agrees to be subject to   Section 2.18(d)   as though it were a Lender. 
    
  (ii)        A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under   Section 2.15   or   2.17   than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Borrower s prior written consent.  A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of   Section 2.17   unless the Borrower is notified of the participation sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of the Borrower, to comply with   Section 2.17(e)   as though it were a Lender.  Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant s interest in the Loans or other obligations under this Agreement (the    Participant Register      provided   that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register to any Person (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant s interest in any Commitments, Loans, Letters of Credit or its other obligations under this Agreement) except to the extent that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such Commitment, Loan, Letter of Credit or other obligation is in registered form under Section 5f.103-1(c) of the United States Treasury Regulations.  The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and such Lender shall treat each person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of such participation for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary. 
    
  (d)        Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including without limitation any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest;   provided   that no such pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.

  SECTION 9.07.   Severability  .  Any provision of any Loan Document held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions thereof; and the invalidity of a particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other jurisdiction.

If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each Lender and each of its Affiliates is hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand,  provisional  or  final  and  in  whatever  currency  denominated)  at  any  time  held  and  other obligations at any time owing by such Lender or Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower or any Subsidiary Guarantor against any of and all of the Secured Obligations held by such Lender, irrespective of whether or not such Lender shall have made any demand under the Loan Documents and although such obligations may be unmatured.   The rights of each Lender under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) which such Lender may have.
