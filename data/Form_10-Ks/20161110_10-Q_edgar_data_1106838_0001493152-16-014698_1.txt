the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) for interim reporting and include all
adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) that are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair presentation.
These condensed consolidated financial statements have not been audited. The results of operations for the three and nine month
periods ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full year.  

Certain
information and footnote disclosures normally included in consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP
have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations for interim reporting. The Company believes that the disclosures
contained herein are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. However, these financial statements should be
read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the SEC on March 31, 2016 and amended on April 26, 2016. Certain
amounts for the prior year have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.  

LIQUIDITY
AND CAPITAL RESOURCES   

As
of September 30, 2016, our cash balance was $1.0 million. At September 30, 2016, the Company had current assets of $2.1 million,
current liabilities of $14.9 million, and a working capital deficit of $12.8 million. The Company has $9.7 million
in notes and convertible debt obligations which could potentially be called for payment within the next twelve months. The Company
incurred a loss from continuing operations of $2.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The level of additional
cash needed to fund operations and our ability to conduct business for the next twelve months will be influenced primarily by
the following factors:  

the
    pace of growth in our restaurant businesses and related investments in opening new stores;   

the
    level of investment in acquisition of new restaurant businesses and entering new markets;   

our
    ability to manage our operating expenses and maintain gross margins and reduce operating losses as we grow;   

our
    ability to access the capital and debt markets, including our ability to refinance or extend the maturities of our current
    obligations;   

popularity
    of and demand for our fast casual dining concepts; and   

general
    economic conditions and changes in consumer discretionary income.   

Our operating plans for
the next twelve months contemplate moderate organic growth, opening 6-10 new stores within our current markets and restaurant concepts.
We have typically funded our operating costs, acquisition activities, working capital investments and capital expenditures with
proceeds from the issuances of our common stock and other financing arrangements, including convertible debt, lines of credit,
notes payable and capital leases. 

During
2015, we completed two rights offering providing net proceeds of approximately $13.1 million, completed a private placement transaction
providing net proceeds of approximately $1.9 million and issued $2.2 million in convertible notes to fund the acquisitions of
BGR: The Burger Joint, BT s Burger Joint, Little Big Burger and for other general corporate purposes.  

During
2016, we entered into a letter of intent with a US investor to finance the opening of up to 10 Little Big Burger restaurants in
the Seattle, Washington area. We also entered into a letter of intent with potential investors to finance the opening of additional
Little Big Burger restaurants pursuant to the US governments EB-5 program. During the third quarter of 2016, we closed transactions
totaling $750,000 with investors for the opening of Little Big Burger stores in Seattle and Portland.  

We are currently seeking
financing through a proposed public rights offering consisting of non-transferable subscription rights to purchase units, each
unit consisting of one share of redeemable preferred stock and one warrant to purchase 10 shares of common stock. A registration
statement relating to these securities has been filed with the Securities Exchange Commission but has not yet become effective. 

If successful, the rights
offering proceeds will be used to retire certain of the Company s current debt obligations, provide funds for store-related
growth and for general working capital. If the rights offering proceeds and is fully subscribed, the Company would
receive  gross proceeds of approximately $13.5 million. 

There
can be no assurances that the Company will be successful in completing the rights offering or any other such equity or
debt financing. In the event that such capital is not available, we may then need to scale back or freeze our organic growth plans,
reduce general and administrative expenses, and/or curtail future acquisition plans to manage our liquidity and capital resources.
In addition, we may not be able to payoff or otherwise extend the maturities of our current obligations, or continue to operate
as a going concern, which would have an adverse impact on the Company and its shareholders.  

2.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

There
have been no material changes to our significant accounting policies previously disclosed in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015.  

USE
OF ESTIMATES   

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying
notes. Significant estimates include the valuation of the investments in portfolio companies, deferred tax asset valuation allowances,
valuing options and warrants using the Binomial Lattice and Black Scholes models, intangible asset valuations and useful lives,
depreciation and uncollectible accounts and reserves. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  

REVENUE
RECOGNITION   

Restaurant
Net Sales and Food and Beverage Costs   

The
Company records revenue from restaurant sales at the time of sale, net of discounts, coupons, employee meals, and complimentary
meals and gift cards. Sales, value added tax ( VAT ) and goods and services tax ( GST ) collected from
customers and remitted to governmental authorities are presented on a net basis within sales in our condensed consolidated statements
of operations. Restaurant cost of sales primarily includes the cost of food, beverages, and merchandise and disposable paper and
plastic goods used in preparing and selling our menu items, and exclude depreciation and amortization. Vendor allowances received
in connection with the purchase of a vendor s products are recognized as a reduction of the related food and beverage costs
as earned.  

Management
Fee Income   

The
Company receives revenue from management fees from certain non-affiliated companies, including from managing its investment in
Hooters of America. Such fees are recognized as revenue as they are earned.  

Gaming
Income   

The
Company receives revenue from operating a gaming facility adjacent to its Hooters restaurant in Jantzen Beach, Oregon. Revenue
from gaming is recognized as earned from gaming activities, net of taxes and other government fees.  

Franchise
Income   

The
Company accounts for initial franchisee fees in accordance with FASB ASC 952, Franchisors. The Company grants franchises to operators
in exchange for initial franchise license fees and continuing royalty payments. Franchise license fees are deferred when received
and recognized as revenue when the Company has performed substantially all initial services required by the franchise or license
agreement, which is generally upon the opening of a store. Continuing royalty fees, which are based upon a percentage of franchisee
revenues, are recognized on the accrual basis as those sales occur.  

LOSS
PER COMMON SHARE   

The
Company is required to report both basic earnings per share, which is based on the weighted-average number of shares outstanding,
and diluted earnings per share, which is based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding plus all potentially
diluted shares outstanding. The following table summarizes the number of common shares potentially issuable upon the exercise
of certain warrants, convertible notes payable and convertible interest as of September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015 that have
been excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per common share since the effect would be antidilutive.  

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements    

In
2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) No.
2015-03  Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  which requires that debt issuance costs related to a
recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability
consistent with the presentation of debt discounts, however debt issuance costs related to revolving credit agreements may be
presented in the balance sheet as an asset. This guidance was adopted in the first quarter of 2016 and had no effect on our consolidated
financial statements.  

In
November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-07  Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes 
related to the presentation of deferred income taxes. The guidance requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified
as non-current in a consolidated balance sheet. This guidance is effective for us in the first quarter of 2017 and is not expected
to materially impact our financial position or net earnings.  

In
February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02  Leases,  which supersedes ASC 840  Leases  and creates
a new topic, ASC 842  Leases.  This update requires lessees to recognize a lease liability and a lease asset for all
leases, including operating leases, with a term greater than 12 months on its balance sheet. The update also expands the required
quantitative and qualitative disclosures surrounding leases. This update is effective for fiscal years beginning after December
15, 2018 and interim periods within those fiscal years, with earlier adoption permitted. This update will be applied using a modified
retrospective transition approach for leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period
presented in the financial statements. The Company is currently evaluating the effect of this update on its consolidated financial
statements.  

In
March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09  Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based
Payment Accounting . The amendments in this update simplify several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment
transactions, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification
in the statement of cash flows. This update will be effective for the Company in fiscal year 2017, but early adoption is permitted.
The Company is currently evaluating the effect of this update on its consolidated financial statements.

    COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES   

On
March 26, 2013, our South African operations received Notice of Motion filed in the Kwazulu-Natal High Court, Durban, Republic
of South Africa, filed against Rolalor (PTY) LTD ( Rolalor ) and Labyrinth Trading 18 (PTY) LTD ( Labyrinth )
by Jennifer Catherine Mary Shaw ( Shaw ). Rolalor and Labyrinth were the original entities formed to operate the Johannesburg
and Durban locations, respectively. On September 9, 2011, the assets and the then-disclosed liabilities of these entities were
transferred to Tundraspex (PTY) LTD ( Tundraspex ) and Dimaflo (PTY) LTD ( Dimaflo ), respectively. The
current entities, Tundraspex and Dimaflo are not parties in the lawsuit. Shaw is requesting that the Respondents, Rolalor and
Labyrinth, be wound up in satisfaction of an alleged debt owed in the total amount of R4,082,636 (approximately $480,000). The
two Notices were defended and argued in the High Court of South Africa (Durban) on January 31, 2014. Madam Justice Steryi dismissed
the action with costs on May 5, 2014. Ms. Shaw has appealed this decision. There has been no activity on this matter since 2014
and no amounts have been reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  

On
January 28, 2016, our Just Fresh subsidiary was notified that it had been served with a copyright infringement complaint, Kevin
Chelko Photography, Inc. v. JF Restaurants, LLC, Case No. 3:13-CV-60-GCM (W.D. N.C.). The claim was filed in the United States
District Court for the Western District of North Carolina Charlotte Division and seeks unspecified damages related to the use
of certain photographic assets allegedly in violation of the United States copyright laws. The Company has full insurance coverage
and has asserted numerous defenses in answer to the complaint, intends to defend itself fully and vigorously and no liability
has been reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  

Prior
to the Company s acquisition of Little Big Burger, a class action lawsuit was filed in Oregon by certain current and former
employees of Little Big Burger asserting that the former owners of Little Big Burger failed to compensate employees for overtime
hours and also that an employee had been wrongfully terminated. The plaintiffs and defendants agreed to enter into a settlement
agreement pursuant to which the former owners of Little Big Burger will pay a gross settlement of up to $675,000, inclusive of
plaintiffs  attorney s fees of $225,000. This settlement was approved by the court and all settlement payments
were distributed by the sellers and this matter closed prior to September 30, 2016.  

In
connection with our acquisition of Little Big Burger, the sellers agreed that the 1,619,646 shares of the Company s common
stock certain of the sellers received from the Company and an additional $200,000 in cash would be held in escrow until such time
as the litigation was fully resolved. The Company reflected the $675,000 settlement amount in accrued liabilities, with an offsetting
asset in other current assets, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2015. As of September 30, 2016,
the Company did not reflect either a liability or an asset as the lawsuit was fully resolved and all amounts paid by the sellers
prior to September 30, 2016.  

From
time to time, the Company may be involved in legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business.  

15.
    DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE   

Assets
and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are summarized in the following tables according to FASB ASC 820 pricing
levels.  

The
Company s available-for-sale equity securities were valued using Level 1 inputs as summarized above. Level 1 inputs are
based on unadjusted prices for identical assets in active markets that the Company can access. Level 2 inputs are based on quoted
prices for similar assets other than quoted prices in Level 1, quoted prices in markets that are not yet active, or other inputs
that are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term
of the assets.  

The
derivative liabilities are measured at fair value using quoted market prices and estimated volatility factors based on historical
quoted market prices for the Company s common stock and are classified within Level 3 of the valuation hierarchy.  

16.
    SUBSEQUENT EVENTS   

Management
has evaluated all events and transactions that occurred from October 1, 2016 through the date these condensed consolidated financial
statements were issued for subsequent events requiring recognition or disclosure in the condensed consolidated financial statements.  

On October 28, 2016, the
Company announced that it filed a registration statement on Form S-1 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC )
for a rights offering to its existing shareholders and public warrant holders. The proposed rights offering will consist of
non-transferable subscription rights to purchase up to an aggregate of 1,000,000 units, each unit consisting of one share of redeemable
Series 1 Preferred Stock and one Series 1 Warrant to purchase 10 shares of common stock, at an exercise price of $13.50 per unit.
Holders of the Series 1 Preferred will be entitled to receive cumulative dividends at the rate of 9% of the purchase price per
year for a term of seven years, payable quarterly. Each Series 1 Warrant may be exercised at any time within 7-years of issuance
by surrendering one share of Series 1 Preferred. Assuming the rights offering is fully subscribed, the Company would receive gross
proceeds of approximately $13.5 million. If successful, the rights offering proceeds would be used to retire certain of the Company s
current debt obligations, provide funds for store-related growth and for general working capital. The record date of the rights
offering has not yet been determined. There is no guarantee that the rights offering will be consummated, or if it is consummated
that it will raise sufficient capital to enable the Company to continue to execute its business strategy as currently contemplated.
A registration statement relating to these securities has been filed with the SEC but has not yet become effective. The securities
may not be sold nor may offers to buy be accepted prior to the time the registration statement becomes effective. There will not
be any sale of these securities in any state in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration
or qualification under the securities laws of any such state.

Management s
Analysis of Business   

We
are in the business of owning, operating and franchising fast casual and full service dining concepts in the United States and
internationally.  

We
own, operate and franchise a system-wide total of thirty-nine fast casual restaurants specializing the  Better Burger 
category of which twenty-seven are company-owned and twelve are operated by franchisees under franchise agreements. American Burger
Company ( ABC ) is a fast casual dining chain consisting of nine locations in New York and the Carolinas, known for
its diverse menu featuring, customized burgers, milk shakes, sandwiches, fresh salads and beer and wine. BGR: The Burger Joint
( BGR ), consists of ten company-owned locations in the United States and twelve franchisee-operated locations in
the United States and the Middle East. Little Big Burger ( LBB ) consists of eight locations in Oregon.  

We
own and operate Just Fresh, our healthier eating fast casual concept with eight company owned locations in Charlotte, North Carolina.
Just Fresh offers fresh-squeezed juices, gourmet coffee, fresh-baked goods and premium-quality, made-to-order sandwiches, salads
and soups.  

We
own and operate nine Hooters full service restaurants in the United States, South Africa, and the United Kingdom. Hooters restaurants
are casual beach-themed establishments featuring music, sports on large flat screens, and a menu that includes seafood, sandwiches,
burgers, salads, and of course, Hooters original chicken wings and the  nearly world famous  Hooters Girls. In addition,
the Company formerly operated six Hooters restaurants in Australia and Hungary. The Company determined it was in its best interest
to exit those regions and completed the transfer of ownership of those stores to the local operating managers during the third
quarter of 2016. Accordingly, those regions are treated as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements and
management s discussion and analysis.  

As
of September 30, 2016, our system-wide store count totaled 56 locations, consisting of 44 company-owned locations and 12 franchisee-operated
locations.  

RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 COMPARED TO THE THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2015   

Our
results of operations are summarized below:  

*
Restaurant cost of sales, operating expenses and pre-opening and closing expense percentages are based on restaurant sales, net.
Other percentages are based on total revenue.   

Revenue   

Total
revenue from continuing operations increased 18.3% to $11.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $9.3 million
for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  

The
increase resulted primarily from growth in our Better Burger Fast Casual group with the acquisition of BT s Burger Joint
and Little Big Burger in the second half of 2015, combined with sales increases at our American Burger Company restaurants which
were open during both periods and the opening of BGR s new Springfield mall location in Maryland. Revenues also increased
in our Just Fresh stores due to a combination of the addition of one new location and menu price increases in early 2016. Those
increases were partially offset by foreign currency rate fluctuations at our Hooters locations.  

Revenues
by concept and revenue type and a breakdown of system-wide store count are further summarized below:  

Restaurant
revenues from continuing operations increased 18.8% to $10.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $9.0 million
for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Revenue increased as the number of company owned stores increased from 30 to 44
and same store sales increased in our US stores; those increases were partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency
translation on our United Kingdom Hooters store.  

Restaurant
    revenue from the Company s Better Burger Group increased 38.9% to $5.6 million for the three months ended September
    30, 2016 from $4.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The growth in our Better Burger Group was due to
    increased store count as company-owned restaurants grew from 15 locations at the end of the prior period to 27 locations at
    the end of the current period. The majority of the growth in revenues and store count resulted from the acquisition of Little
    Big Burger on September 30, 2015. In addition, revenues from Better Burgers stores open in both periods increased 0.4%,
    the Company opened one new BGR location at Springfield Mall in Maryland and closed one American Burger location in Colombia,
    South Carolina.   

Restaurant
    revenue from the Company s Just Fresh Group increased 7.6% to $1.5 million for the three months ended September 30,
    2016 from $1.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Revenue growth resulted from primarily the addition
    of one new location in early 2016, as well as an increase in store level revenues of 3.2%.   

Restaurant
    revenue from the Company s Hooter s restaurants increased 0.3% to $3.6 million for the three months ended September
    30, 2016 from $3.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Revenue declined 11.2% in United Kingdom on a US
    dollar basis (3.0% on a local currency basis), and were negatively impacted by the foreign currency movements and local economic
    trends following the recent  Brexit  vote in that region. Revenue at our South Africa locations decreased overall
    as revenue from the Port Elizabeth location which was in its grand opening honeymoon period during the third quarter of the
    prior year, decreased. Excluding Port Elizabeth, same store sales at our South Africa locations increased 1.5% on a
    local currency basis and 19.7% on a US dollar basis.   

Gaming
revenue increased 25.7% due to increased play as a result of recent upgrades to the VLT terminals, which occurred in late 2015
and early 2016.  

Franchise
revenue decreased 20.3% to $96 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $120 thousand for the three months
ended September 30, 2015. The decline in franchise revenue is primarily due to limited new franchising activity in the current
period while the BGR groups is undertaking a comprehensive rebranding process to improve their store design and offerings.  

Management
fee revenue was unchanged at $25,000 in each period. The Company earns management fees for its CEO serving on the Board of Directors
of Hooters of America.  

Cost
of Restaurant sales   

Cost
of restaurant sales increased 16.9% to $3.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $3.0 million for the three
months ended September 30, 2015.  

Cost
of restaurant sales improved to 33.1% of net restaurant revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from 33.6% for
the three months ended September 30, 2015. Cost of sales improved in the Better Burger group from 32.9% to 32.2% and Just Fresh
improved from 35.2% to 34.7%, and Hooters was essentially flat at 33.9% from 33.8%.  

The
improvements in the Better Burger and Just Fresh groups are attributable to several factors, including purchase price reductions
and other efficiencies as a result of our increased scale and purchasing power, menu price increases which have been implemented
at most locations during the first half of 2016, and the favorable impact of reductions in beef and other commodity prices during
the past year. At Hooters, improvements in the US and South Africa where we have focused on supply chain improvements were offset
by higher cost of sales in the United Kingdom, partially attributable to higher import prices.  

Restaurant
operating expenses   

Restaurant
operating expenses increased 13.8% to $5.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $5.2 million for the three
months ended September 30, 2015 due to the increase in the number of store locations and related restaurant business volumes.  

Our
restaurant operating expenses as a percentage of restaurant sales for each region of operations
is included in the following table:  

As
a percent of restaurant revenues, operating expenses improved to 54.8% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from 57.3%
for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Operating expenses as a percent of revenue improved with the Better Burger group
improving from 58.4% to 53.6% and Just Fresh improving from 56.5% to 50.2%. The most significant driver of improved overall operating
expenses was in our Better Burger group, where lower operating costs inherent in Little Big Burger s more efficient operating
model created improved operating leverage for the overall group.  

Operating
expense comparisons also benefited from the closure of the American Burger Company s Columbia, South Carolina location in
2015 which carried higher fixed operating costs than our other stores. Just Fresh also improved due to increased focus on cost
controls throughout the system. Hooters operating expenses increased from 56.2% to 58.7% due primarily to revenue and operating
expense fluctuations in South Africa and, to a smaller degree, in the United States. In South Africa, operating expenses
were reduced from prior year at the store level due to cost cutting measures implemented due to the current economic climate,
but increased as a percentage of revenue due to lower revenue levels.  

Restaurant
pre-opening and closing expenses   

Restaurant
pre-opening and closing expenses decreased to $110 thousand for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $141 thousand for
the three months ended September 30, 2015. During 2015, the Company incurred costs related to the opening of the Hooters Port
Elizabeth location in South Africa. During 2016, the Company incurred costs related to three Little big Burger stores that are
currently under construction and expected to open in late 2016 and early 2017.  

General
and Administrative Expense ( G A )   

G A
decreased 18.2% to $1.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $1.7 million for the three months ended September
30, 2015. Significant components of G A are summarized as follows:  

As
a percentage of total revenue, G A decreased to 12.3% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from 17.8% for the three
months ended September 30, 2015.  

For
the current period, approximately 46% of G A is attributable to Corporate overhead, including salaries, travel, audit, legal
and other public company costs. Approximately 36%, 9%, and 9% of total G A attributable to regional management, franchising,
marketing, advertising, and other administrative activities within the Better Burger group, Hooters, and Just Fresh, respectively.  

The
improvement in G A is primarily due to lower audit, legal, professional and consulting fees. Fees paid to third party professionals
and others were a significant portion of the Company s expenses in 2015 due to the nature of the acquisition and financing
transactions occurring last year. During the current period, the Company did not incur significant fees related to acquisitions
or financing initiatives.  

In
addition, the company reduced its routine audit, legal and other professional fees from prior levels through increased focus on
cost reduction and rationalization of back office operations, while also leveraging the Company s overhead over a larger
business which favorably impacted G A as a percent of revenue. These reductions were partially offset by increased G A
and marketing expenses in our regional company store and franchising operations where the company s acquisition significantly
increased the operating scale and scope of our business.  

Depreciation
and amortization   

Depreciation
and amortization expense increased 66.7% to $0.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $0.4 million for the
three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in depreciation and amortization is due to increased depreciable property
and equipment and intangible assets associated with acquired and newly opened restaurants.  

OTHER
INCOME (EXPENSE)    

Other
income (expense) consisted of the following:  

Other
expense, net decreased 46.5% to $0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $0.6 million for the three months
ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in other expenses, net was primarily due to lower non-cash interest, amortization, derivative
liability adjustments and other charges arising from our convertible and other debt obligations.  

Interest
expense decreased 31.1% to $0.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 from $0.7 million for the three months ended
September 30, 2015. The reduction in interest are primarily due to lower average outstanding debt balances due to debt conversions
occurring in 2015, combined with lower amortization of debt discount.  

The
Company recognized changes in the fair value of derivative liabilities totaling $0.1 million for the three months ended September
30, 2016 as compared with $0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. This is a non-cash income or expense associated
with our convertible debt and is adjusted quarterly based primarily on the change in the fair value of the price of the
Company s common stock.  

Loss
on extinguishment of debt was zero in the current period and $0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. During
2015, several of the Company s convertible notes and one of the Company s term debt instruments were converted by
the holders into shares of the Company s common stock. In connection with the conversions, the Company recognized a loss
on extinguishment of convertible debt, related accrued interest, penalties and derivative liabilities. The Company did not have
any debt conversions or loss on extinguishments in the current year.  

RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS FOR THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2016 COMPARED TO THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2015   

Our
results of operations are summarized below:  

*
Restaurant cost of sales, operating expenses and pre-opening and closing expense percentages are based on restaurant sales, net.
Other percentages are based on total revenue.   

Revenue   

Total
revenue from continuing operations increased 30.3% to $31.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $24.4 million
for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  

The
increase resulted primarily from growth in our Better Burger Fast Casual group with the acquisition of BT s Burger Joint
and Little Big Burger in the second half of 2015, combined with sales increases at our American Burger Company restaurants which
were open during both periods and the opening of BGR s new Springfield mall location in Maryland. Those increases were partially
offset by lower revenues from our Hooters restaurants, primarily due to foreign currency rate fluctuations.  

Revenues
by concept and revenue type and a breakdown of system-wide store count are further summarized below:  

Restaurant
revenues increased 30.4% to $31.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $23.8 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015. Revenue increased as the number of company owned stores increased from 30 to 44; those increases were
partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation on our South Africa and United Kingdom stores.  

Restaurant
    revenue from the Company s Better Burger Group increased 90.4% to $16.8 million for the nine months ended September
    30, 2016 from $8.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The growth in our Better Burger Group was primarily
    due to the acquisitions of Little Big Burger, BGR The Burger Joint and BT s Burger Joint. In addition,
    same store revenues from American Burger locations open in both periods increased 4.5% and the Company opened one new BGR
    location at Springfield Mall in Maryland and closed one American Burger location in Colombia, South Carolina.   

Restaurant
    revenue from the Company s Just Fresh Group increased 4.5% to $4.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016
    from $4.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Revenue growth resulted from primarily the addition of one
    new location in early 2016, as well as an increase in store level revenues of 0.7%   

Restaurant
    revenue from the Company s Hooter s restaurants decreased 8.6% to $9.9 million for the nine months ended September
    30, 2016 from $10.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Revenue declined 10.2 % in United Kingdom on a US
    dollar basis (1.7% on a local currency basis), and were negatively impacted by the foreign currency movements and local economic
    trends following the recent  Brexit  vote in that region. Revenue at our South Africa locations increased overall
    as revenue from the Port Elizabeth location which opened during the third quarter of the prior year contributed for a full
    nine months in 2016. Excluding Port Elizabeth, same store sales at our South Africa locations decreased 6.5% on a local currency
    basis and 17.3% on a US dollar basis due to the impact of soft local economic conditions on consumer spending and weakening
    exchange rates.   

Gaming
revenue increased 21.2% due to increased play as a result of recent upgrades to the VLT terminals, which occurred in late 2015
and early 2016.  

Franchise
revenue increased 40.8% to $0.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $0.3 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2015. The Company commenced its franchise operations in middle of March 2015 with the acquisition of BGR. Accordingly,
the 2015 period includes 6   months of franchise activity, whereas the current period contains a full nine months of franchise
activity. The increase in franchise revenue as a result of additional months in the period was partially offset by limited new
franchising activity while the BGR group is undertaking a comprehensive rebranding process to improve their store design and offerings.  

Management
fee revenue was unchanged at $75,000 in each period. The Company earns management fees for its CEO serving on the Board of Directors
of Hooters of America.  

Cost
of Restaurant sales   

Cost
of restaurant sales increased 25.1% to $10.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $8.2 million for
the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  

Cost
of restaurant sales improved to 33.0% from 34.4% of net restaurant sales. Cost of sales improved in all three operating segments
with the Better Burger group improving from 33.7% to 32.2%, Hooters improving from 34.6% to 33.4% and Just Fresh improving from
35.2% to 34.9%. These improvements are attributable to several factors, including price reductions and other efficiencies as a
result of our increased scale and purchasing power, menu price increases which have been implemented at most locations during
the first half of 2016, and the favorable impact of reductions in beef and other commodity prices during the past year.  

Restaurant
operating expenses   

Restaurant
operating expenses increased 24.2% to $17.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $13.8 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2015 due to the increase in the number of store locations and related restaurant business volumes.  

Our
restaurant operating expenses as a percentage of restaurant sales for each region of operations
is included in the following table:  

As
a percent of restaurant revenues, operating expenses improved to 55.2% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from 57.9%
for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Operating expenses as a percent of revenue improved in the Better Burger group from
60.8% to 54.2%, and in the Just Fresh business from 53.6% to 51.1%. Operating expenses in our Hooters group changed from 57.3%
to 58.5%.  

The
most significant driver of improved overall operating expenses was in our Better Burger group, where lower operating costs inherent
in Little Big Burger s more efficient operating model created improved operating leverage for the overall group. Operating
expense comparisons also benefited from the closure of the American Burger Company s Columbia South Carolina location in
2015 which carried higher fixed operating costs than our other stores. Just Fresh improved due to increased focus on controlling
costs. At Hooters, operating expenses as a percent off revenue increased primarily due to the impact of lower revenue in South
Africa, where a 7.8% reduction in local currency operating expenses was more than offset by the 13.2% reduction in revenue due
to unfavorable local economic conditions.  

Restaurant
pre-opening expenses   

Restaurant
pre-opening expenses decreased 75.5% to $0.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $0.5 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2015. During 2015, the Company incurred costs related to closure of the American Burger Company Colombia,
South Carolina location and the opening of the Hooters Port Elizabeth location in South Africa. During 2016, the Company incurred
costs related to three Little big Burger stores that are currently under construction and expected to open in late 2016 and early
2017.  

General
and Administrative Expense ( G A )   

G A
decreased 14.8% to $4.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $5.2 million for the nine months ended September
30, 2016. Significant components of G A are summarized as follows:  

As
a percentage of total revenue, G A decreased to 13.8% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from 21.1% for the nine
months ended September 30, 2015.  

For
the current period, approximately 47% of G A is attributable to Corporate overhead, including salaries, travel, audit, legal
and other public company costs. Approximately 35%, 11%, and 7% of total G A are attributable to regional management, franchising,
marketing, advertising, and other administrative activities within the Better Burger group, Hooters, and Just Fresh, respectively.  

The
improvement in G A is primarily due reduce audit, legal, professional and consulting fees. Fees paid to third party professionals
were a significant portion of the Company s expenses in 2015 due to the nature of the acquisition and financing transactions
occurring last year. During the current period, the Company did not incur significant fees related to acquisitions or financing
initiatives.  

In
addition, the company reduced its routine audit, legal and other professional fees from prior levels through increased focus on
cost reduction and rationalization of back office operations, while also leveraging the Company s overhead over a larger
business which favorably impacted G A as a percent of revenue. These reductions were partially offset by increased G A
and marketing expenses in our regional company store and franchising operations where the company s acquisition significantly
increased the operating scale and scope of our business.  

Depreciation
and amortization   

Depreciation
and amortization expense increased 78.6% to $1.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $1.0 million for the
nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in depreciation and amortization is due to increased depreciable property and
equipment and intangible assets associated with acquired and newly opened restaurants.  

OTHER
INCOME (EXPENSE)    

Other
income (expense) consisted of the following:  

Other
expense, net decreased 78.8% to $0.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $2.2 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in other expenses, net was primarily due to lower non-cash interest, amortization, derivative
liability adjustments and other charges arising from our convertible and other debt obligations.  

Interest
expense decreased 37.7% to $1.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from $2.7 million the nine months ended September
30, 2015. The reduction in interest are primarily due to lower average outstanding debt balances due to debt conversions occurring
in 2015, combined with lower amortization of debt discount.  

The
Company recognized changes in the fair value of derivative liabilities totaling $1.2 million for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 as compared with $0.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The liability is a non-cash income or expense
associated with our convertible debt and is adjusted quarterly based on the change in the fair value of the price of the Company s
common stock.  

Loss
on extinguishment of debt was zero in the current period and $0.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. During
2015, several of the Company s convertible notes and one of the Company s term debt instruments were converted by
the holders into shares of the Company s common stock. In connection with the conversions, the Company recognized a loss
on extinguishment of convertible debt, related accrued interest, penalties and derivative liabilities. The Company did not have
any debt conversions or loss on extinguishments in the current year.  

LIQUIDITY,
CAPITAL RESOURCES AND GOING CONCERN   

As
of September 30, 2016, our cash balance was $1.0 million. At September 30, 2016, the Company had current assets of $2.1 million,
current liabilities of $14.9 million, and a working capital deficit of $12.8 million. The Company has $9.7 million
in notes and convertible debt obligations which could potentially be called for payment within the next twelve months. The Company
incurred a loss from continuing operations of $2.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The level of additional
cash needed to fund operations and our ability to conduct business for the next twelve months will be influenced primarily by
the following factors:  

the
    pace of growth in our restaurant businesses and related investments in opening new stores;   

the
    level of investment in acquisition of new restaurant businesses and entering new markets;   

our
    ability to manage our operating expenses and maintain gross margins and reduce operating losses as we grow;   

our
    ability to access the capital and debt markets, including our ability to refinance or extend the maturities of our current
    obligations;   

popularity
    of and demand for our fast casual dining concepts; and   

general
    economic conditions and changes in consumer discretionary income.   

Our
operating plans for the next twelve months contemplate moderate organic growth, opening 6 - 10 new stores within our current markets
and restaurant concepts. We have typically funded our operating costs, acquisition activities, working capital investments and
capital expenditures with proceeds from the issuances of our common stock and other financing arrangements, including convertible
debt, lines of credit, notes payable and capital leases.  

During
2015, we completed two rights offering providing net proceeds of approximately $13.1 million, completed a private placement transaction
providing net proceeds of approximately $1.9 million and issued $2.2 million in convertible notes to fund the acquisitions of
BGR: The Burger Joint, BT s Burger Joint, Little Big Burger and for other general corporate purposes.  

During
2016, we entered into a letter of intent with a US investor to finance the opening of up to 10 Little Big Burger restaurants in
the Seattle, Washington area. We also entered into a letter of intent with potential investors to finance the opening of additional
Little Big Burger restaurants pursuant to the US governments EB-5 program. During the third quarter of 2016, we closed transactions
totaling $750,000 with investors for the opening of Little Big Burger stores in Seattle and Portland.  

We are currently seeking
financing through a proposed public rights offering consisting of non-transferable subscription rights to purchase units, each
unit consisting of one share of redeemable preferred stock and one warrant to purchase 10 shares of common stock. A registration
statement relating to these securities has been filed with the Securities Exchange Commission but has not yet become effective. 

There
can be no assurances that the Company will be successful in completing the rights offering or any other equity or debt
financing. In the event that such capital is not available, we may then need to scale back or freeze our organic growth plans,
reduce general and administrative expenses, and/or curtail future acquisition plans to manage our liquidity and capital resources.
In addition, we may not be able to payoff or otherwise extend the maturities of our current obligations, or continue to operate
as a going concern, which would have an adverse impact on the Company and its shareholders.  

In
addition, our business is subject to additional risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those described Part II,
Item 1A of this Quarterly Report and in Item 1A of Part I of our Annual Report filed on Form 10-K for the period ended December
31, 2015.  Risk Factors .  

CRITICAL
ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

Our
condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. Preparation of these statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected by the application
of our accounting policies. Critical accounting policies are those that require application of management s most difficult,
subjective, or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently
uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. A summary of significant accounting policies and a description of accounting policies
that are considered critical may be found in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission on September 30, 2016, in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1, and the Critical Accounting Policies
section of Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  

Item
3: QUANTITATIVE and QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK   

Not
applicable.  

Item
4: Controls and Procedures   

Evaluation
of disclosure controls and procedures   

Under
the PCAOB standards, a control deficiency exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees,
in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A significant
deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting that is less severe
than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit the attention by those responsible for oversight of the company s
financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting,
such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company s annual or interim financial statements
will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.  

Under
the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial
officer, we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such terms are defined under Rule 13a-15(e)
and Rule 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended ( Exchange Act ), as of December
31, 2015. Our management has determined that, as of September 30, 2016, the Company s disclosure controls and procedures
were ineffective.  

Management s
report on internal control over financial reporting   

Management
Responsibility for Internal Control over Financial Reporting . Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective
internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. The Company s internal control
over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company s management and Board of Directors
regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements in accordance with the United States 
generally accepted accounting principles (US GAAP), including those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance
of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and disposition of the assets of the Company;
(ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with US GAAP and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management
and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition of the Company s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Therefore, even
those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation
and presentation.  

Management s
Evaluation of Internal Control over Financial Reporting . Management evaluated our internal control over financial reporting
as of September 30, 2016. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations
of the Treadway Commission in  Internal Control   Integrated Framework . As a result of this assessment and based on
the criteria in this framework, management has concluded that, as September 30, 2016, our internal control over financial reporting
was ineffective.  

Material
Weaknesses   

A
material weakness is a control deficiency, or a combination of control deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting,
such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not
be prevented or detected on a timely basis.  

Management
identified the following deficiencies in its internal control over financial reporting:  

As
    the Company recently completed multiple acquisitions in a short period of time, it currently operates multiple accounting
    systems using disparate charts of accounts and inconsistent financial close procedures and timetables. The lack of consistency
    makes it more difficult to ensure that the consolidated financial records are completed timely and on a consistent basis each
    reporting period, which increases the risk of undetected errors.   

The
    Company s financial close procedures are not formally documented across the organization to the degree necessary to
    ensure that financial statements are prepared consistently and accurately each reporting period.   

The
    Company s information systems, as well as the organization and storage of critical financial records, were not deemed
    adequate to ensure the timely ability to recover from a disaster or prevent the accidental loss of critical financial records.   

The
    Company s financial statements include complex transactions and financial instruments that are subject to extensive
    technical accounting standards that increase the risk of undetected errors and where the Company s internal resources
    do not possess deep technical specialization.   

The
    Company performs extensive reconciliation and manual review procedures to ensure that the financial statements results are
    accurately presented, however, there is inconsistent and informal documentation of those review procedures.   

Management
determined that the deficiencies, evaluated in the aggregate, could potentially result in a material misstatement of the consolidated
financial statements in a future annual or interim period that would not be prevented or detected. Therefore, the deficiencies
constitute material weaknesses in internal control. Based on that evaluation, management determined that our internal control
over financial reporting was not effective as of September 30, 2016.  

Remediation
Plans   

We
have initiated several steps and plan to continue to evaluate and implement measures designed to improve our internal control
over financial reporting in order to remediate the control deficiencies noted above.  

While
our evaluation of the appropriate remediation plans is still ongoing, efforts to date have included recruiting additional qualified
personnel with experience in financial reporting and internal control. We are also in the process of migrating the majority of
our operations to a common accounting system, standardizing charts of accounts and formalizing the documentation of accounting
close and review procedures.  

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting    As a result of the acquisitions, the Company is evaluating additional
changes to processes and policies to further standardize the internal control over financial reporting with respect to the monitoring,
reporting and consolidation of the financial results of the acquired operations into the Company s financial statements.
There were no changes in the Company s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended
September 30, 2016, that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s internal control
over financial reporting.  

PART
II   OTHER INFORMATION    

ITEM
1: LEGAL PROCEEDINGS   

We
are subject to various legal proceedings from time to time in the ordinary course of business, which may not be required to be
disclosed under this Item 1. For the nine month period ending September 30, 2016 covered by this Quarterly Report, there have
been no reportable legal proceedings or material developments to previously reported legal proceedings.  

ITEM
1A: RISK FACTORS   

We
are in default under notes payable in the amount of $5,856,073 due to the appointment of an administrator over the Australia Hooters
entities in the third quarter of 2015.     

We
are in default under notes payable in the amount of $5,856,073 due to the appointment of an administrator over the Australia Hooters
entities in the third quarter of 2015. These notes are deemed accelerated until such time as we are able to renegotiate the terms
or obtain a waiver of the default. To date the note holders have given no indication that they intend to enforce acceleration
of the various notes. However, our inability to renegotiate the terms of these notes or obtain a waiver and action by the note
holders to collect on the accelerated notes could adversely affect our growth and our operating results.  

Other
than the addition of the foregoing risk factors, there have been no material changes to our risk factors as previously disclosed
in  Risk Factors  in Item 1A of Part I of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. Readers
should carefully consider the risk factors disclosed under this Item IA and other risk factors discussed in  Risk Factors 
in Item 1A of Part I of the Annual Report on Form 10-K, which could materially affect our business, financial condition or future
results. The risks described in this Quarterly Report and the Annual Report on Form 10-K are not the only risks we face. Additional
risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect
our business, financial condition or future results.  

We
have $9.6 million in notes and convertible debt obligations, which could potentially be called for payment within the next twelve
months. Our current operations are contingent upon successfully obtaining additional financing in the near future, and failure
to obtain financing will adversely affect our growth and operating results    

If
capital is not available, we may then need to scale back or freeze our organic growth plans, reduce general and administrative
expenses, and/or curtail future acquisition plans to manage our liquidity and capital resources. We may also not be able refinance
or otherwise extend or repay our current obligations of $9.6 million, or continue to operate as a going concern.  

The
uncertainty surrounding the implementation and effect of Brexit may impact our UK operations.    

The
uncertainty surrounding the implementation and effect of Brexit, including the commencement of the exit negotiation period, the
terms and conditions of such exit, the uncertainty in relation to the legal and regulatory framework that would apply to the UK
and its relationship with the remaining members of the EU (including, in relation to trade) during a withdrawal process and after
any Brexit is effected, has caused and is likely to cause increased economic volatility and market uncertainty globally. It is
too early to ascertain the long term effects. To date, the only measurable impact is attributable to the decline in the pound
sterling as measured against the U.S. dollar.  

Negative
publicity could reduce sales at some or all of our restaurants.    

We
may, from time to time, be faced with negative publicity relating to food quality and integrity, the safety, sanitation and welfare
of our restaurant facilities, customer complaints or litigation alleging illness or injury, health inspection scores, integrity
of our or our suppliers  food processing and other policies, practices and procedures, employee relationships and welfare
or other matters at one or more of our restaurants. Negative publicity may adversely affect us, regardless of whether the allegations
are valid or whether we are held to be responsible. The risk of negative publicity is particularly great with respect to our franchised
restaurants because we are limited in the manner in which we can regulate them, especially on a real-time basis and negative publicity
from our franchised restaurants may also significantly impact company-operated restaurants. A similar risk exists with respect
to food service businesses unrelated to us, if customers mistakenly associate such unrelated businesses with our operations. Employee
claims against us based on, among other things, wage and hour violations, discrimination, harassment or wrongful termination may
also create not only legal and financial liability but negative publicity that could adversely affect us and divert our financial
and management resources that would otherwise be used to benefit the future performance of our operations. These types of employee
claims could also be asserted against us, on a co-employer theory, by employees of our franchisees. A significant increase in
the number of these claims or an increase in the number of successful claims could materially adversely affect our business, financial
condition, results of operations and cash flows.  

The
interests of our franchisees may conflict with ours or yours in the future and we could face liability from our franchisees or
related to our relationship with our franchisees.    

Franchisees,
as independent business operators, may from time to time disagree with us and our strategies regarding the business or our interpretation
of our respective rights and obligations under the franchise agreement and the terms and conditions of the franchisee/franchisor
relationship or have interests adverse to ours. This may lead to disputes with our franchisees and we expect such disputes to
occur from time to time in the future as we continue to offer franchises. Such disputes may result in legal action against us.
To the extent we have such disputes, the attention, time and financial resources of our management and our franchisees will be
diverted from our restaurants, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations
and cash flows even if we have a successful outcome in the dispute.  

In
addition, various state and federal laws govern our relationship with our franchisees and our potential sale of a franchise. A
franchisee and/or a government agency may bring legal action against us based on the franchisee/franchisor relationships that
could result in the award of damages to franchisees and/or the imposition of fines or other penalties against us.
