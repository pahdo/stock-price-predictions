Organization and Nature of Business   
   
 DS Healthcare Group, Inc. (d/b/a DS Laboratories) (the  Company ,  DS Laboratories ,  DSKX ,  we ,  us  or  our ) was organized under the laws of the State of Florida in January 2007. Through its predecessors, the Company has been developing and marketing hair care, skin care and personal care products for over fifteen years. The Company has grown steadily over the last few years with a network of top specialty retailers and distributors throughout North America, Europe, Asia and South America. The Company researches and develops its own products, which management believes keeps the Company at the forefront of innovation. The Company utilizes two innovative technologies in its products, (1)  Liposome Technology , which acts as a carrier agent, and has been designed to enhance the action of the active ingredients in our products, and (2)  Nanosome Technology , which acts as a delivery vehicle, and has been designed to infuse active compounds into targeted cells for increased efficiency of our products. We currently offer products within the following broad product categories:  Hair Care, Skin Care and Personal Care. 
   
  NOTE 2.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES  
   
   Principles of Consolidation and Presentation   
   
 The condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared using the accrual basis of accounting where revenues and expenses are recognized in the period in which they were incurred. The basis of accounting conforms to US GAAP. 
   
 The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its operating subsidiaries DS Laboratories, Inc., Sigma Development and Holding Co., Inc., Polaris Labs, Inc., Polymer Research, Inc., and Divine Skin Laboratories, S.A. de CV ( DS Mexico ). Also included in the condensed consolidated financial statements are the operating activities of Velocity Storage and Packaging, LLC, which are accounted for as VIEs. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 
   
 On March 30, 2016, during the preparation of the Company s 10-K, the company identified that certain transactions recorded in the company s 10-K report for it consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2014 and the results of each quarterly 10-Q filings for the period ending September 30, 2015 became subject to an internal investigation.  The internal investigation resulted in the company s inability to timely file it s for 10-Q as required.   
   
 The Company continued its review these transactions with its newly appointed independent accountants, the results of which have now been corrected and reflected in the restated unaudited consolidated financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2015.   The corrective actions identified errors related to sales and customer returns and allowances, amounts with respect to the recognition of revenues and customer accounts receivable, and the recording of certain stock transactions.

NOTE 2.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)  
   
 The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors consulted with management and analyzed the adjustments with the intent to correct the 2014 and 2015 10-Q filings to reflect these errors.  However, because of the above mentioned errors, the Audit Committee has directed the Company to conduct a thorough review of the financial records for calendar years ended 2014 and 2015 along with its independent accountants and believes the restated financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014 included herein to be fairly presented. 
   
   Interim Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements   
   
 The interim condensed consolidated financial statements presented herein have been prepared pursuant to the rules and regulations of the SEC. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with US GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations. The interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s annual consolidated financial statements and related disclosures included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on April 15, 2015. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting only of those of a normal recurring nature) which are necessary to provide a fair presentation of financial position as of March 31, 2015 and the related operating results and cash flows for the interim periods presented have been made.  The results of operations for the periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for future periods or for the year ending December 31, 2015. 
   
   Use of Estimates   
   
 The preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the condensed consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Although these estimates are based on management s knowledge of current events and actions it may undertake in the future, they may ultimately differ from actual results. We believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable; however, such estimates and assumptions are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from such estimates. Significant estimates and assumptions underlying these condensed consolidated financial statements include: 

Estimates of allowances for uncollectable accounts receivable, 

Estimates of inventory obsolescence and overhead and labor cost allocations, 

Estimates assuming future earning capacity of our intangible assets, 

Estimates of value of equity transactions for services rendered, 

Estimates of returned or damaged product, and 

Estimates made in our deferred income tax calculations, for which there is a full valuation allowance. 

Accounts Receivable   
   
 Accounts receivable are reported at their net realizable value. The Company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon factors pertaining to the credit risk of specific customers, historical trends, and other information. Delinquent accounts are written-off when it is determined that the amounts are uncollectible. The Company also provides for allowances against accounts receivables for product returns and cooperative advertising allowances. At March 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the allowance for uncollectable accounts was $251,825 and $268,329, respectively, $210,000 at both dates for defectives and product returns and $60,000 at both dates for advertising credits. 
   
   Inventories   
   
 Inventory is reported at the lower of cost or market on the FIFO method. Our inventory is subject to expiration and obsolescence. Accordingly, quantities purchased and sell through rates are periodically monitored for potential overstocking or pending expiration as a basis for establishing the appropriate reserve for any estimated expiration or obsolescence.

NOTE 2.   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Continued)  
   
   Revenue Recognition   
   
 The Company s revenue recognition policies are in compliance with ASC Topic 605,  Revenue Recognition , which establishes criteria that must be satisfied before revenue is realized or realizable and earned. The Company recognizes revenue when all of the following four criteria are met: 

persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists, 

Shipping terms are FOB shipping point, 

delivery has occurred, 

the sales price is fixed or determinable and 

collectability is probable. 

Shipping and handling charges related to sales transactions are recorded as sales revenues when billed to customers or included in the sales price.  Shipping and handling costs are included in cost of goods sold. 
   
   Research and Development   
   
 The Company currently maintains a functional laboratory employing a full time chemist, a part time chemist/consultant and a lab technician that identify new technology, test product alternatives and improve existing formulations. In addition, our founder and CEO devotes a substantial portion of his time in identifying new technologies and formulations to develop new products and improve existing products with the newest technology available. Such activities are expensed in the year incurred. Such costs include laboratory supplies, salaries, materials and consultant fees. These costs are classified as product development, salaries, selling, general and administrative expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of operations, and amounted to $47,326 and $98,568 for 2015-QTR and 2014-QTR, respectively. 
   
   Earnings Per Share   
   
 Potentially dilutive securities are excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share for all of the periods presented in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations because the reported net loss in each of these periods results in their inclusion being antidilutive. Antidilutive securities, which consist of stock options and warrants that are not included in the diluted net loss per share calculation, consisted of an aggregate of 286,526 shares as of March 31, 2015 and 2014.

NOTE 3.   LIQUIDITY and GOING CONCERN  
   
 We have sustained operational losses since our inception. At March 31, 2015, we had an accumulated deficit of $11,105,490. The Company cannot predict how long it will continue to incur further losses or whether it will ever become profitable as this is dependent upon the reduction of certain operating expenses, success of new and existing products and increase in overall revenue among other things. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern. 
   
  As of March 31, 2015, we had $652,093 in cash. While we have historically financed our operations and growth primarily through the successful issuance and sale of shares of our common stock, a line of credit and the issuance of promissory notes, the Company has started several new revenue initiatives creating additional revenue streams.  Some of these initiatives include: establishing an online store (   Shop.DSLaboratories.com   ) which became operational in the third quarter of 2014, generating $131,107 2014-YTD and $85,636 2015-QTR     in net revenue, respectively. The company also established a hair treatment clinic which opened in late November 2014 which has not yet generated appreciable sales. In the first quarter 2015, we have launched a range of new products. Although we cannot predict our success with these products or projects, all are currently under development and production and in various stages of completion. We have commenced implementing, and will continue to implement, various measures to address our financial condition, including but not limited to:  

Continuing to seek debt and equity financing. However, there can be no assurances that the Company will be able to raise additional capital on favorable terms, or at all. 

We completed an operational budget for 2015 that sets changes in our processes to focus on profitability.  We are also implementing a feedback process with improved interdepartmental communication.    

Accordingly, the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with US GAAP, which contemplates continuation of the Company as a going concern.  The condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and carrying amount or classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty. We have commenced implementing, and will continue to implement, various measures to address our financial condition. 
   
  NOTE 4.   RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS   
   
 Management continually evaluates the potential impact, if any, of all recent accounting pronouncements on our condensed consolidated financial statements or related disclosures and, if significant, makes the appropriate disclosures required by such new accounting pronouncements. 
   
 In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03(ASU 2015-03),  Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs . This standard amends the existing guidance to require that debt issuance costs be presented in the balance sheet as a deduction from the carrying amount of the related debt liability instead of as a deferred charge. ASU 2015-03 is effective on a retrospective basis for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, but early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's condensed consolidated financial position and results of operations. 
   
  NOTE 5.   RESTATEMENT OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
   
 On September 28, 2016, during the preparation of the Company s 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, the company identified certain transactions recorded in the company s 10-K report for it consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2014 and the results of each quarterly 10-Q filings for the period ending March 31, 2015, June 30, 2015 and September 30, 2015, and determined these transactions did not reflect the proper matching of revenues and costs. The impact of these transactions on the Company s financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2014, have been considered and have been disclosed and reported in the notes to the Company s financial statements as reported in the annual 10-K report for the year ending December 31, 2014.

NOTE 11.     COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES  
   
 During the three months ended March 31, 2015, the Company operated under several material agreements as listed below: 
   
 Lease for office and production facilities     

The Company is party to a lease for a total of 1,875 square feet in sales facilities located in Ashville, North Carolina. The leases provide for monthly rent of $4,725 throughout the lease term which both expire on December 31, 2015.  Effective September 30, 2014 the Company has relocated this office to its Florida headquarters and as of March 31, 2015 is still in negotiations with the landlord to formalize the lease termination.  

The Company was party to a lease for 50,000 square feet in warehouse and corporate office space located in Deerfield Beach, Florida, which expired in July 2014. On June 25, 2014, commencing August 1, 2014, the Company completed negotiations for a new lease for the same Deerfield Beach location. The terms of the new lease provide for $6.00 per square foot or $24,720 per month base rent plus $10,918 monthly in operating expenses and terminates on July 31, 2019. The lease provides for annual increases in the monthly base rent of $0.24- $0.27 per square foot. 

The Company s Mexican facility leases 246 square feet of office space and 1,230 square feet of warehouse Mexico City, Mexico, which expires in July 2015.  The leases provide for monthly rent of $1,408. 
   
 The Company accounts for its facility leases using the straight-line method and incurred $106,914 and $99,884 in total rent expense in the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 
   
 The Company is committed to lease payments over the next five years as follows:  

Pending and threatened litigation    
   
 On June 13, 2011, we filed an action in the Circuit Court of the Eleventh Judicial Circuit in and for Miami-Dade County, Florida for the rescission of an investor relations and consulting agreement entered into on or about October 15, 2010 whereby we paid a third party approximately $20,000 and 23,000 shares of restricted common stock in consideration of investor relations and consulting services. We have demanded return of the 23,000 shares of restricted stock and recovery of costs and other damages. The third party has filed a counter claim for breach of the agreement. We intend to continue vigorously defend this claim.  
   
 During 2011, we filed an action in the Circuit Court of the Eleventh Judicial Circuit in and for Miami-Dade County, Florida for the rescission of an agreement entered into on or about May 18, 2010 whereby we paid a third party approximately $500 and 20,000 shares of restricted common stock in consideration of consulting services. We had demanded return of the 20,000 shares of restricted stock and recovery of costs and other damages. The claim was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction and we re-filed the action in the Supreme Court, New York County, New York on or about January 11, 2012, seeking rescission of said agreement and the return of $500 and 20,000 shares of restricted common stock.  During March 2014, the matter was settled and each party released the other from all claims related to the action.  Under a settlement matter and general release, the defendant agreed to return to Company treasury 10,000 shares common stock subject to the dispute, and of the remaining 10,000 shares, the defendant agreed to a one year lock up agreement covering 60% of the shares for a period of one year from the settlement date. As of March 31, 2015, the agreed shares have not been returned to treasury.

NOTE 11.   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (Continued)  
   
 From time to time, the Company may be involved in various claims and legal actions arising from the ordinary course of business.  In the opinion of management, the ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company s condensed consolidated financial position or results of operations. 
   
   Purchase commitments   
   
 In order to secure an adequate supply of raw materials, the Company executes purchase orders to its suppliers as evidence of its intent to purchase materials. Purchase orders outstanding at March 31, 2015 totaled $496,994. 
   
   Contract contingencies   
   
 Our distribution agreement with Gamma Investors, a shareholder of the Company, provides that in the event we terminate the agreement without cause, we are required to repurchase all products held in Gamma s inventory and pay Gamma a fee equal to the greater of the prior 12 month product purchased by Gamma or $2 million. Transactions with Gamma have been de minimus to date.

 Throughout the year ended 2014 and 2015, Daniel Khesin, the Company's former chief executive officer and former chief financial officer, received in addition to base compensation, reimbursement and payroll advances of expenses of approximately $76,000 and $40,000 respectively, which were for non-business related goods and services. Pursuant to his executive employment agreement $50,000 in shares were to be payable in shares of the Company's common stock at fiscal year-end. While Mr. Khesin believed that these payments were received as satisfaction of certain bonus or other perquisites earned by him on a monthly basis under his employment agreement, such payments, if any, required approval of our compensation committee, which approval was not received until subsequent to 2014 and 2015. Section 402 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 prohibits advances or loans to a director or executive officer of a public company. While our audit committee has concluded that the payments made to Mr. Khesin prior to board approval may be in violation of Section 402 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, in the event it is determined any such payments were a violation of the Sarbanes Oxley Act, such violation could have a material adverse effect on our Company, including, but not limited to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, penalties, or investigations, in addition to potential securities litigation. As a consequence of these activities, the company received notice from its independent auditor of potential illegal acts concerning payments of personal expenses by the Company. The Company s Audit Committee has agreed with the findings. On September 29 th , 2016. The company, in accordance with Section 10A of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, informed the Commission in a letter also dated September 29 th , 2016. See  Controls and Procedures  and  Executive Compensation  below. 
   
 During 2013, in addition to base compensation paid to Abner Silva, a consultant deemed to be an officer by our independent auditor for accounting purposes, our company advanced approximately $11,500, to Mr. Silva. While Mr. Silva, believed that these payments were received as satisfaction of certain moneys owed to him or his affiliate companies, such payments, if any, required prior approval of our compensation committee, which approval was not received. As a consequence of these activities, the company received notice from its independent auditor of potential illegal acts concerning payments of personal expenses by the company on September 29 th , 2016. The company, in accordance with Section 10A of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, informed the Commission in a letter also dated September 29 th , 2016. 
   
 In December 2015, the Company, under former management entered into an agreement with a barter trading company to sell slow moving, finished goods in exchange for prepaid credits. During 2015 and through April 2016, the Company sold merchandise worth $956,176 and $4,566,717 to this barter trading company. However, these credits proved to have no economic value and accordingly revenue did not meet the criteria as defined in Accounting Standards Codification 605 ( ASC ). The Company has reversed the sales to this barter trading company that did not meet the revenue standards. 
   
 In January 2016, the company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with a private party in the amount of $1,996,500 for 605,000 shares of the company s stock. To date, the purchase agreement has only partially settled. The Company s has offset subscription receivable against the additional paid in capital of $1,196,500. The Board of Directors has decided to negotiate a revision to the original Stock Purchase Agreement to reach an appropriate resolution to the matter. The company has no way of knowing what the financial impact will be. 
   
 On May 2, 2016, the company received a letter from an attorney representing its former CEO, Renee Barch-Niles requesting certain payments she believes are due arising from her employment contract. This includes salary demands, equity demands and commission demands on the above barter transaction. The total claims made by Ms. Barch-Niles are $2,500,000 worth of shares of the company s stock, $123,000 in commissions from the barter trading arrangement, and $300,000 in severance payments. The company maintains that Ms. Barch-Niles is not due any payments subsequent to her separation from the company and will take all appropriate action to defend against the claims.

The company s failure to promptly initiate and conduct an independent investigation, recommended by its previous independent auditors, into concerns identified by its former board of directors, including concerns regarding revenue recognition and stock issuances, among other matters; and 2. The Company s inability to produce minutes evidencing meetings of the Company s board of directors for calendar year 2015 and for the first four months of calendar year 2016. Further, and also as a separate basis for delisting, Nasdaq informed the company of its belief the Company had made misleading statements and/or omitted material facts in its communications with Staff, in violation of Listing Rule 5250(a)(1). Pursuant to Nasdaq listing Rule 5800 series the Company appealed the staff s determination to a Hearings Panel and requested an oral hearing to appeal the staff determination. In addition, the Company requested a stay of the suspension and delisting action pending the issuance of a written decision by the Hearings Panel. In the request, the company stated that the delinquent reports would be filed prior to the October 11th due date, informed Nasdaq that an independent investigation had been initiated by the company with an expected completion date of approximately October 11th, 2016, informed Nasdaq of its efforts to retrieve the missing minutes via a diligent search of its email archives and attempts to contact prior board members for their records, and its disagreement with the staff s belief that any misleading statement had been made. The company received from Nasdaq, on September 26th, 2016, a letter informing them that the requested hearing will take place on November 10th.

ITEM 2.  
  MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION.  
   
 This filing contains forward-looking statements, including statements regarding, among other things, our projected sales and profitability, our Company s growth strategies, our Company s future financing plans and our Company s anticipated needs for working capital. Actual events or results may differ materially from those discussed in forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including, without limitation, the matters described in this filing generally. In light of these risks and uncertainties, there can be no assurance that the forward-looking statements contained in this filing will in fact occur. Forward-looking statements, which involve assumptions and describe our future plans, strategies and expectations, are generally identifiable by use of the words  may,   will,   should,   expect,   anticipate,   estimate,   believe,   intend  or  project  or the negative of these words or other variations on these words or comparable terminology. 
   
 This discussion is intended to supplement and highlight information contained in, and should be read in conjunction with, our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes and the selected financial data presented elsewhere in this report. 
   
  Significant Accounting Policies  
   
 Our condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Note 2 to condensed consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements. Certain of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies, as defined below. 
   
 A critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both material to the presentation of our condensed consolidated financial statements and requires management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Specifically, critical accounting estimates have the following attributes: 1) we are required to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate; and 2) different estimates we could reasonably have used, or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur, would have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. 
   
 Estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates may change as new events occur, as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes. These changes have historically been minor and have been included in the condensed consolidated financial statements as soon as they became known. Based on a critical assessment of our accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies, management believes that our condensed consolidated financial statements are fairly stated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, and present a meaningful presentation of our financial condition and results of operations. We believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements: 
   
   Risks and Uncertainties     The Company s business could be impacted by price pressure on its product manufacturing, acceptance of its products in the market place, new competitors, changes in federal and/or state legislation and other factors. The Company also has been experiencing significant growth which puts serious strains on its cash availability requirements. If the Company is unsuccessful in securing adequate liquidity, its plans may be curtailed. Adverse changes in these areas could negatively impact the Company s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 

24 

Accounts Receivable     Accounts receivable are reported at their net realizable value. The Company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon factors pertaining to the credit risk of specific customers, historical trends, and other information. Delinquent accounts are written-off when it is determined that the amounts are uncollectible. 
   
   Inventory     Inventory is reported at the lower of cost or market on the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. Our inventory is subject to expiration and obsolescence. Accordingly, quantities purchased and sell through rates are periodically monitored for potential overstocking or pending expiration as a basis for establishing the appropriate reserve for any estimated expiration or obsolescence. 
   
   Revenue Recognition     The Company s revenue recognition policies are in compliance with ASC Topic 605,  Revenue Recognition , which establishes criteria that must be satisfied before revenue is realized or realizable and earned. The Company recognizes revenue when all of the following four criteria are met: 

persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists, 

delivery has occurred, 

the sales price is fixed or determinable and 

collectability is probable. 

Shipping and handling charges related to sales transactions are recorded as sales revenues when billed to customers or included in the sales price. Shipping and handling costs are included in cost of goods sold. 
   
   Research and Development     The Company incurs formulation costs that include salaries, materials and consultant fees. These costs are classified as product development, selling and general and administrative expenses in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. 
   
  Results of Operations  
   
  Three Months Ended March 31, 2015 as Compared to the Three Months Ended March 31, 2014  
   
   Revenues, net     Total net revenues increased $13,046 or 0.5%, from $2,684,964 for the three months ended March 31, 2014 to $2,698,010 for the three months ended March 31, 2015. Our product revenues represent primarily sales of Revita and Revita Cor, which individually exceeded 10% of total sales and collectively represented approximately 46% of total sales for the period. In addition, Spectral DNC-N represents approximately 10% of total sales for each period along with Spectral DNC-S V1 and Spectral DNC 5% which represents 6% each of net revenue.  
   
 Net revenue from our Mexican subsidiary increased 5.1%  in 2015-QTR compared to 2014-QTR, accounting for $664,183 (25%)  and $631,975 (23.5%) of consolidated net sales for the three months ended March 31, 2015 and 2014 respectively. The increase in net revenue from our Mexican subsidiary as a result of increased marketing efforts, continues to consistently contribute to the overall increase in net revenue. Sales generated from US operations have increased as well, as a result of no longer delaying sales due to backorders. The issue of backorders has improved dramatically. We continue our marketing and sales efforts to expand our customer base, with our primary focus on expanding our distributor base, both domestic and foreign. We conduct a significant portion of business with various distributors under exclusive distribution agreements. Revenues from our top ten customers accounted for approximately 70% and 45% of our total revenues during the three months ended March 31, 2015 and March 31, 2014, respectively. 
   
   Cost of Goods Sold     Total cost of goods sold decreased $177,332 or 12.7%, from $1,391,547 (2014-QTR) to $1,214,215 (2015-QTR). We continued additional cost cutting efforts during the quarter ending March 31, 2015 that included improved sales mix, reformulations, and improved manufacturing efficiencies.  
   
 Consequently, the gross margin has improved from 48.2% (2014-QTR) to 55.0% (2015-QTR), with US operations accounting for $931,516 or 72% (2014-QTR) and $1,099,581 or 74% (2015-QTR) of the gross margin dollars and with DS Mexico accounting for $361,901 or 28% (2014-QTR) and $384,214 or 26% (2015-QTR) of gross margin dollars, offset by the stronger dollar compared to the Mexican peso. 

25 

Selling and Marketing Costs     Selling and marketing costs decreased $179,744 or 18.5% from $970,022 (2014-QTR) to $790,278 (2015-QTR). The decrease was due to the following: 

Decreases of: 

$191,187 for consulting and commissions, as a result of decreased sales incentives and improved efficiencies in the sales force, and 

Partially offset by increases of: 

$22,261 for travel and entertainment costs, as a result of increased educational and training of support staff during the quarter, and 

$11,947 for Internet and Web Hosting costs, as a result of increased activity through the online store and technical support needed. 

General and Administrative Costs     General and administrative costs decreased $10,431 or 0.8%, from $1,340,614 (2014-QTR) to $1,330,183 (2015-QTR). The decrease is due to the following: 

Decreases of: 

$214,497 for professional fees primarily associated with a reduced need for consultants, specifically receiving common stock compensation, and 

$72,232 for personnel costs, as a result of reductions in redundancies and overall staff needs, and 

$23,302 for depreciation and amortization primarily associated with reduced amortization as a result of fully amortizing the Pure Guild brand and other intangibles associated with our Mexico operations during 2014, and    

$26,015 for licenses and permits as a result of a decreased filings of regulatory permits in the U.S. and abroad, specifically with our Mexico subsidiary.  

$23,364 for bank charges as a result of improved internal policies within A/P for wire and bank analysis costs, as well as overall fees for transactions. 

$58,866 for other general and administrative costs, as a result of improved overall efficiencies.  

Other Income and Expenses     Other income and expense increased $204,247 from $28,633 expense (2014-QTR) to $232,880 expense (2015-QTR). The increase is due to invoicing a one-time fee of $120,000 for terminating our existing agreement with a major consumer products company so that a new agreement could be structured, which the Company realized no revenue from the terminated agreement, partially offset by a charge for the impairment of an intangible brand rights agreement totaling $337,500.

Liquidity and Capital Resources  
   
 We had cash of $652,093 and working capital of $3,232,955 at March 31, 2015. Our operating and capital requirements in connection with supporting our expanding operations and introducing new products have been and will continue to be significant to us. Since inception, our losses from operations and working capital required to grow our business were satisfied primarily through the private sales of our common stock and by credit financing. 
   
 Despite our losses since inception, we believe that by increasing our sales and gross profit margins while maintaining and better optimizing our current operational structure and administrative expenses, we can minimize the cash needed to support our operations. Our largest consumption of cash is the working capital necessary to support expanding sales. The sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities will result in dilution to our stockholders. The incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed obligations and may also result in covenants that would restrict our operations. These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 
   
 We have commenced implementing, and will continue to implement, various measures to address our financial condition, including methods to increase gross profit margins and reducing and streamlining our operational costs and overhead. We have historically satisfied our working capital requirements through the sale of common stock, advances from related parties and third parties and through our credit facility. We are continuing to seek debt and equity financing; however, there can be no assurances that the Company will be able to raise additional capital on favorable terms, or at all. 
   
  Cash Flows for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2015  
   
   Cash Flows from Operating Activities   
   
 Operating activities used net cash for the three months ended March 31, 2015 of $901,136. In addition, changes in operating assets and liabilities used cash of $486,865 as follows: 

$139,088 provided by a decrease in gross accounts receivable not including the non-cash effect of changes in the allowance for doubtful accounts, 

$83,561 used by an increase in inventory component levels resulting from implementing a purchasing strategy to continue eliminating backorders and improve customer satisfaction, 

$233,781 used by a decrease in accounts payable resulting from efforts to reduce outstanding vendor balances and restore normalized vendor relations, 

$42,129 used by a decrease in accrued expenses as a result of a decrease in certain accrued expenses, and 

$260,482 provided by net changes in other current assets and liabilities primarily as a result of increased liabilities associated with the expansion of our Mexican operations. 

Cash Flows used in Investing Activities   
   
 Our investing activities used $13,724 in net cash during the three months ended March 31, 2015. Net cash used is primarily the result of injection mold purchases for production in the US and sales operations in Mexico. 
   
   Cash Flows from Financing Activities   
   
 Our financing activities contributed $217,035 in net cash during the three months ended March 31, 2015, primarily as a result of the $220,000 contributed for purchase of subscriptions, and use of $2,965 in repayment of loans and notes. 

27 

Financial Position  
   
   Total Assets     Our total assets decreased $874,599 or 10.6% from $8,281,328 as of December 31, 2014 to $7,406,730 as of March 31, 2015, primarily as a result of the cash used to repay creditors and increase inventory components. The decrease in total assets was also the result of a decrease of $350,362 in intangible assets, an impairment charge of $337,500 on the brand rights agreement for Brazil offset by amortization, as well as a decrease in equipment, net of depreciation, of $18,699 which was partially offset by an increase of $12,250 in other assets.  Current assets decreased by $517,787 the components of which are discussed further below.  
   
   Current Assets     The net decrease in current assets of $517,787 was primarily associated with a decrease in cash of $476,463, primarily to support operations. These decreases were partially offset by a $82,474 decrease in inventory levels and a $122,967 increase in accounts receivable. These net changes are primarily driven by changes in sales and other factors more specifically discussed below: 
   
   Inventory     Inventory levels increased 2.1% from December 31, 2014 to March 31, 2015, as a result of continued efforts to replenish inventory in key raw material components in anticipation of higher sales in the latter half of 2015. Inventory levels increased as a result of increased number of SKU s in our portfolio of products. Backlog and back orders have effectively been reduced to zero and perceived sales in the later part of 2015 should use the inventory on hand. 
   
 Average inventory represents approximately 89.2% of COGS or over an elevenmonth supply based on the sell through rate achieved for the three months ended March 31, 2015, resulting in an inventory turnover rate of 1.37 times. This inventory turn rate should improve as we ramp up sales volume that can now be met with smoother production timing.  
   
   Accounts Receivable, net     Accounts receivable decreased $122,967, primarily as a result of an improvement in collections during Q1 2015. The receivables are in line with historical averages for previous quarters and these levels of sales.  
   
   Prepaid Expenses and other current assets     Prepaid expenses marginally increased and was flat when compared to 2014-QTR.

  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.

ITEM 4.  
  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES   
   
 Disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d 15(e) under the Exchange Act) are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the forms and rules of the SEC and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the CEO and CFO, in a manner to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. 
   
 In connection with the preparation of this Form 10 Q, our management, including the CEO and CFO, updated its December 31, 2014 evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of March, 2015. As described below, management has identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, which is an integral component of our disclosure controls and procedures. As a result of those material weaknesses, our management has concluded that, as of March 31, 2015, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective, as a result of certain material weaknesses.  
   
  The specific material weaknesses that management identified in our internal controls as of March 31, 2015 that persist are as follows:    

We did not have adequate staffing resources to provide appropriate review and supervision for all necessary areas and our general staff do not have the necessary training to perform appropriate analytical or review procedures. 

We did not have a sufficient number of adequately trained technical accounting and external reporting personnel to support standalone external financial reporting under SEC requirements. 

We did not have personnel with sufficient experience with United States generally accepted accounting principles to address complex transactions. 

We did not obtain adequate documentation to support all credit card transactions. 

Plans for Remediation of Material Weaknesses  
   
 We have begun implementing changes to strengthen our internal controls and will continue to implement remediation plans for the identified material weaknesses and expect the work on the plan will continue throughout 2015, as financial resources permit. The Company plans to hire a full-time Chief Financial Officer. The Company continues to formalizing its policies and procedures in writing and to improve the integration of its financial consolidation and reporting system into non- accounting departments. Where appropriate, the Company is receiving advice and assistance from third-party experts as it implements and refines its remediation plan. 
   
 Additional measures may be necessary, and the measures we expect to take to improve our internal controls may not be sufficient to address the issues identified, to ensure that our internal controls are effective or to ensure that such material weakness or other material weaknesses would not result in a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements. In addition, other material weaknesses or significant deficiencies may be identified in the future. If we are unable to correct deficiencies in internal controls in a timely manner, our ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information accurately and within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC will be adversely affected. This failure could negatively affect the market price and trading liquidity of our common stock, cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, subject us to civil and criminal investigations and penalties, and generally materially and adversely impact our business and financial condition. 
   
  Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting  
   
 Except as otherwise stated above, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting or in other factors during the quarter ended March 31, 2015, that have materially affected, or were reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
