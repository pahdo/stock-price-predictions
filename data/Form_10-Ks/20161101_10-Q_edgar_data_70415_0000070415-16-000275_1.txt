    Basis of Presentation 
       
  GP Strategies Corporation is a global performance improvement solutions provider of training, e-Learning solutions, management consulting and engineering services. References in this report to  GP Strategies,  the  Company,   we  and  our  are to GP Strategies Corporation and its subsidiaries, collectively. 
    
  The accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of   September 30, 2016   and the condensed consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income and cash flows for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   have not been audited, but have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , as presented in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015  . In the opinion of management, this interim information includes all material adjustments, which are of a normal and recurring nature, necessary for a fair presentation. The results for the   2016   interim period are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the entire year.  
    
  The condensed consolidated financial statements include the operations of the Company and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.

     Accounting Standards Issued 
       
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers  , which provides a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers and will supersede most current revenue recognition guidance. The ASU s core principle is that a company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 is effective for public companies for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017, which requires us to adopt the standard in the first quarter of 2018. Companies can elect to apply the provisions of ASU 2014-09 either retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively with a cumulative effect adjustment recognized at the date of adoption. We are currently evaluating the method and impact the adoption of ASU 2014-09 will have on our consolidated financial statements. 
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02,   Leases  . This standard will require all leases with durations greater than twelve months to be recognized on the balance sheet as a right-of-use asset and a lease liability. ASU 2016-02 is effective for public companies for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years. We believe adoption of this standard will have a significant impact on our consolidated balance sheets. Although we have not completed our assessment, we do not expect the adoption of ASU 2016-02 to materially change the recognition and measurement of lease expense within the consolidated statements of operations.  
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,   Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718)  .  The standard is intended to simplify several areas of accounting for share-based compensation arrangements. Under ASU 2016-09, companies will no longer record excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies to additional paid-in capital (APIC) on the settlement of awards. Instead, they will record all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement and APIC pools will be eliminated. ASU 2016-09 also requires companies to make an accounting policy election on whether to account for forfeitures on share-based payments by 1) recognizing forfeitures as they occur; or 2) estimating the number of awards expected to be forfeited and periodically adjusting the estimate, as is currently required. ASU 2016-09 also clarifies the statement of cash flows presentation for certain components of share-based awards. The standard is effective for annual and interim reporting periods of public companies beginning after December 15, 2016, although early adoption is permitted. We plan to adopt ASU 2016-09 on January 1, 2017. Although we are currently still evaluating the impact of this ASU on our consolidated financial statements, we don't believe the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. However, it could result in volatility in income tax expense from quarter to quarter as a result of the change in accounting for excess tax benefits on the settlement of awards.

    Significant Customers   Concentration of Credit Risk 
       
  We have a market concentration of revenue in both the automotive sector and financial services   insurance sector. Revenue from the automotive industry accounted for approximately   22%   and   18%   of our consolidated revenue for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. In addition, we have a concentration of revenue from a single automotive customer, which accounted for approximately   13%   and   12%   of our consolidated revenue for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  
    
  Revenue from the financial services   insurance industry accounted for approximately   21%   of our consolidated revenue for both the   nine  -month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . In addition, we have a concentration of revenue from a single financial services customer, which accounted for approximately   15%   and   14%   of our consolidated revenue for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. As of   September 30, 2016  , billed and unbilled accounts receivable from a single financial services customer totaled $  26.5 million  , or   19%  , of our consolidated accounts receivable and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts balances.  
    
  No other single customer accounted for more than   10%   of our consolidated revenue for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   or   2015   or consolidated accounts receivable balance as of   September 30, 2016  .

    Earnings Per Share 
       
  Basic earnings per share (EPS) is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution of common stock equivalent shares that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock. 
    
  Our dilutive common stock equivalent shares consist of stock options and restricted stock units computed under the treasury stock method, using the average market price during the period. The following table presents instruments which were not dilutive and were excluded from the computation of diluted EPS in each period, as well as the dilutive common stock equivalent shares which were included in the computation of diluted EPS:

    Acquisitions 
       
  Jencal Training 
  On March 1, 2016, we acquired the share capital of Jencal Training Limited (Jencal Training) and its subsidiary B2B Engage Limited (B2B), an independent provider of vocational skills training in the United Kingdom. The upfront purchase price was    $2.5 million   in cash. In addition, the purchase agreement requires up to an additional   $0.4 million   of  consideration, contingent upon attaining incremental funding levels under a customer contract prior to July 31, 2016, which is expected to be calculated and paid in the fourth quarter of 2016. The preliminary purchase price allocation for the acquisition primarily includes   $1.4 million   of customer-related intangible assets which are being amortized over   four   years from the acquisition date and   $1.8 million   of goodwill. None of the goodwill recorded for financial statement purposes is deductible for tax purposes. The acquired Jencal Training business is included in the Learning Solutions segment and the results of its operations have been included in the consolidated financial statements beginning March 1, 2016. The pro-forma impact of the acquisition is not material to our results of operations. 
    
  Maverick Solutions 
  Effective October 1, 2016, we acquired the business and certain assets of Maverick Solutions, a U.S.-based provider of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) product training services. The upfront purchase price was   $5.0 million   in cash. In addition, the purchase agreement requires up to an additional   $10.0 million   of consideration, contingent upon the achievement of certain earnings targets during the two twelve-month periods following completion of the acquisition. The acquired Maverick Solutions business will be included in the Performance Readiness Solutions segment effective October 1, 2016. 
    
  Contingent Consideration 
  Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Topic 805 requires that contingent consideration be recognized at fair value on the acquisition date and be re-measured each reporting period with subsequent adjustments recognized in the consolidated statement of operations. We estimate the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities based on financial projections of the acquired companies and estimated probabilities of achievement and discount the liabilities to present value using a weighted-average cost of capital. Contingent consideration is valued using significant inputs that are not observable in the market which are defined as Level 3 inputs pursuant to fair value measurement accounting. We believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable; however, there is significant judgment involved. At each reporting date, the contingent consideration obligation is revalued to estimated fair value, and changes in fair value subsequent to the acquisitions are reflected in income or expense in the consolidated statements of operations, and could cause a material impact to, and volatility in, our operating results. Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration obligations may result from changes in discount periods, changes in the timing and amount of revenue and/or earnings estimates and changes in probability assumptions with respect to the likelihood of achieving the various earn-out criteria. 
    
  Below is a summary of the changes in the recorded amount of contingent consideration liabilities from   December 31, 2015   to   September 30, 2016   (dollars in thousands): 

As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , contingent consideration is considered a current liability and is included in accounts payable of   $0.2 million   and   $2.4 million  , respectively.

    Stock-Based Compensation 
       
  We recognize compensation expense for stock-based compensation awards issued to employees that are expected to vest. Compensation cost is based on the fair value of awards as of the grant date.  
    
  The following table summarizes the pre-tax stock-based compensation expense included in reported net income (in thousands):  

Pursuant to our 2011 Stock Incentive Plan (the  2011 Plan ), we may grant awards of non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, restricted stock, stock units, performance shares, performance units and other incentives payable in cash or in shares of our common stock to officers, employees or members of the Board of Directors. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had non-qualified stock options and restricted stock units outstanding under these plans as discussed below. 
    
  Non-Qualified Stock Options 
    
  Summarized information for the Company s non-qualified stock options is as follows:

Restricted Stock Units 
    
  In addition to stock options, we issue restricted stock units to key employees and members of the Board of Directors based on meeting certain service goals. The stock units vest to the recipients at various dates, up to   five years  , based on fulfilling service requirements. We recognize the value of the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant as compensation expense over the requisite service period. Upon vesting, the stock units are settled in shares of our common stock. Summarized share information for our restricted stock units is as follows: 

On March 29, 2016, the Compensation Committee granted   71,918   performance-based restricted stock units ("PSU's") to certain officers of the Company. Vesting of the PSU's is contingent upon the employee's continued employment and the Company's achievement of certain performance goals during a three-year performance period. The performance goals are established by the Compensation Committee and for the 2016-2018 performance period are based on financial targets, including an average annual return on invested capital ( ROIC ) and average annual growth in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (adjusted to exclude the effect of acquisitions, dispositions, and certain other nonrecurring or extraordinary items) ( Adjusted EBITDA ).  We recognize compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, for PSU's on a straight-line basis over the performance period based on the probable outcome of achievement of the financial targets. At the end of each reporting period, we estimate the number of PSU's expected to vest, based on the probability and extent to which the performance goals will be met, and take into account these estimates when calculating the expense for the period. If the number of shares expected to be earned changes during the performance period, we will make a cumulative adjustment to compensation expense based on the revised number of shares expected to be earned. 
    
  Also on March 29, 2016 in conjunction with the grant of PSU's, the Compensation Committee granted a total of   40,679   time-based restricted stock units to the same officers of the Company. Vesting of the time-based restricted stock units is subject to the employee's continued employment through December 31, 2018.

  September 30, 2016 
  (Unaudited) 

On September 2, 2014, we entered into a Fourth Amended and Restated Financing and Security Agreement (the  Credit Agreement ). The Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility up to a maximum principal amount of   $65 million   expiring on October 31, 2018 and for a term loan in the principal amount of   $40 million   maturing on   October 31, 2017  , and is secured by substantially all of our assets.  
  The maximum interest rate on the Credit Agreement is the daily one-month   LIBOR market index rate plus 2.50%  . Based on our financial performance, the interest rate can be reduced to a minimum rate of the daily one-month   LIBOR market index rate plus 1.25%  , with the rate being determined based on our maximum leverage ratio for the preceding four quarters. Each unpaid advance on the revolving loan will bear interest until repaid. The term loan is payable in monthly installments equal to   $1.1 million   plus applicable interest, beginning on November 1, 2014 and ending on October 31, 2017. We may prepay the term loan or the revolving loan, in whole or in part, at any time without premium or penalty, subject to certain conditions. Amounts repaid or prepaid on the term loan may not be reborrowed. 
  The Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants that limit or restrict our and our subsidiaries  (subject to certain exceptions) ability to, among other things, grant liens, make investments, incur indebtedness, merge or consolidate, dispose of assets or make acquisitions. We are also required to maintain compliance with a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a maximum leverage ratio. We were in compliance with all of the financial covenants under the Credit Agreement as of   September 30, 2016  .  As of   September 30, 2016  , our total long-term debt outstanding under the term loan was   $14.4 million  .  In addition, there were   $44.8 million   of borrowings outstanding and   $14.7 million   of available borrowings under the Credit Agreement. For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the weighted average interest rate on our borrowings was   2.2%  .  

(9) 
    Income Taxes 
       
  Income tax expense was   $8.1 million  , or an effective income tax rate of   37.4%  , for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $7.5 million  , or an effective income tax rate of   37.5%  , for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . Income tax expense for the quarterly periods is based on an estimated annual effective tax rate which includes the U.S. federal, state and local, and non-U.S. statutory rates, permanent differences, and other items that may have an impact on income tax expense. 
    
  An uncertain tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return is recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not (i.e., a likelihood of more than fifty percent) that the position would be sustained upon examination by tax authorities that have full knowledge of all relevant information. A recognized tax position is then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Interest and penalties related to income taxes are accounted for as income tax expense. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had no uncertain tax positions reflected on our consolidated balance sheet. The Company files income tax returns in U.S. federal, state and local jurisdictions, and various non-U.S. jurisdictions, and is subject to audit by tax authorities in those jurisdictions. Tax years 2013 through 2015 remain open to examination by these tax jurisdictions, and earlier years remain open to examination in certain of these jurisdictions which have longer statutes of limitations.

  Changes in stockholders  equity during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were as follows (in thousands): 

Stock Repurchase Program 
    
  We have a share repurchase program under which we may repurchase shares of our common stock from time to time in the open market, subject to prevailing business and market conditions and other factors. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we repurchased approximately   340,000   and   255,000   shares, respectively, of our common stock in the open market for a total cost of approximately   $8.0 million   and   $6.6 million  , respectively. As of   September 30, 2016  , there was approximately   $6.1 million   available for future repurchases under the buyback program.  

As of   September 30, 2016  , we operated through   four   reportable business segments: (i) Learning Solutions, (ii) Professional   Technical Services, (iii) Sandy Training   Marketing, and (iv) Performance Readiness Solutions. Each of our reportable segments represents an operating segment under U.S. GAAP. We are organized by operating groups primarily based upon the markets served by each group and/or the services performed. Each operating group consists of business units which are focused on providing specific products and services to certain classes of customers or within targeted markets. Marketing and communications, accounting, finance, legal, human resources, information systems and other administrative services are organized at the corporate level.

Acquisitions 
    
  Jencal Training 
  On March 1, 2016, we acquired the share capital of Jencal Training Limited (Jencal Training) and its subsidiary B2B Engage Limited (B2B), an independent provider of vocational skills training in the United Kingdom. The upfront purchase price was  $2.5 million in cash. In addition, the purchase agreement requires up to an additional $0.4 million of consideration, contingent upon attaining incremental funding levels under a customer contract prior to July 31, 2016, which is expected to be calculated and paid in the fourth quarter of 2016. The preliminary purchase price allocation for the acquisition primarily includes $1.4 million of customer-related intangible assets which are being amortized over four years from the acquisition date and $1.8 million of goodwill. None of the goodwill recorded for financial statement purposes is deductible for tax purposes. The acquired Jencal Training business is included in the Learning Solutions segment and the results of its operations have been included in the consolidated financial statements beginning March 1, 2016. The pro-forma impact of the acquisition is not material to our results of operations. 
    
  Maverick Solutions 
  Effective October 1, 2016, we acquired the business and certain assets of Maverick Solutions, a U.S.-based provider of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) product training services. The upfront purchase price was $5.0 million in cash. In addition, the purchase agreement requires up to an additional $10.0 million of consideration, contingent upon the achievement of certain earnings targets during the two twelve-month periods following completion of the acquisition. The acquired Maverick Solutions business will be included in the Performance Readiness Solutions segment effective October 1, 2016. 
    
  Operating Highlights 
    
  Three Months ended   September 30, 2016   Compared to the Three Months ended   September 30, 2015 
    
  Our revenue decreased   $1.0 million   or   0.8%   during the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to the   third   quarter of   2015  . The net decrease is due to a   $5.2 million   decline in our Professional   Technical Services segment and a   $0.5 million   revenue decrease in our Learning Solutions segment, offset by a   $4.5 million   revenue increase in our Sandy Training   Marketing segment and a   $0.3 million   increase in our Performance Readiness Solutions segment.  Foreign currency exchange rate declines resulted in a total $4.4 million decrease in U.S. dollar reported revenue during the third quarter of 2016 across all segments. The changes in revenue and gross profit are discussed in further detail below by segment. 
    
  Operating income, the components of which are discussed below, increased $  1.1 million   or   16.6%   to   $8.0 million   for the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to   $6.9 million   for the   third   quarter of   2015  . The net increase in operating income is primarily due to restructuring charges of $1.2 million incurred in the third quarter of 2015 that did not recur in 2016.  
    
  For the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , we had income before income tax expense of   $7.6 million   compared to   $5.9 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . Net income was   $4.8 million  , or   $0.29   per diluted share, for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to net income of   $3.7 million  , or   $0.22   per diluted share, for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . Diluted weighted average shares outstanding were   16.7 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   17.3 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  . The decrease in shares outstanding is primarily due to the repurchase of shares of our outstanding common stock in the open market during 2015 and 2016. 

16 

Revenue 

Learning Solutions revenue   decreased     $0.5 million   or   1.0%   during the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to the   third   quarter of   2015  . The revenue decrease is due to the following: 
             
    A $3.2 million decrease in revenue due to unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates; partially offset by 
                
    A $1.4 million net increase in e-Learning content development and training business process outsourcing (BPO) services; and 
                
    A $1.3 million revenue increase attributable to the Jencal Training acquisition completed on March 1, 2016.  
     Professional   Technical Services revenue   decreased     $5.2 million   or   17.3%   during the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to the   third   quarter of   2015  . The net decrease in revenue is due to the following: 
             
    A $2.0 million decrease in training and technical services for oil and gas clients; 
                
    A $1.5 million net decrease in engineering and technical services; 
                
    A $0.4 million net decrease in training and professional services for energy clients; 
                
    A $0.4 million net decrease in alternative fuels design and build projects; and 
                
    A $0.9 million decrease in revenue due to unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates. 
     Sandy Training   Marketing revenue   increased     $4.5 million   or   20.3%   during the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to the   third   quarter of   2015  . The net increase is primarily due to a $5.6 million increase in training services for an automotive client related to a new luxury vehicle launch and a $2.7 million net increase in training services for in-dealership and other training programs for automotive customers. These increases were offset by a $3.8 million decline in magazine publications revenue due to a partial shipment of a publication during the third quarter with the remainder to be shipped in the fourth quarter of 2016, whereas the similar publication for 2015 was fully delivered in the third quarter of 2015. 
    
  Performance Readiness Solutions revenue   increased     $0.3 million   or   1.6%   during the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to the   third   quarter of   2015  . The net increase is primarily due to a $0.8 million increase in technical training services largely due to a new contract with an aerospace client and a $0.3 million increase in platform adoption training services, offset by a $0.5 million decline in leadership development training and a $0.3 million million decrease due to unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates. 
    
  Gross Profit 

17 

Learning Solutions gross profit was   $9.8 million   or   19.1%   of revenue for the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to gross profit of   $9.8 million   or   18.9%   of revenue for the   third   quarter of   2015  .  While gross profit was flat quarter over quarter, there was a $0.4 million increase in gross profit attributable to the Jencal acquisition completed in March 2016, offset by a $0.6 million decrease in gross profit due to unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates. 
    
  Professional   Technical Services gross profit of   $3.6 million   or   14.3%   of revenue for the   third   quarter of   2016     decreased   by   $1.9 million   or   34.9%   when compared to gross profit of   $5.5 million   or   18.2%   of revenue for the   third   quarter of   2015  . The decrease in gross profit is primarily due to the overall revenue decrease and a decline in higher margin revenue streams in this segment, largely due to a decline in training and technical services for oil and gas clients and a decline in engineering and technical services.  
    
  Sandy Training   Marketing gross profit of   $3.6 million   or   13.6%   of revenue for the   third   quarter of   2016     increased   by   $1.1 million   or   46.5%   when compared to gross profit of   $2.5 million   or   11.2%   of revenue for the   third   quarter of   2015   due to the revenue increases noted above. Gross margin increased due to an increase in higher margin revenue streams during the third quarter of 2016 compared to the third quarter of 2015. 
    
  Performance Readiness Solutions gross profit of   $3.0 million   or   15.9%   of revenue for the   third   quarter of   2016     increased   by   $0.4 million   or   16.7%   when compared to gross profit of   $2.6 million   or   13.8%   of revenue for the   third   quarter of   2015  . The increase in gross profit is primarily due to a decrease in overhead costs due to cost cutting measures.   
    
  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
    
  Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased   $0.3 million   or   2.1%   from   $12.3 million   for the   third   quarter of   2015   to   $12.0 million   for the   third   quarter of   2016  .  The decrease in SG A expenses is due to a $0.3 million decrease in bad debt expense and a $0.2 million decrease in amortization expense due to certain intangible assets related to previously completed acquisitions becoming fully amortized. These decreases were offset by a $0.2 million increase in labor and benefits expense. 
    
  Restructuring Charges 
    
  During the third quarter of 2015, we incurred restructuring charges of $1.2 million, primarily consisting of severance expense related to a cost savings initiative to better align costs with revenues and improve our operating margins.  
    
  Change in Fair Value of Contingent Consideration 
    
  We recognized losses on the change in fair value of contingent consideration related to acquisitions of less than   $0.1 million   in both the third quarters of   2016   and   2015  . Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration obligations result from changes in discount periods, changes in the timing and amount of revenue and/or earnings estimates and changes in probability assumptions with respect to the likelihood of achieving the various earn-out criteria. See Note 5 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further details regarding the potential contingent consideration payments and the changes in fair value of the related liabilities during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Interest Expense 
    
  Interest expense was   $0.4 million   for the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to   $0.3 million   for the   third   quarter of   2015   and consisted primarily of interest on our short-term borrowings and term loan under the Credit Agreement which is disclosed in more detail in Note 8 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.  
    
  Other Expense 
    
  Other expense was less than $0.1 million for the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to other expense of   $0.6 million   for the   third   quarter of    2015  , and consists primarily of income from a joint venture offset by foreign currency losses in both periods. During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , we had a $0.7 million net decrease in foreign currency losses and a $0.1 million decrease in income from a joint venture compared to the corresponding period in   2015  . Foreign currency gains and losses primarily relate to the effect of exchange rates on intercompany receivables and payables and third party receivables and payables that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our legal entities.  

18 

Income Tax Expense 
    
  Income tax expense was   $2.8 million   for the   third   quarter of   2016   compared to   $2.2 million   for the   third   quarter of   2015  . The effective income tax rate was   36.9%   and   37.2%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Income tax expense for the quarterly periods is based on an estimated annual effective tax rate which includes the U.S. federal, state and local, and non-U.S. statutory rates, permanent differences, and other items that may have an impact on income tax expense. 
    
  Nine   Months ended   September 30, 2016   Compared to the   Nine   Months ended   September 30, 2015    
    
  Our revenue decreased   $0.6 million   or   0.2%   and our gross profit decreased   $1.3 million   or   2.2%   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The net decrease in revenue is due to a   $13.4 million   decline in our Professional   Technical Services segment, a   $0.5 million   decline in our Learning Solutions segment and a   $0.5 million   decline in our Performance Readiness Solutions segment, partially offset by a   $13.8 million   revenue increase in our Sandy Training   Marketing segment. Foreign currency exchange rate declines resulted in a total $8.5 million decrease in U.S. dollar reported revenue during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   across all segments. The changes in revenue and gross profit are discussed in further detail below by segment.  
    
  Operating income, the components of which are discussed in detail below, decreased   $0.3 million   or   1.2%   to   $22.0 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $22.2 million   for the same period in 2015. The net decrease in operating income was primarily due to a   $1.3 million   decrease in gross profit and a   $0.4 million   increase in SG A expenses, offset by a $1.2 million decline in non-recurring restructuring charges. 
    
  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we had income before income tax expense of   $21.6 million   compared to   $20.1 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . Net income was   $13.5 million  , or   $0.80   per diluted share, for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to net income of   $12.5 million  , or   $0.72   per diluted share, for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . Diluted weighted average shares outstanding were   16.8 million   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   17.3 million   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2015  . The decrease in shares outstanding is primarily due to the repurchase of shares of our outstanding common stock in the open market during 2015 and 2016. 
    
  Revenue 

Learning Solutions revenue   decreased     $0.5 million   or   0.3%   during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  . The revenue decrease is due to the following: 
             
    A $6.3 million decrease in revenue due to unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates; partially offset by 
                
    A $3.3 million revenue increase attributable to the Jencal Training acquisition completed on March 1, 2016; and  
                
    A $2.5 million net increase in e-Learning content development and training business process outsourcing (BPO) services. 
       
  Professional   Technical Services revenue   decreased     $13.4 million   or   14.8%   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  . The net decrease in revenue is due to the following: 
             
    A $6.1 million decrease in training and technical services for oil and gas clients; 
                
    A $2.1 million net decrease in training and professional services for energy clients; 
                
    A $2.5 million net decrease in engineering and technical training services; 
                
    A $1.7 million decrease in revenue due to unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates; and 
                
    A $1.0 million decrease due to the completion of projects in our alternative fuels business. 
     
   19 

Sandy Training   Marketing revenue   increased     $13.8 million   or   22.2%   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  . The net increase is primarily due to the following: 
             
    A $5.6 million increase in training services for an automotive client related to a new luxury vehicle launch; 
                
    A $6.8 million increase in training services for in-dealership and other training programs for automotive customers; 
                
    A $0.8 million increase in magazine publications revenue due to an increase in the volume of publications delivered; and 
                
    A $0.6 million increase in glovebox portfolio revenue. 
     Performance Readiness Solutions revenue   decreased     $0.5 million   or   0.9%   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  . The net decrease is primarily due to a $1.3 million decline in platform adoption training services, a $0.5 million decrease due to unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and a $0.4 million net decline primarily in performance consulting services, partially offset by a $1.7 million increase in technical training services largely due to a new contract with an aerospace client. 
    
  Gross Profit 

Learning Solutions gross profit of   $29.1 million   or   18.9%   of revenue for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016     increased   by   $2.5 million   or   9.5%   when compared to gross profit of   $26.5 million   or   17.2%   of revenue for the same period in   2015  . The increase in gross profit is primarily due to cost reduction initiatives and a one-time cost reduction related to a UK government funded skills training contract during the first quarter of 2016. In addition, there was a $0.8 million increase in gross profit attributable to the Jencal acquisition completed in March 2016, offset by a $1.3 million decrease in gross profit due to unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates. 
    
  Professional   Technical Services gross profit of   $11.6 million   or   15.1%   of revenue for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016     decreased   by   $6.2 million   or   34.8%   when compared to gross profit of   $17.8 million   or   19.7%   of revenue for the same period in   2015  . The decrease in gross profit is primarily due to the overall revenue decrease and a decline in higher margin revenue streams in this segment and a loss in our alternative fuels business during the first nine months of 2016.  
    
  Sandy Training and Marketing gross profit of   $9.9 million   or   13.1%   of revenue for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016     increased   by   $2.0 million   or   25.7%   when compared to gross profit of   $7.9 million   or   12.7%   of revenue for the same period in   2015   due to the revenue increases noted above.  
    
  Performance Readiness Solutions gross profit of   $7.7 million   or   13.7%   of revenue for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016     increased   by   $0.3 million   or   4.3%   when compared to gross profit of   $7.4 million   or   13.0%   of revenue for the same period in   2015  . Despite the net decline in revenue, gross profit increased primarily due to a decrease in overhead costs due to cost cutting measures.   
    
  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 
    
  Selling, general and administrative expenses   increased     $0.4 million   or   1.1%   from   $35.9 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   to   $36.2 million   for the same period in   2016  . The increase in SG A expenses is due to a $0.8 million increase in labor and benefits expense and a $0.6 million net increase in various other expenses, partially offset by a $0.6 million decrease in amortization expense due to certain intangible assets related to previously completed acquisitions becoming fully amortized and a $0.4 million decrease in bad debt expense.

  During the third quarter of 2015, we incurred restructuring charges of $1.2 million, primarily consisting of severance expense related to a cost savings initiative to better align costs with revenues and improve our operating margins.  
    
  Change in Fair Value of Contingent Consideration 
    
  We recognized net losses on the change in fair value of contingent consideration related to acquisitions of   $0.1 million   and   $0.3 million   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration obligations result from changes in discount periods, changes in the timing and amount of revenue and/or earnings estimates and changes in probability assumptions with respect to the likelihood of achieving the various earn-out criteria. See Note 5 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further details regarding the potential contingent consideration payments and the changes in fair value of the related liabilities during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Interest Expense 
    
  Interest expense was consistent at   $1.0 million   for both the nine-month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   and consisted primarily of interest on our short-term borrowings and term loan under the Credit Agreement which is disclosed in more detail in Note 8 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. 
    
  Other Income (Expense) 
    
  Other income was   $0.6 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to other expense of   $1.1 million   for the same period in   2015   and consisted primarily of income from a joint venture and foreign currency gains and losses. During the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , we had $0.3 million of net foreign currency gains compared to $1.7 million of net foreign currency losses during the same period in 2015. This improvement was partially offset by a $0.2 million decrease in income from a joint venture during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the corresponding period in   2015  . Foreign currency gains and losses primarily relate to the effect of exchange rates on intercompany receivables and payables and third party receivables and payables that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our legal entities.  
    
   Income Tax Expense 
    
  Income tax expense was   $8.1 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $7.5 million   for the same period in   2015  . The effective income tax rate was   37.4%   and   37.5%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Income tax expense for the quarterly periods is based on an estimated annual effective tax rate which includes the U.S. federal, state and local, and non-U.S. statutory rates, permanent differences, and other items that may have an impact on income tax expense.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  Working Capital 
    
  Our working capital was   $33.8 million   at   September 30, 2016   compared to   $40.3 million   at   December 31, 2015  . As of   September 30, 2016   we had   $44.8 million   of short-term borrowings and   $14.4 million   of long-term debt outstanding. We believe that cash generated from operations and borrowings available under our Credit Agreement (  $14.7 million   of available borrowings as of   September 30, 2016  ) will be sufficient to fund our working capital and other requirements for at least the next twelve months.  
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the amount of cash and cash equivalents held outside of the U.S. by foreign subsidiaries was $15.6 million. At the present time, we do not anticipate repatriating these balances to fund domestic operations. We would be required to accrue for and pay taxes in the U.S. in the event we repatriated these funds. 
    
  Stock Repurchase Program 
    
  We have a share repurchase program under which we may repurchase shares of our common stock from time to time in the open market, subject to prevailing business and market conditions and other factors. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we repurchased approximately   340,000   and   255,000   shares, respectively, of our common stock in the open market for a total cost of approximately   $8.0 million   and   $6.6 million  , respectively. As of   September 30, 2016  , there was approximately   $6.1 million   available for future repurchases under the buyback program.  
    
  Acquisition-Related Payments 
    
  We paid   $2.6 million   in contingent consideration in June 2016 for the 2014 acquisition of Effective Companies. In addition, we may be required to pay up to an additional   $0.4 million   of contingent consideration in the fourth quarter of 2016 for the Jencal Training acquisition and up to an additional maximum   $10.0 million   of contingent consideration for the Maverick acquisition if certain earnings targets are achieved during the two twelve-month periods following completion of the acquisition which is effective October 1, 2016. 
    
  Significant Customers   Concentration of Credit Risk 
    
  We have a market concentration of revenue in both the automotive sector and financial services   insurance sector. Revenue from the automotive industry accounted for approximately   22%   and   18%   of our consolidated revenue for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. In addition, we have a concentration of revenue from a single automotive customer, which accounted for approximately   13%   and   12%   of our consolidated revenue for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.   
    
  Revenue from the financial services   insurance industry accounted for approximately   21%   of our consolidated revenue for both the   nine  -month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . In addition, we have a concentration of revenue from a single financial services customer, which accounted for approximately   15%   and   14%   of our consolidated revenue for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  As of   September 30, 2016  , billed and unbilled accounts receivable from a single financial services customer totaled $  26.5 million  , or   19%  , of our consolidated accounts receivable and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts balances. No other single customer accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenue for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   or   2015   or consolidated accounts receivable balance as of   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Cash Flows 
    
  Nine   Months ended   September 30, 2016   Compared to the   Nine   Months ended   September 30, 2015    
    
  Our cash and cash equivalents balance   decreased     $5.3 million   from   $21.0 million   as of   December 31, 2015   to   $15.7 million   as of   September 30, 2016  . The decrease in cash and cash equivalents during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   resulted from cash provided by operating activities of   $11.9 million  , cash used in investing activities of   $5.4 million  , cash used in financing activities of   $11.2 million   and a negative effect of exchange rates changes on cash of   $0.7 million  . 
    
  Cash provided by operating activities was   $11.9 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $9.5 million   for the same period in   2015  . The increase in cash is primarily due to a net favorable change in working capital balances during  
  
   22 

the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015   largely due to a decrease in costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts. 
    
  Cash used in investing activities was   $5.4 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $1.7 million   for the same period in   2015  . The increase in cash used is due to $2.2 million of cash, net of cash acquired, used to complete the Jencal Training acquisition in March 2016, $1.6 million of cash used for an investment in a new joint venture during the second quarter of 2016, and $0.5 million of software development costs. These cash uses were offset by a $0.6 million decline in fixed asset additions during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  . 
    
  Cash used in financing activities was   $11.2 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   $8.7 million   for the same period in   2015  . The increase in cash used in financing activities is primarily due a $1.4 million increase in share repurchases and a $1.3 million decrease in proceeds from short-term borrowings during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period in   2015  . 
    
  Debt 
    
  On September 2, 2014, we entered into a Fourth Amended and Restated Financing and Security Agreement (the  Credit Agreement ). The Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility up to a maximum principal amount of   $65 million   expiring on October 31, 2018 and for a term loan in the principal amount of   $40 million   maturing on   October 31, 2017  , and is secured by substantially all of our assets.  
    
  The maximum interest rate on the Credit Agreement is the daily one-month   LIBOR market index rate plus 2.50%  . Based on our financial performance, the interest rate can be reduced to a minimum rate of the daily one-month   LIBOR market index rate plus 1.25%  , with the rate being determined based on our maximum leverage ratio for the preceding four quarters. Each unpaid advance on the revolving loan will bear interest until repaid. The term loan is payable in monthly installments equal to   $1.1 million   plus applicable interest, beginning on November 1, 2014 and ending on October 31, 2017. We may prepay the term loan or the revolving loan, in whole or in part, at any time without premium or penalty, subject to certain conditions. Amounts repaid or prepaid on the term loan may not be reborrowed. 
    
  The Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants that limit or restrict our and our subsidiaries  (subject to certain exceptions) ability to, among other things, grant liens, make investments, incur indebtedness, merge or consolidate, dispose of assets, make acquisitions. We are also required to maintain compliance with a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.5 to 1.0 and a maximum leverage ratio of 2.0 to 1.0. As of   September 30, 2016  , our fixed coverage charge ratio was 2.0 to 1.0 and our leverage ratio was 1.4 to 1.0, all of which were in compliance with the Credit Agreement.  
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our total long-term debt outstanding under the term loan was   $14.4 million  .  In addition, there were   $44.8 million   of borrowings outstanding and   $14.7 million   of available borrowings under the Credit Agreement. For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the weighted average interest rate on our borrowings was   2.2%  . 
    
  Off-Balance Sheet Commitments 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we did not have any off-balance sheet commitments except for operating leases and letters of credit entered into in the normal course of business. 
    
  Accounting Standards Issued 
    
  We discuss recently issued accounting standards in Note 2 to the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.

Forward-Looking Statements 
    
  This report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a  safe harbor  for forward looking statements. Forward looking statements are not statements of historical facts, but rather reflect our current expectations concerning future events and results. We use words such as  expects,   intends,   believes,   may,   will,   should,   could,   anticipates,   estimates,   plans  and similar expressions to indicate forward-looking statements, but their absence does not mean a statement is not forward-looking. Because these forward-looking statements are based upon management s expectations and assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties, there are important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, those factors set forth in Item 1A - Risk Factors of the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015   and those other risks and uncertainties detailed in our periodic reports and registration statements filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We caution that these risk factors may not be exhaustive. We operate in a continually changing business environment, and new risk factors emerge from time to time. We cannot predict these new risk factors, nor can we assess the effect, if any, of the new risk factors on our business or the extent to which any factor or combination of factors may cause actual results to differ from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. 
    
  If any one or more of these expectations and assumptions proves incorrect, actual results will likely differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements. Even if all of the foregoing assumptions and expectations prove correct, actual results may still differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements as a result of factors we may not anticipate or that may be beyond our control. While we cannot assess the future impact that any of these differences could have on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows or the market price of shares of our common stock, the differences could be significant. We do not undertake to update any forward-looking statements made by us, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You are cautioned not to unduly rely on such forward-looking statements when evaluating the information presented in this report.
