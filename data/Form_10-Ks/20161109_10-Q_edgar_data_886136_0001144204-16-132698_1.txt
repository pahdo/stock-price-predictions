FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  

Basis of Presentation   

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for interim
financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not
include all of the information and footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States for annual
financial statements. 

In our opinion, the accompanying financial
statements include all adjustments of a normal, recurring nature considered necessary for a fair presentation of our financial
position as of September 30, 2016 and the results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.
Results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that
may be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016. 

For further information, refer to the consolidated
financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the Saga Communications, Inc. Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2015. 

The Company has evaluated events and transactions
occurring subsequent to the balance sheet date of September 30, 2016, for items that should potentially be recognized in these
financial statements or discussed within the notes to the financial statements. 

Earnings Per Share Information   

Earnings per share is calculated using the
two-class method. The two-class method is an earnings allocation formula that determines earnings per share for each class of common
stock and participating security. The Company has participating securities related to restricted stock units, granted under the
Company s Second Amended and Restated 2005 Incentive Compensation Plan, that earn dividends on an equal basis with common
shares. In applying the two-class method, earnings are allocated to both common shares and participating securities. 

The following table sets forth the computation
of basic and diluted earnings per share: 

6  

SAGA COMMUNICATIONS, INC.  

NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL  

  STATEMENTS   (Continued)  

The number of stock options outstanding that
had an antidilutive effect on our earnings per share calculation, and therefore have been excluded from diluted earnings per share
calculation, was 0 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 0 for the three and nine months ended September 30,
2015, respectively. The actual effect of these shares, if any, on the diluted earnings per share calculation may vary significantly
depending on the fluctuation in the stock price. 

Financial Instruments   

Our financial instruments are comprised of
cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and long-term debt. The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents,
accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair value due to their short maturities. The carrying value of long-term
debt approximates fair value as it carries interest rates that either fluctuate with the euro-dollar rate, prime rate or have been
reset at the prevailing market rate at September 30, 2016. 

Income Taxes   

Our effective tax rate is higher than the federal
statutory rate as a result of the inclusion of state taxes in the income tax amount. 

Time Brokerage Agreements/Local Marketing
Agreements   

We have entered into Time Brokerage Agreements
( TBA s ) or Local Marketing Agreements ( LMA s ) in certain markets. In a typical TBA/LMA,
the FCC licensee of a station makes available, for a fee, blocks of air time on its station to another party that supplies programming
to be broadcast during that air time and sells their own commercial advertising announcements during the time periods specified.
Revenue and expenses related to TBA s/LMA s are included in the accompanying unaudited Condensed Consolidated Statements
of Income. 

2. Recent Accounting Pronouncements  

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements   

In September 2015, the FASB issued
Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-16,   Business Combinations (Topic 805), Simplifying the Accounting for
Measurement Period Adjustments ,  ( ASU 2015-16 ), which eliminated the requirement that an acquirer in
a business combination account for measurement-period adjustments retrospectively. Instead an acquirer will recognize a
measurement-period adjustment during the period in which it determines the amount of the adjustment, including the effect on
earnings of any amounts it would have recorded in previous periods if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition
date. ASU 2015-16 was adopted on January 1, 2016 and did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial
statements. 

In April 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards
Update No. 2015-05,   Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40), Customer s Accounting
for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement   ( ASU 2015-05 ), with new guidance on whether a cloud computing
arrangement includes a software license and the accounting for such an arrangement. If a cloud computing arrangement includes a
software license, then the software license element of the arrangement should be accounted for consistently with the acquisition
of other software licenses. If a cloud computing arrangement does not include a software license, the agreement should be accounted
for as a service contract. ASU 2015-05 was adopted on January 1, 2016 and did not have a material impact on our consolidated
financial statements. 

In April 2015, the FASB issued
Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-03,   Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30), Simplifying the
Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs  , and in August 2015 the FAS issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-15, 
 Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements . 
These ASUs require debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability to be presented in the balance sheet as a
direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt consistent with debt discounts. The presentation and subsequent
measurement of debt issuance costs associated with line of credit, may be presented as an asset and amortized ratably over
the term of the line of credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are outstanding borrowings on the arrangement. We
currently present deferred financing costs related to our line of credit within Other assets. These amendments were adopted
on January 1, 2016 and did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

SAGA COMMUNICATIONS, INC.  

NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL  

  STATEMENTS   (Continued)  

In February 2015, the FASB issued Accounting
Standards Update No. 2015-02,   Consolidation (Topic 810), Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis   ( ASU
2015-02 ) ,  which amended the consolidation requirements in ASC 810, primarily related to limited partnerships and
VIEs. ASU 2015-02 was adopted on January 1, 2016 and did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

In January 2015, the FASB issued Accounting
Standards Update No. 2015-01,   Income Statement-Extraordinary and Unusual Items   ( ASU 2015-01 ),
which simplified income statement presentation by eliminating the need to determine whether to classify an item as an extraordinary
item. ASU 2015-01 was adopted on January 1, 2016 and did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 

Recent Accounting Pronouncements  
Not Yet Adopted   

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,
  Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (Topic 230): Statement of Cash Flows   ( ASU
2016-15 ), which clarifies how entities should classify certain cash receipts and cash payments on the statement of cash
flows. ASU 2016-15 also clarifies how the predominance principle should be applied when cash receipts and cash payments have aspects
of more than one class of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15,
2017. The Company is currently evaluating the impact that this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements. 

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13,
  Financial Instruments   Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments 
 ( ASU 2016-13 ), which amends guidance on reporting credit losses for assets held at amortized cost basis and available
for sale debt securities. ASU 2016-13 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2019. The
Company is currently evaluating the impact that this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements. 

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,
  Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting   ( ASU
2016-09 ), which includes multiple amendments intended to simplify aspects of share-based payment accounting. Amendments to
the timing of when excess tax benefits are recognized, minimum statutory withholding requirements, and forfeitures will be applied
using a modified retrospective transition method through a cumulative-effect adjustment to equity as of the beginning of the period
of adoption. Amendments to the presentation of employee taxes paid on the statement of cash flows when an employer withholds shares
to meet the minimum statutory withholding requirement will be applied retrospectively, and amendments requiring the recognition
of excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies in the income statement are to be applied prospectively. ASU 2016-09 will be effective
for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating
the impact that the standard will have on our consolidated financial statements. 

In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting
Standards Update No. 2016-02,   Leases (Topic 842)   ( ASU 2016-02 ) which requires that all
leases with a term of more than one year, covering leased assets such as real estate, broadcasting towers and equipment, be reflected
on the balance sheet as assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by these leases. ASU 2016-02 is effective
for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the provisions
of this new standard on our consolidated financial statements. 

In November 2015, the FASB issued Accounting
Standards Update No. 2015-17,   Income Taxes (Topic 740), Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes   ( ASU
2015-17 ), which requires companies to classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent on the balance sheet
instead of separating deferred taxes into current and noncurrent amounts. ASU 2015-17 is effective for fiscal years and interim
periods beginning after December 15, 2016. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of this new standard
on our consolidated financial statements. 

In August 2014, the FASB issued Accounting
Standards Update No. 2014-15,   Disclosure of Uncertainties About an Entity s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern  
( ASU 2014-15 ), which requires management to evaluate, at each annual and interim reporting period, whether there
are conditions or events that raise substantial doubt about the entity s ability to continue as a going concern and provide
related disclosures. ASU 2014-15 is effective for annual reporting the first interim period within annual reporting periods beginning
after December 15, 2016 and is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial statements.

SAGA COMMUNICATIONS, INC.  

NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL  

  STATEMENTS   (Continued)  

In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards
Update No. 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers   ( ASU 2014-09 ), which provides guidance
for the recognition, measurement and disclosure of revenue resulting from contracts with customers and will supersede virtually
all of the current revenue recognition guidance under GAAP. In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-08,
  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus
Net)   ( ASU 2016-08 ), which clarifies how an entity should identify the unit of accounting for the principal
versus agent evaluation and how it should apply the control principle to certain types of arrangements. In April 2016, the FASB
issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-10,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), Identifying Performance
Obligations and Licensing   ( ASU 2016-10 ), which clarifies guidance related to identifying the performance
obligations and licensing implementation guidance contained in the new revenue recognition standard. In May 2016, the FASB issued
Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-12,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), Narrow-Scope Improvements
and Practical Expedients   ( ASU 2016-12 ), which addresses narrow-scope improvements to the guidance on collectability,
noncash consideration and completed contracts at transition as well as providing a practical expedient for contract modifications
at transition and an accounting polidy election related to the presentation of sales taxes and other similar taxes collected from
customers. ASU 2014-09, ASU 2016-08, ASU 2016-10, and ASU 2016-12 are effective for the first interim period within annual reporting
periods beginning after December 15, 2016.  In July 2015, the FASB made a decision to defer the effective date of ASU 2014-09
for one year and permit early adoption as of the original effective date. As a result, the standard is effective for us for
fiscal and interim periods beginning January 1, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of this
standard on our consolidated financial statements. 

3. Intangible Assets  

We evaluate our FCC licenses and goodwill for
impairment annually as of October 1   st   or more frequently if events or circumstances
indicate that the asset might be impaired. FCC licenses are evaluated for impairment at the market level using a direct method.
If the carrying amount of FCC licenses is greater than their estimated fair value in a given market, the carrying amount of FCC
licenses in that market is reduced to its estimated fair value. If the carrying amount of goodwill in a reporting unit is greater
than the implied value of goodwill determined by completing a hypothetical purchase price allocation using estimated fair value
of the reporting unit, the carrying amount of goodwill in that reporting unit is reduced to its implied value. 

Intangible assets that have finite lives are
amortized over their useful lives using the straight-line method. Favorable lease agreements are amortized over the lives of the
leases ranging from four to twenty-six years. Other intangibles are amortized over one to eleven years. 

4. Common Stock and Treasury Stock  

The following summarizes information relating
to the number of shares of our common stock issued in connection with stock transactions through September 30, 2016:

SAGA COMMUNICATIONS, INC.  

NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED
FINANCIAL  

  STATEMENTS   (Continued)  

We have a Stock Buy-Back Program to allow us
to purchase up to $75.8 million of our Class A Common Stock. As of September 30, 2016 we have remaining authorization of $24.9
million for future repurchases of our Class A Common Stock. 

5. Acquisitions and Dispositions  

We actively seek and explore opportunities
for expansion through the acquisition of additional broadcast properties. The consolidated statements of income include the operating
results of the acquired stations from their respective dates of acquisition. All acquisitions were accounted for as purchases and,
accordingly, the total purchase consideration was allocated to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities based on their estimated
fair values as of the acquisition dates. The excess of the consideration paid over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired
have been recorded as goodwill. The Company accounts for acquisition under the provisions of FASB ASC Topic 805,  Business Combinations . 

Management assigned fair values to the acquired
property and equipment through a combination of cost and market approaches based upon each specific asset s replacement cost,
with a provision for depreciation, and to the acquired intangibles, primarily an FCC license, based on the Greenfield valuation
methodology, a discounted cash flow approach. 

2016 Acquisitions   

On November 2, 2015, we entered into an agreement
to acquire an FM radio station (WLVQ) from Wilks Broadcast - Columbus, LLC, serving the Columbus, Ohio market for approximately
$13,791,000, which included $734,000 in accounts receivable and $57,000 in transactional costs. We completed this acquisition on
February 3, 2016. We operated this station under a LMA from November 16, 2015 through our completion of the acquisition. This acquisition
was financed through funds generated from operations. Management attributes the goodwill recognized in the acquisition to the power
of the existing brands in the Columbus, Ohio market as well as the synergies and growth opportunities expected through the combination
with the Company s existing stations. 

On March 16, 2016 we acquired an FM translator
serving the Portland, Maine market for approximately $50,000. 

On March 25, 2016 we acquired an FM translator
serving the Milwaukee, Wisconsin market for approximately $50,000. 

On April 8, 2016 we acquired an FM translator
serving the Charlottesville, Virginia market for approximately $100,000. 

On April 11, 2016 we acquired an FM translator
serving the Clarksville, Tennessee market for approximately $30,000. 

On June 3, 2016 we acquired an FM translator
serving the Spencer, Iowa market for approximately $35,000. 

On August 11, 2016 we acquired two FM translators
serving the Bellingham, Washington market for approximately $50,000. 

On September 12, 2016 we acquired an FM translator
serving the Portland, Maine market for approximately $45,000. 

2015 Acquisitions and Dispositions   

On July 13, 2015 we acquired an FM translator
serving the Manchester, New Hampshire market for approximately $45,000. 

On August 1, 2015 we acquired two AM and three
FM stations and one FM translator (WSVA-AM, WHBG-AM, WQPO-FM, WMQR-FM, WWRE-FM and WQPO-HD3) from M. Belmont VerStandig, Inc.,
serving the Harrisonburg, Virginia market for approximately $10,131,000, which included $128,000 in transactional costs. Cash was
utilized to fund the acquisition. Management attributes the goodwill recognized in the acquisition to the power of the existing
brands in the Harrisonburg, Virginia market as well as the synergies and growth opportunities expected through the combination
with the Company s existing stations. 

On August 26, 2015 we acquired an FM translator
serving the Asheville, North Carolina market for approximately $125,000.

  STATEMENTS   (Continued)  

On September 1, 2015 we acquired two FM stations
(WSIG-FM and WBOP-FM) from Gamma Broadcasting, LLC, serving the Harrisonburg, Virginia market for approximately $1,558,000, which
included $92,000 in transactional costs. Cash was utilized to fund the acquisition. FCC multiple ownership rules prohibit us from
owning both of these stations. In order to satisfy the multiple ownership requirements and receive FCC approval for this acquisition,
we simultaneously donated WBOP-FM to Liberty University, Inc., a charitable organization. In exchange for donating WBOP-FM, including
the Station, the FCC License and the Assets, we received an FM Translator W267BA, the FM Translator Assets, and the FM Translator
FCC license, valued at approximately $50,000. We incurred a pre-tax loss of $400,000 as a result of this donation. This loss is
recorded in other operating (income), expense, net on the Company s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and reported
in cash flows from operating activities on the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Management attributes the goodwill
recognized in the acquisition to the power of the existing brands in the Harrisonburg, Virginia market as well as the synergies
and growth opportunities expected through the combination with the Company s existing stations.

6. Stock-Based Compensation  

2005 Incentive Compensation Plan   

On October 16, 2013 our stockholders approved
the Second Amended and Restated Saga Communications, Inc. 2005 Incentive Compensation Plan (the  Second Restated 2005 Plan ).
The 2005 Incentive Compensation Plan was first approved by stockholders in 2005 and replaced our 2003 Stock Option Plan (the  2003
Plan ). The 2005 Incentive Compensation Plan was re-approved by stockholders in 2010. The changes made in the Second Restated
2005 Plan (i) increases the number of authorized shares by 233,334 shares of Common Stock, (ii) extends the date for making awards
to September 6, 2018, (iii) includes directors as participants, (iv) targets awards according to groupings of participants based
on ranges of base salary of employees and/or retainers of directors, (v) requires participants to retain 50% of their net annual
restricted stock awards during their employment or service as a director, and (vi) includes a clawback provision. The Second Restated
2005 Plan allows for the granting of restricted stock, restricted stock units, incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options,
and performance awards to eligible employees and non-employee directors. 

The number of shares of Common Stock that may
be issued under the Second Restated 2005 Plan may not exceed 280,000 shares of Class B Common Stock, 900,000 shares of Class A
Common Stock of which up to 620,000 shares of Class A Common Stock may be issued pursuant to incentive stock options and 280,000
Class A Common Stock issuable upon conversion of Class B Common Stock. Awards denominated in Class A Common Stock may be granted
to any employee or director under the Second Restated 2005 Plan. However, awards denominated in Class B Common Stock may only be
granted to Edward K. Christian, President, Chief Executive Officer, Chairman of the Board of Directors, and the holder of 100%
of the outstanding Class B Common Stock of the Company. Stock options granted under the Second Restated 2005 Plan may be for terms
not exceeding ten years from the date of grant and may not be exercised at a price which is less than 100% of the fair market value
of shares at the date of grant. 

Stock-Based Compensation   

All stock options granted were fully vested
and expensed at December 31, 2012, therefore there was no compensation expense related to stock options for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. 

The following summarizes the stock option transactions
for the Second Restated 2005 Plan and 2003 Plan for the nine months ended September 30, 2016:

of total compensation expense related to restricted stock-based compensation arrangements. This expense is included in corporate
general and administrative expenses in our results of operations. The associated tax benefit recognized for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, was $214,000, $638,000, $149,000 and $480,000,
respectively. 

7. Long-Term Debt  

Long-term debt consisted of the following: 

On August 18, 2015, we entered into a new credit
facility (the  Credit Facility ) with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., The Huntington National Bank, Citizens Bank, National
Association and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC. In connection with the execution of the Credit Facility, the credit agreement in place
at June 30, 2015 (the  Old Credit Agreement ) was terminated, and all outstanding amounts were paid in full. The Credit
Facility consists of a $100 million five-year revolving facility (the  Revolving Credit Facility ) and matures on August
18, 2020. 

We have pledged substantially all of our assets
(excluding our FCC licenses and certain other assets) in support of the Credit Facility and each of our subsidiaries has guaranteed
the Credit Facility and has pledged substantially all of their assets (excluding their FCC licenses and certain other assets) in
support of the Credit Facility. 

The proceeds from the Credit Facility were
used to repay all amounts outstanding on our Old Credit Agreement and pay transactional fees. The unused portion of the Revolving
Credit Facility is available for general corporate purposes, including working capital, capital expenditures, permitted acquisitions
and related transaction expenses and permitted stock buybacks. We wrote-off unamortized debt issuance costs relating to the Old
Credit Agreement of approximately $557,000, pre-tax, due to entering into this new agreement during the quarter ended September
30, 2015.

  STATEMENTS   (Continued)  

Approximately $266,000 of transaction fees
related to the Credit Facility were capitalized and are being amortized over the life of the Credit Facility. Those deferred debt
costs are included in other assets, net in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. 

Interest rates under the Credit Facility are
payable, at our option, at alternatives equal to LIBOR (0.5625% at September 30, 2016), plus 1% to 2% or the base rate plus 0%
to 1%. The spread over LIBOR and the base rate vary from time to time, depending upon our financial leverage. Letters of credit
issued under the Credit Facility will be subject to a participation fee (which is equal to the interest rate applicable to Eurocurrency
Loans, as defined in the Credit Agreement) payable to each of the Lenders and a fronting fee equal to 0.25% per annum payable to
the issuing bank. We also pay quarterly commitment fees of 0.2% to 0.3% per annum on the unused portion of the Revolving Credit
Facility. 

The Credit Facility contains a number of financial
covenants (all of which we were in compliance with at September 30, 2016) which, among other things, require us to maintain specified
financial ratios and impose certain limitations on us with respect to investments, additional indebtedness, dividends, distributions,
guarantees, liens and encumbrances. 

We had approximately $65 million of unused
borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility at September 30, 2016. 

The loan agreement of approximately $1.1 million
of secured debt of affiliate was amended in April, 2014 to extend the due date of the loan for three years to mature on May 1,
2017. 

8. Segment Information  

We evaluate the operating performance of our
markets individually. For purposes of business segment reporting, we have aligned operations with similar characteristics into
two business segments: Radio and Television. 

The Radio segment includes twenty-four markets,
which includes all ninety-nine of our radio stations. The Television segment includes two markets and consists of four television
stations and five low power television ( LPTV ) stations. The Radio and Television segments derive their revenue from
the sale of commercial broadcast inventory. The category  Corporate general and administrative  represents the income
and expense not allocated to reportable segments.

9. Litigation  

The Company is subject to various outstanding
claims which arise in the ordinary course of business and to other legal proceedings. Management anticipates that any potential
liability of the Company, which may arise out of or with respect to these matters, will not materially affect the Company s
financial statements.

10. Other Income  

During the third quarter of 2016, the Company
sold a tower in our Norfolk, Virginia market for approximately $1,619,000 to SBA Towers IX, LLC ( SBA ). Subsequently,
we entered into a ten year lease for tower space from SBA with three renewal periods of five years each. The transactions described have
been accounted for as a sale-leaseback transaction. Accordingly, the Company recognized a gain on the sale of assets of approximately
$1,415,000, which is the amount of the gain on sale in excess of present value of future lease payments and will recognize the
remaining approximately $65,000 in proportion to the related gross rental charged to expense over the term of the lease. The gain
is recorded in the other operating (income) expense, net in the Company s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. 

During the second quarter of 2015, two transmitters
in our Victoria, Texas market were significantly damaged by lightning. The Company s insurance policy provided coverage for
the replacement cost of the transmitters. The insurance settlement was finalized during the second quarter and the Company received
cash proceeds of $777,000, resulting in a $417,000 gain. The gain on insurance settlement represents the difference between the
replacement cost and carrying value of the transmitters. The gain is recorded in other (income) expense, net, in the Company s
Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations    

Results of Operations  

The following discussion should be read in
conjunction with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto of Saga Communications, Inc. and its
subsidiaries contained elsewhere herein and the audited financial statements and Management Discussion and Analysis contained in
our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. The following discussion is presented on both a consolidated
and segment basis. Corporate general and administrative expenses, interest expense, other (income) expense, and income tax
expense are managed on a consolidated basis and are reflected only in our discussion of consolidated results. 

For purposes of business segment reporting,
at September 30, 2016, we have aligned operations with similar characteristics into two business segments: Radio and Television.
The Radio segment includes twenty-four markets, which includes all ninety-nine of our radio stations. The Television segment includes
two markets and consists of four television stations and five LPTV stations. The discussion of our operating performance focuses
on segment operating income because we manage our segments primarily on operating income. Operating performance is evaluated for
each individual market. 

We use certain financial measures that are
not calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP) to assess
our financial performance. For example, we evaluate the performance of our markets based on  station operating income 
(operating income plus corporate general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, other operating (income) expenses,
and impairment of intangible assets). Station operating income is generally recognized by the broadcasting industry as a measure
of performance, is used by analysts who report on the performance of the broadcasting industry and it serves as an indicator of
the market value of a group of stations. In addition, we use it to evaluate individual stations, market-level performance, overall
operations and as a primary measure for incentive based compensation of executives and other members of management. Station operating
income is not necessarily indicative of amounts that may be available to us for debt service requirements, other commitments, reinvestment
or other discretionary uses. Station operating income is not a measure of liquidity or of performance in accordance with GAAP,
and should be viewed as a supplement to, and not a substitute for our results of operations presented on a GAAP basis. 

General  

We are a broadcast company primarily engaged
in acquiring, developing and operating broadcast properties. We actively seek and explore opportunities for expansion through the
acquisition of additional broadcast properties. We review acquisition opportunities on an ongoing basis. For additional information
with respect to acquisitions, see  Liquidity and Capital Resources  below. 

Radio Segment  

Our radio segment s primary source of
revenue is from the sale of advertising for broadcast on our stations. Depending on the format of a particular radio station, there
are a predetermined number of advertisements available to be broadcast each hour. 

Most advertising contracts are short-term and
generally run for a few weeks only. The majority of our revenue is generated from local advertising, which is sold primarily by
each radio markets  sales staff. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, approximately 89% and 89%, respectively,
of our radio segment s gross revenue was from local advertising. To generate national advertising sales, we engage independent
advertising sales representative firms that specialize in national sales for each of our broadcast markets. 

Our revenue varies throughout the year. Advertising
expenditures, our primary source of revenue, generally have been lowest during the winter months, which include the first quarter
of each year. We expect an increase in political advertising for 2016 due to the increased number of national, state, and local
elections in most of our markets as compared to the prior year. 

Our net operating revenue, station operating
expense and operating income varies from market to market based upon the market s rank or size which is based upon population
and the available radio advertising revenue in that particular market. 

The broadcasting industry, and advertising
in general, are influenced by the state of the overall economy, including unemployment rates, inflation, energy prices and consumer
interest rates. Our stations primarily broadcast in small to midsize markets. Historically, these markets have been more stable
than major metropolitan markets during downturns in advertising spending, but may not experience increases in such spending as
significant as those in major metropolitan markets in periods of economic improvement. 

19  

Our financial results are dependent on a number
of factors, the most significant of which is our ability to generate advertising revenue through rates charged to advertisers.
The rates a station is able to charge are, in large part, based on a station s ability to attract audiences in the demographic
groups targeted by its advertisers. In a number of our markets this is measured by periodic reports generated by independent national
rating services. In the remainder of our markets it is measured by the results advertisers obtain through the actual running of
an advertising schedule. Advertisers measure these results based on increased demand for their goods or services and/or actual
revenues generated from such demand. Various factors affect the rate a station can charge, including the general strength of the
local and national economies, population growth, ability to provide popular programming, local market competition, target marketing
capability of radio compared to other advertising media and signal strength. 

When we acquire and/or begin to operate a station
or group of stations we generally increase programming and advertising and promotion expenses to increase our share of our target
demographic audience. Our strategy sometimes requires levels of spending commensurate with the revenue levels we plan on achieving
in two to five years. During periods of economic downturns, or when the level of advertising spending is flat or down across the
industry, this strategy may result in the appearance that our cost of operations are increasing at a faster rate than our growth
in revenues, until such time as we achieve our targeted levels of revenue for the acquired station or group of stations. 

The number of advertisements that can be broadcast
without jeopardizing listening levels (and the resulting ratings) is limited in part by the format of a particular radio station.
Our stations strive to maximize revenue by constantly managing the number of commercials available for sale and adjusting prices
based upon local market conditions and ratings. While there may be shifts from time to time in the number of advertisements broadcast
during a particular time of day, the total number of advertisements broadcast on a particular station generally does not vary significantly
from year to year. Any change in our revenue, with the exception of those instances where stations are acquired or sold, is generally
the result of inventory sell out ratios and pricing adjustments, which are made to ensure that the station efficiently utilizes
available inventory. 

Our radio stations employ a variety of programming
formats. We periodically perform market research, including music evaluations, focus groups and strategic vulnerability studies.
Because reaching a large and demographically attractive audience is crucial to a station s financial success, we endeavor
to develop strong listener loyalty. Our stations also employ audience promotions to further develop and secure a loyal following.
We believe that the diversification of formats on our radio stations helps to insulate us from the effects of changes in musical
tastes of the public on any particular format. 

The primary operating expenses involved in
owning and operating radio stations are employee salaries, sales commissions, programming expenses, depreciation, and advertising
and promotion expenses. 

20  

The radio broadcasting industry is subject
to rapid technological change, evolving industry standards and the emergence of new media technologies and services. These new
technologies and media are gaining advertising share against radio and other traditional media. 

We are continuing to expand our digital initiative
to provide a seamless experience across numerous platforms to allow our listeners and viewers to connect with our products where
and when they want. We continue to create opportunities through targeted digital advertising and an array of digital services that
include online promotions, mobile messaging, and email marketing. 

In addition, we continue the rollout of HD
radio . HD radio  utilizes digital technology that provides improved sound quality over standard analog broadcasts
and also allows for the delivery of additional channels of diversified programming or data streaming in each radio market. 

During the nine months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015 and the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, our Columbus, Ohio; Des Moines, Iowa; Manchester, New Hampshire;
Milwaukee, Wisconsin; and Norfolk, Virginia markets, when combined, represented approximately 35%, 35%, 34% and 34%, respectively,
of our consolidated net operating revenue. An adverse change in any of these radio markets or our relative market position in those
markets could have a significant impact on our operating results as a whole. 

The following tables describe the percentage
of our consolidated net operating revenue represented by each of these markets: 

During the nine months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015 and the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the radio stations in our five largest markets when combined,

Television Segment  

Our television segment s primary source
of revenue is from the sale of advertising for broadcast on our stations. The number of advertisements available for broadcast
on our television stations is limited by network affiliation and syndicated programming agreements and, with respect to children s
programs, federal regulation. Our television stations  local market managers determine the number of advertisements to be
broadcast in locally produced programs only, which are primarily news programming and occasionally local sports or information
shows. 

Our net operating revenue, station operating
expense and operating income vary from market to market based upon the market s rank or size, which is based upon population,
available television advertising revenue in that particular market, and the popularity of programming being broadcast. 

Our financial results are dependent on a number
of factors, the most significant of which is our ability to generate advertising revenue through rates charged to advertisers.
The rates a station is able to charge are, in large part, based on a station s ability to attract audiences in the demographic
groups targeted by its advertisers, as measured principally by periodic reports by independent national rating services. Various
factors affect the rate a station can charge, including the general strength of the local and national economies, population growth,
ability to provide popular programming through locally produced news, sports and weather and as a result of syndication and network
affiliation agreements, local market competition, the ability of television broadcasting to reach a mass appeal market compared
to other advertising media, and signal strength including cable/satellite coverage, and government regulation and policies. 

Our stations strive to maximize revenue by
constantly adjusting prices for our commercial spots based upon local market conditions, advertising demands and ratings. While
there may be shifts from time to time in the number of advertisements broadcast during a particular time of day, the total number
of advertisements broadcast on a particular station generally does not vary significantly from year to year. Any change in our
revenue, with the exception of those instances where stations are acquired or sold, is generally the result of pricing adjustments,
which are made to ensure that the station efficiently utilizes available inventory. 

Because audience ratings in the local market
are crucial to a station s financial success, we endeavor to develop strong viewer loyalty by providing locally produced
news, weather and sports programming. We believe that this emphasis on the local market provides us with the viewer loyalty we
are trying to achieve. 

Most of our revenue is generated from local
advertising, which is sold primarily by each television markets  sales staff. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015, approximately 85% and 85%, respectively, of our television segment s gross revenue was from local advertising.
To generate national advertising sales, we engage independent advertising sales representatives that specialize in national sales
for each of our television markets. 

Our revenue varies throughout the year. Advertising
expenditures, our primary source of revenue, generally have been lowest during the winter months, which include the first quarter
of each year. We expect an increase in political advertising for 2016 due to the increased number of national, state and local elections
in most of our markets as compared to the prior year. 

The primary operating expenses involved in
owning and operating television stations are employee salaries, sales commissions, programming expenses, including news production
and the cost of acquiring certain syndicated programming, depreciation and advertising and promotion expenses. 

Our television market in Joplin, Missouri represented
approximately 11%, 10%, 10% and 10%, respectively, of our net operating revenues, and approximately 16%, 13%, 13% and 13%, respectively,
of our consolidated station operating income (operating income plus corporate general and administrative expenses, depreciation
and amortization, other operating (income) expenses, and impairment of intangible assets) for the nine months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015 and the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.

For the three months ended September
30, 2016, consolidated net operating revenue was $36,119,000 compared with $33,831,000 for the three months ended September
30, 2015, an increase of $2,288,000 or 6.8%. Approximately $1,574,000 or 69% of the increase was attributable to stations
that we did not own or operate for the entire comparable period and approximately $714,000 was generated by stations we owned
or operated for the comparable period in 2015 ( same station ). The increase in same station revenue was
primarily the result of an increase in gross political revenue of $1,619,000 offset by a decrease in gross local revenue
of approximately $921,000 from the third quarter of 2015. The increase in gross political revenue was due to a higher number
of national, state and local elections in most of our markets. The majority of the increase in political revenue (77%) was
attributable to our Joplin, Missouri TV market with the remainder of the increase attributable to Des Moines,
Iowa; Manchester, New Hampshire and Milwaukee, Wisconsin radio markets. The decrease in gross local revenue was due to
decreases in our Bellingham, Washington; Charlottesville, Virginia; Des Moines, Iowa; Milwaukee, Wisconsin and our
Victoria, Texas markets. 

Station operating expense was $25,459,000 for
the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared with $24,324,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, an increase
of $1,135,000 or 4.7%. Approximately $1,017,000 or 90% of the increase was attributable to stations that we did not own or operate
for the entire comparable period. We had an increase of approximately $118,000 on a same station basis primarily due to an increase
in our health insurance costs of $97,000. 

Operating income for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 was $9,325,000 compared to $6,497,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $2,828,000
or 43.5%. The increase was a result of the increase in net operating revenue partially offset by an increase in station operating,
described above, an increase in our corporate general and administrative expenses of $151,000 or 5.9% and an increase in other
operating income of $1,826,000, from the third quarter of 2015. The increase in corporate expenses is due to increases in non-cash
compensation related to the amortization of restricted stock grants of $163,000. The increase in other operating income is from
the gain of $1,415,000 received from the sale of a tower in our Norfolk, Virginia market as discussed in Note 10 of the financial
statements and a reduction in other operating expenses related to the loss of $400,000 in 2015 from the donation of WBOP-FM to
Liberty University, Inc., as discussed in Note 5 of the financial statements. 

We generated net income of $5,414,000 ($.92
per share on a fully diluted basis) during the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $3,112,000 ($.53 per share on
a fully diluted basis) for the three months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $2,302,000 or 74%. We had an increase in operating
income of $2,828,000, as described above, a decrease in interest expense of $33,000 and a decrease in the write-off of debt issuance
costs of $557,000 related to the new Credit Facility entered into during the third quarter of 2015 partially offset by an increase
in income tax expense of $1,116,000.

Radio Segment   

For the three months ended September 30,
2016, net operating revenue of the radio segment was $29,878,000 compared with $28,536,000 for the three months ended
September 30, 2015, which represents an increase of $1,342,000 or 4.7%. Approximately $1,574,000 of the increase was
attributable stations we did not own or operate for the entire comparable period, which was partially offset by a decrease of
$232,000 for the stations we owned or operated for the comparable period in 2015. The decrease in same station net operating
revenue was primarily attributable to a decrease in gross local revenue of $753,000 partially offset by increases in gross
political revenue of $376,000 and gross national revenue of $170,000. The decrease in gross local revenue was due to
decreases in our Bellingham, Washington; Charlottesville, Virginia; Des Moines, Iowa and Milwaukee, Wisconsin markets. The
increase in gross political revenue was due to a higher number of national, state and local elections in  our Des
Moines, Iowa; Manchester, New Hampshire and Milwaukee, Wisconsin markets. The increase in gross national revenue was due to
increases in our Columbus, Ohio and Milwaukee, Wisconsin markets. 

Station operating expense for the radio segment
was $21,775,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared with $20,825,000 for the three months ended September 30,
2015, an increase of $950,000 or 4.6%. The increase in station operating expense for the radio segment represents an increase of
approximately $1,017,000 in stations we did not own or operate in the entire comparable period partially offset by a decrease of
$67,000 in stations we did own or operate for the comparable period in 2015. The decrease in radio same station operating expenses
is primarily a result of a decrease in selling expenses of $196,000 partially offset by increases in healthcare costs of $67,000,
compensation costs of $46,000 and programming expenses of $29,000. 

Operating income in the radio segment increased
$2,185,000 or 29.9% to $9,496,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, from $7,311,000 for the three months ended September
30, 2015. The increase was a result of the increase in net operating revenue partially offset by the increase in station operating
expense as described above. Additionally, the increase in other operating income is from the gain of $1,415,000 received from the
sale of a tower in our Norfolk, Virginia market as discussed in Note 10 of the financial statements and a reduction in other operating
expenses related to the loss of $400,000 in 2015 from the donation of WBOP-FM to Liberty University, Inc., as discussed in Note
5 of the financial statements. 

Television Segment   

For the three months ended September
30, 2016, net operating revenue of our television segment was $6,241,000 compared with $5,295,000 for the three months
ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $946,000 or 17.9% which was primarily related to an increase in gross political
revenue of $1,243,000 in our Joplin, Missouri market, partially offset by a decrease in gross local revenue of $168,000. The
increase in gross political revenue was due to a higher number of national, state  and local elections in both of our
markets. The decrease in gross local revenue was due to a decrease at our Victoria, Texas market. 

Station operating expense in the television
segment for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $3,684,000, compared with $3,499,000 for the three months ended September
30, 2015, an increase of $185,000 or 5.3%. The increase is primarily related to increases in national sales commissions of $62,000,
compensation costs of $44,000, retransmission fees of $42,000 and healthcare costs of $30,000. 

Operating income in the television segment
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $2,557,000 compared with $1,763,000 for the three months ended September 30,
2015, an increase of $794,000 or 45.0%. The increase was a direct result of the increase in net operating revenue partially offset
by the increase in station operating expense described above.

Consolidated   

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
consolidated net operating revenue was $105,302,000 compared with $97,250,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, an
increase of $8,052,000 or 8.3%. Approximately $5,059,000 or 63% was attributable to stations that we did not own or operate for
the entire comparable period and $2,993,000 was attributable to stations we owned or operated for the comparable period. The majority
of increase in same station revenue was due to an increase in gross political revenue of $2,972,000 from 2015. The majority of the increase in political revenue (49%) was
attributable to our Joplin, Missouri TV market with the remainder of the increase attributable to our Des Moines,
Iowa; Manchester, New Hampshire and Milwaukee, Wisconsin radio markets. The increase in
gross political revenue was due to a higher number of national, state and local elections in most of our
markets. 

Station operating expense was $75,564,000 for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared with $71,400,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of
$4,164,000 or 5.8%. The increase was attributable to an increase of $3,382,000 or 81% attributable to stations that we did not
own or operate for the entire comparable period and an increase of $782,000 on a same station basis. The increase in same station
is primarily a result of an increase in healthcare costs of $586,000 and compensation costs of $289,000. 

Operating income for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 was $23,058,000 compared to $17,761,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $5,297,000
or 29.8%. The increase was a result of the increase in net operating revenue partially offset by an increase in station operating
expense, described above. Additionally, there was an increase in our corporate general and administrative expenses of $423,000
or 5.5%, from 2015 and an increase in our other operating income of $1,832,000. The increase in corporate expenses is primarily
due to an increase in non-cash compensation related to the amortization of restricted stock grants of $394,000. The increase in
other operating income is from the gain of $1,415,000 received from the sale of a tower in our Norfolk, Virginia market as discussed
in Note 10 of the financial statements and a reduction in other operating expenses related to the loss of $400,000 in 2015 from
the donation of WBOP-FM to Liberty University, Inc., as discussed in Note 5 of the financial statements. 

27  

We generated net income of 13,249,000 ($2.26
per share on a fully diluted basis) during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $9,717,000 ($1.67 per share on
a fully diluted basis) for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of $3,532,000 or 36.4%. We had an increase in
operating income of $5,297,000, as described above, a decrease in interest expense of $140,000 driven by a decrease in the interest
rate and amortization of bank fees, a decrease in the write-off of debt issuance costs of $557,000 due to the new Credit Facility
entered into during the third quarter of 2015, partially offset by an increase in income tax expense of $2,045,000 and a decrease
in other income of $417,000 attributable to a gain recognized in 2015 from insurance proceeds related to lightning damage to two
of our transmitters. 

Radio Segment   

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
net operating revenue of the radio segment was $88,208,000 compared with $81,829,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015,
which represents an increase of $6,379,000 or 7.8%. Approximately $5,059,000 or 79% was attributable to stations that we did not
own or operate for the entire comparable period and $1,320,000 was attributable to stations we owned or operated for the comparable
period. The majority of increase in same station revenue was due to an increase in gross political revenue of $1,467,000 from 2015.
The increase in gross political revenue was due to a higher number of national, state and local elections
in most of our markets. The increase in political revenue  was primarily attributable to increases in our Des Moines, Iowa; Manchester, New Hampshire and Milwaukee,
Wisconsin markets. 

Station operating expense for the radio segment
was $64,757,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared with $61,066,000 for the nine months ended September 30,
2015, a decrease of $3,691,000 or 6.0%. The increase was attributable to an increase of $3,382,000 or 92% attributable to stations
that we did not own or operate for the entire comparable period and an increase of $309,000 on a same station basis. The increase
in same station is primarily a result of an increase in healthcare costs of $457,000 partially offset by a decrease in legal expenses
of $99,000. 

Operating income in the radio segment increased
$4,490,000 or 22.1% to $24,839,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, from $20,349,000 for the nine months ended September
30, 2015. The increase was a result of the increase in net operating revenue, partially offset by the increase in station operating
expenses, as described above. Additionally, there was an increase in other operating income from the gain of $1,415,000 received
from the sale of a tower in our Norfolk, Virginia market as discussed in Note 10 of the financial statements and a reduction in
other operating expenses related to the loss of $400,000 in 2015 from the donation of WBOP-FM to Liberty University, Inc., as discussed
in Note 5 of the financial statements. 

Television Segment   

For the nine months ended September 30,
2016, net operating revenue of our television segment was $17,094,000 compared with $15,421,000 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2015, an increase of $1,673,000 or 10.9% which was primarily related to gross political revenue of $1,506,000
primarily attributable to our Joplin, Missouri market. The increase in gross political revenue was due to a higher number of
national, state and local elections in most of our markets. 

Station operating expense in the television
segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $10,807,000, compared with $10,334,000 for the nine months ended September
30, 2015, an increase of $473,000 or 4.6%. The increase is primarily a result of an increase in compensation costs of $195,000,
an increase in healthcare costs of $129,000, an increase in retransmission costs of $85,000 and an increase in national commissions
of $82,000.

for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $6,284,000 compared with $5,054,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015,
an increase of $1,230,000 or 24.3%. The increase was a result of the increase in net operating revenue partially offset by the
increase in station operating expense, described above.

attacks. We cannot be sure that we will be able to anticipate or respond timely to changes in any of these factors, which could
adversely affect the operating results in one or more fiscal quarters. Results of operations in any past period should not be considered,
in and of itself, indicative of the results to be expected for future periods. Fluctuations in operating results may also result

risks and uncertainties inherent in our business, see Item 1A.  Risk Factors  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the year ended December 31, 2015. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

Debt Arrangements and Debt Service Requirements   

On August 18, 2015, we entered into a new credit
facility (the  Credit Facility ) with a group of banks. In connection with the execution of the Credit Facility, the
credit agreement in place at June 30, 2015 (the  Old Credit Agreement ) was terminated, and all outstanding amounts
were paid in full. The Credit Facility consists of a $100 million five-year revolving facility (the  Revolving Credit Facility )
and matures on August 18, 2020. 

We have pledged substantially all of our assets
(excluding our FCC licenses and certain other assets) in support of the Credit Facility and each of our subsidiaries has guaranteed
the Credit Facility and has pledged substantially all of their assets (excluding their FCC licenses and certain other assets) in
support of the Credit Facility. 

The proceeds from the Credit Facility were
used to repay all amounts outstanding on our Old Credit Agreement and pay transactional fees. The unused portion of the Revolving
Credit Facility is available for general corporate purposes, including working capital, capital expenditures, permitted acquisitions
and related transaction expenses and permitted stock buybacks. We wrote-off unamortized debt issuance costs relating to the Old
Credit Agreement of approximately $557,000, pre-tax, due to entering into this new agreement during the quarter ended September
30, 2015. 

Approximately $266,000 of transaction fees
related to the Credit Facility were capitalized and are being amortized over the life of the Credit Facility. Those deferred debt
costs are included in other assets, net in the condensed consolidated balance sheets. 

Interest rates under the Credit Facility are
payable, at our option, at alternatives equal to LIBOR (0.5625% at September 30, 2016), plus 1% to 2% or the base rate plus 0%
to 1%. The spread over LIBOR and the base rate vary from time to time, depending upon our financial leverage. Letters of credit
issued under the Credit Facility will be subject to a participation fee (which is equal to the interest rates applicable to Eurocurrency
Loans, as defined in the Credit Agreement) payable to each of the Lenders and a fronting fee equal to 0.25% per annum payable to
the issuing bank. We also pay quarterly commitment fees of 0.2% to 0.3% per annum on the unused portion of the Revolving Credit
Facility. 

The Credit Facility contains a number of financial
covenants (all of which we were in compliance with at September 30, 2016) which, among other things, require us to maintain specified
financial ratios and impose certain limitations on us with respect to investments, additional indebtedness, dividends, distributions,
guarantees, liens and encumbrances. 

29  

We had approximately $65 million of unused
borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Facility at September 30, 2016. 

In 2003, we entered into an agreement of understanding
with Surtsey Media, LLC ( Surtsey Media ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Surtsey Productions, Inc., whereby we have
guaranteed up to $1,250,000 of the debt incurred in closing the acquisition of a construction permit for KFJX-TV station in Pittsburg,
Kansas, a full power Fox affiliate serving Joplin, Missouri. At September 30, 2016, there was $1,078,000 of debt outstanding under
this agreement. The loan agreement was amended in April, 2014 to extend the due date of the loan for three years to mature on May
1, 2017. We do not have any recourse provision in connection with our guarantee that would enable us to recover any amounts paid
under the guarantee. As a result, at September 30, 2016, we have recorded $1,078,000 in debt and $1,000,000 in intangible assets,
primarily broadcast licenses. In consideration for the guarantee, Surtsey Media entered into various agreements with us relating
to the stations. 

Sources and Uses of Cash   

During the nine months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015, we had net cash flows from operating activities of $21,020,000 and $19,348,000, respectively. We believe that cash
flow from operations will be sufficient to meet quarterly debt service requirements for interest and payments of principal under
our Credit Facility. However, if such cash flow is not sufficient we may be required to sell additional equity securities, refinance
our obligations or dispose of one or more of our properties in order to make such scheduled payments. There can be no assurance
that we would be able to effect any such transactions on favorable terms, if at all. 

Our capital expenditures, exclusive of acquisitions,
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 were $4,149,000 ($4,427,000 in 2015). We anticipate capital expenditures in 2016 to
be approximately $5   $5.5 million, which we expect to finance through funds generated from operations. 

On March 2, 2016, the Company s Board
of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 per share on its Classes A and B Common Stock. This dividend,
totaling $1.5 million, was paid on April 15, 2016 to shareholders of record on March 28, 2016 and funded by cash on the Company s
balance sheet. 

On June 1, 2016, the Company s Board
of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $0.25 per share on its Classes A and B Common Stock. This dividend, totaling $1.5
million, was paid on July 8, 2016 to shareholders of record on June 15, 2016 and funded by cash on the Company s balance sheet. 

On August 30, 2016, the Company s Board
of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $0.30 per share on its Classes A and B Common Stock. This dividend, totaling $1.8
million, was paid on September 30, 2016 to shareholders of record on September 14, 2016 and funded by cash on the Company s
balance sheet. 

On February 3, 2016 we acquired an FM radio
station (WLVQ) from Wilks Broadcast - Columbus, LLC, serving the Columbus, Ohio market for approximately $13,791,000, which included
$734,000 in accounts receivable and $57,000 in transactional costs. We operated this station under a LMA from November 16, 2015
through our completion of the acquisition. This acquisition was financed through funds generated from operations. 

We continue to actively seek and explore opportunities
for expansion through the acquisitions of additional broadcast properties. 

We anticipate that any future acquisitions
of radio and television stations and dividend payments will be financed through funds generated from operations, borrowings under
the Credit Agreement, additional debt or equity financing, or a combination thereof. However, there can be no assurances that any
such financing will be available on acceptable terms, if at all. 

Summary Disclosures About Contractual Obligations and Commercial
Commitments   

We have future cash obligations under various
types of contracts, including the terms of our Credit Facility, operating leases, programming contracts, employment agreements,
and other operating contracts. For additional information concerning our future cash obligations see  Item 7. Management s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation   Summary Disclosures About Contractual Obligations 
in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

We anticipate that our contractual cash obligations
will be financed through funds generated from operations or additional borrowings under the Credit Facility, or a combination thereof. 

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  

Our consolidated financial statements have
been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require us to make estimates,
judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of certain assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and related disclosures
and contingencies. We evaluate estimates used in preparation of our financial statements on a continual basis. There have been
no significant changes to our critical accounting policies that are described in Item 7.  Management s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations   Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  in our
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements  

Recent accounting pronouncements are described
in Note 2 to the accompanying financial statements. 

Inflation  

The impact of inflation on our operations has
not been significant to date. There can be no assurance that a high rate of inflation in the future would not have an adverse effect
on our operations. 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about
Market Risk    

Refer to  Item 7A. Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  and  Item 7. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations   Market Risk and Risk Management Policies  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for

Item 4. Controls and Procedures    

As of the end of the period covered by this
report, the Company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Company s management,
including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company s
disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a-15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Based upon that evaluation,
the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company s disclosure controls
and procedures are effective to cause the material information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files
or submits under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to be recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the Commission s rules and forms. There were no changes in the Company s internal controls over financial
reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2016, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect,
the Company s internal controls over financial reporting. 

PART II   OTHER INFORMATION  

Item 1. Legal Proceedings    

The Company is subject to various outstanding
claims which arise in the ordinary course of business and to other legal proceedings. Management anticipates that any potential
liability of the Company, which may arise out of or with respect to these matters, will not materially affect the Company s
financial statements. 

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use
of Proceeds    

The following table summarizes our repurchases
of our Class A Common Stock during the three months ended September 30, 2016. Shares repurchased during the quarter were from the
retention of shares for cashless exercise of stock options and the payment of the withholding taxes related to those stock option
exercises. 

(a) 
     We have a Stock Buy-Back Program which allows us to purchase our Class A Common Stock. In February 2013, our Board of Directors authorized an increase in the amount committed to the Buy-Back Program from $60 million to approximately $75.8 million.
