   NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS        NOTE 1   BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES        Reporting Entity       HCA Holdings, Inc. is a holding company
whose affiliates own and operate hospitals and related health care entities. The term  affiliates  includes direct and indirect subsidiaries of HCA Holdings, Inc. and partnerships and joint ventures in which such subsidiaries are partners.
At September 30, 2016, these affiliates owned and operated 169 hospitals, 117 freestanding surgery centers and provided extensive outpatient and ancillary services. HCA Holdings, Inc. s facilities are located in 20 states and England.
The terms  Company,   HCA,   we,   our  or  us,  as used herein and unless otherwise stated or indicated by context, refer to HCA Holdings, Inc. and its affiliates. The terms  facilities 
or  hospitals  refer to entities owned and operated by affiliates of HCA and the term  employees  refers to employees of affiliates of HCA.       Basis of Presentation       The accompanying unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly,
they do not include all the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete consolidated financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation
have been included and are of a normal and recurring nature.      The majority of our expenses are  costs of
revenues  items. Costs that could be classified as general and administrative would include our corporate office costs, which were $94 million and $79 million for the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and
$272 million and $237 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Operating results for the quarter and the nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be
expected for the year ending December 31, 2016. For further information, refer to the consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto included in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.

    Revenues    
  Revenues are recorded during the period the health care services are provided, based upon the estimated amounts due from
the patients and third-party payers. Third-party payers include federal and state agencies (under Medicare, Medicaid and other programs), managed care health plans (including the health insurance exchanges), commercial insurance companies and
employers. Estimates of contractual allowances under managed care health plans are based upon the payment terms specified in the related contractual agreements. Revenues related to uninsured patients and copayment and deductible amounts for patients
who have health care coverage may have discounts applied (uninsured discounts and contractual discounts). We also record a provision for doubtful accounts related to uninsured accounts to record the net self-pay revenues at the estimated amounts we
expect to collect. Our revenues from third-party payers, the uninsured and other payers for the quarters and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are summarized in the following table (dollars in millions):

all industries will use a five-step model to recognize revenue from customer contracts. The new standard, which replaces nearly all existing United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
( US GAAP ) and International Financial Reporting Standards revenue recognition guidance, will require significant management judgment in addition to changing the way many companies recognize revenue in their financial statements. The
standard was originally scheduled to become effective for public entities for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption was originally not to be permitted under US GAAP. In July 2015, the FASB decided to
defer the effective date of the new revenue standard by one year, but will permit entities to adopt one year earlier if they choose (i.e., the original effective date). The FASB decided, based on its outreach to various stakeholders and continuing
amendments to the new revenue standard, that a deferral was necessary to provide adequate time to effectively implement the new standard. We are continuing to evaluate the effects the adoption of this standard will have on our financial statements
and financial disclosures, and we do not believe the adoption will have a significant impact on our recognition of net revenues.      In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update  2016-02,   Leases  ( ASU  2016-02 ),  which
requires lessees to recognize assets and liabilities for most leases. ASU  2016-02  is effective for public business entities for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018 (calendar year
2019). Early adoption is permitted. ASU  2016-02 s  transition provisions will be applied using a modified retrospective approach at the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the
financial statements. We are currently evaluating the provisions of ASU  2016-02  to determine how our financial statements will be affected, and we believe the primary effect of adopting the new standard will
be to record assets and obligations for current operating leases.      In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting
Standards Update  2016-05,   Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Effect of Derivative Contract Novations on Existing Hedge Accounting Relationships  ( ASU
 2016-05 ),  which clarified that a novation of a derivative contract in a hedge accounting relationship does not, in and of itself, represent a termination of the original derivative instrument or a change
in the critical terms of the hedge relationship. We elected to adopt ASU  2016-05  prospectively effective January 1, 2016.   
  In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update  2016-09, 
 Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  ( ASU  2016-09 ),  which requires changes to how companies account for certain aspects of share-based payments to employees, including the
accounting for income taxes, forfeitures and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. We elected to adopt ASU  2016-09  prospectively effective
January 1, 2016.       Reclassifications    
  Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.   
   NOTE 2   ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS       During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we paid $343 million to acquire three hospital facilities and $125 million to acquire other nonhospital health care entities. During the nine
months ended September 30, 2015, we paid $15 million to acquire a hospital and $169 million to acquire other nonhospital health care entities.      During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we received proceeds of $23 million and recognized a net pretax gain of $8 million related to sales of real estate and other investments. During
the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we received proceeds of $27 million and recognized a net pretax gain of $2 million related to sales of real estate and other investments.

    NOTE 3   INCOME TAXES    
  Our liability for unrecognized tax benefits was $414 million, including accrued interest of $41 million, as of
September 30, 2016 ($554 million and $73 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2015). Unrecognized tax benefits of $136 million ($233 million as of December 31, 2015) would affect the effective rate, if
recognized.      Our provision for income taxes for the quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2016
included tax benefits of $11 million and $129 million, respectively, related to the adoption of ASU  2016-09,  which changes how companies account for certain aspects of share-based payments to employees.
Under ASU  2016-09,  we no longer record excess tax benefits (when the deductible amount related to the settlement of employee equity awards for tax purposes exceeds the cumulative compensation cost recognized
for financial reporting purposes) in equity. Instead, we recognize these tax benefits (and deficiencies, if applicable) as a component of our tax provision. This reporting change is applied prospectively and prior period amounts are not restated
(the excess tax benefits for the quarter and nine months ending September 30, 2015, related to the settlement of employee equity awards, were $34 million and $219 million, respectively, and were recorded in equity). ASU  2016-09  requires companies to present excess tax benefits as an operating activity on the statement of cash flows rather than as a financing activity, as previously required. We have elected to apply the change to
the statement of cash flows presentation prospectively.      During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, the
IRS completed its examination, resolving all outstanding federal tax issues for our 2011 and 2012 tax years. We reduced our provision for income taxes for the quarter and the nine months ended September 30, 2016 by $51 million, including
interest of $27 million ($17 million, net of tax) primarily as a result of this resolution. We are also subject to examination by state and foreign taxing authorities. Depending on the resolution of any federal, state and foreign tax disputes,
the completion of examinations by federal, state or foreign taxing authorities, or the expiration of statutes of limitation for specific taxing jurisdictions, we believe it is reasonably possible that our liability for unrecognized tax benefits may
significantly increase or decrease within the next 12 months. However, we are currently unable to estimate the range of any possible change.       NOTE 4   EARNINGS PER SHARE       We compute basic earnings
per share using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. We compute diluted earnings per share using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding, plus the dilutive effect of outstanding equity awards and potential
shares, computed using the treasury stock method.      The following table sets forth the computation of basic and
diluted earnings per share for the quarters and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 (dollars and shares in millions, except per share amounts):

   The average expected maturity of the investments in debt securities at
September 30, 2016 was 3.9 years, compared to the average scheduled maturity of 5.6 years. Expected and scheduled maturities may differ because the issuers of certain securities have the right to call, prepay or otherwise redeem such
obligations prior to their scheduled maturity date.       NOTE 6   FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS    
   Interest Rate Swap Agreements    
  We have entered into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. These swap
agreements involve the exchange of fixed and variable rate interest payments between two parties based on common notional principal amounts and maturity dates. Pay-fixed interest rate swaps effectively convert LIBOR indexed variable rate obligations
to fixed interest rate obligations. The interest payments under these agreements are settled on a net basis. The net interest payments, based on the notional amounts in these agreements, generally match the timing of the related liabilities for the
interest rate swap agreements which have been designated as cash flow hedges. The notional amounts of the swap agreements represent amounts used to calculate the exchange of cash flows and are not our assets or liabilities. Our credit risk related
to these agreements is considered low because the swap agreements are with creditworthy financial institutions.   
  The following table sets forth our interest rate swap agreements, which have been designated as cash flow hedges, at
September 30, 2016 (dollars in millions):       
    During the next 12 months, we estimate $48 million will be reclassified from
other comprehensive income ( OCI ) to interest expense.       Derivatives   Results of

     Credit-risk-related Contingent Features    
  We have agreements with each of our derivative counterparties that contain a provision where we could be declared in
default on our derivative obligations if repayment of the underlying indebtedness is accelerated by the lender due to our default on the indebtedness. As of September 30, 2016, we have not been required to post any collateral related to these
agreements. If we had breached these provisions at September 30, 2016, we would have been required to settle our obligations under the agreements at their aggregate, estimated termination value of $85 million.

    NOTE 7   ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE    
  Accounting Standards Codification 820,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures  ( ASC 820 ) emphasizes
fair value is a market-based measurement, not an entity-specific measurement. Therefore, a fair value measurement should be determined based on the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. As a basis for
considering market participant assumptions in fair value measurements, ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting
entity (observable inputs classified within Levels 1 and 2 of the hierarchy) and the reporting entity s own assumptions about market participant assumptions (unobservable inputs classified within Level 3 of the hierarchy).   
  Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs may include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in
active markets, as well as inputs observable for the asset or liability (other than quoted prices), such as interest rates, foreign exchange rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs
for the asset or liability, which are typically based on an entity s own assumptions, as there is little, if any, related market activity. In instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different
levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. Our assessment of the
significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment, and considers factors specific to the asset or liability.       Cash Traded Investments       Our cash traded investments are
generally classified within Level 1 or Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted market prices, broker or dealer quotations, or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency.
Certain types of cash traded instruments are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy because they trade infrequently and therefore have little or no price transparency. The valuation of these securities involves management s
judgment, after consideration of market factors and the absence of market transparency, market liquidity and observable inputs. Our valuation models derived fair market values compared to tax-equivalent yields of other securities of similar credit
worthiness and similar effective maturities.       Derivative Financial Instruments    
  We have entered into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. The valuation
of these instruments is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative. This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives, including the
period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves and implied volatilities. We incorporate credit valuation adjustments to reflect both our own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty s
nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements.      Although we determined the majority of the inputs used to
value our derivatives fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, the credit valuation adjustments associated with our derivatives utilize Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads to evaluate the likelihood of
default by us and our counterparties. We assessed the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of our derivative positions, and at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we determined the
credit valuation adjustments were not significant to the overall valuation of our derivatives.

   NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)        NOTE 7   ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE (continued)        
   The estimated fair value of our long-term debt was $33.343 billion
and $31.411 billion at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, compared to carrying amounts, excluding net debt issuance costs, aggregating $31.619 billion and $30.655 billion, respectively. The estimates of
fair value are generally based upon the quoted market prices or quoted market prices for similar issues of long-term debt with the same maturities.       NOTE 8   LONG-TERM DEBT       A summary of
long-term debt at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, including related interest rates at September 30, 2016, follows (dollars in millions):       
     2016 Activity    
  During August 2016, we issued $1.200 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.500% senior secured notes due 2027. We used
the net proceeds for general corporate purposes and to retire a portion of one of our senior secured term loans. We also entered into a joinder agreement to retire the remaining portion of this senior secured term loan using proceeds from a new
$1.200 billion senior secured term loan facility maturing in February 2024. The pretax loss on retirement of debt was $4 million.      During March 2016, we issued $1.500 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.250% senior secured notes due 2026. We used the net proceeds for general corporate purposes and to retire a portion of one of
our senior secured term loans. We also entered into a joinder agreement to retire the remaining portion of this senior secured term loan using proceeds from a new $1.500 billion senior secured term loan facility maturing in March 2023.   
   2015 Activity       During December 2015, we issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 5.875% senior notes due 2026. We used the net proceeds for general corporate purposes.

   2015 Activity (continued)        
   During November 2015, we issued $1.000 billion aggregate principal
amount of 5.875% senior notes due 2026. We used the net proceeds to redeem all $1.000 billion aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 6.500% senior notes due 2016.   
  During June 2015, we entered into a joinder agreement to retire certain of our existing senior secured term loans using
proceeds from a new $1.400 billion senior secured term loan credit facility maturing in June 2020. The pretax loss on retirement of debt was $3 million.   
  During May 2015, we issued $1.600 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.375% senior notes due
2025. We used the net proceeds to redeem all $1.525 billion aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 7   3   /   4   % senior notes due 2021. The pretax loss on retirement of debt related to this redemption was $122 million.
      During January 2015, we issued $1.000 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.375% senior notes due
2025. We used a portion of the net proceeds to repay at maturity our $750 million aggregate principal amount of 6.375% senior notes due 2015.   
   NOTE 9   CONTINGENCIES AND LEGAL CLAIM COSTS    
  We operate in a highly regulated and litigious industry. As a result, various lawsuits, claims and legal and regulatory
proceedings have been and can be expected to be instituted or asserted against us. We are also subject to claims and suits arising in the ordinary course of business, including claims for personal injuries or wrongful restriction of, or interference
with, physicians  staff privileges. In certain of these actions the claimants may seek punitive damages against us which may not be covered by insurance. We are subject to claims for additional taxes and related interest and penalties. The
resolution of any such lawsuits, claims or legal and regulatory proceedings could have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or liquidity.   
   Government Investigations, Claims and Litigation    
  Health care companies are subject to numerous investigations by various governmental agencies. Further, under the federal
False Claims Act ( FCA ), private parties have the right to bring  qui tam , or  whistleblower,  suits against companies that submit false claims for payments to, or improperly retain overpayments from, the government. Some
states have adopted similar state whistleblower and false claims provisions. Certain of our individual facilities have received, and from time to time, other facilities may receive, government inquiries from, and may be subject to investigation by,
federal and state agencies. Depending on whether the underlying conduct in these or future inquiries or investigations could be considered systemic, their resolution could have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations, financial
position or liquidity.      On April 2, 2014, the UK Competition and Markets Authority
( Authority ) issued a final report on its investigation of the private health care market in London. It concluded, among other things, that many private hospitals face little competition in central London, and that there are high barriers
to entry. As part of its remedies package, the Authority ordered HCA to sell either: (a) its London Bridge and Princess Grace hospitals; or (b) its Wellington Hospital, including the Platinum Medical Centre. It also imposed other remedial
conditions on HCA and other private health care providers, including: regulation of incentives to referring physicians; increased access to information about fees and performance; and restrictions on future arrangements between private providers and
National Health Service private patient units. HCA disagrees with the Authority s

assessment of the competitive conditions for hospitals in London, as well as its proposed divestiture remedy, and appealed the decision to the Competition Appeal Tribunal. The Competition Appeal
Tribunal overturned certain of the Authority s findings and sent the matter back to the Authority for further proceedings. In November 2015, following consideration of additional evidence, the Authority issued a provisional decision that again
found there were adverse effects on competition in the private hospital market in central London. The November 2015 provisional decision modified some of the Authority s earlier factual conclusions and acknowledged certain mitigating factors
for some of the effects noted in the prior decision. The November 2015 provisional decision also offered additional potential remedies, which continued to include divestment of one or more of HCA s London hospitals. Following a period of
consultation on the potential additional remedies, the Authority concluded, in a provisional decision issued March 22, 2016, that none of the additional remedies, including divestiture, would be both effective and proportionate. A final
decision was issued on September 5, 2016 confirming the terms of the provisional decision. No appeal has been notified by the Competition Appeal Tribunal as of yet. Third parties have until November 4, 2016 to challenge the decision (subject to any
extensions).       Health Midwest Litigation    
  In October 2009, the Health Care Foundation of Greater Kansas City, a nonprofit health foundation, filed suit against HCA
Inc. in the Circuit Court of Jackson County, Missouri and alleged that HCA did not fund the level of capital expenditures and uncompensated care agreed to in connection with HCA s purchase of hospitals from Health Midwest in 2003. The central
issue in the case was whether HCA s construction of new hospitals counted towards its $450 million five-year capital commitment. In addition, the plaintiff alleged that HCA did not make its required capital expenditures in a timely fashion. On
January 24, 2013, the court ruled in favor of the plaintiff and awarded at least $162 million. The court also ordered a court-supervised accounting of HCA s capital expenditures, as well as of expenditures on charity and uncompensated care
during the ten years following the purchase. The court also indicated it would award plaintiff attorneys fees, which the parties have stipulated are approximately $12 million for the trial phase. HCA recorded $175 million of legal claim costs in the
fourth quarter of 2012 related to this ruling, and, consistent with the judge s order, began accruing interest on that sum at 9% per annum. On April 25, 2014, the parties stipulated to an additional $78 million shortfall relating to
the capital expenditures issue. HCA recorded $78 million of legal claims costs in the first quarter of 2014 as a result of the stipulation, and accrued interest on that amount at 9% per annum. Pursuant to the terms of the stipulation, the
parties preserved their respective rights to contest the judge s underlying ruling, whether through motions in the trial court or on appeal. On February 9, 2015, the parties reached an agreement to settle the part of their dispute relating
to charity and uncompensated care for $15 million. The foundation is required to use that amount, net of attorneys  fees, for charitable activities in the Kansas City area. The parties also agreed on an additional amount for attorneys 
fees for the plaintiff for the accounting phase of the case. The parties filed post-trial motions, on which the court ruled on October 21, 2015. The court denied defendants  motion to have the court change its rulings on liability and
damages related to the capital expenditures issue. The court granted the plaintiff s motion for an award of additional pre-judgment interest, but did not specify whether the interest awarded was simple interest or would be compounded. The court
subsequently concluded that interest was to be compounded, and on December 9, 2015, the court entered judgment in the case in the total sum of $434 million, with interest continuing to accrue at 9% per annum, compounded annually, from and
after November 19, 2015, until the matter is resolved. At September 30, 2016, the Company had accrued liabilities of $468 million for the damages, costs and interest related to this litigation. On January 15, 2016, the Company filed a
Notice of Appeal in the Missouri Court of Appeals for the Western District. The Court of Appeals has scheduled December 20, 2016 for oral arguments.

  The changes in stockholders  deficit, including changes in stockholders  deficit attributable to HCA Holdings,
Inc. and changes in equity attributable to noncontrolling interests, are as follows (dollars and shares in millions):       
    On October 26, 2015, our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program
for up to $3 billion of our outstanding common stock. During May 2016, the Company repurchased 9.361 million shares of its common stock beneficially owned by affiliates of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts   Co. at a purchase price of $80.12 per
share, the closing price of the Company s common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on May 10, 2016, less a discount of 1%. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we also repurchased 19.703 million shares of our common
stock at an average price of $74.28 per share through market purchases, resulting in total repurchases of 29.064 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $76.16 per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 pursuant to
the $3.0 billion share repurchase program authorized during October 2015. At September 30, 2016, we had $390 million of repurchase authorization available under the October 2015 authorization.

    NOTE 11   SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION    
  We operate in one line of business, which is operating hospitals and related health care entities. We operate in two
geographically organized groups: the National and American Groups. The National Group includes 84 hospitals located in Alaska, California, Florida, southern Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, northern Kentucky, Nevada, New Hampshire, South Carolina, Utah and
Virginia, and the American Group includes 79 hospitals located in Colorado, northern Georgia, Kansas, southern Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas. We also operate six hospitals in England, and these facilities
are included in the Corporate and other group.      Adjusted segment EBITDA is defined as income before
depreciation and amortization, interest expense, losses (gains) on sales of facilities, losses on retirement of debt, legal claim costs, income taxes and net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. We use adjusted segment EBITDA as an
analytical indicator for purposes of allocating resources to geographic areas and assessing their performance. Adjusted segment EBITDA is commonly used as an analytical indicator within the health care industry, and also serves as a measure of
leverage capacity and debt service ability. Adjusted segment EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles, and the items excluded from adjusted segment EBITDA are significant
components in understanding and assessing financial performance. Because adjusted segment EBITDA is not a measurement determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and is thus susceptible to varying calculations, adjusted
segment EBITDA, as presented, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. The geographic distributions of our revenues, equity in earnings of affiliates, adjusted segment EBITDA and depreciation and amortization for
the quarters and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are summarized in the following table (dollars in millions):

       FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS        Forward-Looking Statements       This quarterly report on
Form 10-Q includes certain disclosures which contain  forward-looking statements.  Forward-looking statements include statements regarding expected share-based compensation expense, expected capital expenditures and expected net claim
payments and all other statements that do not relate solely to historical or current facts, and can be identified by the use of words like  may,   believe,   will,   expect,   project, 
 estimate,   anticipate,   plan,   initiative  or  continue.  These forward-looking statements are based on our current plans and expectations and are subject to a number of known and unknown
uncertainties and risks, many of which are beyond our control, which could significantly affect current plans and expectations and our future financial position and results of operations. These factors include, but are not limited to, (1) the
impact of our substantial indebtedness and the ability to refinance such indebtedness on acceptable terms, (2) the effects related to the implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and
Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the  Health Reform Law ), possible delays in or complications related to implementation of the Health Reform Law, court challenges, the possible enactment of additional federal or state
health care reforms and possible changes to the Health Reform Law and other federal, state or local laws or regulations affecting the health care industry, (3) the effects related to the continued implementation of the sequestration spending
reductions required under the Budget Control Act of 2011, and related legislation extending these reductions, and the potential for future deficit reduction legislation that may alter these spending reductions, which include cuts to Medicare
payments, or create additional spending reductions, (4) increases in the amount and risk of collectability of uninsured accounts and deductibles and copayment amounts for insured accounts, (5) the ability to achieve operating and financial
targets, and attain expected levels of patient volumes and control the costs of providing services, (6) possible changes in Medicare, Medicaid and other state programs, including Medicaid upper payment limit programs or Waiver Programs, that
may impact reimbursements to health care providers and insurers, (7) the highly competitive nature of the health care business, (8) changes in service mix, revenue mix and surgical volumes, including potential declines in the population
covered under managed care agreements, the ability to enter into and renew managed care provider agreements on acceptable terms and the impact of consumer-driven health plans and physician utilization trends and practices, (9) the efforts of
insurers, health care providers and others to contain health care costs, (10) the outcome of our continuing efforts to monitor, maintain and comply with appropriate laws, regulations, policies and procedures, (11) increases in wages and
the ability to attract and retain qualified management and personnel, including affiliated physicians, nurses and medical and technical support personnel, (12) the availability and terms of capital to fund the expansion of our business and
improvements to our existing facilities, (13) changes in accounting practices, (14) changes in general economic conditions nationally and regionally in our markets, (15) the emergence and effects related to infectious diseases,
(16) future divestitures which may result in charges and possible impairments of long-lived assets, (17) changes in business strategy or development plans, (18) delays in receiving payments for services provided, (19) the outcome
of pending and any future tax audits, disputes and litigation associated with our tax positions, (20) potential adverse impact of known and unknown government investigations, litigation and other claims that may be made against us,
(21) our ongoing ability to demonstrate meaningful use of certified electronic health record ( EHR ) technology, and (22) other risk factors described in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2015 and our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. As a consequence, current plans, anticipated actions and future financial position and results of operations may differ from those expressed in any forward-looking statements
made by or on behalf of HCA. You are cautioned not to unduly rely on such forward-looking statements when evaluating the information presented in this report, which forward-looking statements reflect management s views only as of the date of

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF    
   FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)    
   
    Health Care Reform    
  The Health Reform Law changes how health care services are covered, delivered and reimbursed through expanded coverage of
uninsured individuals, reduced growth in Medicare program spending, reductions in Medicare and Medicaid Disproportionate Share Hospital payments, and the establishment of programs in which reimbursement is tied to quality and integration. In
addition, the Health Reform Law reforms certain aspects of health insurance, expands existing efforts to tie Medicare and Medicaid payments to performance and quality, and contains provisions intended to strengthen fraud and abuse enforcement. The
Health Reform Law is expanding coverage through a combination of public program expansion and private sector health insurance and other reforms. Most of the provisions of the Health Reform Law that seek to decrease the number of uninsured became
effective January 1, 2014. However, the ongoing effect of the Health Reform Law is uncertain as a result of a number of factors, including the 2016 federal election, efforts to repeal or revise the law and uncertainty regarding how many states
will ultimately implement the Medicaid expansion provisions of the law.       Third Quarter 2016 Operations Summary    
  Revenues increased to $10.270 billion in the third quarter of 2016 from $9.856 billion in the third quarter of 2015. Net
income attributable to HCA Holdings, Inc. totaled $618 million, or $1.59 per diluted share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, compared to $449 million, or $1.05 per diluted share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2015.
Third quarter 2016 results include tax benefits of $51 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, primarily related to the resolution of federal income tax issues for our 2011 and 2012 tax years and $11 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, related to our
early adoption, during the first quarter of 2016, of a new accounting standard that requires the excess tax benefits related to employee equity award settlements to be recorded as a component of the provision for income taxes for periods subsequent
to adoption. Third quarter 2016 results also include legal claim costs of $11 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, losses on retirement of debt of $4 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, and net gains on sales of facilities of $3 million, or $0.01
per diluted share. Third quarter 2015 results include legal claim costs of $77 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, and net losses on sales of facilities of $2 million. All  per diluted share  disclosures are based upon amounts net of the
applicable income taxes. Shares used for diluted earnings per share were 389.592 million shares for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 and 426.441 million shares for the quarter ended September 30, 2015. During 2015 and the
first nine months of 2016, we repurchased 31.991 million and 29.064 million shares of our common stock, respectively.      Revenues increased 4.2% on a consolidated basis and increased 4.0% on a same facility basis for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2015. The
increase in consolidated revenues can be attributed to the combined impact of a 2.7% increase in revenue per equivalent admission and a 1.5% increase in equivalent admissions. The same facility revenues increase resulted from the combined impact of
a 2.7% increase in same facility revenue per equivalent admission and a 1.3% increase in same facility equivalent admissions.      During the quarters ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, consolidated admissions and same facility admissions each increased 0.7%. Surgeries increased 1.0% on a consolidated basis and 0.2% on a same
facility basis during the quarter ended September 30, 2016, compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2015. Emergency department visits increased 2.7% on both a consolidated basis and a same facility basis during the quarter ended
September 30, 2016, compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2015.      For the quarter ended
September 30, 2016, the provision for doubtful accounts declined $318 million, compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2015. The self-pay revenue deductions for charity care and uninsured discounts increased $117 million and $531
million, respectively, during the third quarter of 2016, compared to the third quarter of 2015. The sum of the provision for doubtful accounts, uninsured discounts and charity care, as a percentage of the sum of revenues, provision for doubtful
accounts, uninsured discounts and

charity care, was 33.7% for the third quarter of 2016, compared to 33.1% for the third quarter of 2015. Same facility uninsured admissions increased 0.7% for the quarter ended September 30,
2016, compared to the quarter ended September 30, 2015.      Cash flows from operating activities increased
$105 million from $1.101 billion for the third quarter of 2015 to $1.206 billion for the third quarter of 2016. The increase is related primarily to the $172 million favorable change in net income.   
   Results of Operations        Revenue/Volume Trends       Our revenues depend upon inpatient
occupancy levels, the ancillary services and therapy programs ordered by physicians and provided to patients, the volume of outpatient procedures and the charge and negotiated payment rates for such services. Gross charges typically do not reflect
what our facilities are actually paid. Our facilities have entered into agreements with third-party payers, including government programs and managed care health plans, under which the facilities are paid based upon the cost of providing services,
predetermined rates per diagnosis, fixed per diem rates or discounts from gross charges. We do not pursue collection of amounts related to patients who meet our guidelines to qualify for charity care; therefore, they are not reported in revenues. We
provide discounts to uninsured patients who do not qualify for Medicaid or charity care. After the discounts are applied, we are still unable to collect a significant portion of uninsured patients  accounts, and we record provisions for
doubtful accounts (based upon our historical collection experience) related to uninsured patients in the period the services are provided.     Revenues increased 4.2% from $9.856 billion in the third quarter of 2015 to $10.270 billion in the third quarter of 2016. Revenues are recorded during the period the health care services are
provided, based upon the estimated amounts due from the patients and third-party payers. Third-party payers include federal and state agencies (under Medicare, Medicaid and other programs), managed care health plans (including the health insurance
exchanges), commercial insurance companies and employers. Estimates of contractual allowances under managed care health plans are based upon the payment terms specified in the related contractual agreements. Revenues related to uninsured patients
and copayment and deductible amounts for patients who have health care coverage may have discounts applied (uninsured discounts and contractual discounts). We also record a provision for doubtful accounts related to uninsured accounts to record the
net self-pay revenues at the estimated amounts we expect to collect. Our revenues from our third-party payers, the uninsured and other payers for the quarters and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are summarized in the following
table (dollars in millions):

   FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)        Results of Operations (continued)        Revenue/Volume
Trends (continued)        

Consolidated and same facility revenue per equivalent admission each increased 2.7% in
the third quarter of 2016, compared to the third quarter of 2015. Consolidated and same facility equivalent admissions increased 1.5% and 1.3%, respectively, in the third quarter of 2016, compared to the third quarter of 2015. Consolidated and same
facility outpatient surgeries increased 1.2% and declined 0.2%, respectively, in the third quarter of 2016, compared to the third quarter of 2015. Consolidated and same facility inpatient surgeries each increased 0.8% in the third quarter of 2016,
compared to the third quarter of 2015. Consolidated and same facility emergency department visits each increased 2.7% in the third quarter of 2016, compared to the third quarter of 2015.   
  To quantify the total impact of and trends related to uninsured accounts, we believe it is beneficial to view the direct
uninsured revenue deductions (charity care and uninsured discounts) and provision for doubtful accounts in combination, rather than each separately. At September 30, 2016, our allowance for doubtful accounts represented 96.1% of the
$5.214 billion total patient due accounts receivable balance. The patient due accounts receivable balance represents the estimated uninsured portion of our accounts receivable. A summary of these adjustments to revenues amounts, related to
uninsured accounts, for the quarters and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 follows (dollars in millions):

   FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)        Results of Operations (continued)        Revenue/Volume
Trends (continued)        

    Same facility uninsured admissions increased by 255 admissions, or 0.7%, in the third
quarter of 2016, compared to the third quarter of 2015. Same facility uninsured admissions increased by 5.7%, in the second quarter of 2016, compared to the second quarter of 2015. Same facility uninsured admissions increased by 10.6%, in the first
quarter of 2016, compared to the first quarter of 2015. Same facility uninsured admissions in 2015, compared to 2014, increased 8.6% in the fourth quarter of 2015, increased 13.6% in the third quarter of 2015, increased 8.7% in the second quarter of
2015 and declined 12.5% in the first quarter of 2015. We believe the decline in the first quarter of 2015, compared to the prior year quarter, was primarily due to previously uninsured patients obtaining medical coverage through the health insurance
exchanges and Medicaid expansion programs. We believe the benefits from the health insurance exchanges and Medicaid expansion programs that we began realizing during 2014 are now reflected in both periods in our quarterly comparisons.   
  The approximate percentages of our admissions related to Medicare, managed Medicare, Medicaid, managed Medicaid, managed
care and other insurers and the uninsured for the quarters and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are set forth in the following table.       
    The approximate percentages of our inpatient revenues, before provision for doubtful
accounts, related to Medicare, managed Medicare, Medicaid, managed Medicaid, managed care and other insurers and the uninsured for the quarters and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are set forth in the following table.

   FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)        Results of Operations (continued)        Revenue/Volume
Trends (continued)        
   At September 30, 2016, we had 82 hospitals in the states of Texas
and Florida. During the third quarter of 2016, 56% of our admissions and 47% of our revenues were generated by these hospitals. Uninsured admissions in Texas and Florida represented 70% of our uninsured admissions during the third quarter of 2016.
     We receive a significant portion of our revenues from government health programs, principally Medicare and
Medicaid, which are highly regulated and subject to frequent and substantial changes. In 2011, the Centers for Medicare   Medicaid Services ( CMS ) approved a Medicaid waiver that allows Texas to continue receiving supplemental
Medicaid reimbursement while expanding its Medicaid managed care program. Texas currently operates its Medicaid Waiver Program pursuant to this waiver, which CMS has agreed to extend through December 2017. We cannot predict whether the Texas
Medicaid Waiver Program will be further extended, be revised or that revenues recognized from the program will not decline.      The Texas Medicaid Waiver Program includes two primary components: an indigent care component and a Delivery System Reform Incentive Payment ( DSRIP ) component. Initiatives under the DSRIP
program are designed to provide incentive payments to hospitals and other providers for their investments in delivery system reforms that increase access to health care, improve the quality of care and enhance the health of patients and families
they serve. We provide indigent care services in several communities in the state of Texas, in affiliation with other hospitals. The state of Texas has been involved in efforts to increase the indigent care provided by private hospitals. As a result
of additional indigent care being provided by private hospitals, public hospital districts or counties in Texas have available funds that were previously devoted to indigent care. The public hospital districts or counties are under no contractual or
legal obligation to provide such indigent care. The public hospital districts or counties have elected to transfer some portion of these available funds to the state s Medicaid program. Such action is at the sole discretion of the public
hospital districts or counties. It is anticipated that these contributions to the state will be matched with federal Medicaid funds. The state then may make supplemental payments to hospitals in the state for Medicaid services rendered. Hospitals
receiving Medicaid supplemental payments may include those that are providing additional indigent care services. Our Texas Medicaid revenues included Medicaid supplemental payments of $109 million ($25 million DSRIP related and $84 million
indigent care related) and $87 million ($22 million DSRIP related and $65 million indigent care related) during the third quarters of 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $293 million ($78 million DSRIP related and $215 million
indigent care related) and $252 million ($70 million DSRIP related and $182 million indigent care related) during the first nine months of 2016 and 2015, respectively.   
  In addition, we receive supplemental payments in several other states. We are aware these supplemental payment programs
are currently being reviewed by certain state agencies and CMS, and some states have made waiver requests to CMS to replace their existing supplemental payment programs. It is possible these reviews and waiver requests will result in the
restructuring of such supplemental payment programs and could result in the payment programs being reduced or eliminated. Because deliberations about these programs are ongoing, we are unable to estimate the financial impact the program structure
modifications, if any, may have on our results of operations.

volume.      

(b)  
    Equivalent admissions are used by management and certain investors as a general measure of combined inpatient and outpatient volume. Equivalent
admissions are computed by multiplying admissions (inpatient volume) by the sum of gross inpatient revenues and gross outpatient revenues and then dividing the resulting amount by gross inpatient revenues. The equivalent admissions computation
 equates  outpatient revenues to the volume measure (admissions) used to measure inpatient volume, resulting in a general measure of combined inpatient and outpatient volume.

   FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)        Results of Operations (continued)        
    Quarters Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015    
  Net income attributable to HCA Holdings, Inc. totaled $618 million, or $1.59 per diluted share, for the third quarter
of 2016 compared to $449 million, or $1.05 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2015. Third quarter 2016 results include tax benefits of $51 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, primarily related to the resolution of federal income tax
issues for our 2011 and 2012 tax years and $11 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, related to our early adoption, during the first quarter of 2016, of a new accounting standard that requires the excess tax benefits related to employee equity award
settlements to be recorded as a component of the provision for income taxes for periods subsequent to adoption. Third quarter 2016 results also include legal claim costs of $11 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, losses on retirement of debt of $4
million, or $0.01 per diluted share, and net gains on sales of facilities of $3 million, or $0.01 per diluted share. Third quarter 2015 results include legal claim costs of $77 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, and net losses on sales of
facilities of $2 million. All  per diluted share  disclosures are based upon amounts net of the applicable income taxes. Shares used for diluted earnings per share were 389.592 million shares for the quarter ended
September 30, 2016 and 426.441 million shares for the quarter ended September 30, 2015. During 2015 and the first nine months of 2016, we repurchased 31.991 million and 29.064 million shares of our common stock,
respectively.      Revenues before provision for doubtful accounts increased 0.9% for the third quarter of 2016
compared to the third quarter of 2015. The provision for doubtful accounts declined $318 million from $1.158 billion in the third quarter of 2015 to $840 million in the third quarter of 2016. The provision for doubtful accounts relates primarily to
uninsured amounts due directly from patients, including copayment and deductible amounts for patients who have health care coverage. The self-pay revenue deductions for charity care and uninsured discounts increased $117 million and $531 million,
respectively, during the third quarter of 2016, compared to the third quarter of 2015. The sum of the provision for doubtful accounts, uninsured discounts and charity care, as a percentage of the sum of revenues, the provision for doubtful accounts,
uninsured discounts and charity care, was 33.7% for the third quarter of 2016, compared to 33.1% for the third quarter of 2015. At September 30, 2016, our allowance for doubtful accounts represented 96.1% of the $5.214 billion total
patient due accounts receivable balance, including accounts, net of estimated contractual discounts, related to patients for which eligibility for Medicaid coverage or uninsured discounts was being evaluated.   
  Revenues increased 4.2% due to the combined impact of revenue per equivalent admission growth of 2.7% and a 1.5% increase
in equivalent admissions for the third quarter of 2016 compared to the third quarter of 2015. Same facility revenues increased 4.0% due to the combined impact of a 2.7% increase in same facility revenue per equivalent admission and a 1.3% increase
in same facility equivalent admissions for the third quarter of 2016 compared to the third quarter of 2015.   
  Salaries and benefits, as a percentage of revenues, were 46.1% in the third quarter of 2016 and 46.9% in the third

   Other operating expenses, as a percentage of revenues, were 18.5% in the
third quarter of 2016 and 18.2% in the third quarter of 2015. Other operating expenses is primarily comprised of contract services, professional fees, repairs and maintenance, rents and leases, utilities, insurance (including professional liability
insurance) and nonincome taxes. Provisions for losses related to professional liability risks were $106 million and $72 million for the third quarters of 2016 and 2015, respectively. During the third quarter of 2015, we recorded a
reduction of $29 million to our provision for professional liability risks related to the receipt of updated actuarial information.      We recognized $1 million and $9 million of electronic health record incentive income primarily related to Medicare incentives during the third quarters of 2016 and 2015, respectively.   
  Equity in earnings of affiliates was $22 million and $9 million in the third quarters of 2016 and 2015.   
  Depreciation and amortization increased $13 million, from $482 million in the third quarter of 2015 to $495
million in the third quarter of 2016.      Interest expense was $432 million in the third quarter of 2016 and

debt was 5.5% for the quarters ended September 30, 2015 and 2016.      During the third quarters of 2016 and
2015, we recorded net gains on sales of facilities of $3 million and net losses on sales of facilities of $2 million, respectively.      During August 2016, we issued $1.200 billion aggregate principal amount of 4.500% senior secured notes due 2027. We used the net proceeds for general corporate purposes and to retire a portion of one of
our senior secured term loans. We also entered into a joinder agreement to retire the remaining portion of this senior secured term loan using proceeds from a new $1.200 billion senior secured term loan facility maturing in February 2024. The pretax
loss on retirement of debt was $4 million.      We recorded $11 million and $77 million of legal claim costs
during the third quarters of 2016 and 2015, respectively, related to the Health Midwest litigation.      The
effective tax rates were 30.6% and 37.6% for the third quarters of 2016 and 2015, respectively. The effective tax rate computations exclude net income attributable to noncontrolling interests as it relates to consolidated partnerships. Our provision
for income taxes for the third quarter of 2016 included tax benefits of $51 million primarily related to the resolution of federal income tax issues for our 2011 and 2012 tax years and $11 million related to our early adoption, during the first
quarter of 2016, of ASU  2016-09  which requires the excess tax benefits related to employee equity award settlements be recorded as a component of the provision for income taxes for periods subsequent to
adoption. Excluding the effect of these adjustments, the effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2016 would have been 37.6%.      Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased from $124 million for the third quarter of 2015 to $127 million for the third quarter of 2016.

of these adjustments, the effective tax rate for the first nine months of 2016 would have been 37.6%.      Net
income attributable to noncontrolling interests declined from $411 million for the first nine months of 2015 to $377 million for the first nine months of 2016. The decline in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests related primarily
to joint ventures in our England market, a Texas market and an Oklahoma market.      Liquidity and Capital Resources    
  Cash provided by operating activities totaled $3.954 billion in the first nine months of 2016 compared to $3.176 billion
in the first nine months of 2015. The $778 million increase in cash provided by operating activities in the first nine months of 2016 compared to the first nine months of 2015 related primarily to the $389 million increase in net income (which
includes the $129 million tax benefit related to our adoption of ASU  2016-09)  and net positive changes in working capital items of $340 million. The combined interest payments and net tax payments in the
first nine months of 2016 and 2015 were $2.229 billion and $2.213 billion, respectively. Working capital totaled $3.688 billion at September 30, 2016 and $3.716 billion at December 31, 2015.   
  Cash used in investing activities was $2.234 billion in the first nine months of 2016 compared to $1.631 billion in the
first nine months of 2015. Acquisitions of hospitals and health care entities increased from $184 million in the first nine months of 2015 to $468 million in the first nine months of 2016. Excluding acquisitions, capital expenditures were
$1.884 billion in the first nine months of 2016 and $1.571 billion in the first nine months of 2015. Capital expenditures, excluding acquisitions, are expected to approximate $2.7 billion in 2016. At September 30, 2016, there were projects
under construction which had estimated additional costs to complete and equip over the next five years of approximately $2.9 billion. We expect to finance capital expenditures with internally generated and borrowed funds.   
  Cash used in financing activities totaled $1.784 billion in the first nine months of 2016 compared to $1.523 billion in
the first nine months of 2015. During the first nine months of 2016, net cash flows used in financing activities included a net increase of $906 million in our indebtedness, repurchases of common stock of $2.213 billion, distributions to
noncontrolling interests of $342 million and payments of debt issuance costs of $40 million. During the first nine months of 2015, net cash flows used in financing activities included a net increase of $76 million in our indebtedness,
repurchases of common stock of $1.386 billion, distributions to noncontrolling interests of $367 million and payments of debt issuance costs of $34 million.   
  We are a highly leveraged company with significant debt service requirements. Our debt totaled $31.441 billion at
September 30, 2016. Our interest expense was $1.275 billion for the first nine months of 2016 and $1.255 billion for the first nine months of 2015.      In addition to cash flows from operations, available sources of capital include amounts available under our senior secured credit facilities ($2.057 billion and $2.327 billion available as of
September 30, 2016 and October 31, 2016, respectively) and anticipated access to public and private debt markets.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF    
   FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)        Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued)        
   During August 2016, we issued $1.200 billion aggregate principal amount
of 4.500% senior secured notes due 2027. We used the net proceeds for general corporate purposes and to retire a portion of one of our senior secured term loans. We also entered into a joinder agreement to retire the remaining portion of this senior
secured term loan using proceeds from a new $1.200 billion senior secured term loan facility maturing in February 2024.      During March 2016, we issued $1.500 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.250% senior secured notes due 2026. We used the net proceeds for general corporate purposes and to retire a portion of one of
our senior secured term loans. We also entered into a joinder agreement to retire the remaining portion of this senior secured term loan using proceeds from a new $1.500 billion senior secured term loan facility maturing in March 2023.
     During December 2015, we issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 5.875% senior notes due 2026. We
used the net proceeds for general corporate purposes.      During November 2015, we issued $1.000 billion
aggregate principal amount of 5.875% senior notes due 2026. We used the net proceeds to redeem all $1.000 billion aggregate principal amount of our outstanding 6.500% senior notes due 2016.   
  During June 2015, we entered into a joinder agreement to retire certain of our existing senior secured term loans using
proceeds from a new $1.400 billion senior secured term loan credit facility maturing in June 2020.      During May 2015, we issued $1.600 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.375% senior notes due 2025. We used the net proceeds to redeem all $1.525 billion aggregate principal amount of our outstanding
7         3   /   4   % senior notes due 2021.       During January 2015, we issued
$1.000 billion aggregate principal amount of 5.375% senior notes due 2025. We used a portion of the net proceeds to repay at maturity our $750 million aggregate principal amount of 6.375% senior notes due 2015.   
  Investments of our professional liability insurance subsidiaries, to maintain statutory equity and pay claims, totaled
$403 million and $482 million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. An insurance subsidiary maintained net reserves for professional liability risks of $226 million and $261 million at September 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015, respectively. Our facilities are insured by a 100% owned insurance subsidiary for losses up to $50 million per occurrence; however, this coverage is subject to a $15 million per occurrence self-insured
retention. Net reserves for the self-insured professional liability risks retained were $1.275 billion and $1.160 billion at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Claims payments, net of reinsurance recoveries, during the
next 12 months are expected to approximate $363 million. We estimate that approximately $314 million of the expected net claim payments during the next 12 months will relate to claims subject to the self-insured retention.   
  Management believes that cash flows from operations, amounts available under our senior secured credit facilities and our
anticipated access to public and private debt markets will be sufficient to meet expected liquidity needs during the next 12 months.

ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF    
   FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued)        Liquidity and Capital Resources (continued)        
    Market Risk    
  We are exposed to market risk related to changes in market values of securities. The investments in debt and equity
securities of our 100% owned insurance subsidiaries were $399 million and $4 million, respectively, at September 30, 2016. These investments are carried at fair value, with changes in unrealized gains and losses being recorded as
adjustments to other comprehensive income. At September 30, 2016, we had a net unrealized gain of $23 million on the insurance subsidiaries  investment securities.   
  We are exposed to market risk related to market illiquidity. Investments in debt and equity securities of our 100% owned
insurance subsidiaries could be impaired by the inability to access the capital markets. Should the 100% owned insurance subsidiaries require significant amounts of cash in excess of normal cash requirements to pay claims and other expenses on short
notice, we may have difficulty selling these investments in a timely manner or be forced to sell them at a price less than what we might otherwise have been able to in a normal market environment. We may be required to recognize other-than-temporary
impairments on our investment securities in future periods should issuers default on interest payments or should the fair market valuations of the securities deteriorate due to ratings downgrades or other issue-specific factors.   
  We are also exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates, and we periodically enter into interest rate
swap agreements to manage our exposure to these fluctuations. Our interest rate swap agreements involve the exchange of fixed and variable rate interest payments between two parties, based on common notional principal amounts and maturity dates. The
notional amounts of the swap agreements represent balances used to calculate the exchange of cash flows and are not our assets or liabilities. Our credit risk related to these agreements is considered low because the swap agreements are with
creditworthy financial institutions. The interest payments under these agreements are settled on a net basis. These derivatives have been recognized in the financial statements at their respective fair values. Changes in the fair value of these
derivatives, which are designated as cash flow hedges, are included in other comprehensive income, and changes in the fair value of derivatives which have not been designated as hedges are recorded in operations.   
  With respect to our interest-bearing liabilities, approximately $2.966 billion of long-term debt at
September 30, 2016 was subject to variable rates of interest, while the remaining balance in long-term debt of $28.475 billion at September 30, 2016 was subject to fixed rates of interest. Both the general level of interest rates and, for
the senior secured credit facilities, our leverage affect our variable interest rates. Our variable debt is comprised primarily of amounts outstanding under the senior secured credit facilities. Borrowings under the senior secured credit facilities
bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus, at our option, either (a) a base rate determined by reference to the higher of (1) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% and (2) the prime rate of Bank of America or (b) a
LIBOR rate for the currency of such borrowing for the relevant interest period. The applicable margin for borrowings under the senior secured credit facilities may fluctuate according to a leverage ratio. The average effective interest rate for our
long-term debt declined from 5.7% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to 5.5% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.      The estimated fair value of our total long-term debt was $33.343 billion at September 30, 2016. The estimates of fair value are based upon the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues of
long-term debt with the same maturities. Based on a hypothetical 1% increase in interest rates, the potential annualized reduction to future pretax earnings would be approximately $30 million. To mitigate the impact of fluctuations in interest
rates, we generally target a portion of our debt portfolio to be maintained at fixed rates.      Our international
operations and the related market risks associated with foreign currencies are currently insignificant to our results of operations and financial position.

    Tax Examinations    
  During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, the IRS completed its examination, resolving all outstanding federal
income tax issues for our 2011 and 2012 tax years. We are also subject to examination by state and foreign taxing authorities.      Management believes HCA Holdings, Inc. and its predecessors, subsidiaries and affiliates properly reported taxable income and paid taxes in accordance with applicable laws and agreements established with
IRS, state and foreign taxing authorities and final resolution of any disputes will not have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position. However, if payments due upon final resolution of any issues exceed our
recorded estimates, such resolutions could have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position.

    BALANCE SHEET DATA    

(a)  
    Licensed beds are those beds for which a facility has been granted approval to operate from the applicable state licensing agency.

(b)  
    Represents the average number of licensed beds, weighted based on periods owned.      

(c)  
    Represents the average number of patients in our hospital beds each day.      

(d)  
    Represents the total number of patients admitted to our hospitals and is used by management and certain investors as a general measure of inpatient
volume.      

(e)  
    Equivalent admissions are used by management and certain investors as a general measure of combined inpatient and outpatient volume. Equivalent
admissions are computed by multiplying admissions (inpatient volume) by the sum of gross inpatient revenues and gross outpatient revenues and then dividing the resulting amount by gross inpatient revenues. The equivalent admissions computation
 equates  outpatient revenues to the volume measure (admissions) used to measure inpatient volume resulting in a general measure of combined inpatient and outpatient volume.      

(f)  
    Represents the average number of days admitted patients stay in our hospitals.      

(g)  
    Represents the number of patients treated in our emergency rooms.      

(h)  
    Represents the number of surgeries performed on patients who were not admitted to our hospitals. Pain management and endoscopy procedures are not
included in outpatient surgeries.      

(i)  
    Represents the number of surgeries performed on patients who have been admitted to our hospitals. Pain management and endoscopy procedures are not
included in inpatient surgeries.      

(j)  
    Revenues per day is calculated by dividing the revenues for the quarter by the days in the quarter. Days revenues in accounts receivable is then
calculated as accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, at the end of the quarter divided by the revenues per day.  Revenues  used in this computation are net of the provision for doubtful accounts.

(k)  
    Represents the percentage of patient revenues related to patients who are not admitted to our hospitals.      

(l)  
    Accounts receivable aging data is based upon consolidated gross accounts receivable of $10.514 billion (each 1% is equivalent to approximately
$105 million of gross accounts receivable).

      ITEM 3.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE
DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK       The information called for by this item is provided under the caption
 Market Risk  under Item 2,  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.          ITEM 4.     CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES        Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures    
  HCA s chief executive officer and chief financial officer have reviewed and evaluated the effectiveness of HCA s
disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in  Rules 13a-15(e)  and  15d-15(e)  promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of the end of the period
covered by this quarterly report. Based on that evaluation, the chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded HCA s disclosure controls and procedures were effective.   
   Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting    
  During the period covered by this report, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that
have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.        
 PART II. OTHER INFORMATION          ITEM 1.    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
      We operate in a highly regulated and litigious industry. As a result, various lawsuits, claims and legal
and regulatory proceedings have been and can be expected to be instituted or asserted against us. We are also subject to claims and suits arising in the ordinary course of business, including claims for personal injuries or wrongful restriction of,
or interference with, physicians  staff privileges. In certain of these actions the claimants may seek punitive damages against us which may not be covered by insurance. We are subject to claims for additional taxes and related interest and
penalties. The resolution of any such lawsuits, claims or legal and regulatory proceedings could have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or liquidity.   
   Government Investigations, Claims and Litigation    
  Health care companies are subject to numerous investigations by various governmental agencies. Further, under the federal
False Claims Act ( FCA ), private parties have the right to bring  qui tam , or  whistleblower,  suits against companies that submit false claims for payments to, or improperly retain overpayments from, the government. Some
states have adopted similar state whistleblower and false claims provisions. Certain of our individual facilities have received, and from time to time, other facilities may receive, government inquiries from, and may be subject to investigation by,
federal and state agencies. Depending on whether the underlying conduct in these or future inquiries or investigations could be considered systemic, their resolution could have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations, financial
position or liquidity.      On April 2, 2014, the UK Competition and Markets Authority
( Authority ) issued a final report on its investigation of the private health care market in London. It concluded, among other things, that many private hospitals face little competition in central London, and that there are high barriers
to entry. As part of its remedies package, the Authority ordered HCA to sell either: (a) its London Bridge and Princess Grace hospitals; or (b) its Wellington Hospital, including the Platinum Medical Centre. It also imposed other remedial
conditions on HCA and other private health care providers, including: regulation of incentives to referring physicians; increased access to information about fees and performance; and restrictions on future arrangements between private providers and
National Health Service private patient units. HCA disagrees with the Authority s   
         48

assessment of the competitive conditions for hospitals in London, as well as its proposed divestiture remedy, and appealed the decision to the Competition Appeal Tribunal. The Competition Appeal
Tribunal overturned certain of the Authority s findings and sent the matter back to the Authority for further proceedings. In November 2015, following consideration of additional evidence, the Authority issued a provisional decision that again
found there were adverse effects on competition in the private hospital market in central London. The November 2015 provisional decision modified some of the Authority s earlier factual conclusions and acknowledged certain mitigating factors
for some of the effects noted in the prior decision. The November 2015 provisional decision also offered additional potential remedies, which continued to include divestment of one or more of HCA s London hospitals. Following a period of
consultation on the potential additional remedies, the Authority concluded, in a provisional decision issued March 22, 2016, that none of the additional remedies, including divestiture, would be both effective and proportionate. A final
decision was issued on September 5, 2016 confirming the terms of the provisional decision. No appeal has been notified by the Competition Appeal Tribunal as of yet. Third parties have until November 4, 2016 to challenge the decision (subject to any
extensions).       Health Midwest Litigation    
  In October 2009, the Health Care Foundation of Greater Kansas City, a nonprofit health foundation, filed suit against HCA
Inc. in the Circuit Court of Jackson County, Missouri and alleged that HCA did not fund the level of capital expenditures and uncompensated care agreed to in connection with HCA s purchase of hospitals from Health Midwest in 2003. The central
issue in the case was whether HCA s construction of new hospitals counted towards its $450 million five-year capital commitment. In addition, the plaintiff alleged that HCA did not make its required capital expenditures in a timely fashion. On
January 24, 2013, the court ruled in favor of the plaintiff and awarded at least $162 million. The court also ordered a court-supervised accounting of HCA s capital expenditures, as well as of expenditures on charity and uncompensated care
during the ten years following the purchase. The court also indicated it would award plaintiff attorneys fees, which the parties have stipulated are approximately $12 million for the trial phase. HCA recorded $175 million of legal claim costs in the
fourth quarter of 2012 related to this ruling, and, consistent with the judge s order, began accruing interest on that sum at 9% per annum. On April 25, 2014, the parties stipulated to an additional $78 million shortfall relating to
the capital expenditures issue. HCA recorded $78 million of legal claims costs in the first quarter of 2014 as a result of the stipulation, and accrued interest on that amount at 9% per annum. Pursuant to the terms of the stipulation, the
parties preserved their respective rights to contest the judge s underlying ruling, whether through motions in the trial court or on appeal. On February 9, 2015, the parties reached an agreement to settle the part of their dispute relating
to charity and uncompensated care for $15 million. The foundation is required to use that amount, net of attorneys  fees, for charitable activities in the Kansas City area. The parties also agreed on an additional amount for attorneys 
fees for the plaintiff for the accounting phase of the case. The parties filed post-trial motions, on which the court ruled on October 21, 2015. The court denied defendants  motion to have the court change its rulings on liability and
damages related to the capital expenditures issue. The court granted the plaintiff s motion for an award of additional pre-judgment interest, but did not specify whether the interest awarded was simple interest or would be compounded. The court
subsequently concluded that interest was to be compounded, and on December 9, 2015, the court entered judgment in the case in the total sum of $434 million, with interest continuing to accrue at 9% per annum, compounded annually, from and
after November 19, 2015, until the matter is resolved. At September 30, 2016, the Company had accrued liabilities of $468 million for the damages, costs and interest related to this litigation. On January 15, 2016, the Company filed a
Notice of Appeal in the Missouri Court of Appeals for the Western District. The Court of Appeals has scheduled December 20, 2016 for oral arguments.         ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS       Reference is made to the factors set forth under the caption  Forward-Looking Statements  in Part I, Item 2 of this Form 10-Q and other risk factors described in our annual report on

EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS       On October 26, 2015, our board of directors authorized a share
repurchase program for up to $3 billion of our outstanding common stock. During May 2016, the Company repurchased 9,361,000 shares of its common stock beneficially owned by affiliates of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts   Co. at a purchase price of
$80.12 per share, the closing price of the Company s common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on May 10, 2016, less a discount of 1%. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we also repurchased 19,702,700 shares of our
common stock at an average price of $74.28 per share through market purchases, resulting in total repurchases of 29,063,700 shares of our common stock at an average price of $76.16 per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 pursuant
to the $3.0 billion share repurchase program authorized during October 2015. At September 30, 2016, we had $390 million of repurchase authorization available under the October 2015 authorization.   
  The following table provides certain information with respect to our repurchases of common stock from July 1, 2016
through September 30, 2016 (dollars in millions, except per share amounts).
