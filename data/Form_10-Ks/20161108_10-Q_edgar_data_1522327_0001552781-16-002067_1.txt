1. ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION   

Organization   

Entegra
Financial Corp. (the  Company ) was incorporated on May 31, 2011 and became the holding company for Entegra Bank (the
 Bank ) on September 30, 2014 upon the completion of Macon Bancorp s merger with and into the Company, pursuant
to which Macon Bancorp converted from the mutual to stock form of organization. The Company s primary operation is its investment
in the Bank. The Company also owns 100% of the common stock of Macon Capital Trust I (the  Trust ), a Delaware statutory
trust formed in 2003 to facilitate the issuance of trust preferred securities. The Bank is a North Carolina state-chartered savings
bank and has a wholly owned subsidiary, Entegra Services, Inc., which was inactive as of September 30, 2016. The consolidated
financials are presented in these financial statements.  

The
Bank operates as a community-focused retail bank, originating primarily real estate based mortgage, consumer and commercial loans
and accepting deposits from consumers and small businesses.  

Estimates   

The
preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  

Material
estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change, in the near term, relate to the determination of the allowance
for loan losses and the valuation of real estate acquired in connection with foreclosures or in satisfaction of loans. In connection
with the determination of the allowance for loan losses and the valuation of foreclosed real estate, management obtains independent
appraisals for significant properties.  

Principles
of Consolidation   

The
accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, the Bank, and its wholly owned subsidiary.
The accounts of the Trust are not consolidated with the Company. In consolidation all significant intercompany accounts and transactions
have been eliminated.  

Reclassification   

Certain
amounts in the prior years  financial statements may have been reclassified to conform to the current year s presentation.
The reclassifications had no significant effect on our results of operations or financial condition as previously reported.  

Basis
of Presentation   

The
accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles, or GAAP, for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation
S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements
and should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on March 15, 2016. In the opinion of
management, these interim financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the Company s consolidated financial
position and results of operations for each of the interim periods presented. Results of operations for interim periods are not
necessarily indicative of the results of operations that may be expected for a full year or any future period.  

Acquisition
Activities   

The
Company accounts for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed
are measured and recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition, including identifiable intangible assets. If the fair value
of net assets purchased exceeds the fair value of consideration paid, a bargain purchase gain is recognized at the date of acquisition.
Conversely, if the consideration paid exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired, goodwill is recognized at the acquisition
date. Fair values are subject to refinement for a period not to exceed one year after the closing date of an acquisition as information
relative to closing date fair values becomes available.   

9  

The
determination of the fair value of loans acquired takes into account credit quality deterioration and probability of loss; therefore,
the related allowance for loan losses is not carried forward.  

All identifiable intangible assets that are acquired in a business
combination are recognized at fair value on the acquisition date. Identifiable intangible assets are recognized separately if
they arise from contractual or other legal rights or if they are separable (i.e., capable of being sold, transferred, licensed,
rented, or exchanged separately from the entity). Deposit liabilities and the related depositor relationship intangible assets
may be exchanged in observable exchange transactions. As a result, the depositor relationship intangible asset is considered identifiable,
because the separability criterion has been met.   

Subsequent
Events   

Subsequent
events are events or transactions that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued. Recognized
subsequent events are events or transactions that provide additional evidence about conditions that existed at the date of the
balance sheet including the estimates inherent in the process of preparing financial statements. Unrecognized subsequent events
are events that provide evidence about conditions that did not exist at the date of the balance sheet but arose after that date.
The Company has reviewed events occurring through the issuance date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and no subsequent
events have occurred requiring accrual or disclosure in these financial statements other than as described in Footnote 16.  

Recent
Accounting Standards Updates   

In
January 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) amended the  Financial Instruments  topic of
the Accounting Standards Codification to address certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of
financial instruments. The amendments will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim
periods within those fiscal years. The Company will apply the guidance by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance
sheet as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The amendments related to equity securities without readily determinable
fair values will be applied prospectively to equity investments that exist as of the date of adoption of the amendments. The Company
is currently evaluating the impact on its financial statements.  

In
March 2016, the FASB amended the  Revenue from Contracts with Customers  topic of the Accounting Standards Codification to
clarify the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations and address how an entity should assess whether it
is the principal or the agent in contracts that include three or more parties. The amendments will be effective for the Company
for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company does not expect these amendments to have a material effect
on its financial statements.  

In
March 2016, the FASB issued guidance to simplify several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions
including the income tax consequences, the classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and the classification on
the statement of cash flows. Additionally, the guidance simplifies two areas specific to entities other than public business entities
allowing them to apply a practical expedient to estimate the expected term for all awards with performance or service conditions
that have certain characteristics and also allowing them to make a one-time election to switch from measuring all liability-classified
awards at fair value to measuring them at intrinsic value. The amendments will be effective for the Company for annual periods
beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those annual periods. The Company does not expect these amendments
to have a material effect on its financial statements.  

In
June 2016, the FASB issued amendments to Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-13  Financial Instruments  
Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.  The amendments in the Update require a financial
asset (or a group of financial assets) measured at amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected.
Thereby, providing financial statement users with more decision-useful information about the expected credit losses on financial
instruments and other commitments to extend credit held by the reporting entity. The amendments will be effective for the Company
for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company is currently evaluating the impact on its financial statements.  

In
August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15 ,  Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.   Current
GAAP is unclear or does not include specific guidance on how to classify certain transactions in the statement of cash flows.
This ASU is intended to reduce diversity in practice in how eight particular transactions are classified in the statement of cash
flows. ASU No. 2016-15 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption
is permitted, provided that all of the amendments are adopted in the same period. Entities will be required to apply the guidance
retrospectively. If it is impracticable to apply the guidance retrospectively for an issue, the amendments related to that issue
would be applied prospectively. As this guidance only affects the classification within the statement of cash flows, ASU No. 2016-15
is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s Consolidated Financial Statements.  

Other
accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by the FASB or other standards-setting bodies are not expected to have
a material impact on the Company s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

NOTE
2. INVESTMENT SECURITIES   

The
Company s held-to-maturity investment portfolio was transferred to available for sale during the third quarter of 2016 in
order to provide the Company more flexibility managing its investment portfolio. As a result of the transfer, the Company is prohibited
from classifying any investment securities as held to maturity for two years from the date of the transfer.  

The
amortized cost and estimated fair values of securities available for sale as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are summarized
as follows:  

11  

The
amortized cost and estimated fair values of securities held to maturity ( HTM ) as of December 31, 2015 is summarized
as follows:  

Information
pertaining to the activity for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 of unrealized losses related
to HTM securities (before the impact of income taxes) previously recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income ( AOCI )
is summarized below:  

The
increase in amortization during the three months ended September 30, 2016 was due to transfer of HTM securities to AFS.  

12  

Information
pertaining to securities with gross unrealized losses at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, aggregated by investment category
and length of time that individual securities have been in a continuous loss position, follows:  

13  

Information
pertaining to the number of securities with unrealized losses is detailed in the table below. The Company believes all unrealized
losses as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 represent temporary impairment. The unrealized losses have resulted from
temporary changes in the interest rate market and not as a result of credit deterioration.  We
do not intend to sell and it is not likely that we will be required to sell any of the securities referenced in the table below
before recovery of their amortized cost.   

For
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 the Company had proceeds from sales of securities available for sale
and their corresponding gross realized gains and losses as detailed below:  

14  

The
Company had securities pledged against deposits and borrowings of approximately $138.7 million and $69.6 million at September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  

The
amortized cost and estimated fair value of investments in debt securities at September 30, 2016, by contractual maturity, is shown
below. Mortgage-backed securities have not been scheduled because expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities
when borrowers have the right to prepay the obligations.  

NOTE
3. ACQUISITION ACTIVITIES   

The
Company has determined that the acquisition described below constitutes a business combination as defined in ASC Topic 805,  Business
Combinations . Accordingly, as of the date of the acquisition, the Company recorded the assets acquired and liabilities assumed
at fair value. The Company determined fair values in accordance with the guidance provided in ASC Topic 820,  Fair Value Measurements .
Fair value is established by discounting the expected future cash flows with a market discount rate for like maturity and risk
instruments. The estimation of expected future cash flows requires significant assumptions about appropriate discount rates, expected
future cash flows, market conditions and other future events. Actual results could differ materially. The Company made the determinations
of fair value using the best information available at the time; however, the assumptions used are subject to change and, if changed,
could have a material effect on the Company s financial position and results of operations.  

On
April 1, 2016, the Bank acquired Old Town Bank of Waynesville, North Carolina. In connection with the acquisition, the Bank acquired
$110.0 million of assets and assumed $97.9 million of liabilities. Total consideration transferred was $13.5 million of cash.
The fair value of consideration paid exceeded the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired and resulted
in the establishment of goodwill in the amount of $1.3 million, none of which is deductible for tax purposes. Loans purchased
with evidence of credit impairment were not material.  

15  

The
purchased assets and assumed liabilities were recorded at their acquisition date fair values, and are summarized in the table
below ( in thousands. )  

(1)    Fair
values are subject to refinement for a period not to exceed one year after the closing date of an acquisition as information relative
to closing date fair values becomes available. In particular, the fair value of collateral dependent loans and other real estate
owned may change to the extent that the Company receives updated appraisals indicating changes in valuation assumptions at acquisition.  

16  

NOTE
4. LOANS RECEIVABLE   

Loans
receivable as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are summarized as follows:  

The
Bank had $130.1 million and $119.5 million of loans pledged as collateral to secure funding with the Federal Home Loan Bank of
Atlanta ( FHLB ) at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The Bank also had $86.9 million and $88.4
million of loans pledged as collateral to secure funding with the Federal Reserve Bank ( FRB ) Discount Window at
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  

Included
in loans receivable and other borrowings at September 30, 2016 are $2.6 million in participated loans that did not qualify for
sale accounting. Interest expense on the other borrowings accrues at the same rate as the interest income recognized on the loans
receivable, resulting in no effect to net income.  

The
following tables present the activity related to the discount on purchased loans for the three and nine month periods ended September
30, 2016 and 2015:

The

Portfolio
Quality Indicators    

The
Company s portfolio grading analysis estimates the capability of the borrower to repay the contractual obligations of the
loan agreements as scheduled. The Company s internal credit risk grading system is based on experiences with similarly graded
loans, industry best practices, and regulatory guidance. Credit risk grades are refreshed each quarter, at which time management
analyzes the resulting information, as well as other external statistics and factors, to track loan performance.  

The
Company s internally assigned grades pursuant to the Board-approved lending policy are as follows:  

Pass
                                         (1-5)   Acceptable loans with any identifiable weaknesses appropriately mitigated.

Special
                                         Mention (6)   Potential weakness or identifiable weakness present without appropriate
                                         mitigating factors; however, loan continues to perform satisfactorily with no material
                                         delinquency noted. This may include some deterioration in repayment capacity and/or loan-to-value
                                         of securing collateral.    

Substandard
                                         (7)   Significant weakness that remains unmitigated, most likely due to diminished
                                         repayment capacity, serious delinquency, and/or marginal performance based upon restructured
                                         loan terms.     

Doubtful
                                         (8)   Significant weakness that remains unmitigated and collection in full is highly
                                         questionable or improbable.     

Loss
                                         (9)   Collectability is unlikely resulting in immediate charge-off.     

Beginning
as of March 31, 2015, we no longer risk grade consumer purposed loans within all categories for which the individual loan balance
is less than $417,000. These loan types provide limited credit information subsequent to origination and therefore may not be
properly risk graded within our standard risk grading system. All of our consumer purposed loans are now considered ungraded and
will be analyzed on a performing versus non-performing basis. The non-performing ungraded loans will be deemed substandard when
determining our classified assets. Consumer purposed loans may include residential loans, home equity loans and lines of credit,
residential lot loans, and other consumer loans. This change in risk grading methodology did not have any material impact on our
allowance for loan losses calculation.

Description
of segment and class risks   

Each
of our portfolio segments and the classes within those segments are subject to risks that could have an adverse impact on the
credit quality of our loan portfolio. Management has identified the most significant risks as described below which are generally
similar among our segments and classes. While the list is not exhaustive, it provides a description of the risks that management
has determined are the most significant.  

One-to
four family residential    

We
centrally underwrite each of our one-to four family residential loans using credit scoring and analytical tools consistent with
the Board-approved lending policy and internal procedures based upon industry best practices and regulatory directives. Loans
to be sold to secondary market investors must also adhere to investor guidelines. We also evaluate the value and marketability
of that collateral. Common risks to each class of non-commercial loans, including one-to-four family residential, include risks
that are not specific to individual transactions such as general economic conditions within our markets, particularly unemployment
and potential declines in real estate values. Personal events such as death, disability or change in marital status also add risk
to non-commercial loans.  

Commercial
real estate   

Commercial
mortgage loans are primarily dependent on the ability of our customers to achieve business results consistent with those projected
at loan origination resulting in cash flow sufficient to service the debt. To the extent that a customer s business results
are significantly unfavorable versus the original projections, the ability for our loan to be serviced on a basis consistent with
the contractual terms may be at risk. While these loans are secured by real property and possibly other business assets such as
inventory or accounts receivable, it is possible that the liquidation of the collateral will not fully satisfy the obligation.
Other commercial real estate loans consist primarily of loans secured by multifamily housing and agricultural loans. The primary
risk associated with multifamily loans is the ability of the income-producing property that collateralizes the loan to produce
adequate cash flow to service the debt. High unemployment or generally weak economic conditions may result in our customer having
to provide rental rate concessions to achieve adequate occupancy rates. The performance of agricultural loans are highly dependent
on favorable weather, reasonable costs for seed and fertilizer, and the ability to successfully market the product at a profitable
margin. The demand for these products is also dependent on macroeconomic conditions that are beyond the control of the borrower.  

Home
equity and lines of credit   

Home
equity loans are often secured by first or second liens on residential real estate, thereby making such loans particularly susceptible
to declining collateral values. A substantial decline in collateral value could render our second lien position to be effectively
unsecured. Additional risks include lien perfection inaccuracies and disputes with first lienholders that may further weaken our
collateral position. Further, the open-end structure of these loans creates the risk that customers may draw on the lines in excess
of the collateral value if there have been significant declines since origination.  

Residential
construction and other construction and land   

Residential
mortgage construction loans are typically secured by undeveloped or partially developed land with funds to be disbursed as home
construction is completed contingent upon receipt and satisfactory review of invoices and inspections. Declines in real estate
values can result in residential mortgage loan borrowers having debt levels in excess of the collateral s current market
value. Non-commercial construction and land development loans can experience delays in completion and/or cost overruns that exceed
the borrower s financial ability to complete the project. Cost overruns can result in foreclosure of partially completed
collateral with unrealized value and diminished marketability. Commercial construction and land development loans are dependent
on the supply and demand for commercial real estate in the markets we serve as well as the demand for newly constructed residential
homes and building lots. Deterioration in demand could result in significant decreases in the underlying collateral values and
make repayment of the outstanding loans more difficult for our customers.  

20  

Commercial   

We
centrally underwrite each of our commercial loans based primarily upon the customer s ability to generate the required cash
flow to service the debt in accordance with the contractual terms and conditions of the loan agreement. We strive to gain a complete
understanding of our borrower s businesses including the experience and background of the principals. To the extent that
the loan is secured by collateral, which is a predominant feature of the majority of our commercial loans, or other assets including
accounts receivable and inventory, we gain an understanding of the likely value of the collateral and what level of strength it
brings to the loan transaction. To the extent that the principals or other parties are obligated under the note or guaranty agreements,
we analyze the relative financial strength and liquidity of each guarantor. Common risks to each class of commercial loans include
risks that are not specific to individual transactions such as general economic conditions within our markets, as well as risks
that are specific to each transaction including volatility or seasonality of cash flows, changing demand for products and services,
personal events such as death, disability or change in marital status, and reductions in the value of our collateral.  

Consumer   

The
consumer loan portfolio includes loans secured by personal property such as automobiles, marketable securities, other titled recreational
vehicles including boats and motorcycles, as well as unsecured consumer debt. The value of underlying collateral within this class
is especially volatile due to potential rapid depreciation in values since date of loan origination in excess of principal repayment.

9. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES    

The
Company is exposed to certain risks arising from both its business operations and economic conditions. The Company principally
manages its exposure to business and operational risks through management of its core business activities. The Company manages
interest rate risk primarily by managing the amount, sources, and duration of its investment securities portfolio and borrowings
and through the use of derivative financial instruments. Specifically, the Company enters into derivative financial instruments
to manage exposures that arise from business activities that result in the receipt or payment of future known and uncertain cash
amounts, the value of which are determined by interest rates. Derivative financial instruments are used to manage differences
in the amount, timing, and duration of known or expected cash receipts or payments principally related to loans and borrowings.  

The
table below presents the fair value of the Company s derivative financial instruments as of the dates indicated as well
as their classification on the consolidated balance sheet (in thousands).

Derivative
contracts that are not accounted for as hedging instruments under ASC 815,  Derivatives and Hedging , are related to the
Company s mortgage loan origination activities. Between the time that the Company enters into an interest-rate lock commitment
to originate a mortgage loan that is to be held for sale and the time the loan is funded and eventually sold, the Company is subject
to the risk of variability in market prices. The Company also enters into forward sale agreements to mitigate risk and to protect
the expected gain on the eventual loan sale. This activity is on a matched basis, with a loan sale commitment hedging a specific
loan. The commitments to originate mortgage loans and forward loan sales commitments are freestanding derivative instruments.
The underlying loans are accounted for under the lower of cost or fair value method and are not reflected in the table above.
Fair value adjustment on these derivative instruments are recorded within mortgage banking income in the Consolidated Statement
of Income.  

The
Company s objectives in using interest rate derivatives are to add stability to net interest revenue and to manage its exposure
to interest rate movements. To accomplish this objective, the Company uses interest rate swaps as part of its interest rate risk
management strategy. At September 30, 2016, the Company had one interest rate swap with a notional amount of $14.0 million that
was designated as a cash flow hedge of the interest expense on junior subordinated notes. Also at September 30, 2016 the Company
had one interest rate swap with a notional amount of $15.0 million that was designated as a cash flow hedge of the interest expense
on variable rate FHLB advances. The swap contracts involve the payment of fixed-rate amounts to a counterparty in exchange for
the Company receiving variable-rate payments over the four year life of the junior subordinated note interest rate swap agreement
and the two year life of the FHLB interest rate swap agreement without exchange of the underlying notional amounts.  

The
effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and that qualify as cash flow hedges is recorded in accumulated
other comprehensive income and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the hedged forecasted transaction
affects earnings. Amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive income related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest
expense when the swaps become effective, as interest payments are made on the Company s LIBOR based variable-rate junior
subordinated debt and LIBOR based FHLB advance.  

The
table below presents the effect of the Company s cash flow hedge on the Consolidated Statement of Income (in thousands).

The
Company may be exposed to credit risk in the event of non-performance by the counterparties to its interest rate derivative agreements.
The Company assesses the credit risk of its financial institution counterparties by monitoring publicly available credit rating
and financial information. The Company manages dealer credit risk by entering into interest rate derivatives only with primary
and highly rated counterparties, the use of ISDA master agreements and counterparty limits. The agreements contain collateral
arrangements with the amount of collateral to be posted generally governed by the settlement value of outstanding swaps. The Company
does not currently anticipate any losses from failure of interest rate derivative counterparties to honor their obligations.  

The
Company has agreements with its derivative counterparties that contain a provision in which if the Company defaults on any of
its indebtedness, including default where repayment of the indebtedness has not been accelerated by the lender, the
Company could also be declared in default on its derivative obligations. Furthermore, certain agreements covering the Company s
derivative instruments contain provisions that require the Company to maintain its status as a well / adequately capitalized institution.
These provisions enable the counterparties to the derivative instruments to request immediate payment or require the Company to
post additional collateral.

NOTE
10. INCOME TAXES   

During
2015, the Company completed an analysis of all positive and negative evidence in assessing the need to maintain the valuation
allowance against its net deferred tax asset. As a result of this analysis, the Company determined that significant positive evidence
existed that would support the reversal of the valuation allowance including the following:  

A
                                         pattern of sustained profitability, excluding non-recurring items, since the first quarter
                                         of 2014;    

A
                                         3 year cumulative profit;    

Forecasted
                                         earnings sufficient to utilize all remaining net operating losses prior to expiration
                                         beginning in 2025 for North Carolina and 2032 for Federal ;    

Significant
                                         improvements in asset quality;    

Resolution
                                         of all remaining regulatory orders; and    

A
                                         strong capital position enabling future earnings investments.    

As
of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, $0.3 million and $0.6 million in valuation allowance related to net deferred tax
assets on investment securities remains in accumulated other comprehensive income. This valuation allowance will be recognized
as tax expense on a security-by-security basis upon the sale or maturity of the individual securities. The tax expense is expected
to be recognized over the remaining life of the securities of approximately 1.5 years.  

The
components of net deferred taxes as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 are summarized as follows:  

On
July 23, 2013, North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory signed a major tax reform bill into law that lowered the North Carolina corporate
income tax rate among other things. Specifically, the corporate income tax rate was reduced from 6.9% to 6% in 2014 and to 5%
in 2015. The rate was to be further reduced to 4% during the 2016 tax year and to 3% for post-2016 tax years provided that specified
revenue growth targets are reached. Based on state income tax revenues announced by the North Carolina Governor s Office
on August 2, 2016, the revenue target for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 was met, resulting in a reduction of the state income
tax rate to 3% effective January 1, 2017. As a result, the Company recorded a $0.4 million reduction in the net deferred tax asset
as of September 30, 2016.

not been included in calculating diluted earnings per share. There were no stock options outstanding during the nine months ended
September 30, 2015.  

For
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, all of the 178,300 outstanding restricted stock units were dilutive and included
in calculating diluted earnings per share. There were no restricted stock units outstanding during the nine months ended September
30, 2015.

NOTE
13. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES   

To
accommodate the financial needs of its customers, the Company makes commitments under various terms to lend funds. These commitments
include revolving credit agreements, term loan commitments and short-term borrowing agreements. Commitments to extend credit are
agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally
have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected
to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. The Company
evaluates each customer s creditworthiness. The amount of collateral obtained, if it is deemed necessary by the Company
upon extension of credit, is based on management s credit evaluation of the counterparty. Collateral held includes first
and second mortgages on one-to-four family dwellings, accounts receivable, inventory, and commercial real estate. Certain lines
of credit are unsecured.  

The
following summarizes the Company s approximate commitments to extend credit:  

As
of September 30, 2016, the Company had outstanding commitments to originate loans as follows:  

34  

The
allowance for unfunded commitments was $0.1 million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  

The
Company is exposed to loss as a result of its obligation for representations and warranties on loans sold to Fannie Mae and maintained
a reserve of $0.3 million as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  

In
the normal course of business, the Company is periodically involved in litigation. In the opinion of the Company s management,
none of this litigation is expected to have a material adverse effect on the accompanying consolidated financial statements.  

NOTE
14. FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURES   

We
use fair value measurements when recording and disclosing certain financial assets and liabilities. Securities available-for-sale,
loan servicing rights and mortgage derivatives are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Additionally, from time to time,
we may be required to record other assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, such as loans held for sale, impaired loans and
real estate owned.  

Fair
value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in the principal or most advantageous
market in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. An orderly transaction is a transaction
that assumes exposure to the market for a period prior to the measurement date to allow for marketing activities that are usual
and customary for transactions involving such assets or liabilities; it is not a forced transaction. In determining fair value,
we use various valuation approaches, including market, income and cost approaches. The fair value standard establishes a hierarchy
for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs
by requiring that observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in
pricing an asset or liability, which is developed, based on market data we have obtained from independent sources. Unobservable
inputs reflect our estimate of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability, which are developed
based on the best information available in the circumstances.  

The
fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
(Level 1 measurement) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurement). The fair value hierarchy is broken
down into three levels based on the reliability of inputs as follows:  

Level
                                         1: valuation is based upon unadjusted quoted market prices for identical instruments
                                         traded in active markets.     

Level
                                         2: valuation is based upon quoted market prices for similar instruments traded in active
                                         markets, quoted market prices for identical or similar instruments traded in markets
                                         that are not active and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions
                                         are observable in the market or can be corroborated by market data.     

Level
                                         3: valuation is derived from other valuation methodologies, including discounted cash
                                         flow models and similar techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in
                                         the market. These unobservable assumptions reflect estimates of assumptions that market
                                         participants would use in determining fair value.     

A
financial instrument s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to
the fair value measurement.  

Fair
value estimates are made at a specific point of time, based on relevant market information and information about the financial
instrument. These estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering for sale the Company s
entire holdings of a particular financial instrument. Because no active market exists for a significant portion of the Company s
financial instruments, fair value estimates are based on judgments regarding future expected loss experience, current economic
conditions, current interest rates and prepayment trends, risk characteristics of various financial instruments, and other factors.
These estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot be
determined with precision. Changes in any of these assumptions used in calculating fair value also would affect significantly
the estimates. In addition, the tax ramifications related to the realization of the unrealized gains and losses can have a significant
effect on fair value estimates and have not been considered in any of these estimates.  

35  

Following
is a description of valuation methodologies used for assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis:  

Investment
Securities     

We
obtain fair values for debt securities available for sale from a third-party pricing service, which utilizes several sources for
valuing fixed-income securities. The market evaluation sources for debt securities available for sale include observable inputs
rather than significant unobservable inputs and are classified as Level 2. The service provider utilizes pricing models that vary
by asset class and include available trade, bid and other market information. Generally, the methodologies include broker quotes,
proprietary models, vast descriptive terms and conditions databases, as well as extensive quality control programs.  

Included
in securities are investments in an exchange traded bond fund and U.S. Treasury bonds which are valued by reference to quoted
market prices and considered a Level 1 security.  

Also
included in securities are corporate bonds which are valued using significant unobservable inputs and are classified as Level
3.  

Trading
securities represent investments in exchange traded mutual funds which are valued by reference to quoted market prices and considered
a Level 1 security.  

Loan
Servicing Rights    

Loan
servicing rights are carried at fair value as determined by a third party valuation firm. The valuation model utilizes a discounted
cash flow analysis using discount rates and prepayment speed assumptions used by market participants. The Company classifies loan
servicing rights fair value measurements as Level 3.  

Derivative
Instruments    

Derivative
instruments include interest rate lock commitments, forward sale commitments and interest rate swaps. Interest rate lock commitments
and forward sale commitments are valued based on the change in the value of the underlying loan between the commitment date and
the end of the period. The Company classifies these instruments as Level 3.  

Interest
rate swaps are valued by a third party using significant assumptions that are observable in the market and can be corroborated
by market data. The Company classifies interest rate swaps as Level 2.  

Following
is a description of valuation methodologies used for assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis:  

Loans
Held for Sale    

Loans
held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or fair value. The fair value of loans held for sale is based on what secondary
markets are currently offering for portfolios with similar characteristics. Loans held for sale carried at fair value are classified
as Level 2.  

Impaired
Loans    

Impaired
loans are carried at the lower of recorded investment or fair value. The fair value of collateral dependent impaired loans is
estimated using the value of the collateral less selling costs if repayment is expected from liquidation of the collateral. Appraisals
may be discounted based on our historical knowledge, changes in market conditions from the time of appraisal or our knowledge
of the borrower and the borrower s business. Impaired loans carried at fair value are classified as Level 3. Impaired loans
measured using the present value of expected future cash flows are not deemed to be measured at fair value.  

Real
Estate Owned    

Real
estate owned, obtained in partial or total satisfaction of a loan is recorded at the lower of recorded investment in the loan
or fair value less cost to sell. Subsequent to foreclosure, these assets are carried at the lower of the amount recorded at acquisition
date or fair value less cost to sell. Accordingly, it may be necessary to record nonrecurring fair value adjustments. Fair value,
when recorded, is generally based upon appraisals by approved, independent, state certified appraisers. Like impaired loans, appraisals
may be discounted based on our historical knowledge, changes in market conditions from the time of appraisal or other information
available to us. Real estate owned carried at fair value is classified as Level 3.  

In
addition to financial instruments recorded at fair value in our financial statements, fair value accounting guidance requires
disclosure of the fair value of all of an entity s assets and liabilities that are considered financial instruments. The
majority of our assets and liabilities are considered financial instruments. Many of these instruments lack an available trading
market as characterized by a willing buyer and willing seller engaged in an exchange transaction. Also, it is our general practice
and intent to hold our financial instruments to maturity and to not engage in trading or sales activities. For fair value disclosure
purposes, we substantially utilize the fair value measurement criteria as required and explained above. In cases where quoted
fair values are not available, we use present value methods to determine the fair value of our financial instruments.  

36  

Following
is a description of valuation methodologies used for the disclosure of the fair value of financial instruments not carried at
fair value:  

Cash
and Cash Equivalents    

The
carrying amount of such instruments is deemed to be a reasonable estimate of fair value.  

Securities
Held to Maturity    

We
obtain fair values for debt securities held to maturity from a third-party pricing service, which utilizes several sources for
valuing fixed-income securities. The market evaluation sources for debt securities held to maturity include observable inputs
rather than significant unobservable inputs and are classified as Level 2. The service provider utilizes pricing models that vary
by asset class and include available trade, bid and other market information. Generally, the methodologies include broker quotes,
proprietary models, vast descriptive terms and conditions databases, as well as extensive quality control programs.  

Loans    

The
fair value of variable rate performing loans is based on carrying values adjusted for credit risk. The fair value of fixed rate
performing loans is estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, utilizing interest rates currently being offered for loans
with similar terms, adjusted for credit risk. The fair value of nonperforming loans is based on their carrying values less any
specific reserve. A prepayment assumption is used to estimate the portion of loans that will be repaid prior to their scheduled
maturity. No adjustment has been made for the illiquidity in the market for loans as there is no active market for many of the
Company s loans on which to reasonably base this estimate.  

Bank
Owned Life Insurance    

Fair
values approximate net cash surrender values.  

Other
Investments, at cost    

No
ready market exists for this stock and it has no quoted market value. However, redemption of this stock has historically been
at par value. Accordingly, the carrying amount is deemed to be a reasonable estimate of fair value.  

Deposits        

The
fair values disclosed for demand deposits are equal to the amounts payable on demand at the reporting date. The fair value of
certificates of deposit are estimated by discounting the amounts payable at the certificate rates using the rates currently offered
for deposits of similar remaining maturities.  

Advances
from the FHLB    

The
fair values disclosed for fixed rate long-term borrowings are determined by discounting their contractual cash flows using current
interest rates for long-term borrowings of similar remaining maturities. The carrying amounts of variable rate long-term borrowings
approximate their fair values.  

Junior
Subordinated Notes    

The
carrying amount approximates fair value because the debt is variable rate tied to LIBOR.  

Other
Borrowings    

The
fair values disclosed for fixed rate long-term borrowings are determined by discounting their contractual cash flows using current
interest rates for long-term borrowings of similar remaining maturities.  

Accrued
Interest Receivable and Payable    

Since
these financial instruments will typically be received or paid within three months, the carrying amounts of such instruments are
deemed to be a reasonable estimate of fair value.  

Loan
Commitments    

Estimates
of the fair value of these off-balance sheet items are not made because of the short-term nature of these arrangements and the
credit standing of the counterparties.  

37

and Liabilities Recorded at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis    

Below
is a table that presents information about certain assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis:

 project,   believe,   intend,   anticipate,   plan,   seek, 
 expect,   will,   may  and words of similar meaning. These forward-looking statements include,
but are not limited to:  

statements
of our goals, intentions and expectations;  

statements
regarding our business plans, prospects, growth and operating strategies;  

statements
regarding the asset quality of our loan and investment portfolios; and  

estimates
of our risks and future costs and benefits.  

These
forward-looking statements are based on our current beliefs and expectations and are inherently subject to significant business,
economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control. In addition, these forward-looking
statements are subject to assumptions with respect to future business strategies and decisions that are subject to change. The
Company is under no duty to and does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements after the date of this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  

The
following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations
expressed in the forward-looking statements:  

the
occurrence of an ownership change under applicable tax rules that could limit our ability to utilize losses to offset future taxable
income;  

general
economic conditions, either nationally or in our market areas, that are worse than expected;  

credit
quality deterioration as a result of, among other potential factors, declining real estate values, increasing interest rates,
increasing unemployment, or changes in payment behavior or other factors;  

the
adequacy of the level of our allowance for loan losses and the amount of loan loss provisions required in future periods;  

weaknesses
in the real estate market affect the value of real estate serving as collateral for loans in our portfolio  

competition
among depository and other financial institutions;  

inflation
and changes in the interest rate environment that reduce our margins or reduce the fair value of financial instruments;  

adverse
changes in the securities markets;  

changes
in laws or government regulations or policies affecting financial institutions, including changes in regulatory fees and capital
requirements;

ability to enter new markets successfully and capitalize on growth opportunities;  

our
ability to successfully integrate acquired entities;  

changes
in consumer spending, borrowing and savings habits;  

changes
in accounting policies and practices, as may be adopted by the bank regulatory agencies, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
( FASB ), the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
( PCAOB   

changes
in our key personnel, and our compensation and benefit plans;  

changes
in our financial condition or results of operations that reduce capital available to pay dividends or buy back shares;  

changes
in the financial condition or future prospects of issuers of securities that we own; and  

other
risks and uncertainties detailed in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and, from time to time, in our other filings with the SEC.  

For
additional information with respect to factors that could cause actual results to differ from the expectations stated in the forward-looking
statements, see  Risk Factors  under Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K.  

43  

Critical
Accounting Policies and Estimates   

Our
critical accounting policies involving significant judgments and assumptions used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial
Statements as of September 30, 2016 have remained unchanged from the disclosures presented in our Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Due to recent acquisition activity, we have added the following acquisition accounting policy:  

We
determined the fair value of our acquired assets and liabilities in accordance with accounting requirements for fair value measurement
and acquisition transactions as promulgated in FASB Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Subtopic 310-30, Loans
and Debt Securities Acquired with Deteriorated Credit Quality (ASC 310-30), ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations (ASC
805), and ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures. The determination of the initial fair values on loans
and other real estate purchased in an acquisition require significant judgment and complexity. All identifiable assets acquired,
including loans, are recorded at fair value. Loans acquired are recorded at fair value in accordance with the fair value methodology
prescribed in ASC Topic No. 820. These fair value estimates associated with the purchased loans include estimates related
to expected prepayments and the amount and timing of expected principal, interest and other cash flows.  

Where
a loan exhibits evidence of credit deterioration since origination and it is probable at the acquisition date that we will not
collect all principal and interest payments in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement, we account for the loan under
ASC 310-30, as a purchased credit impaired loan. Purchased-credit impaired loans were not material related to the Old Town Bank
acquisition.  

The
Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act ( JOBS Act ) contains provisions that, among other things, reduce certain reporting
requirements for qualifying public companies. As an  emerging growth company  we have elected to use the extended
transition period to delay adoption of new or revised accounting pronouncements applicable to public companies until such pronouncements
are made applicable to private companies. Accordingly, our financial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements
of public companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015,
there was not a significant difference in the presentation of our financial statements as compared to other public companies as
a result of this transition guidance.  

Overview   

Entegra
Financial Corp. was incorporated on May 31, 2011 to be the holding company for Entegra Bank (the  Bank ) upon the
completion of Macon Bancorp s merger with and into Entegra Financial Corp., pursuant to which Macon Bancorp converted from
the mutual to stock form of organization. Prior to the completion of the conversion, Entegra Financial Corp. did not engage in
any significant activities other than organizational activities. On September 30, 2014, the mutual to stock conversion was completed
and the Bank became the wholly owned subsidiary of Entegra Financial Corp. Also on September 30, 2014, Entegra Financial Corp.
completed the initial public offering of its common stock. In this Discussion and Analysis section, terms such as  we, 
 us,   our  and the  Company  refer to Entegra Financial Corp.  

We
provide a full range of financial services through offices located in Cherokee, Henderson, Jackson, Macon, Polk, Haywood and Transylvania
counties in North Carolina and Anderson, Greenville, and Spartanburg counties in South Carolina. We provide full service retail
and commercial banking products as well as wealth management services through a third party.  

We
earn revenue primarily from interest on loans and securities, and fees charged for financial services provided to our customers.
Offsetting these revenues are the cost of deposits and other funding sources, provisions for loan losses and other operating costs
such as salaries and employee benefits, data processing, occupancy and tax expense.  

Our
results of operations are significantly affected by general economic and competitive conditions in our market areas and nationally,
as well as changes in interest rates, sources of funding, government policies and actions of regulatory authorities. Future changes
in applicable laws, regulations or government policies may materially affect our financial condition and results of operations.  

Recent
Events   

On
April 1, 2016, the Company completed its acquisition of Old Town Bank ( Old Town ) of Waynesville, North Carolina,
which was merged with and into Entegra Bank.  

Shareholders
of Old Town received a cash payment equal to $11.05 in exchange for each share of Old Town common stock held immediately prior
to the effective time of the merger. The aggregate merger consideration paid by the Company was approximately $13.5 million, which
included a $0.7 million payment for the cash-out of in-the-money stock options. The Company did not issue any shares of its common
stock in connection with the merger.  

44  

The
acquisition added approximately $110.0 million to the Company s assets, including $64.8 million of loans, $88.7 million
of deposits, and $1.9 million of goodwill and intangibles.  

On
July 23, 2013, North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory signed a major tax reform bill into law that lowered the North Carolina corporate
income tax rate among other things. Specifically, the corporate income tax rate was reduced from 6.9% to 6% in 2014 and to 5%
in 2015. The rate was to be further reduced to 4% during the 2016 tax year and to 3% for post-2016 tax years provided that specified
revenue growth targets are reached. Based on state income tax revenues announced by the North Carolina Governor s Office
on August 2, 2016, the revenue target for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 was met, resulting in a reduction of the state
income tax rate to 3% effective January 1, 2017. As a result, the Company recorded a $0.4 million reduction in the net deferred
tax asset as of September 30, 2016.  

Strategic
Plan   

We
continue to execute on our Board of Director approved strategic plan which involves the following key components:  

Positioning
the Company for long-term independence by building a franchise that will provide above average shareholder returns;  

Seeking
acquisition opportunities that have reasonable earn-back periods and are accretive to return on equity while minimizing book value
dilution;  

Building
long term franchise value by diversifying into high growth markets with geographic contiguity to our current markets;  

Maximizing
our capital leverage through organic and acquired asset growth; and  

Rational
use of share repurchases to supplement shareholder returns and return excess capital to shareholders, but not at the expense of
building long-term value.  

The
following discussion and analysis is presented on a consolidated basis and focuses on the major components of the Company s
operations and significant changes in its results of operations for the periods presented. We encourage you to read this discussion
and analysis in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes and the other statistical information included
in this report and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Earnings
Summary   

Net
income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $1.8 million compared to $2.2 million for the same period in 2015. The
decrease in net income was the result of increases in compensation and benefits of $0.9 million, net occupancy of $0.2 million,
marketing and advertising of $0.2 million, data processing of $0.1 million and merger expenses of $0.1 million related to the acquisition
and integration of Old Town combined with an increase in income tax expense of $0.7 million. The increase in the income tax expense
for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 relates primarily to the reduction in the
North Carolina corporate income tax rate as well as the write-off of certain residual amounts recorded prior to the reversal of
the valuation allowance on its net deferred tax asset. This decrease was partially offset by a $1.9 million increase in net interest
income and an increase of $0.3 million in noninterest income during the 2016 period, as compared to the same period in 2015.  

Net
income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $4.0 million compared to $21.9 million for the same period in 2015. The
decrease in net income for the nine month period was primarily a result of a non-cash income tax benefit resulting from the $19.0
million reversal of substantially all of the valuation allowance on the Company s net deferred tax asset and a negative
provision for loan losses of $1.5 million in 2015. These items were partially offset by an increase in net interest income of
$5.3 million and an increase in noninterest income of $1.6 million partially offset by an increase in noninterest expense of $3.5
million during the nine months ending September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015.  

Net
interest income increased $1.9 million, or 26.4%, to $8.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $7.0
million for the same period in 2015. Net interest income increased $5.3 million, or 26.3%, to $25.3 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 compared to $20.0 million for the same period in 2015. The increase in net interest income was primarily
due to higher volumes in the loan and investment portfolios as well as a decrease in the rate paid on advances and deposits. Net
interest margin for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 improved to 3.29% and 3.28%, respectively, compared to
3.13% and 3.08% for the same periods in 2015.  

The
provision for loan losses was $0.1 million for the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 compared to a provision
for loan losses of $0 and $(1.5 million) in the comparable 2015 periods. The Company continues to experience a minimal level of
net charge-offs and low levels of non-performing assets.  

Non-GAAP
Financial Measures   

Statements
included in this Management s Discussion and Analysis include non-GAAP financial measures and should be read along with
the accompanying tables, which provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures. This Management s
Discussion and Analysis and the accompanying tables discuss financial measures, such as core net interest income, core noninterest
expense, and core net income, which are non-GAAP measures. We believe that such non-GAAP measures are useful because they enhance
the ability of investors and management to evaluate and compare the Company s operating results from period to period in
a meaningful manner. Non-GAAP measures should not be considered as an alternative to any measure of performance as promulgated
under GAAP. Investors should consider the Company s performance and financial condition as reported under GAAP and all other
relevant information when assessing the performance or financial condition of the company. Non-GAAP measures have limitations
as analytical tools, and investors should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the Company s results
or financial condition as reported under GAAP.  

46  

We
analyze our noninterest expense and net income on a non-GAAP basis in order to exclude non-recurring items as detailed in the
table below:  

(1) -
The Company maintained a valuation allowance on a portion of its net deferred tax asset during a portion of 2015 and therefore
did not recognize a normal income tax provision. Core results have been adjusted to reflect income tax expense to an estimated
35% effective tax rate after the other adjustments have been applied.  

47  

Financial
Condition At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015   

Total
assets increased $187.0 million, or 18.1%, to $1.22 billion at September 30, 2016 from $1.03 billion at December 31, 2015, primarily
as a result of the addition of $111.4 million in assets related to the Old Town acquisition in the second quarter of 2016, and
increases in loan activity and investment purchases.  

Loans
increased $103.3 million, or 16.6%, to $727.4 million at September 30, 2016, which included $65.0 million of loans related to
the Old Town acquisition. Loan balances excluding those acquired in the Old Town acquisition have grown at an annualized pace
of 8.2% since December 31, 2015 and have been primarily concentrated in commercial real estate and consumer and industrial loans.  

The
Company also increased its investment portfolio by $42.7 million from December 31, 2015 to September 30, 2016 in order to better
leverage its capital. FHLB advances, which increased $55.0 million, or 35.8%, from December 31, 2015 to September 30, 2016, were
utilized to fund the investment purchases.  

Core
deposits increased $97.0 million, or 22.0%, to $537.5 million at September 30, 2016 from $440.5 million at December 31, 2015,
including $40.6 million of core deposits related to the Old Town acquisition. Excluding $48.1 million of certificates of deposit
acquired from Old Town Bank, certificates of deposit decreased $24.5 million, or 8.9%, to $299.8 million at September 30, 2016.
Core deposits now represent 64% of the Company s deposit portfolio compared to 61% at December 31, 2015.  

Total
equity increased $6.7 million, or 5.1%, to $138.2 million at September 30, 2016 compared to $131.5 million at December 31, 2015.
This increase was primarily attributable to $4.0 million of net income, a $3.4 million improvement in the market value of investment
securities, and $0.7 million of stock-based compensation partially offset by $1.4 million of share repurchases. The Company intends
to selectively utilize share repurchases to supplement shareholder returns, but not at the expense of building long term value.
Notwithstanding the $0.55 per share dilution arising from the Old Town acquisition, tangible book value per share increased $1.02,
or 5.1%, to $20.90 at September 30, 2016 from $19.88 at December 31, 2015.  

Cash
and Cash Equivalents   

Total
cash and cash equivalents increased $21.4 million, or 52.6%, to $62.0 million at September 30, 2016 from $40.7 million at December
31, 2015.  

Investment
Securities   

During
the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company funded a trading account which is held in a Rabbi trust to generate returns that seek
to offset changes in liabilities of certain deferred compensation agreements.  

The
following table presents the holdings of our trading account as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:  

The
Company s held-to-maturity investment portfolio was transferred to available-for-sale during the third quarter of 2016 in
order to provide the Company more flexibility managing its investment portfolio. As a result of the transfer, the Company is prohibited
from classifying any investment securities as held to maturity for two years from the date of the transfer.  

Available-for-sale
securities are carried at fair value. The following table shows the amortized cost and fair value for our available-for-sale investment
portfolio at the dates indicated.  

48  

Available-for-sale
investment securities increased $53.4 million, or 22.4%, excluding the $30.4 million transfer from the held-to-maturity portfolio,
to $322.7 million at September 30, 2016, from $238.9 million at December 31, 2015. We continue to grow our investment portfolio
as we seek to better leverage our capital.  

Held-to-maturity
investment securities are carried at amortized cost. The following table shows the amortized cost and fair value of our held-to-maturity
investment portfolio as of December 31, 2015.

prior years, the Company reclassified certain municipal securities from available-for-sale to held-to-maturity. The reclassifications
remained in effect until the investments were called, matured, or reclassified back to available-for-sale. The difference between
the book values and fair values at the date of the transfer continued to be reported in a separate component of accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss), and were amortized into income over the remaining life of the securities (or reclassification back
to available-for-sale) as an adjustment of yield in a manner consistent with the amortization of a premium. Concurrently, the
revised book values of the transferred securities (represented by the market value on the date of transfer) were amortizing back
to their par values over the remaining life of the securities (or reclassification back to available-for-sale) as an adjustment
of yield in a manner consistent with the amortization of a discount. All held-to-maturity securities were reclassified as available-for-sale
and carried at fair value during the third quarter of 2016. At the time of the transfer the remaining unamortized amount in AOCI
was offset by the remaining discount of the revised book values.

Loans   

The
following table presents our loan portfolio composition and the corresponding percentage of total loans as of the dates indicated.
Other construction and land loans include residential acquisition and development loans, commercial undeveloped land and one-
to four-family improved and unimproved lots. Commercial real estate includes non-residential owner occupied and non-owner occupied
real estate, multi-family, and owner-occupied investment property. Commercial business loans include unsecured commercial loans
and commercial loans secured by business assets.  

Net
loans increased $103.3 million, or 16.6%, to $727.4 million at September 30, 2016 from $624.1 million at December 31, 2015 primarily
as the result of the Old Town acquisition. In addition, we have continued to experience moderate loan demand and maintain a strong
pipeline going into the fourth quarter. We believe that economic conditions in our primary market areas are strong and present
opportunities for continued growth. The amount of commercial real estate loans as a percentage of total loans continues to increase
as we continue to shift our lending focus to these loan types as we develop stronger commercial relationships in all of our markets.  

Included
in loans receivable and other borrowings at September 30, 2016 are $2.6 million in participated loans that did not qualify for
sale accounting. Interest expense on the other borrowings accrues at the same rate as the interest income recognized on the loans
receivable, resulting in no effect to net income.  

Delinquent
Loans   

When
a loan becomes 15 days past due, we contact the borrower to inquire as to why the loan is past due. When a loan becomes 30 days
or more past due, we increase collection efforts to include all available forms of communication. Once a loan becomes 45 days
past due, we generally issue a demand letter and further explore the reasons for non-repayment, discuss repayment options, and
inspect the collateral. In the event the loan officer or collections staff has reason to believe restructuring will be mutually
beneficial to the borrower and the Bank, the borrower will be referred to the Bank s Credit Administration staff to explore
restructuring alternatives to foreclosure. Once the demand period has expired and it has been determined that restructuring is
not a viable option, the Bank s counsel is instructed to pursue foreclosure.  

50  

The
accrual of interest on loans is discontinued at the time a loan becomes 90 days delinquent or when it becomes impaired, whichever
occurs first, unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection. All interest accrued but not collected for loans
that are placed on nonaccrual is reversed. Interest payments received on nonaccrual loans are generally applied as a direct reduction
to the principal outstanding until the loan is returned to accrual status. Interest payments received on nonaccrual loans may
be recognized as income on a cash basis if recovery of the remaining principal is reasonably assured. Loans are returned to accrual
status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured.
Interest payments applied to principal while the loan was on nonaccrual may be recognized in income over the remaining life of
the loan after the loan is returned to accrual status.  

If
a loan is modified in a TDR, the loan is generally placed on non-accrual until there is a period of satisfactory payment performance
by the borrower (either immediately before or after the restructuring), generally six consecutive months, and the ultimate collectability
of all amounts contractually due is not in doubt.  

The
following table sets forth certain information with respect to our loan portfolio delinquencies at the dates indicated. We have
no loans past due 90 days and over that are still accruing interest as of September 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015.  

Total
delinquency as a percentage of total loans declined from 2.01% at December 31, 2015, to 1.84% at September 30, 2016. Despite
the slight increase in 90 days and over delinquencies from 0.37% at December 31, 2015, to 0.56% as of September 30, 2016, our
level of delinquent loans remains low.  

51  

Non-Performing
Assets   

Non-performing
loans include all loans past due 90 days and over, certain impaired loans (some of which may be contractually current), and TDR
loans that have not yet established a satisfactory period of payment performance (some of which may be contractually current).
Non-performing assets include non-performing loans and real estate owned ( REO ). The table below sets forth the amounts
and categories of our non-performing assets at the dates indicated.  

Non-performing
loans as a percentage of total loans declined from 1.17% to 0.98% as of December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2016, respectively.
The decline is primarily related to the early payoff of $2.6 million of delinquencies in the third quarter of 2016.  

Non-performing
assets as a percentage of total assets declined from 1.23% to 0.96% as of December 31, 2015 and September 30, 2016,
respectively primarily as a result of the early payoff of non-performing loans mentioned above combined with the sale of
foreclosed commercial real estate.  

52  

Classification
of Loans   

The
following table sets forth amounts of classified and criticized loans at the dates indicated. As indicated in the table, loans
classified as  doubtful  or  loss  are charged off immediately.  

Total
classified loans decreased $4.3 million, or 24.4%, to $13.2 million at September 30, 2016 from $17.5 million at December 31,
2015. Total criticized loans decreased $4.9 million, or 13.3%, to $31.8 million at September 30, 2016 from $36.7 million at
December 31, 2015. These decreases were primarily attributable to the upgrades of certain classified loans after sustained
performance improvement or collateral enhancement. Management continues to dedicate significant resources to monitoring and
resolving classified and criticized loans.  

Allowance
for Loan Losses   

The
allowance for loan losses reflects our estimates of probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio at the balance sheet date.
The allowance for loan losses is evaluated on a regular basis by management and is based upon management s periodic review
of the collectability of our loans in light of historical experience, the nature and volume of our loan portfolio, adverse situations
that may affect our borrowers  abilities to repay, the estimated value of any underlying collateral and prevailing economic
conditions. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as
more information becomes available. The methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses has two main components: the
evaluation of individual loans for impairment and the evaluation of certain groups of homogeneous loans with similar risk characteristics.  

A
loan is considered impaired when it is probable that we will be unable to collect all principal and interest payments due according
to the original contractual terms of the loan. We individually evaluate loans classified as  substandard  or nonaccrual
and greater than $350,000 for impairment. If the impaired loan is considered collateral dependent, a charge-off is taken based
upon the appraised value of the property (less an estimate of selling costs if foreclosure or sale of the property is anticipated).
If the impaired loan is not collateral dependent, a specific reserve is established based upon an estimate of the future discounted
cash flows after consideration of modifications and the likelihood of future default and prepayment.  

The
allowance for homogenous loans consists of a base loss reserve and a qualitative reserve. The base loss reserve utilizes an average
loss rate for the last 16 quarters. The loss rates for the base loss reserve are segmented into 13 loan categories and contain
loss rates ranging from approximately 0.25% to 11%.  

The
qualitative reserve adjusts the weighted average loss rates utilized in the base loss reserve for trends in the following internal
and external factors:  

Non-accrual
and classified loans  

Collateral
values  

Loan
concentrations  

Economic
conditions   including unemployment rates, building permits, and a regional economic index.  

Qualitative
reserve adjustment factors are decreased for favorable trends and increased for unfavorable trends. These factors are subject
to further adjustment as economic and other conditions change.  

53  

The
following table sets forth activity in our allowance for loan losses at the dates and for the periods indicated.  

We
have continued to experience limited charge-off amounts and stable collections of amounts previously charged-off. The overall
historical loss rate used in our allowance for loan losses calculation continues to decline as previous quarters with larger loss
rates are eliminated from the calculation as time passes. Our coverage ratio of non-performing loans remained strong at 127.67%
at September 30, 2016 compared to 126.73% at September 30, 2015 and 129.96% at December 31, 2015.  

54  

Real
Estate Owned (REO)   

The
table below summarizes the balances and activity in REO at the dates and for the periods indicated.  

REO
decreased $0.8 million, or 14.0%, to $4.6 million at September 30, 2016 compared to $5.4 million at December 31, 2015. Most of
the transfers to real estate owned during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 were 1-4 family residential properties
which are normally sold at a faster pace than other property types. We have experienced a significant decrease in the number and
dollar amount of additions to REO, and have had moderate success in liquidating REO. Our policy continues to be to aggressively
market REO for sale, including recording write-downs when necessary.  

Net
Deferred Tax Assets   

Deferred
income tax assets and liabilities are determined using the asset and liability method and are reported net in the Consolidated
Balance Sheets. Under this method, the net deferred tax asset or liability is based on the tax effects of the differences between
the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities and recognizes enacted changes in tax rate and laws. When deferred tax assets
are recognized, they are subject to a valuation allowance based on management s judgment as to whether realization is more
likely than not. In determining the need for a valuation allowance, we considered the following sources of taxable income:  

Future
reversals of existing taxable temporary differences;  

Future
taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carry forwards;  

Taxable
income in prior carryback years; and  

Tax
planning strategies that would, if necessary, be implemented.  

Net
deferred tax assets decreased $3.5 million, or 18.3%, to $15.4 million at September 30, 2016 compared to $18.8 million at December
31, 2015. The decrease in net deferred tax assets is mainly attributable to reductions in our federal and state net operating
losses and changes in the net unrealized holding gains/losses on our investment securities.  

55  

Deposits   

The
following table presents deposits by category and percentage of total deposits as of the dates indicated.  

Total
deposits increased $120.7 million, or 16.8%, to $837.3 million at September 30, 2016 from $716.6 million at December 31, 2015
primarily as a result of the Old Town acquired deposits of approximately $88.7 million. We continue our efforts to reduce our
reliance on time deposits and expand our core deposit relationships which is evidenced by the decrease in time deposits as a percentage
of total deposits to 35.8% at September 30, 2016 from 38.5% at December 31, 2015.  

FHLB
Advances   

FHLB
advances increased $55.0 million, or 35.8%, to $208.5 million at September 30, 2016 compared to $153.5 million at December 31,
2015. The additional funds were primarily used to invest in investment securities and to provide funding for future cash needs.
The advances had a weighted average rate of 0.75% as of September 30, 2016 compared to 0.65% at December 31, 2015. To manage our
exposure to interest rate movement, we entered into an interest rate swap in September 2016. The swap contract involves the payment
of fixed-rate amounts to a counterparty in exchange for our receipt of variable-rate payments over the two year life of the contract.
The effective interest rate of the swap was 0.75% at September 30, 2016.  

Junior
Subordinated Notes   

We
had $14.4 million in junior subordinated notes outstanding at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 payable to an unconsolidated
subsidiary. These notes accrue interest at 2.80% above the 90-day LIBOR, adjusted quarterly. To add stability to net interest
revenue and manage our exposure to interest rate movement, we entered into an interest rate swap in June 2016. The swap contract
involves the payment of fixed-rate amounts to a counterparty in exchange for our receipt of variable-rate payments over the four
year life of the contract. The effective interest rate was 3.76% and 3.34% at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  

Equity   

Total
equity increased $6.7 million, or 5.1%, to $138.2 million at September 30, 2016 compared to $131.5 million at December 31, 2015.
This increase was primarily attributable to $4.0 million of net income, a $3.4 million improvement in the market value of investment
securities, and $0.7 million of stock-based compensation partially offset by $1.4 million of share repurchases.  

56  

Comparison
of Operating Results for the Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015.   

General.
  Net income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was $1.8 million compared to $2.2 million for the same period
in 2015. The decrease in net income was the result of increases in compensation and benefits of $0.9 million, net occupancy of
$0.2 million, marketing and advertising of $0.2 million, data processing of $0.1 million and merger expenses of $0.1 million related
to the acquisition and integration of Old Town combined with an increase in income tax expense of $0.7 million. The increase in
the income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 relates primarily
to the reduction in the North Carolina corporate income tax rate as well as the write-off of certain residual amounts recorded
prior to the reversal of the valuation allowance on its net deferred tax asset. This decrease was partially offset by a $1.9 million
increase in net interest income and an increase of $0.3 million in noninterest income during the 2016 period, as compared to the
same period in 2015.  

Net
Interest Income.   Net interest income increased $1.9 million, or 26.4%, to $8.9 million for the three months ended September
30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. The increase in net interest income for the period was primarily the result of increases
in interest and fee income on loans of $1.6 million.  

The
tax-equivalent net interest margin increased to 3.29% for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 compared to 3.13% for the same
period in 2015. The increase was primarily the result of increased yields on taxable loans and investments and decreased rates
on deposits.  

57  

The
following table sets forth the average balances of assets and liabilities, the total dollar amounts of interest income and dividends
from average interest-earning assets on a tax-equivalent basis, the total dollar amounts of interest expense on average interest-bearing
liabilities, and the resulting annualized average tax-equivalent yields and cost for the periods indicated. All average balances
are daily average balances. Non-accrual loans were included in the computation of average balances, but have been reflected in
the table as loans carrying a zero yield. The yields set forth below include the effect of deferred fees, discounts and premiums
that are amortized or accreted to interest income or expense.  

(1)
Tax exempt loans and investments are calculated giving effect to a 35% federal tax rate.  

  (2)
Net interest-earning assets represents total interest-earning assets less total interest-bearing liabilities.  

  (3)
Tax-equivalent net interest rate spread represents the difference between the tax equivalent yield on average interest-earning
assets and the cost of average interest-bearing liabilities.  

  (4)
Tax-equivalent net interest margin represents tax equivalent net interest income divided by average total interest-earning assets.  

58  

The
following table presents the effects of changing rates and volumes on our net interest income for the periods indicated. The rate
column shows the effects attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume). The volume column shows
the effects attributable to change in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate). The total column represents the sum
of the prior columns. For purposes of this table, changes attributable to both rate and volume, which cannot be segregated, have
been allocated proportionately, based on changes due to rate and the changes due to volume.  

(1)
Non-accrual loans are included in the above analysis.  

  (2)
Interest income on tax exempt loans and investments are adjusted for based on a 35% federal tax rate  

Net
interest income before provision for loan losses increased to $8.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared
to $7.0 million for the same period in 2015. As indicated in the table above $1.9 million of the increase is attributable to increased
volume and the remaining $0.2 million improvement in net interest earned is attributable to an improvement in rates.  

The
increase in tax-equivalent net interest income of $1.9 million related to volume was primarily the result of higher average taxable
loan balances and tax exempt investment securities which increased $126.5 million and $57.7 million respectively, for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 primarily as a result of the Old Town acquisition. The
increase in average loan and investment balances was partially offset by higher average deposits and FHLB advance balances which
increased $107.6 million and $72.8 million, respectively, over the same periods. While the average deposit growth was primarily
attributable to the Old Town acquisition, the increase in average FHLB advances was a result of a leverage strategy to fund investment
purchases.  

59  

The
increase in tax-equivalent net interest income of $0.2 million related to rate was primarily the result of increased yields on
taxable loans and decreased time deposit rates partially offset by decreased tax exempt investment yields. The decrease in average
tax exempt investment yields was offset by the impact of lower average time deposit yields which decreased 19 basis points to
0.97% in the quarter ended September 30, 2016 as compared to 1.16% in the three months ending September 30, 2015.  

Our
tax-equivalent net interest rate spread increased by 18 basis points to 3.17% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared
to 2.99% for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Our tax-equivalent net interest margin increased 16 basis points to 3.29%
for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to 3.13% for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increases
in our interest rate spread and margin were primarily a result of decreased rates on time deposits and increases in loan yields.  

Provision
for Loan Losses.   We recorded a provision for loan losses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 of $0.1 million
compared to no provision for loan losses for the same period in 2015. We are experiencing continued stabilization in asset quality,
low charge off amounts, and a continued decline in the overall loss rates used in our allowance for loan losses model.  

Noninterest
Income.   The following table summarizes the components of noninterest income and the corresponding change between the three
month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:  

The
$0.1 million net decrease in servicing income was primarily the result of the valuation impact of the corresponding loan servicing
rights compared to the prior year period.  

The
$0.1 million increase in mortgage banking income was primarily due to increased volume.  

Gains
on sales of SBA loans decreased $0.3 million as a result of a fewer SBA loans being sold during the 2016 period. We continue to
focus on our SBA lending efforts.  

Net
gains on sales of investments increased $0.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months
ended September 30, 2015 due a decrease in interest rates which provided favorable market conditions.  

Increases
in service charges on deposit accounts and interchange fees totaling $0.1 million are the result of increased core deposit accounts
and the acquisition of approximately $88.7 million in deposits from Old Town.  

60  

Noninterest
Expense.   The following table summarizes the components of noninterest expense and the corresponding change between the
three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:  

Compensation
and employee benefits increased by $0.9 million, or 26.8%, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three
months ended September 30, 2015. This additional expense is related to increases in our number of employees primarily as a result
of the addition of three new branches, the Old Town Bank acquisition, annual raises, employee benefits, incentives and commissions.  

Net
occupancy increased $0.2 million, or 26.6%, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September
30, 2015 due primarily to the addition of three new branches and the Old Town acquisition.  

Marketing
and advertising expenses increased $0.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015
due primarily to increased advertising in the Upstate South Carolina market.  

Data
processing increased $0.1 million, or 31.0%, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended
September 30, 2015 due primarily to the Old Town acquisition.  

Merger-related
expenses were $0.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to none during the 2015 period. The expenses
during the period related to the Old Town acquisition.  

Other
noninterest expense increased $0.3 million, or 31.0%, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period
in 2015 primarily as the result of increases in directors stock-based benefits of $0.2 million as part of the 2015 Long-term Stock
Incentive Plan and telecommunication expense of $0.2 million partially offset by reduced franchise taxes of $0.1 million.  

Income
Taxes.   We recorded $1.2 million of income tax expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $0.5
million income tax expense in the same period of 2015. The increase of $0.7 million in the income tax expense for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 relates primarily to the reduction in the North Carolina corporate
income tax rate as well as the write-off of certain residual amounts recorded prior to the reversal of the valuation allowance
on its net deferred tax asset. We remain focused on reducing our effective tax rate through further investments in tax-free municipal
securities, BOLI and affordable housing tax credits.  

We
continue to be in a net operating loss position for federal and state income tax purposes and do not have a material current tax
liability or receivable.  

Comparison
of Operating Results for the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015.   

General.
  Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $4.0 million compared to $21.9 million for the same period
in 2015. The decrease in net income for the nine month period was primarily a result of a non-cash income tax benefit resulting
from the $19.0 million reversal of substantially all of the valuation allowance on the Company s net deferred tax asset
and a negative provision for loan losses of $1.5 million in 2015. These items were partially offset by an increase in net interest
income of $5.3 million and an increase in noninterest income of $1.6 million partially offset by an increase in noninterest expense
of $3.5 million during the nine months ending September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015.  

61  

Net
Interest Income.   Net interest income before provision for loan losses increased to $25.3 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, compared to $20.0 million for the same period in 2015. The increase in net interest income was primarily the
result of an increase of $4.1 million of interest and fees on loans combined with declines in interest expense on deposits of
$0.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015.  

The
tax-equivalent net interest margin increased to 3.28% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 3.08% for the same
period in 2015. This increase was primarily the result of increased yields on taxable investments combined with declines in time
deposit and FHLB advance rates for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  

62  

The
following table sets forth the average balances of assets and liabilities, the total dollar amounts of interest income and dividends
from average interest-earning assets on a tax-equivalent basis, the total dollar amounts of interest expense on average interest-bearing
liabilities, and the resulting annualized average tax-equivalent yields and cost for the periods indicated. All average balances
are daily average balances. Non-accrual loans were included in the computation of average balances, but have been reflected in
the table as loans carrying a zero yield. The yields set forth below include the effect of deferred fees, discounts and premiums
that are amortized or accreted to interest income or expense.  

(1)
Tax exempt loans and investments are calculated giving effect to a 35% federal tax rate.  

  (2)
Net interest-earning assets represents total interest-earning assets less total interest-bearing liabilities.  

  (3)
Tax-equivalent net interest rate spread represents the difference between the tax equivalent yield on average interest-earning
assets and the cost of average interest-bearing liabilities.  

  (4)
Tax-equivalent net interest margin represents tax equivalent net interest income divided by average total interest-earning assets.  

63  

The following table presents the
effects of changing rates and volumes on our net interest income for the periods indicated. The rate column shows the effects attributable
to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume). The volume column shows the effects attributable to change in
volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate). The total column represents the sum of the prior columns. For purposes of
this table, changes attributable to both rate and volume, which cannot be segregated, have been allocated proportionately, based
on changes due to rate and the changes due to volume. 

(1)
Non-accrual loans are included in the above analysis.  

  (2)
Interest income on tax exempt loans and investments are adjusted for based on a 35% federal tax rate  

Net interest income before provision
for loan losses increased to $25.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $20.0 million for the same
period in 2015. As indicated in the table above, $5.1 million of the increase is attributable to increased volume, and the remaining
$0.5 million improvement is the result of improved rates mainly for time deposits and FHLB advances. 

The increase in tax-equivalent net
interest income of $5.1 million related to volume was primarily the result of higher average loan and tax exempt investment balances
which increased $115.5 million and $37.2 million, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the
same period in 2015. The increase in average loan and investment balances was partially offset by higher average money market accounts
and FHLB advance balances which increased $47.2 million and $85.8 million, respectively, over the same periods. 

The increase in tax-equivalent net
interest income of $0.5 million related to rate was primarily the result of reduced rates on time deposits and FHLB advances of
21 basis points and 15 basis points, respectively. The reduced rates on average loans and tax exempt investments of 4 basis points
and 219 basis points, respectively, for the nine months period ending September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 was
partially offset by an increased rate on average taxable investments of 13 basis points for the same period. 

64  

Our tax-equivalent net interest
rate spread increased by 24 basis points to 3.16% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 2.92% for the nine months
ended September 30, 2015. Our tax-equivalent net interest margin increased 20 basis points to 3.28% for the nine months ended September
30, 2016, compared to 3.08% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. As mentioned above, the increases in our interest rate
spread and margin were primarily a result of the increases in taxable investment yields and reduced rate on time deposits and FHLB
advances. 

Provision for Loan Losses.  
The Company continues to experience a low level of net charge-offs and non-performing assets. As such, a provision for loan losses
of $0.1 million was recorded for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016. The reversal of the provision for loan losses
for the same period in 2015 was the result of improved asset quality and reduced loss rates during the period. 

Noninterest Income.  
The following table summarizes the components of noninterest income and the corresponding change between the nine month periods
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

Mortgage banking income increased
$0.1 million primarily as a result of increased loan volume. 

Gains on sales of SBA loans increased
$0.1 million as a result of a larger balance of SBA loans being sold during the 2016 period as we continue to increase our SBA
lending efforts. 

Net gains on sales of investments
increased $0.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015 due to
a significant drop in interest rates which provided for favorable market conditions for sales. 

Service charges on deposit
accounts and interchange fees increased $0.2 million and $0.1 million, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30,
2016, compared to the same period in 2015 primarily as a result of the Old Town acquisition and a continued focus on core
deposits. 

Other noninterest income increased
$0.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015 primarily as a result of increases
in trading securities revenue. 

65  

Noninterest Expense.  
The following table summarizes the components of noninterest expense and the corresponding change between the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

Compensation and employee benefits
increased $1.7 million, or 15.7%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. This additional
expense is related to increases in our number of employees primarily as a result of the addition of three new branches and the
Old Town acquisition, annual raises, employee benefits, incentives and commissions. 

Net occupancy increased $0.4
million, or 19.1%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 primarily as the
result of the addition of three branches and the Old Town acquisition. During the second quarter of 2015, we prepaid a $15.0
million FHLB advance and incurred a prepayment penalty of $1.8 million. 

Marketing and advertising expenses
increased $0.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. The increase is primarily
the result of increased advertising in the Upstate  South Carolina market. 

FDIC deposit insurance decreased
$0.3 million, or 36.9%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015 as a
result of a reduction in our assessment rates due to an improving risk profile. 

Merger-related expenses of $2.0
million related primarily to the Old Town acquisition. 

Other noninterest expense increased
$0.6 million, or 21.0%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 primarily as the result
of increases in directors stock-based benefits of $0.2 million as part of the 2015 Long-term Stock Incentive Plan and telecommunication
expense of $0.2 million partially offset by reduced franchise taxes of $0.2 million. 

Income Taxes.   We recorded
a $2.8 million income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to a $16.9 million income tax benefit for
the nine months ended September 30, 2015. As mentioned above, the reversal of $19.0 million in deferred tax asset valuation allowance
resulted in the tax benefit for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. We continue to be in a net operating loss position for
federal and state income tax purposes and do not have a material current tax liability or receivable. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

Liquidity is the ability to meet
current and future financial obligations. Our primary sources of funds consist of deposit inflows, loan repayments, advances from
the FHLB, proceeds from the sale of loans originated for sale, and principal repayments and the sale of available-for-sale securities.
While maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and mortgage
prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions and competition. Our Asset/Liability Management
Committee, under the direction of our Chief Financial Officer, is responsible for establishing and monitoring our liquidity targets
and strategies in order to ensure that sufficient liquidity exists for meeting the borrowing needs and deposit withdrawals of our
customers as well as unanticipated contingencies. We believe that we have enough sources of liquidity to satisfy our short- and
long-term liquidity needs as of September 30, 2016. 

66  

We regularly monitor and adjust
our investments in liquid assets based upon our assessment of expected loan demand, expected deposit flows and borrowing maturities,
yields available on interest-earning deposits and securities, and the objectives of our asset/liability management program. Excess
liquid assets are invested generally in FHLB and FRB interest-earning deposits and investment securities and are also used to pay
off short-term borrowings. At September 30, 2016, cash and cash equivalents totaled $62.0 million. Included in this total was $43.6
million held at FRB and $6.0 million held at the FHLB in interest-earning accounts. 

Our cash flows are derived from
operating activities, investing activities and financing activities as reported in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included
in our Consolidated Financial Statements. The following summarizes the most significant sources and uses of liquidity during the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015: 

At September 30, 2016, we had $42.8
million in outstanding commitments to originate loans. In addition to commitments to originate loans, we had $104.6 million in
unused lines of credit. 

Depending on market conditions,
we may be required to pay higher rates on our deposits or other borrowings than we currently pay on certificates of deposit. Based
on historical experience and current market interest rates, we anticipate that following their maturity we will retain a large
portion of our retail certificates of deposit with maturities of one year or less as of September 30, 2016. 

In addition to loans, we invest
in securities that provide a source of liquidity, both through repayments and as collateral for borrowings. Our securities portfolio
includes both callable securities (which allow the issuer to exercise call options) and mortgage-backed securities (which allow
borrowers to prepay loans). Accordingly, a decline in interest rates would likely prompt issuers to exercise call options and borrowers
to prepay higher-rate loans, producing higher than otherwise scheduled cash flows. 

Liquidity management is both a daily
and long-term function of management. If we require more funds than we are able to generate locally, we have borrowing agreements
with the FHLB and the FRB discount window. The following summarizes our borrowing capacity as of September 30, 2016: 

67  

In addition to the amounts noted
in the table above, we have the ability to pledge additional loans and increase our borrowing capacity with the FHLB. 

In July 2013, federal bank regulatory
agencies issued final rules to revise their risk-based capital requirements and the method for calculating risk-weighted assets
to make them consistent with agreements that were reached by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain provisions
of the Dodd-Frank Act ( Basel III ). On January 1, 2015, the Basel III rules became effective and include transition
provisions which implement certain portions of the rules through January 1, 2019. 

The rule also includes changes in
what constitutes regulatory capital, some of which are subject to a transition period. These changes include the phasing-out of
certain instruments as qualifying capital. In addition, Tier 2 capital is no longer limited to the amount of Tier 1 capital included
in total capital. Mortgage servicing rights, certain deferred tax assets and investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries over designated
percentages of common stock are required to be deducted from capital, subject to a transition period. Finally, common equity Tier
1 capital includes accumulated other comprehensive income (which includes all unrealized gains and losses on available for sale
debt and equity securities), subject to a transition period and a one-time opt-out election. The Bank elected to opt-out of this
provision. As such, accumulated comprehensive income is not included in the Bank s Tier 1 capital. 

The Bank is subject to various regulatory
capital requirements, including a risk-based capital measure. The risk-based guidelines and framework under prompt corrective action
provisions include both a definition of capital and a framework for calculating risk-weighted assets by assigning balance sheet
assets and off-balance sheet items to broad risk categories. 

Beginning on January 1, 2016, the
Company and its subsidiary bank must maintain a capital conservation buffer to avoid restrictions on capital distributions or discretionary
bonus payments. This buffer must consist solely of Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, but the buffer applies to all three measurements
(Common Equity Tier 1, Tier 1 capital and total capital) in addition to the minimum risk-based capital requirements. The capital
conservation buffer required for 2016 is common equity equal to .625% of risk-weighted assets and will increase by .625% per year
until reaching 2.5% beginning January 1, 2019. 

The tables below summarize capital
ratios and related information in accordance with Basel III as measured at September 30, 2016 and pre-existing rules at December
31, 2015. 

The following table summarizes the
required and actual capital ratios of the Bank as of the dates indicated:

The Company exceeded its regulatory capital ratios at
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, as set forth in the following table:

Item
3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK   

One of the most significant forms
of market risk is interest rate risk because, as a financial institution, the majority of our assets and liabilities are sensitive
to changes in interest rates. Interest rate fluctuations affect earnings by changing net interest income and other interest  sensitive
income and expense levels. Interest rate changes affect economic value of equity ( EVE ) by changing the net present
value of a bank s future cash flows, and the cash flows themselves as rates change. Accepting this risk is a normal part
of banking and can be an important source of profitability and shareholder value. However, excessive risk can threaten a bank s
earnings, capital, liquidity and solvency. Therefore, a principal part of our operations is to manage interest rate risk and limit
the exposure of our net interest income to changes in market interest rates. The Board of Directors of the Bank have established
an Asset/Liability Management Committee ( ALCO ), which is responsible for evaluating the interest rate risk inherent
in our assets and liabilities, for determining the level of risk that is appropriate, given our business strategy, operating environment,
capital, liquidity and performance objectives, and for managing this risk consistent with the guidelines approved by the Board.
Our ALCO monitors and manages market risk through rate shock analyses, economic value of equity, or EVE, analyses and simulations
in order to avoid unacceptable earnings and market value fluctuations due to changes in interest rates. 

One of the primary ways we manage
interest rate risk is by selling the majority of our long-term fixed rate mortgages into the secondary markets, and obtaining commitments
to sell at locked-in interest rates prior to issuing a loan commitment. From a funding perspective, we expect to satisfy the majority
of our future requirements with retail deposit growth, including checking and savings accounts, money market accounts and certificates
of deposit generated within our primary markets. If our funding needs exceed our deposits, we will utilize our excess funding capacity
with the FHLB and the FRB. 

We have taken the following steps
to reduce our interest rate risk: 

increased our personal and business checking accounts
and our money market accounts, which are less rate-sensitive than certificates of deposit and which provide us with a stable,
low-cost source of funds; 

limited the fixed rate period on loans within our
portfolio; 

utilized our securities portfolio for positioning
based on projected interest rate environments; 

priced certificates of deposit to encourage customers
to extend to longer terms; 

increased our level of variable-rate investments and
loans; 

utilized FHLB advances for positioning; and 

engaged in an interest rate swap to hedge interest
expense related to the junior subordinated debt. 

Economic Value of Equity (EVE)

EVE is the difference between the
present value of an institution s assets and liabilities (the institution s EVE) that would change in the event of
a range of assumed changes in market interest rates. EVE is used to monitor interest rate risk beyond the 12 month time horizon
of income simulations. The simulation model uses a discounted cash flow analysis and an option-based pricing approach to measure
the interest rate sensitivity of EVE. The model estimates the economic value of each type of asset, liability and off-balance sheet
contract using the current interest rate yield curve with instantaneous increases or decreases of 100 to 400 basis points in 100
basis point increments. A basis point equals one-hundredth of one percent, and 100 basis points equals one percent. An increase
in interest rates from 3% to 4% would mean, for example, a 100 basis point increase in the  Change in Interest Rates 
column below. Given the current relatively low level of market interest rates, an EVE calculation for an interest rate decrease
of greater than 100 basis points has not been prepared. 

70  

Certain shortcomings are inherent
in the methodologies used in determining interest rate risk through changes in EVE. Modeling changes in EVE require making certain
assumptions that may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs, or loan repayments and deposit decay, respond
to changes in market interest rates. In this regard, the EVE information presented assumes that the composition of our interest-sensitive
assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and assumes that a
particular change in interest rates is reflected across the yield curve regardless of the duration or repricing of specific assets
and liabilities. Accordingly, although the EVE information provides an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular
point in time, such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest
rates on our net interest income and will differ from actual results. 

Net Interest Income   

In addition to an EVE analysis,
we analyze the impact of changing rates on our net interest income. Using our balance sheet as of a given date, we analyze the
repricing components of individual assets, and adjusting for changes in interest rates at 100 basis point increments, we analyze
the impact on our net interest income. Changes to our net interest income are shown in the following table based on immediate changes
to interest rates in 100 basis point increments. 

The table below reflects the impact
of an immediate change in interest rates in 100 basis point increments on Pretax Net Interest Income (NII) and Economic Value of
Equity (EVE). 

The results from the rate shock
analysis on NII are consistent with having a slightly liability sensitive balance sheet. Having a liability sensitive balance sheet
means liabilities will reprice at a faster pace than assets during the short-term horizon. The implications of a liability sensitive
balance sheet will differ depending upon the change in market rates. For example, with a liability sensitive balance sheet in a
declining interest rate environment, the interest rate on liabilities will decrease at a faster pace than assets. This situation
generally results in an increase in NII and operating income. Conversely, with a liability sensitive balance sheet in a rising
interest rate environment, the interest rate on liabilities will increase at a faster pace than assets. This situation generally
results in a decrease in NII and operating income. As indicated in the table above, a 200 basis point increase in rates would result
in a 0.3% increase in NII as of September 30, 2016 as compared to a 2.0% increase in NII as of December 31, 2015, suggesting that
the Company s exposure to the benefit of rising interest rates has decreased slightly since December 31, 2015. The Company
generally seeks to remain neutral to the impact of changes in interest rates by maximizing current earnings while balancing the
risk of changes in interest rates. 

The results from the rate shock
analysis on EVE are consistent with a balance sheet whose assets have a longer maturity than its liabilities. Like most financial
institutions, we generally invest in longer maturity assets as compared to our liabilities in order to earn a higher return on
our assets than we pay on our liabilities. This is because interest rates generally increase as the time to maturity increases,
assuming a normal, upward sloping yield curve. In a rising interest rate environment, this results in a negative EVE because higher
interest rates will reduce the present value of longer term assets more than it will reduce the present value of shorter term liabilities,
resulting in a negative impact on equity. As noted in the table above, our exposure to higher interest rates from an EVE or present
value perspective has decreased from December 31, 2015 to September 30, 2016. For example, as indicated in the table above, a 200
basis point increase in rates would result in a 3.0% decrease in EVE as of September 30, 2016 as compared to a 9.1% decrease in
EVE as of December 31, 2015.
