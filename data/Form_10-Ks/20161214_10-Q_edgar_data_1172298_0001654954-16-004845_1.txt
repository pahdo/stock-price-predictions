PETRO RIVER OIL CORP. 

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 

(Unaudited) 

1. 

Organization 

Petro River Oil Corp. (the    Company   ) is an independent energy company focused
on the exploration and development of conventional oil and gas
assets with low discovery and development costs. The Company is
focused on taking advantage of the current downturn in oil prices
to enter highly prospective plays with industry-leading partners.
Diversification over a number of projects, each with low initial
capital expenditures and strong risk reward characteristics,
reduces risk and provides cross-functional exposure to a number of
attractive risk adjusted opportunities.  

The Company recently completed a reorganization, including the
addition of new management, the acquisition of several promising
new assets, and an infusion of cash. In connection with the
reorganization, the Company consummated the MegaWest Transaction,
defined below, in which Fortis Property Group, LLC
(   Fortis   ) and the Company plan to jointly develop
its acreage in Osage County, Oklahoma and other oil and gas
assets.  

The Company s core holdings are in the Mid-Continent Region
in Oklahoma and Larne Basin, Northern Ireland.  Following
the acquisition of Horizon I Investments, LLC
(   Horizon
Investments   ), the
Company now has exposure to a portfolio of several domestic and
international oil and gas assets consisting of highly prospective
conventional plays diversified across project type, geographic
location and risk profile, as well as access to a broad network of
industry leaders from Horizon Investment s 20% interest in
Horizon Energy Partners, LLC (   Horizon
Energy   ).  Horizon Energy is an oil and
gas exploration and development company owned and managed by former
senior oil and gas executives.  It has a portfolio of
domestic and international assets, including two assets located in
the United Kingdom, adjacent to the giant Wytch Farm oil field, the
largest onshore oil field in Western Europe.  Other
projects include the proposed redevelopment of a large oil field in
Kern County, California and the development of an additional recent
discovery in Kern County.  Each of the assets in the
Horizon Energy portfolio is characterized by low initial capital
expenditure requirements and strong risk reward
characteristics.  

In light of the challenging oil price environment and capital
markets, management is focusing on specific target acquisitions and
investments, limiting operating expenses and exploring farm-in and
joint venture opportunities for the Company s oil and gas
assets. No assurances can be given that management will be
successful.   

Certain Transactions and Recent Developments 

Reverse Stock Split.   At its Annual Meeting
held on September 20, 2016, the Company s shareholders
approved a resolution to authorize the Company s Board of
Directors, in its sole and absolute discretion, to amend the
Company s Certificate of Incorporation to implement a reverse
stock split of our common stock, at a ratio of not less than
1-for-2, and not greater than 1-for-10 (   Reverse
Split   ), within
one year from the date of the Annual Meeting, with the exact ratio
to be determined by the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors
has not determined the ratio, and does not currently intend to
execute the Reverse Split until such time as the Company lists its
shares of Common Stock on the NASDAQ Stock
Market.  

Spyglass Drilling Program.    On August 19, 2016, Spyglass Energy Group, LLC
(   Spyglass   ), a wholly owned subsidiary of Bandolier
Energy, LLC (   Bandolier   ), entered into a Joint Exploration and
Development Agreement (the    Exploration
Agreement   ) between
Spyglass, Phoenix 2016, LLC (   Phoenix   ) and Mackey Consulting   Leasing, LLC
(   Mackey   ).  Pursuant to the Exploration
Agreement, Phoenix and Mackey shall operate and provide certain
services, including obtaining permits and providing technical
services, at cost, in connection with a Phase I Development Program
as agreed to by the parties (the    Phase I
Program   ).  Phoenix and Mackey shall earn
a 25% working interest on all wells drilled in the Phase I
Program.  Following success and completion of the Phase I
Program, Phoenix and Mackey shall earn a 25% working interest in
the Osage County, Oklahoma Concession held by Spyglass. Under the
Exploration Agreement, Bandolier has agreed commit up to $2.1
million towards costs of the Phase I Program, at their sole
discretion.  

Divestiture of Missouri Properties.   Effective July 11,
2016, MegaWest Energy Missouri Corp (   MegaWest
Missouri   )   assigned
its leaseholds covering approximately 320 acres in Grassy Creek,
Missouri (the    Grassy Creek
Assets   ) to Paluca
Petroleum, Inc. (   Paluca   ) in furtherance of the Company s
corporate strategy to divest its legacy assets. Pursuant to the
terms and conditions of the assignment, Paluca agreed to assume all
liabilities associated with the Grassy Creek Assets and, as
consideration for the assignment, granted MegaWest Missouri an
overriding royalty interest equal to 4% of the value of all oil and
gas assets produced and sold under the assigned
lease.

MegaWest Transaction.    On October 15, 2015, the Company entered into a
contribution agreement (the    Contribution
Agreement   ) with MegaWest
Energy Kansas Corporation ( MegaWest ), and Fortis
Property Group, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company
(   Fortis   ), pursuant to which the Company and Fortis
each agreed to contribute certain assets to MegaWest in exchange
for shares of MegaWest common stock (   MegaWest
Shares   ) (the
   MegaWest
Transaction   ).  

Upon execution of the Contribution Agreement, (i) the Company
transferred its 50% membership interest in Bandolier (the 
  Bandolier
Interest   ), and cancelled
all of its ownership interest in the then issued and outstanding
MegaWest Shares, which prior to the MegaWest Transaction
represented 100% ownership of MegaWest; and (ii) Fortis transferred
certain indirect interests held in 30 condominium units and the
rights to any profits and proceeds
therefrom.  Immediately thereafter, MegaWest issued to
the Company 58,510 MegaWest Shares, representing a 58.51% equity
interest in MegaWest, as consideration for the assignment of the
Bandolier Interest, and issued to Fortis 41,490 MegaWest Shares,
representing a 41.49% equity interest in MegaWest, as consideration
for the assets assigned to MegaWest by Fortis.  The account
receivable and the Company s interest in real estate
reflected on the Company s balance sheet are assets held by
MegaWest, and are controlled by MegaWest s board of
directors, consisting of two members appointed by Fortis, and one
by the Company. The relative composition of the board of
directors of MegaWest shall continue as long as Fortis has an
equity interest in MegaWest.  

Subject to the terms and conditions of the Contribution Agreement,
the Contribution Agreement provided for a redetermination of the
fair market value of the Bandolier Interest at any time following
the six month anniversary after the execution thereof (the
   Redetermination   ),  Upon
a Redetermination, which has not occurred as of December 14, 2016,
in the event there is a shortfall from the valuation ascribed to
the Bandolier Interest at the time of the Redetermination, as
compared to the value ascribed to the Bandolier Interest in the
Contribution Agreement, the Company will be required to provide
Fortis with a cash payment in an amount equal to the
shortfall.  If the Company is unable to deliver to Fortis
the cash payment required after the Redetermination, if any, the
board of directors of MegaWest shall have the right to exercise
certain remedies against the Company, including a right to
foreclose on the Company s entire equity in MegaWest, which
equity interest has been pledged to Fortis under the terms of the
Contribution Agreement.  In the event of foreclosure, the
Bandolier Interest would revert back to the
Company.

Basis of Preparation 

The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial
statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and include
the accounts of the Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All
material intercompany balances and transactions have been
eliminated in consolidation. Non controlling interest
represents the minority equity investment in the Company s
subsidiaries, plus the minority investors  share of the net
operating results and other components of equity relating to the
non controlling interest. 

These unaudited consolidated financial statements include the
Company and the following subsidiaries: 

Petro Spring, LLC, PO1, LLC, Petro River UK Limited, Horizon I
Investments, LLC and MegaWest Energy USA Corp. and MegaWest Energy
USA Corp. s wholly owned subsidiaries: 

MegaWest Energy Texas Corp. 

MegaWest Energy Kentucky Corp. 

MegaWest Energy Missouri Corp. 

MegaWest Energy Montana Corp. 

Also contained in the unaudited consolidated financial statements
is the financial information of the Company s 58.51% owned
subsidiary, MegaWest, which pursuant to the Megawest Transaction
includes the Company s contribution of its 50% interest in
Bandolier Energy LLC.

The unaudited consolidated financial information furnished herein
reflects all adjustments, consisting solely of normal recurring
items, which in the opinion of management are necessary to fairly
state the financial position of the Company and the results of its
operations for the periods presented. This report should be read in
conjunction with the Company s consolidated financial
statements and notes thereto included in the Company s Form
10-K for the year ended April 30, 2016 filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (the    SEC   ) on July 29, 2016. The Company assumes
that the users of the interim financial information herein have
read or have access to the audited financial statements for the
preceding fiscal year and that the adequacy of additional
disclosure needed for a fair presentation may be determined in that
context. Accordingly, footnote disclosure, which would
substantially duplicate the disclosure contained in the
Company s Form 10-K for the year ended April 30, 2016 has
been omitted. The results of operations for the interim periods
presented are not necessarily indicative of results for the entire
year ending April 30, 2017.  

3. 

Significant Accounting Policies 

(a) 

Use of Estimates: 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ
from those estimates. 

The Company s financial statements are based on a number of
significant estimates, including oil and natural gas reserve
quantities which are the basis for the calculation of depreciation,
depletion and impairment of oil and natural gas properties, and
timing and costs associated with its asset retirement obligations,
as well as those related to the fair value of stock options, stock
warrants and stock issued for services. While we believe that our
estimates and assumptions used in preparation of the financial
statements are appropriate, actual results could differ from those
estimates. 

(b) 

Cash and Cash Equivalents: 

Cash and cash equivalents include all highly liquid monetary
instruments with original maturities of three months or less when
purchased. These investments are carried at cost, which
approximates fair value. Financial instruments that potentially
subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist
primarily of cash deposits. The Company maintains its cash in
institutions insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
(   FDIC   ). At times, the Company s cash and
cash equivalent balances may be uninsured or in amounts that exceed
the FDIC insurance limits.  

As of October 31, 2016 and April 30, 2016, restricted cash
consisted of a certificate of deposit in the amount of $80,803,
with an annual interest rate of 0.5% and maturity date of March 13,
2017. 

(c) 

Receivables: 

Pursuant to FASB ASC paragraph 310-10-35-47, receivables that
management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable
future shall be reported in the balance sheet at outstanding
principal adjusted for any charge-offs and the allowance for
doubtful accounts. The Company follows FASB ASC paragraphs
310-10-35-7 through 310-10-35-10 to estimate the allowance for
doubtful accounts. Pursuant to FASB ASC paragraph 310-10-35-9,
losses from uncollectible receivables shall be accrued when both of
the following conditions are met: (a) Information available before
the financial statements are issued or are available to be issued
(as discussed in Section 855-10-25) indicates that it is probable
that an asset has been impaired at the date of the financial
statements, and (b) The amount of the loss can be reasonably
estimated. These conditions may be considered in relation to
individual receivables or in relation to groups of similar types of
receivables. If the conditions are met, an accrual shall be made
even though the particular receivables that are uncollectible may
not be identifiable. The Company reviews individually each
receivable for collectability and performs on-going credit
evaluations of its customers and adjusts credit limits based upon
payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness,
as determined by the review of their current credit information;
and determines the allowance for doubtful accounts based on
historical write-off experience, customer specific facts and
general economic conditions that may affect a client s
ability to pay. Bad debt expense is included in general and
administrative expenses, if any. 

-6- 

Table
of Contents  

Pursuant to FASB ASC paragraph 310-10-35-41, Credit losses for
receivables (uncollectible receivables), which may be for all or
part of a particular receivable, shall be deducted from the
allowance. The related receivable balance shall be charged off in
the period in which the receivables are deemed uncollectible.
Recoveries of receivables previously charged off shall be recorded
when received. The Company charges off its account receivables
against the allowance after all means of collection have been
exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered
remote. 

The allowance for doubtful accounts at October 31, 2016 and April
30, 2016 was $0. 

(d) 

Interest in Real Estate Rights: 

I  nterest in real estate
rights contributed by Fortis related to real properties that Fortis
plans to sell within one year. Since these properties are
contributed by Fortis, a related party, the rights are stated on
balance sheet at the cost basis of Fortis.  

(e) 

Oil and Gas Operations: 

Oil and Gas Properties  : The
Company uses the full-cost method of accounting for its exploration
and development activities. Under this method of accounting, the
costs of both successful and unsuccessful exploration and
development activities are capitalized as oil and gas property and
equipment. Proceeds from the sale or disposition of oil and gas
properties are accounted for as a reduction to capitalized costs
unless the gain or loss would significantly alter the relationship
between capitalized costs and proved reserves of oil and natural
gas attributable to a country, in which case a gain or loss would
be recognized in the consolidated statements of operations. All of
the Company s oil and gas properties are located within the
continental United States, its sole cost
center.  

Oil and gas properties may include costs that are excluded from
costs being depleted. Oil and gas costs excluded represent
investments in unproved properties and major development projects
in which the Company owns a direct interest. These unproved
property costs include non-producing leasehold, geological and
geophysical costs associated with leasehold or drilling interests
and in process exploration drilling costs. All costs excluded are
reviewed at least annually to determine if impairment has
occurred. 

The Company accounts for its unproven long-lived assets in
accordance with Accounting Standards Codification
(   ASC   ) Topic 360-10-05,
   Accounting for the Impairment
or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets  .  ASC Topic 360-10-05 requires that
long-lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the historical cost carrying
value of an asset may no longer be appropriate. For the six months
ended October 31, 2016, the Company evaluated and  recorded no
impairment on these properties.  

Proved Oil and Gas Reserves  : In
accordance with Rule 4-10 of SEC Regulation S-X, proved oil and gas
reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil, natural gas and
natural gas liquids which geological and engineering data
demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future
years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating
conditions. All of the Company s oil and gas properties with
proven reserves were impaired to the salvage value prior to the
Bandolier transaction. The price used to establish economic
producibility is the average price during the 12-month period
preceding the end of the entity s fiscal year and calculated
as the un-weighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month
price for each month within such 12-month period. For the six
months ended October 31, 2016, the Company did not record an
impairment on its properties.   

Depletion, Depreciation and Amortization:   Depletion, depreciation and amortization is
provided using the unit-of-production method based upon estimates
of proved oil and gas reserves with oil and gas production being
converted to a common unit of measure based upon their relative
energy content. Investments in unproved properties and major
development projects are not amortized until proved reserves
associated with the projects can be determined or until impairment
occurs. If the results of an assessment indicate that the
properties are impaired, the amount of the impairment is deducted
from the capitalized costs to be amortized. Once the assessment of
unproved properties is complete and when major development projects
are evaluated, the costs previously excluded from amortization are
transferred to the full cost pool and amortization begins. The
amortizable base includes estimated future development costs and,
where significant, dismantlement, restoration and abandonment
costs, net of estimated salvage value.  

In arriving at rates under the unit-of-production method, the
quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves are
established based on estimates made by the Company s
geologists and engineers which require significant judgment, as
does the projection of future production volumes and levels of
future costs, including future development costs. In addition,
considerable judgment is necessary in determining when unproved
properties become impaired and in determining the existence of
proved reserves once a well has been drilled. All of these
judgments may have significant impact on the calculation of
depletion expenses. There have been no material changes in the
methodology used by the Company in calculating depletion,
depreciation and amortization of oil and gas properties under the
full cost method during the six months ended October 31, 2016 and
2015.

Investments   Cost Method and Equity Method: 

Investments held in stock of entities other than subsidiaries,
namely corporate joint ventures and other non-controlled entities
usually are accounted for by one of three methods: (i) the fair
value method (addressed in Topic 320), (ii) the equity method
(addressed in Topic 323), or (iii) the cost method (addressed in
Subtopic 325-20). Pursuant to Paragraph 323-10-05-5, the equity
method tends to be most appropriate if an investment enables the
investor to influence the operating or financial policies of the
investee. The cost basis is utilized for investments that are less
than 20% owned, and the Company does not exercise significant
influence over the operating and financial policies of the
investee. Under the cost method, investments are held at historical
cost. 

(g) 

Stock-Based Compensation: 

Generally, all forms of stock-based compensation, including stock
option grants, warrants, and restricted stock grants are measured
at their fair value utilizing an option pricing model on the
award s grant date, based on the estimated number of awards
that are ultimately expected to vest. 

Under fair value recognition provisions, the Company recognizes
equity based compensation net of an estimated forfeiture rate
and recognizes compensation cost only for those shares expected to
vest over the requisite service period of the
award.  

The fair value of option award is estimated on the date of grant
using the Black Scholes option valuation model. The
Black Scholes option valuation model requires the development
of assumptions that are input into the model. These assumptions are
the expected stock volatility, the risk free interest rate,
the option s expected life, the dividend yield on the
underlying stock and the expected forfeiture rate. Expected
volatility is calculated based on the historical volatility of the
Company s common stock over the expected option life and
other appropriate factors. Risk free interest rates are
calculated based on continuously compounded risk free rates
for the appropriate term. The dividend yield is assumed to be zero
as the Company has never paid or declared any cash dividends on its
common stock and does not intend to pay dividends on the common
stock in the foreseeable future. The expected forfeiture rate is
estimated based on historical experience. 

Determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the
fair value of equity based payment awards requires the input
of the subjective assumptions described above. The assumptions used
in calculating the fair value of equity based payment awards
represent management s best estimates, which involve inherent
uncertainties and the application of management s judgment.
As a result, if factors change and the Company uses different
assumptions, the equity based compensation expense could be
materially different in the future. In addition, the Company is
required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and recognize
expense only for those shares expected to vest. If the actual
forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate, the
equity based compensation expense could be significantly
different from what the Company has recorded in the current
period.  

The Company determines the fair
value of the stock based payments to non-employees as either
the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of
the equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably
measurable.  If the fair value of the equity instruments
issued is used, it is measured using the stock price and other
measurement assumptions as of the earlier of either (1) the date at
which a commitment for performance by the counterparty to earn the
equity instruments is reached, or (2) the date at which the
counterparty s performance is complete.  

The expenses resulting from stock-based compensation are recorded
as general and administrative expenses in the consolidated
statement of operations, depending on the nature of the services
provided.

Income Taxes: 

Income Tax Provision 

Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based
upon differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of
assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates
and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected
to reverse. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation
allowance to the extent management concludes it is more likely than
not that the assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply
to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences
are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax
assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in
the statements of operations in the period that includes the
enactment date. 

The Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax
position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position
will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based
on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits
recognized in the financial statements from such a position should
be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than
fifty percent (50%) likelihood of being realized upon ultimate
settlement.  

The estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between
the tax basis of assets and liabilities are reported in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets, as well as tax credit
carry-backs and carry-forwards. The Company periodically reviews
the recoverability of deferred tax assets recorded on its
consolidated balance sheets and provides valuation allowances as
management deems necessary. 

Management makes judgments as to the interpretation of the tax laws
that might be challenged upon an audit and cause changes to
previous estimates of tax liability. In addition, the Company
operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to
audit in these jurisdictions. In management s opinion,
adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years.
If actual taxable income by tax jurisdiction varies from estimates,
additional allowances or reversals of reserves may be
necessary. 

Uncertain Tax Positions 

The Company did not take any uncertain tax positions and had no
adjustments to its income tax liabilities or benefits for the
reporting periods ended October 31, 2016 and 2015. 

(i) 

Per Share Amounts: 

Basic net income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing
net loss attributable to common stockholders by the
weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the
period. Diluted net income (loss) per common share is determined
using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding
during the period, adjusted for the dilutive effect of common stock
equivalents. For the three and six months ended October 31,
2016 and 2015, potentially dilutive securities were not included in
the calculation of diluted net loss per share because to do so
would be anti-dilutive.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements: 

In May 2014, the FASB issued a comprehensive new revenue
recognition standard that will supersede nearly all existing
revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP. The standard s
core principle (issued as ASU 2014-09 by the FASB), is that a
company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or
services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration
to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those
goods or services. These may include identifying performance
obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable
consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating
the transaction price to each separate performance obligation. The
new guidance must be adopted using either a full retrospective
approach for all periods presented in the period of adoption or a
modified retrospective approach. In August 2015, the FASB issued
ASU No. 2015-14, which defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by
one year, and would allow entities the option to early adopt the
new revenue standard as of the original effective date. This ASU is
effective for public reporting companies for interim and annual
periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company is currently
evaluating its adoption method and the impact of the standard on
its consolidated financial statements and have not yet determined
the method by which the Company will adopt the standard in
2017. 

In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10,
   Revenue from Contracts with
Customers: Identifying Performance Obligations and
Licensing    (topic 606).
In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08,  Revenue from
Contracts with Customers: Principal versus Agent Considerations
(Reporting Revenue Gross verses Net)  (topic 606). These
amendments provide additional clarification and implementation
guidance on the previously issued ASU 2014-09,  Revenue from
Contracts with Customers . The amendments in ASU 2016-10
provide clarifying guidance on materiality of performance
obligations; evaluating distinct performance obligations; treatment
of shipping and handling costs; and determining whether an entity's
promise to grant a license provides a customer with either a right
to use an entity's intellectual property or a right to access an
entity's intellectual property. The amendments in ASU 2016-08
clarify how an entity should identify the specified good or service
for the principal versus agent evaluation and how it should apply
the control principle to certain types of arrangements. The
adoption of ASU 2016-10 and ASU 2016-08 is to coincide with an
entity's adoption of ASU 2014-09, which we intend to adopt for
interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15,
2017. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new
standard.  

In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,
   Compensation   Stock
Compensation    (topic
718). The FASB issued this update to improve the accounting for
employee share-based payments and affect all organizations that
issue share-based payment awards to their employees. Several
aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award
transactions are simplified, including: (a) income tax
consequences; (b) classification of awards as either equity or
liabilities; and (c) classification on the statement of cash flows.
The updated guidance is effective for annual periods beginning
after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those
fiscal years. Early adoption of the update is permitted. The
Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new
standard.  

In
August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230):
Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash
Payments   ( ASU 2016-15 ). ASU 2016-15
will make eight targeted changes to how cash receipts and cash
payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash
flows. ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2017. The new standard will require adoption on a
retrospective basis unless it is impracticable to apply, in which
case it would be required to apply the amendments prospectively as
of the earliest date practicable. The Company is currently in the
process of evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-15 on its consolidated
financial statements.  

The Company does not expect the adoption of any recently issued
accounting pronouncements to have a significant impact on its
financial position, results of operations, or cash
flows.

Acquisition   ).  As a result of the
acquisition, the Company acquired: (i) a 20% membership interest in
Horizon Energy; (ii) three promissory notes issued by the Company
to Horizon Investments in the principal amount of $1.6 million (the
   Horizon
Notes   ); (iii) a
restricted certificate of deposit; and (iv) certain bank,

Investments.  The Horizon Acquisition was completed in
accordance with the term and conditions of the Conditional Purchase
Agreement first entered into by the Company and Horizon Investments
on December 1, 2015 (the    Purchase
Agreement   ). Also on the
Closing Date, the Company and Horizon Investments entered into an
amended and restated Purchase Agreement, pursuant to which the
Company agreed to provide for additional advances by Horizon
Investments to the Company.  

As consideration for the Horizon Acquisition, and in accordance
with the Purchase Agreement, as amended, the Company issued
11,564,250 shares of its common stock on the Closing Date, which
amount included 1,395,916 additional shares of common stock in
consideration for the additional cash, receivables and other assets
reflected on Horizon Investment's balance sheet on the Closing
Date. 

The following table summarizes the allocation of the purchase price
to the net assets acquired:

project: 

(1) Other property consists primarily of four used steam generators
and related equipment that will be assigned to future projects. As
of October 31, 2016, management concluded that impairment was not
necessary as all other assets were carried at salvage
value. 

Kern County Project.    On March 4,
2016  ,
the Company executed an Asset Purchase and Sale and Exploration
Agreement (the "  Agreement  ")
to acquire a 13.75% working interest in certain oil and gas leases
located in southern Kern County, California (the
"  Project  ").
Horizon Energy also purchased a 27.5% working interest in the
Project.  

Under the terms of the Agreement, the Company paid $108,333 to
the sellers on the closing date, and is obligated to pay certain
other costs and expenses after the closing date related to existing
and new leases as more particularly set forth in the Agreement.
Costs incurred to date for this property have aggregated to
$419,535 as   of October 31, 2016
and are recorded as prepaid oil and gas development costs on the
consolidated balance sheet.   In addition, the
sellers are entitled to an overriding royalty interest in certain
existing and new leases acquired after the closing date, and the
Company is required to make certain other payments, each in amounts
set forth in the Agreement.  

Acquisition of Interest in Larne
Basin.    On January
19, 2016, Petro River UK Limited, ("  Petro UK  "), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company,
entered into a Farmout Agreement to acquire a 9% interest in
Petroleum License PL 1/10 and P2123 (the    Larne
Licenses   ) located in the
Larne Basin in Northern Ireland (the "  Larne
Transaction  ").  The
two Larne Licenses, one onshore and one offshore, together
encompass approximately 130,000 acres covering the large majority
of the prospective Larne Basin.  The other parties to the
Farmout Agreement are Southwestern Resources Ltd, a wholly owned
subsidiary of Horizon Energy, which will acquire a 16% interest,
and Brigantes Energy Limited, which will retain a 10%
interest.  Third parties will own the remaining 65%
interest.  

Under the terms of the Farmout Agreement, Petro UK deposited
approximately $735,000 into an escrow agreement
("  Escrow
Agreement  "), which amount
represented Petro UK's obligation to fund the total projected cost
to drill the first well under the terms of the Farmout Agreement.
The total deposited amount to fund the cost to drill the first well
is approximately $6,159,452, based on an exchange rate of one
British Pound for 1.44 U.S. Dollars. Petro UK was and will continue
to be responsible for its pro-rata costs of additional wells
drilled under the Farmout Agreement. Drilling of the first well was
completed in June 2016 and was unsuccessful. The initial costs
incurred by the Company were reclassified from prepaid oil and gas
development costs to oil and gas assets not being amortized on the
consolidated balance sheets.

Company disposed of some of its interests in its Oklahoma oil and
gas assets and received proceeds totaling $279,013. The proceeds
were offset against the full cost pool, therefore no gain or loss
was recognized.

Intangible Assets 

The Company recorded amortization expense of $0 and $30,113 for the
three months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, 
 and
recorded amortization expense of $0 and $60,226 for the six months
ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively,   related to certain intangible assets which were
acquired during 2015, but for which are no longer recorded by the
Company as they were fully impaired during fiscal year
2016.

Asset Retirement Obligations 

The total future asset retirement obligation was estimated based on
the Company s ownership interest in all wells and facilities,
the estimated legal obligations required to retire, dismantle,
abandon and reclaim the wells and facilities and the estimated
timing of such payments. The Company estimated the present value of
its asset retirement obligations at both October 31, 2016 and April
30, 2016, based on a future undiscounted liability of $636,989 and
$956,612, respectively. These costs are expected to be incurred
within one to 24 years. A credit-adjusted risk-free discount rate
of 10% and an inflation rate of 2% were used to calculate the
present value. 

Changes to the asset retirement obligation were as

and such interest has been allocated pro rata between MegaWest
Kansas and Pearsonia West as of October 31,
2016.

Contingency and Contractual Obligations 

(a) In January 2010, the Company experienced a flood in its Calgary
office premises as a result of a broken water pipe. There was
significant damage to the premises rendering them unusable until
the landlord had completed remediation. Pursuant to the lease
contract, the Company asserted that rent should be abated during
the remediation process and accordingly, the Company did not pay
any rent after December 2009. During the remediation process, the
Company engaged an independent environmental testing company to
test for air quality and for the existence of other potentially
hazardous conditions. The testing revealed the existence of
potentially hazardous mold and the consultant provided specific
written instructions for the effective remediation of the premises.
During the remediation process, the landlord did not follow the
consultant s instructions and correct the potentially
hazardous mold situation and subsequently in June 2010 gave notice
and declared the premises to be ready for occupancy. The Company
re-engaged the consultant to re-test the premises and the testing
results again revealed the presence of potentially hazardous mold.
The Company determined that the premises were not fit for
re-occupancy and considered the landlord to be in default of the
lease. The Landlord subsequently terminated terminated the
lease.  

On January 30, 2014 the landlord filed
a Statement of Claim against the Company for rental arrears in the
amount aggregating CAD $759,000 (approximately USD $578,000 as of
December 13, 2016). The Company filed a defence and on October 20,
2014, it filed a summary judgment application stating that the
landlord s claim is barred as it was commenced outside the
2-year statute of limitation period under the Alberta Limitations
Act. The landlord subsequently filed a cross-application to amend
its Statement of Claim to add a claim for loss of prospective rent
in an amount of CAD $665,000 (approximately USD $506,000 as of
December 13, 2016). The applications were heard on June 25,
2015   and the court
allowed both the Company s summary judgment application and
the landlord s amendment application.  Both of these
orders were appealed though two levels of the Alberta courts and
the appeals were dismissed at both levels. The net effect is that
the landlord's claim for loss of prospective rent is to
proceed.    

(b) In September 2013, the Company was notified by the Railroad
Commission of Texas (the    Commission   ) that the Company was not in compliance
with regulations promulgated by the Commission. The Company was
therefore deemed to have lost its corporate privileges within the
State of Texas and as a result, all wells within the state would
have to be plugged. The Commission therefore collected $25,000 from
the Company, which was originally deposited with the Commission, to
cover a portion of the estimated costs of $88,960 to plug the
wells. In addition to the above, the Commission also reserved its
right to separately seek any remedies against the Company resulting
from its noncompliance.  

(c) On August 11, 2014, Martha Donelson and John Friend amended
their complaint in an existing lawsuit by filing a class action
complaint styled:   Martha Donelson and John
Friend, et al. v. United States of America, Department of the
Interior, Bureau of Indian Affairs and Devon Energy Production, LP,
et al.,   Case No.
14-CV-316-JHP-TLW, United States District Court for the Northern
District of Oklahoma (the    Proceeding   ).  The plaintiffs added as
defendants twenty-seven (27) specifically named operators,
including Spyglass,   as well as
all Osage County lessees and operators who have obtained a
concession agreement, lease or drilling permit approved by the
Bureau of Indian Affairs (   BIA   ) in Osage County allegedly in
violation of National Environmental Policy Act
(   NEPA   ).  Plaintiffs seek a
declaratory judgment that the BIA improperly approved oil and gas
leases, concession agreements and drilling permits prior to August
12, 2014, without satisfying the BIA s obligations under
federal regulations or NEPA, and seek a determination that such oil
and gas leases, concession agreements and drilling permits are
void   ab initio  .  Plaintiffs are seeking damages
against the defendants for alleged nuisance, trespass, negligence
and unjust enrichment.  The potential consequences of
such complaint could jeopardize the corresponding
leases.  

On October 7, 2014, Spyglass, along
with other defendants, filed a Motion to Dismiss the August 11,
2014 Amended Complaint on various procedural and legal grounds.
Following the significant briefing, the Court, on March 31, 2016,
granted the Motion to Dismiss as to all defendants and entered a
judgment in favor of the defendants against the plaintiffs. On
April 14, 2016, Spyglass with the other defendants, filed a Motion
seeking its attorneys  fees and costs. The motion
remains pending. On April 28, 2016, the plaintiffs filed three
motions: a Motion to Amend or Alter the Judgment; a Motion to Amend
the Complaint; and a Motion to Vacate Order. On November 23, 2016
the Court denied all three of Plaintiffs  motions.  On
December 6, 2016, Plaintiffs filed a Notice of Appeal to the Tenth
Circuit Court of Appeals.  That appeal is pending as of the
effective date of this response. There is no specific timeline by
which the Court of Appeals must render a ruling. Spyglass intends
to continue to vigorously defend its interest in this
matter.

(d) MegaWest Energy Missouri Corp. (   MegaWest   ), a wholly owned subsidiary of the
Company, is involved in two cases related to oil leases in West
Central, Missouri.  The first case (  James Long and Jodeane Long v.
MegaWest Energy Missouri and Petro River Oil
Corp.  , case number
13B4-CV00019)   is a case for unlawful
detainer, pursuant to which the plaintiffs contend that MegaWest
oil and gas lease has expired and MegaWest is unlawfully possessing
the plaintiffs real property by asserting that the leases remain in
effect.  The case was originally filed in Vernon County,
Missouri on September 20, 2013.  MegaWest filed an Answer and
Counterclaims on November 26, 2013 and the plaintiffs filed a
motion to dismiss the counterclaims. MegaWest filed a motion for
Change of Judge and Change of Venue and the case was transferred to
Barton County.  The court granted the motion to dismiss the
counterclaims on February 3, 2014.    As to the other allegations in the
complaint, the matter is still pending.  

MegaWest filed a second case on October 14, 2014
(  MegaWest
Energy Missouri Corp. v. James Long, Jodeane Long, and Arrow Mines
LLC  , case number
14VE-CV00599).  This case is pending in Vernon County,
Missouri.  Although the two cases are separate, they are
interrelated.  In the Vernon County case, MegaWest has made
claims for: (1) replevin for personal property; (2) conversion of
personal property; (3) breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment
regarding the lease; (4) constructive eviction of the lease; (5)
breach of fiduciary obligation against James Long; (6) declaratory
judgment that the oil and gas lease did not terminate; and (7)
injunctive relief to enjoin the action pending in Barton County,
Missouri.  The plaintiffs filed a motion to dismiss on
November 4, 2014, and Arrow Mines, LLC filed a motion to dismiss on
November 13, 2014.  Both motions remain pending, and MegaWest
will file an opposition to the motions in the near
future.   

(e) The Company is from time to time involved in legal proceedings
in the ordinary course of business. It does not believe that any of
these claims and proceedings against it is likely to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on its
financial condition or results of operations.

Business Overview 

Petro River Oil Corp.   is an
independent energy company focused on the exploration and
development of conventional oil and gas assets with low discovery
and development costs. The Company is focused on taking advantage
of the current downturn in oil prices to enter highly prospective
plays with industry-leading partners. Management believes that the
Company s diversification across multiple projects, each with
low initial capital expenditures and strong risk reward
characteristics, reduces risk and provides exposure to a number of
attractive risk adjusted opportunities. Further, we seek to reduce
costs and risks by adopting a conventional approach to our drilling
program and developing our traditional core areas, as well as
seeking new growth opportunities. Our current projects do not
involve horizontal drilling or hydraulic
fracking.  

The Company s core holdings are in the Mid-Continent Region
in Oklahoma, Kern County, California and Larne Basin, Northern
Ireland. The Company also holds indirect onshore and offshore
acreage positions in Denmark and Dorsett, U.K. We believe that
these opportunities have considerable future potential for the
development of proven oil and gas reserves.

Table
of Contents  

The execution of our business plan is dependent on obtaining
necessary working capital.  While no assurances can be
given, in the event management is able to obtain additional working
capital, we plan to acquire high-quality oil and gas properties,
primarily proved producing and proved undeveloped reserves. We also
intend to explore low-risk development drilling and work-over
opportunities.   Management is also exploring farm
in and joint venture opportunities for our oil and gas
assets. 

Recent Developments 

Reverse Stock Split.   At its Annual Meeting
held on September 20, 2016, the Company s shareholders
approved a resolution to authorize the Company s Board of
Directors, in its sole and absolute discretion, to amend the
Company s Certificate of Incorporation to implement a reverse
stock split of our common stock, at a ratio of not less than
1-for-2, and not greater than 1-for-10 (   Reverse
Split   ), within
one year from the date of the Annual Meeting, with the exact ratio
to be determined by the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors
has not determined the ratio, and does not currently intend to
execute the Reverse Split until such time as the Company lists its
shares of Common Stock on the NASDAQ Stock
Market.  

Spyglass Drilling Program.    On August 19, 2016, Spyglass Energy Group, LLC
(   Spyglass   ), a wholly owned subsidiary of Bandolier
Energy, LLC (   Bandolier   ), entered into a Joint Exploration and
Development Agreement (the    Exploration
Agreement   ) between
Spyglass, Phoenix 2016, LLC (   Phoenix   ) and Mackey Consulting   Leasing, LLC
(   Mackey   ).  Pursuant to the Exploration
Agreement, Phoenix and Mackey shall operate and provide certain
services, including obtaining permits and providing technical
services, at cost, in connection with a Phase I Development Program
as agreed to by the parties (the    Phase I
Program   ).  Phoenix and Mackey shall earn
a 25% working interest on all wells drilled in the Phase I
Program.  Following success and completion of the Phase I
Program, Phoenix and Mackey shall earn a 25% working interest in
the Osage County, Oklahoma Concession held by Spyglass. Under the
Exploration Agreement, Bandolier has agreed commit up to $2.1
million towards costs of the Phase I Program, at their sole
discretion.  

Divestiture of Missouri Properties.   Effective July 11,
2016, MegaWest Energy Missouri Corp (   MegaWest
Missouri   )   assigned
its leaseholds covering approximately 320 acres in Grassy Creek,
Missouri (the    Grassy Creek
Assets   ) to Paluca
Petroleum, Inc. (   Paluca   ) in furtherance of the Company s
corporate strategy to divest its legacy assets. Pursuant to the
terms and conditions of the assignment, Paluca agreed to assume all
liabilities associated with the Grassy Creek Assets and, as
consideration for the assignment, granted MegaWest Missouri an
overriding royalty interest equal to 4% of the value of all oil and
gas assets produced and sold under the assigned
lease.  

MegaWest Transaction.    On October 15, 2015, the Company entered into a
contribution agreement (the    Contribution
Agreement   ) with MegaWest
and Fortis Property Group, LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company (   Fortis   ), pursuant to which the Company and Fortis
each agreed to contribute certain assets to MegaWest in exchange
for shares of MegaWest common stock (   MegaWest
Shares   ) (the
   MegaWest
Transaction   ).  

Upon execution of the Contribution Agreement, (i) the Company
transferred its 50% membership interest in Bandolier (the 
  Bandolier
Interest   ), and cancelled
all of its ownership interest in the then issued and outstanding
MegaWest Shares, which prior to the MegaWest Transaction
represented 100% ownership of MegaWest; and (ii) Fortis transferred
certain indirect interests held in 30 condominium units and the
rights to any profits and proceeds
therefrom.  Immediately thereafter, MegaWest issued to
the Company 58,510 MegaWest Shares, representing a 58.51% equity
interest in MegaWest, as consideration for the assignment of the
Bandolier Interest, and issued to Fortis 41,490 MegaWest Shares,
representing a 41.49% equity interest in MegaWest, as consideration
for the assets assigned to MegaWest by Fortis.  The account
receivable and the Company s interest in real estate
reflected on the Company s balance sheet are assets held by
MegaWest, and are controlled by MegaWest s board of
directors, consisting of two members appointed by Fortis, and one
by the Company. The relative composition of the board of
directors of MegaWest shall continue as long as Fortis has an
equity interest in MegaWest.  

Subject to the terms and conditions of the Contribution Agreement,
the Contribution Agreement provided for a redetermination of the
fair market value of the Bandolier Interest at any time following
the six month anniversary after the execution thereof (the
   Redetermination   ),  Upon
a Redetermination, which has not occurred as of December 14, 2016,
in the event there is a shortfall from the valuation ascribed to
the Bandolier Interest at the time of the Redetermination, as
compared to the value ascribed to the Bandolier Interest in the
Contribution Agreement, the Company will be required to provide
Fortis with a cash payment in an amount equal to the
shortfall.  If the Company is unable to deliver to Fortis
the cash payment required after the Redetermination, if any, the
board of directors of MegaWest shall have the right to exercise
certain remedies against the Company, including a right to
foreclose on the Company s entire equity in MegaWest, which
equity interest has been pledged to Fortis under the terms of the
Contribution Agreement.  In the event of foreclosure, the
Bandolier Interest would revert back to the
Company.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

The Company s significant accounting policies are described
in Note 3 to the annual consolidated financial statements for the
year ended April 30, 2016 and 2015 on Form 10-K filed with the SEC
on July 29, 2016 for the year ended April 30, 2016. 

Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results
of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements.
These consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States
(   US
GAAP   ), which requires us
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of our assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses, to
disclose contingent assets and liabilities on the date of the
consolidated financial statements, and to disclose the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses incurred during the financial
reporting period. The most significant estimates and assumptions
include the valuation of accounts receivable, and the useful lives
and impairment of property and equipment, goodwill and intangible
assets, the valuation of deferred tax assets and inventories and
the provision for income taxes. We continue to evaluate these
estimates and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under
the circumstances. We rely on these evaluations as the basis for
making judgments about the carrying values of assets and
liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Since
the use of estimates is an integral component of the financial
reporting process, actual results could differ from those
estimates. Some of our accounting policies require higher degrees
of judgment than others in their application. We believe critical
accounting policies as disclosed in this Form 10-Q reflect the more
significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our
consolidated financial statements. We believe there have been no
material changes to our critical accounting policies and
estimates.  

The following critical accounting policies rely upon assumptions
and estimates and were used in the preparation of our consolidated
financial statements: 

Oil and Gas Operations 

The Company follows the full cost method of accounting for oil and
gas operations whereby all costs related to exploration and
development of oil and gas reserves are capitalized. Under this
method, the Company capitalizes all acquisition, exploration and
development costs incurred for the purpose of finding oil and
natural gas reserves, including salaries, benefits and other
internal costs directly attributable to these activities. Costs
associated with production and general corporate activities,
however, are expensed in the period incurred. Costs are capitalized
on a country-by-country basis. To date, there has only been one
cost center, the United States. 

The present value of estimated future net cash flows is computed by
applying the average first-day-of-the-month prices during the
previous twelve-month period of oil and natural gas to estimated
future production of proved oil and natural gas reserves as of
year-end less estimated future expenditures to be incurred in
developing and producing the proved reserves and assuming
continuation of existing economic conditions. Prior to December 31,
2009, prices and costs used to calculate future net cash flows were
those as of the end of the appropriate quarterly
period. 

Following the discovery of reserves and the commencement of
production, the Company will compute depletion of oil and natural
gas properties using the unit-of-production method based upon
production and estimates of proved reserve quantities. Costs
associated with unproved properties are excluded from the depletion
calculation until it is determined whether or not proved reserves
can be assigned to such properties. Unproved properties are
assessed for impairment annually. Significant properties are
assessed individually. 

The Company assesses all items classified as unproved property on
an annual basis for possible impairment. The Company assesses
properties on an individual basis or as a group if properties are
individually insignificant. The assessment includes consideration
of the following factors, among others: land relinquishment; intent
to drill; remaining lease term; geological and geophysical
evaluations; drilling results and activity; the assignment of
proved reserves; and the economic viability of development if
proved reserves are assigned. During any period in which these
factors indicate impairment, the related exploration costs incurred
are transferred to the full cost pool and are then subject to
depletion and the ceiling limitations on development oil and
natural gas expenditures. 

-21- 

Table
of Contents  

Proceeds from the sale of oil and gas assets are applied against
capitalized costs, with no gain or loss recognized, unless a sale
would alter the rate of depletion and depreciation by 25 percent or
more. 

Significant changes in these factors could reduce our estimates of
future net proceeds and accordingly could result in an impairment
of our oil and gas assets. Management will perform annual
assessments of the carrying amounts of its oil and gas assets as
additional data from ongoing exploration activities becomes
available. 

Interest in Real Estate Rights 

Interest in real estate rights, previously identified as
 Real estate - held for sale  in our unaudited
consolidated balance sheets are related to real estate currently
held by Fortis, who intends to sell these properties within the
next 12 months. Fortis contributed profit realized from future sale
of these properties to MegaWest, pursuant to the terms and
conditions of the Contribution Agreement, as a part of the MegaWest
Transaction. As we do not know the price at which the real estate
will be sold, the rights are stated on the consolidated balance
sheet as of October 31, 2016 and April 30, 2016 at the cost basis
realized by Fortis. 

Income Taxes 

The Company uses the asset and liability method in accounting for
income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and
liabilities are determined based on differences between financial
reporting and income tax carrying amounts of assets and liabilities
and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be
in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. The Company
reviews deferred tax assets for a valuation allowance based upon
whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will
be fully realized. A valuation allowance, if necessary, is provided
against deferred tax assets, based upon management s
assessment as to their realization. 

Uncertain Tax Positions 

The Company evaluates uncertain tax positions pursuant to ASC Topic
740-10-25    Accounting for Uncertainty in
Income Taxes  ,  which
allows companies to recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax
position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position
will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on
the technical merits of the position. Those tax positions failing
to qualify for initial recognition are recognized in the first
interim period in which they meet the more likely than not
standard, or are resolved through negotiation or litigation with
the taxing authority, or upon expiration of the statute of
limitations. De-recognition of a tax position that was previously
recognized occurs when an entity subsequently determines that a tax
position no longer meets the more likely than not threshold of
being sustained.  

At April 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company has approximately
$2,501,000 and $0, respectively, of liabilities for uncertain tax
positions. Interpretation of taxation rules relating to net
operating loss utilization in real estate transactions give rise to
uncertain positions. In connection with the uncertain tax position,
there was no interest or penalties recorded as the position is
expected but the tax returns are not yet due. 

The Company is subject to ongoing tax exposures, examinations and
assessments in various jurisdictions. Accordingly, the Company may
incur additional tax expense based upon the outcomes of such
matters. In addition, when applicable, the Company will adjust tax
expense to reflect the Company s ongoing assessments of such
matters, which require judgment and can materially increase or
decrease its effective rate as well as impact operating
results. 

The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the
tax jurisdiction. The Company s major taxing jurisdictions
include the United States (including applicable
states). 

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS 

Recently Adopted Accounting Standards 

In May 2014, the FASB issued a comprehensive new revenue
recognition standard that will supersede nearly all existing
revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP. The standard s
core principle (issued as ASU 2014-09 by the FASB), is that a
company will recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or
services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration
to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those
goods or services. These may include identifying performance
obligations in the contract, estimating the amount of variable
consideration to include in the transaction price and allocating
the transaction price to each separate performance obligation. The
new guidance must be adopted using either a full retrospective
approach for all periods presented in the period of adoption or a
modified retrospective approach. In August 2015, the FASB issued
ASU No. 2015-14, which defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09 by
one year, and would allow entities the option to early adopt the
new revenue standard as of the original effective date. This ASU is
effective for public reporting companies for interim and annual
periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company is currently
evaluating its adoption method and the impact of the standard on
its consolidated financial statements.

Table
of Contents  

In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10,  Revenue from
Contracts with Customers: Identifying Performance Obligations and
Licensing  (topic 606). In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU
No. 2016-08,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers:
Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross
verses Net)  (topic 606). These amendments provide additional
clarification and implementation guidance on the previously issued
ASU 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers .
The amendments in ASU 2016-10 provide clarifying guidance on
materiality of performance obligations; evaluating distinct
performance obligations; treatment of shipping and handling costs;
and determining whether an entity's promise to grant a license
provides a customer with either a right to use an entity's
intellectual property or a right to access an entity's intellectual
property. The amendments in ASU 2016-08 clarify how an entity
should identify the specified good or service for the principal
versus agent evaluation and how it should apply the control
principle to certain types of arrangements. The adoption of ASU
2016-10 and ASU 2016-08 is to coincide with an entity's adoption of
ASU 2014-09, which we intend to adopt for interim and annual
reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company is
currently evaluating the impact of the new standard. 

In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,  Compensation
  Stock Compensation  (topic 718). The FASB issued this
update to improve the accounting for employee share-based payments
and affect all organizations that issue share-based payment awards
to their employees. Several aspects of the accounting for
share-based payment award transactions are simplified, including:
(a) income tax consequences; (b) classification of awards as either
equity or liabilities; and (c) classification on the statement of
cash flows. The updated guidance is effective for annual periods
beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within
those fiscal years. Early adoption of the update is permitted. The
Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new
standard. 

In
August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15,    Statement of Cash Flows (Topic
230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash
Payments    ( ASU
2016-15 ). ASU 2016-15 will make eight targeted changes to
how cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in
the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal
years beginning after December 15, 2017. The new standard will
require adoption on a retrospective basis unless it is
impracticable to apply, in which case it would be required to apply
the amendments prospectively as of the earliest date practicable.
The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of
ASU 2016-15 on its consolidated financial
statements.  

Management does not believe that any recently issued accounting
pronouncements, if adopted, would have a material effect on the
accompanying consolidated financial statements.

Compared to Three Months Ended October 31, 2015 

Oil Sales 

During the three months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015, the
Company did not recognize oil and gas sales primarily due to the
decrease in operations and shut-in wells in light of the
challenging oil price environment during the reporting
period.  The Company is currently drilling four wells and
re-completing certain existing wells, located in Osage County,
Oklahoma.  Given current oil and gas prices, management
does not anticipate deriving revenue from existing oil and gas
assets in the short-term;   provided,
however  , in the event oil and
gas prices rise from current levels, or in the event current
drilling activity and re-completions results in proven reserves
that can be extracted profitably at current oil and gas prices,
management anticipates the resumption of oil and gas sales,
although no assurances can be given.

Lease Operating Expense 

During the three months ended October 31, 2016, lease operating
expense was $8,365, as compared to lease operating expense of
$84,035 for the three months ended October 31, 2015. The overall
decrease in lease operating expense of $75,670 was primarily
attributable to management s commitment to substantially
reduce operating expense in light of the current challenging oil
price environment. 

General and Administrative Expense 

General and administrative expense for the three months ended
October 31, 2016 was $830,071, as compared to $  1,418,386     for
the three months ended October 31, 2015. The decrease was primarily
attributable to decreases in salaries offset by increases in
professional fees and benefits and office and administrative
expenses. These changes are outlined below:  

Salaries and benefits include non-cash stock-based compensation of
$365,260 for three months ended October 31, 2016 compared to
$1,174,078 for the three months ended October 31, 2015. The
decrease in stock-based compensation of $808,818 from the prior
comparable period was due to the vesting terms of the awards.
General and administrative expenses increased due to (i)
significant increases in professional fees incurred during the
implementation of the Company s business plan; (ii) as well
as increased marketing and investor relations expenses. We also
experienced higher legal expenses relating to transactional and
other corporate activities during the three months ended October
31, 2016. 

Interest Income (Expense) 

During the three months ended October 31, 2016, the Company
recognized $157,507 in interest income compared to interest expense
of $101 for the three months ended October 31, 2015. The income
received in the 2016 period was attributable to $157,507 of
interest income accrued on the related party notes
receivable. 

Net Gain on Interests in Real Estate Rights 

During the three months ended October 31, 2016, the Company
recognized $392,665 net gain on its interest in real estate rights
compared to $7,860,738 for the three months ended October 31, 2015.
The net gain on interest in real estate rights for the three months
ended October 31, 2016 and 2015 was due to the sale of one and
eighteen condominium units, respectively, by Fortis, and the
resulting profits which were assigned to MegaWest pursuant to the
Contribution Agreement, less the book value recorded by
MegaWest.   

Results of Operations for the Six Months Ended October 31, 2016
Compared to Six Months Ended October 31, 2015 

Oil Sales 

During the six months ended October 31, 2016, the Company
recognized $0 in oil and gas sales compared to $62,841 for the six
months ended October 31, 2015, consisting of $62,841 in oil sales
and $0 in gas sales. The overall decrease in sales of $62,841 was
primarily due to the decrease in operations and shut-in wells in
light of the challenging oil price environment during the reporting
period.  The Company is currently drilling four wells and
re-completing certain existing wells, located in Osage County,
Oklahoma.  Given current oil and gas prices, management
does not anticipate deriving revenue from existing oil and gas
assets in the short-term;   provided,
however  , in the event oil and
gas prices rise from current levels, or in the event current
drilling activity and re-completions results in proven reserves
that can be extracted profitably at current oil and gas prices,
management anticipates the resumption of oil and gas sales,
although no assurances can be given.

Lease Operating Expense 

During the six months ended October 31, 2016, lease operating
expense was $32,124, as compared to lease operating expense of
$259,988 for the six months ended October 31, 2015. The overall
decrease in lease operating expense of $227,864 was primarily
attributable to management s commitment to substantially
reduce operating expense in light of the current challenging oil
price environment. 

General and Administrative Expense 

General and administrative expense for the six months ended October
31, 2016 was $2,538,212, as compared to $  1,978,361 
 for the six months ended October 31,
2015. The increase was primarily attributable to increases in
salaries and benefits, professional fees and office and
administrative expenses. These changes are outlined
below:  

Salaries and benefits include non-cash stock-based compensation of
$1,515,457 for six months ended October 31, 2016 compared to
$1,402,910     for
the six months ended October 31, 2015. The increase in stock-based
compensation of $112,547 from the prior comparable period was due
to an increase in the number of option awards expensed during the
current three-month period. General and administrative expenses
also increased due to (i) significant increases in professional
fees incurred during the implementation of the Company s
business plan; (ii) the hiring of Stephen Brunner in October 2015;
as well as (iii) increased marketing and investor relations
expenses. We also experienced higher legal expenses relating to
transactional and other corporate activities during the six months
ended October 31, 2016.

Gain on
Sale of Oil and Gas Asset   

During the six months ended October 31, 2016, the
Company   assigned its
leaseholds covering approximately 320 acres in Missouri to third
party in furtherance of the Company s corporate strategy to
divest its legacy assets. In conjunction with the assignment, the
Company recorded a gain of $216,850.  

Interest Income 

During the six months ended October 31, 2016, the Company
recognized $298,766 in interest income compared to of $782 for the
six months ended October 31, 2015. The income received in the 2016
period was attributable to $298,766 of interest income accrued on
the related party notes receivable. 

Net Gain on Interests in Real Estate Rights 

During the six months ended October 31, 2016, the Company
recognized $693,304 net gain on its interest in real estate rights
compared to $7,860,738 for the six months ended October 31, 2015.
The net gain on interest in real estate rights during the six
months ended October 31, 2016 and 2015 was due to the sale of two
and eighteen condominium units, respectively, by Fortis and
the resulting profits which were assigned to MegaWest pursuant to
the Contribution Agreement, less the book value recorded by
MegaWest. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 

At October 31, 2016, the Company had working capital of
approximately $4.2 million, of which approximately $2.7 million and
$1.9 million is attributable to an account receivable from a
related party and the Company s interest in certain real
estate, respectively. The account receivable and the
Company s interest in real estate are assets held by
MegaWest, the Company s 58.51% owned subsidiary, and are
controlled by MegaWest s board of directors, consisting of
two members appointed by Fortis, and one by the Company.  The
relative composition of the board of directors of MegaWest shall
continue as long as Fortis has an equity interest in
MegaWest.   

In the event there is a shortfall from the valuation ascribed to
the Bandolier Interest at the time of the Redetermination, as
compared to the value ascribed to the Bandolier Interest in the
Contribution Agreement, the Company will be required to provide
Fortis with a cash payment in an amount equal to the shortfall, and
any unfunded shortfall will likely result in the foreclosure on all
or a portion of the Company s entire equity interest in
MegaWest, which equity interest has been pledged to Fortis. 
No assurances can be given that the value of the Bandolier Interest
will equal the valuation set forth in the Contribution Agreement,
or if the value identified after the Redetermination is below the
initial valuation, that we will be able to fund such shortfall. Any
requirement to fund a shortfall will have a material and adverse
effect on our operations and financial condition. 

In the event of a foreclosure of our equity interest in MegaWest
resulting in such equity interest decreasing to less than a
controlling interest in MegaWest, the assets conveyed to MegaWest
under the terms of the Contribution Agreement may no longer be
consolidated with the Company s assets on the Company s
financial statements, and the Bandolier Interest may revert back to
the Company.  As a result, our financial condition and
results from operations may be adversely affected, and such affect
will be material. 

As a result of the utilization of cash in its operating activities,
and the development of its assets, the Company has incurred losses
since it commenced operations. In addition, the
Company has a limited operating history.  At October
31, 2016, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of
approximately $2.0 million. The Company s primary source
of operating funds since inception has been equity financings, as
well as through the consummation of the Horizon Acquisition. While
management believes that the current level of working capital is
sufficient to maintain current operations as well as the planned
added operations for the next 12 months, management intends to
raise capital through debt and equity instruments in order to
execute its business and operating plans. Management can provide no
assurances that the Company will be successful in its capital
raising efforts. In order to conserve capital, from time to time,
management may defer certain development activity. 

To address the current challenging oil and gas environment, and in
order to increase the value of the Company s oil and gas
assets, management has also curtailed certain oil and gas
operations, and focused on the Company s technology and
related initiatives, as well as the Horizon Acquisition. In
addition to the Horizon Acquisition and the MegaWest Transaction,
the Company is exploring farm in and joint venture opportunities
for its oil and gas assets as well other opportunities to increase
shareholder value. No assurances can be given that management will
be successful.  

Operating Activities 

During the six months ended October 31, 2016, operating activities
used cash of $1,166,231, as compared to $  815,928   used in operating
activities during the six months ended October 31, 2015. 
 The Company incurred a net loss during
the six months ended October 31, 2016 of $1,790,003 as compared to
a net income of $  5,525,555 
 for the six months ended October 31,
2015  . For six months ended
October 31, 2016, the net loss was offset by non-cash items such as
stock-based compensation, depreciation, depletion and accretion of
asset retirement obligation and the deferred tax liability. Cash
provided by operations was also influenced by changes in accounts
receivable, accrued interest on notes receivable, prepaid expenses
and accounts payable and accrued expenses. For the six months ended
October 31, 2015, the loss was offset by non-cash items such as
stock-based compensation, depreciation, depletion and amortization,
and accretion of asset retirement obligation. Cash used in
operations was also influenced by changes in accounts receivable,
prepaid expenses and accounts payable and accrued
expenses.

Financing Activities 

Financing
activities during the six months ended October 31, 2016 resulted in
cash provided of $176,000, as compared to $  0   during the six months
ended October 31, 2015 related to a contribution received from the
Company s non-controlling interest partners in Bandolier from
a mandatory capital request.   On
August 8, 2016, Bandolier s Board of Managers approved a
capital call of $1,250,000 due January 31, 2017 to fund certain
re-completions and test wells to be drilled in Osage county.
MegaWest Kansas  portion of the capital call is $625,000, of
which it has funded $483,162.50 and $141,837.50 is due on or prior
to January 31, 2017. Pearsonia West s portion of the capital
call is $550,000, of which it has funded $176,000 and $374,000 is
due on or prior to January 31, 2017. Ranger Station has elected not
to fund its capital call amount of $75,000. As a result, Ranger
Station has forfeited its 6% interest in Bandolier and such
interest has been allocated pro rata between MegaWest Kansas and
Pearsonia West as of October 31, 2016.

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 

A. Material Weaknesses 

As discussed in Item 9A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
fiscal year ended April 30, 2016, we identified material weaknesses
in the design and operation of our internal controls. The material
weaknesses are due to the limited number of employees, which
impacts our ability to conduct a thorough internal review, and the
Company s reliance on external accounting personnel to
prepare financial statements. 

-27- 

Table
of Contents  

To remediate the material weakness, the Company is developing a
plan to design and implement the operation of our internal
controls.  Upon the Company obtaining additional capital,
the Company intends to hire additional accounting staff, and
operations and administrative executives in the future to address
its material weaknesses. 

We will continue to monitor and assess our remediation initiatives
to ensure that the aforementioned material weaknesses are
remediated. 

B. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 

The Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures and
internal controls designed to ensure that information required to
be disclosed in the Company s filings under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and
Exchange Commission s rules and forms. The Company s
management, with the participation of its principal executive and
principal financial officers, has evaluated the effectiveness of
the Company s disclosure controls and procedures as of the
end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.
Based upon that evaluation and solely due to the unremediated
material weaknesses described above, the Company s principal
executive and financial officers have concluded that such
disclosure controls and procedures were not effective for the
purpose for which they were designed as of the end of such period.
As a result of this conclusion, the financial statements for the
period covered by this report were prepared with particular
attention to the unremediated material weaknesses previously
disclosed. Accordingly, management believes that the consolidated
financial statements included in this report fairly present, in all
material respects, the Company s financial condition, results
of operations and cash flows as of and for the periods presented,
in accordance with US GAAP, notwithstanding the unremediated
weaknesses. 

C. Changes in Internal Control over Financial
Reporting 

There was no change in the Company s internal control over
financial reporting that was identified in connection with such
evaluation that occurred during the period covered by this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q that has materially affected, or is
reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company s
internal control over financial reporting.

PART
II - OTHER INFORMATION  

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. 

(a) In January 2010, the Company experienced a flood in its Calgary
office premises as a result of a broken water pipe. There was
significant damage to the premises rendering them unusable until
the landlord had completed remediation. Pursuant to the lease
contract, the Company asserted that rent should be abated during
the remediation process and accordingly, the Company did not pay
any rent after December 2009. During the remediation process, the
Company engaged an independent environmental testing company to
test for air quality and for the existence of other potentially
hazardous conditions. The testing revealed the existence of
potentially hazardous mold and the consultant provided specific
written instructions for the effective remediation of the premises.
During the remediation process, the landlord did not follow the
consultant s instructions and correct the potentially
hazardous mold situation and subsequently in June 2010 gave notice
and declared the premises to be ready for occupancy. The Company
re-engaged the consultant to re-test the premises and the testing
results again revealed the presence of potentially hazardous mold.
The Company determined that the premises were not fit for
re-occupancy and considered the landlord to be in default of the
lease. The Landlord subsequently terminated the
lease.   

On January 30, 2014 the landlord filed
a Statement of Claim against the Company for rental arrears in the
amount aggregating CAD $759,000 (approximately USD $578,000 as of
December 13, 2016). The Company filed a defence and on October 20,
2014, it filed a summary judgment application stating that the
landlord s claim is barred as it was commenced outside the
2-year statute of limitation period under the Alberta Limitations
Act. The landlord subsequently filed a cross-application to amend
its Statement of Claim to add a claim for loss of prospective rent
in an amount of CAD $665,000 (approximately USD $506,000 as of
December 13, 2016). The applications were heard on June 25,
2015   and the court
allowed both the Company s summary judgment application and
the landlord s amendment application.  Both of these
orders were appealed though two levels of the Alberta courts and
the appeals were dismissed at both levels. The net effect is that
the landlord's claim for loss of prospective rent is to
proceed.    

(b) In September 2013, the Company was notified by the Railroad
Commission of Texas (the    Commission   ) that the Company was not in compliance
with regulations promulgated by the Commission. The Company was
therefore deemed to have lost its corporate privileges within the
State of Texas and as a result, all wells within the state would
have to be plugged. The Commission therefore collected $25,000 from
the Company, which was originally deposited with the Commission, to
cover a portion of the estimated costs of $88,960 to plug the
wells. In addition to the above, the Commission also reserved its
right to separately seek any remedies against the Company resulting
from its noncompliance.  

(c) On August 11, 2014, Martha Donelson and John Friend amended
their complaint in an existing lawsuit by filing a class action
complaint styled:   Martha Donelson and John
Friend, et al. v. United States of America, Department of the
Interior, Bureau of Indian Affairs and Devon Energy Production, LP,
et al.,   Case No.
14-CV-316-JHP-TLW, United States District Court for the Northern
District of Oklahoma (the    Proceeding   ).  The plaintiffs added as
defendants twenty-seven (27) specifically named operators,
including the Spyglass Energy, LLC (   Spyglass   ),
a wholly owned Subsidiary of Bandolier Energy, LLC, as well as all
Osage County lessees and operators who have obtained a concession
agreement, lease or drilling permit approved by the Bureau of
Indian Affairs (   BIA   ) in Osage County allegedly in
violation of National Environmental Policy Act
(   NEPA   ).  Plaintiffs seek a
declaratory judgment that the BIA improperly approved oil and gas
leases, concession agreements and drilling permits prior to August
12, 2014, without satisfying the BIA s obligations under
federal regulations or NEPA, and seek a determination that such oil
and gas leases, concession agreements and drilling permits are
void   ab initio  .  Plaintiffs are seeking damages
against the defendants for alleged nuisance, trespass, negligence
and unjust enrichment.  The potential consequences of
such complaint could jeopardize the corresponding
leases.  

On October 7, 2014, Spyglass, along with other defendants, filed a
Motion to Dismiss the August 11, 2014 Amended Complaint on various
procedural and legal grounds. Following the significant briefing,
the Court, on March 31, 2016, granted the Motion to Dismiss as to
all defendants and entered a judgment in favor of the defendants
against the plaintiffs. On April 14, 2016, Spyglass with the other
defendants, filed a Motion seeking its attorneys  fees and
costs. Said motion remains pending. On April 28, 2016, the
plaintiffs filed three motions: a Motion to Amend or Alter the
Judgment; a Motion to Amend the Complaint; and a Motion to Vacate
Order.     On November 23, 2016 the Court denied all three of
Plaintiffs  motions.  On December 6, 2016, Plaintiffs
filed a Notice of Appeal to the Tenth Circuit Court of
Appeals.  That appeal is pending as of the effective date of
this response. There is no specific timeline by which the Court of
Appeals must render a ruling. Spyglass intends to continue to
vigorously defend its interest in this
matter.

(d) MegaWest Energy Missouri Corp. (   MegaWest
Missouri   ), a wholly
owned subsidiary of the Company, was previously involved in two
cases related to oil leases in West Central, Missouri. The first
case (James Long and Jodeane Long v. MegaWest Energy Missouri and
Petro River Oil Corp., case number 13B4- CV00019) was a case for
unlawful detainer, pursuant to which the plaintiffs contended that
a MegaWest Missouri oil and gas lease had expired and MegaWest
Missouri was unlawfully possessing the plaintiffs  real
property by asserting that the leases remained in effect. MegaWest
Missouri filed a second case on October 14, 2014 (MegaWest Energy
Missouri Corp. v. James Long, Jodeane Long, and Arrow Mines LLC,
case number 14VE-CV00599). This case was pending in Vernon County,
Missouri. Although the two cases were separate, they were
interrelated. In the Vernon County case, MegaWest Missouri made
claims for: (1) replevin for personal property; (2) conversion of
personal property; (3) breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment
regarding the lease; (4) constructive eviction of the lease; (5)
breach of fiduciary obligation against James Long; (6) declaratory
judgment that the oil and gas lease did not terminate; and (7)
injunctive relief to enjoin the action pending in Barton County,
Missouri. On September 21, 2015, the parties entered into a
Settlement and Release Agreement for both cases. The parties agreed
to release their claims and dismiss their lawsuits with prejudice.
MegaWest Missouri released its claims to certain leases and the
plaintiff purchased certain personal property from MegaWest
Missouri. The matters have been completely resolved, and the cases
dismissed.  

(e) The Company is from time to time involved in legal proceedings
in the ordinary course of business. It does not believe that any of
these claims and proceedings against it is likely to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on its
financial condition or results of operations. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS 

Our results of operations and financial condition are subject to

2. Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue

4. The registrant s other certifying officers and I are

for the registrant and we have: 

a)
designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such
disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our
supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the
registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known
to us by others within those entities, particularly during the
period in which this report is being prepared; 

b)
designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused
such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under

accepted accounting principles; 

c)
evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant s disclosure
controls and procedures and presented in this report our

d)
disclosed in this quarterly report any change in the

affect, the registrant s internal control over financial
reporting; and 

5. The registrant s other certifying officers and I have
disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control
over financial reporting, to the registrant s auditors and
the audit committee of the registrant s board of directors
(or persons performing the equivalent functions): 

a)
all significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design
or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are
reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant s
ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information; and 

b)
any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or
other employees who have a significant role in the
registrant s internal control over financial
