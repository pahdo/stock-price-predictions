  (Unaudited) 
    
  Note 1 - Business Description and Significant Accounting Policies 
    
  Business Description 
    
  Glowpoint, Inc. (   Glowpoint    or    we    or    us    or the    Company   ) is a managed service provider of video collaboration and network applications.  Our services are designed to provide a comprehensive suite of automated and concierge applications to simplify the user experience and expedite the adoption of video as the primary means of collaboration. Our customers include Fortune 1000 companies, along with small and medium enterprises in a variety of industries. We market our services globally through a multi-channel sales approach that includes direct sales and channel partners. The Company was formed as a Delaware corporation in May 2000.  The Company operates in   one   segment and therefore segment information is not presented. 
    
  Principles of Consolidation 
    
  The condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Glowpoint and our   100%  -owned subsidiary, GP Communications, LLC, whose business function is to provide interstate telecommunications services for regulatory purposes.  All material inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.   
    
  Basis of Presentation 
    
  The Company's fiscal year ends on December 31 of each calendar year.  The accompanying interim condensed consolidated financial statements are unaudited and have been prepared on substantially the same basis as our annual consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31,   2015  . In the opinion of the Company's management, these interim condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) considered necessary for a fair statement of our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from these estimates. 
    
  The December 31,   2015   year-end condensed consolidated balance sheet data in this document were derived from audited consolidated financial statements and does not include all of the disclosures required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company's audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31,   2015   and notes thereto included in the Company's fiscal   2015   Annual Report on Form 10-K, filed with the SEC on   March 17, 2016   (the    2015   10-K ). 
    
  The results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods included in these condensed consolidated financial statements are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any future period or the entire fiscal year. 
    
  Reclassification 
    
  Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation. 
    
  Significant Accounting Policies 
    
  The significant accounting policies used in preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements are disclosed in our   2015   10-K, and there have been no changes to the Company's significant accounting policies during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  .  
    
  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 

-   5  - 

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASU 2014-09), which supersedes most existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP. The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 defines a five step process to achieve this core principle and, in doing so, more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than are required under existing U.S. GAAP. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods therein, using either of the following transition methods: (i) a full retrospective approach reflecting the application of the standard in each prior reporting period with the option to elect certain practical expedients, or (ii) a retrospective approach with the cumulative effect of initially adopting ASU 2014-09 recognized at the date of adoption (which includes additional footnote disclosures). We continue to evaluate the impact of the pending adoption of ASU 2014-09 on our consolidated financial statements and believe that the Company will use the retrospective approach with the cumulative effect of initially adopting ASU 2014-09 recognized at the date of adoption. Management does not expect the adoption of ASU 2014-09 to have a material impact on our financial statements and disclosures.  
    
  In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-17,    Income Taxes    (Subtopic 740-10). The amendments in this update require deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as non-current regardless of the classification of the underlying assets and liabilities. For public companies, the amendments will be effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Earlier application is permitted. Management does not expect the adoption of ASU 2015-17 to have a material impact on our financial statements and disclosures.  
    
  In February 2016, the FASB created Topic 842 and issued ASU 2016-02,    Leases   . The guidance in this update supersedes Topic 840,    Leases   . This ASU requires lessees to recognize a right-of-use assets and a lease liability, initially measured at the present value of the lease payments on the balance sheet. For public companies, the amendments will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Earlier application is permitted. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-02 on our financial statements and disclosures. 
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,    Compensation - Stock Compensation    (Subtopic 718). The guidance in this update involves several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification on the statement of cash flows. For public companies, the amendments will be effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Earlier application is permitted for any interim or annual period. Management does not expect the adoption of ASU 2016-09 to have a material impact on our financial statements and disclosures.  
    
  Taxes Billed to Customers and Remitted to Taxing Authorities 
    
  We recognize taxes billed to customers in revenue and taxes remitted to taxing authorities in our cost of revenue.  For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we included taxes of   $190,000   and   $660,000  , respectively, in revenue, and we included taxes of   $203,000   and   $895,000  , respectively, in cost of revenue.  For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , we included taxes of   $249,000   and   $838,000  , respectively, in revenue, and we included taxes of   $262,000   and   $815,000  , respectively, in cost of revenue.   

Note 2 - Liquidity and Going Concern 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $1,343,000   of cash and a working capital deficit of   $8,644,000  .  Our cash balance as of   September 30, 2016   includes restricted cash of   $51,000   (as discussed in Note 4).  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we generated a net loss of   $3,021,000   and net cash provided by operating activities of   $265,000  .  We generated cash flow from operations even though we incurred a net loss as our net loss includes non-cash operating expenses that are added back to our cash flow from operations (as shown on the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows).   
    
  In October 2013, the Company entered into a loan agreement by and among the Company and its subsidiary, and Main Street Capital Corporation ( Main Street ), as lender and as administrative agent and collateral agent for itself and the other lenders from time to time party thereto. On February 27, 2015 the Company and Main Street entered into an amendment to the loan agreement to revise certain of the Company s financial covenants and ratio levels (as amended, the  Main Street Loan Agreement ). The Main Street Loan Agreement provides for an   $11,000,000   senior secured term loan facility ( Main Street Term Loan ) and a   $2,000,000   senior secured revolving loan facility (the  Main Street Revolver ). On October 17, 2016, the Main Street Revolver matured and therefore the Company no longer has access to this revolving loan facility. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had outstanding borrowings of   $9,000,000   under the Main Street Term Loan and   no    

-   6  - 

outstanding borrowings on the Main Street Revolver. While we are in default of the Main Street Loan Agreement (see below), we are not able to access the   $2,000,000   of remaining availability under the Main Street Term Loan. As of   September 30, 2016  , Main Street owns   7,711,517   shares, or   22%  , of the Company s common stock.   
    
  The Main Street Loan Agreement contains certain financial covenants that are measured on a quarterly basis. The Company breached its debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio covenant as of June 30, 2016 and   September 30, 2016   and breached the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant as of   September 30, 2016  , each of which constitutes an event of default under the Main Street Loan Agreement. Main Street has not provided a waiver of any of the existing defaults, and thus, Main Street may seek a variety of remedies under the loan documents including, without limitation, acceleration of the indebtedness owing under the Main Street Loan Agreement. Based on the Company s current financial projections, we believe that it is likely that the Company will breach both of the financial covenants in the Main Street Loan Agreement as of December 31, 2016 and in the future. Accordingly, we are exploring various alternatives to renegotiate our financial covenants and address our liquidity issues, including, without limitation, a potential restructuring of the Main Street and SRS indebtedness, which may involve a conversion of a portion of our debt to equity or a debt refinancing, coupled with a capital raise.  
    
  In connection with the October 2012 acquisition of Affinity VideoNet, Inc. ( Affinity ), the Company issued a promissory note (as amended, the  SRS Note ) to Shareholder Representative Services LLC ( SRS ) on behalf of the prior stockholders of Affinity.  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the principal balance on the SRS Note was   $1,785,000  . As of   September 30, 2016  , accrued interest expense on the SRS Note was   $478,000  .  The maturity date of the SRS Note is July 6, 2017.  Effective March 1, 2015, the interest rate on the SRS Note is   15%   per annum. Payment of all interest earned after March 1, 2015 is due on July 6, 2017, unless certain trailing Adjusted EBITDA targets are met as defined in the SRS Note. 
    
  Because the maturity date of the SRS Note (July 6, 2017) falls within twelve months following the filing of this Report, the Company believes that, based on our current projection of revenue, expenses, capital expenditures and cash flows, it will not have sufficient resources and cash flows to service its debt obligations, including repayment of the SRS Note, and fund its operations for at least the next twelve months following the filing of this Report. In addition, there can be no assurances that Main Street will not accelerate the indebtedness outstanding under the Main Street Loan Agreement. In the event that our lenders accelerate the repayment of such indebtedness, we would not have sufficient resources and/or cash flow to repay the indebtedness. While we expect to continue to adjust our cost of revenue and other operating expenses to partially offset the impact of revenue declines associated with our legacy services, a restructuring of our debt or capital infusion is necessary to fund our obligations. We have renegotiated financial covenants and/or refinanced our indebtedness in the past but there is no assurance we will be able to successfully renegotiate or refinance all or any portion of our indebtedness in the future. If we were unable to repay or otherwise refinance the indebtedness under the loan agreements upon acceleration or when otherwise due, our lenders could foreclose on the collateral that secures our obligations under the loan agreements, which could force us into bankruptcy or liquidation. In the event we need access to capital to fund operations or provide growth capital, we would likely need to raise capital in one or more equity offerings.  There can be no assurance that we will be successful in raising necessary capital or that any such offering will be on terms acceptable to the Company.  If we are unable to raise additional capital that may be needed on terms acceptable to us, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company. The factors discussed above raise substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from these uncertainties. 

Note 3 - Goodwill 
    
  Goodwill is not amortized but is subject to periodic testing for impairment in accordance with ASC Topic 350    Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment   . We test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis on November 30 each year or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change indicating that the fair value of the goodwill may be below its carrying amount. The Company considered the declines in our revenue and cash flows, coupled with defaults of the Main Street Loan Agreement, to be a triggering event for an interim goodwill impairment test.  The performance of the impairment test involves a two-step process.  The first step involves comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying value, including goodwill.  The Company operates as a single reporting unit.  The Company used market-based approaches to determine the fair value of the reporting unit for the first step of the goodwill impairment test. These approaches used quoted market prices in active markets and revenue multiples of next twelve months revenue for comparable companies. The carrying amount of our reporting unit exceeded its fair value; therefore, the second step of the goodwill impairment test was performed to calculate implied goodwill and to measure the amount of the impairment loss.  The Company allocated the fair value of the reporting unit to all of its assets and liabilities.  Based upon this allocation, the Company determined that goodwill is valued at   $9,225,000   and recorded an impairment loss of   $600,000   in the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . The continued future decline of our revenue, cash flows and/or stock price may give rise to a triggering event that may require the Company to record additional impairment charges on goodwill in the future.

Note 4 - Capitalized Software Costs 
    
  The Company capitalizes certain costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining internal-use software.  All software development costs have been appropriately accounted for as required by ASC Topic 350-40    Intangible   Goodwill and Other   Internal-Use Software   .     Capitalized software costs are included in Property and Equipment on our condensed consolidated balance sheets and are amortized over   three   to   four   years.  Software costs that do not meet capitalization criteria are expensed as incurred. For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we capitalized   $89,000   and   $248,000   of internal-use software costs, respectively, and we amortized   $145,000   and   $475,000  , respectively, of these costs. For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , we capitalized   $226,000   and   $1,052,000  , respectively, and we amortized   $166,000   and   $458,000  , respectively, of these costs. During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we recorded impairment losses of   $0   and   $25,000  , respectively, related to capitalized software no longer in service. 

Note 5 - Restricted Cash 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , our cash balance included restricted cash of   $51,000   and   $83,000  , respectively.  The   $51,000   letter of credit that serves as the security deposit for our lease of office space in Colorado (as discussed in Note 10) is secured by an equal amount of cash pledged as collateral and such cash is held in a restricted bank account. 

Note 6 - Accrued Expenses and Other Liabilities 
    
  Accrued expenses and other liabilities consisted of the following (in thousands): 

Note 7 - Debt 
    
  Debt consisted of the following (in thousands):  

As discussed in Note 2, the Main Street Loan Agreement provides for the   $11,000,000   Main Street Term Loan and provided for the   $2,000,000   Main Street Revolver. On October 17, 2016, the Main Street Revolver matured and therefore the Company no longer has access to this revolving loan facility.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had outstanding borrowings of   $9,000,000   under the Main Street Term Loan and   no   outstanding borrowings on the Main Street Revolver. While we are in default of the Main

Street Loan Agreement (see below), we are not able to access the   $2,000,000   of remaining availability under the Main Street Term Loan. As of   September 30, 2016  , Main Street owned   7,711,517   shares, or   22%  , of the Company s common stock.   
    
  Borrowings under the Main Street Term Loan mature on October 17, 2018 unless sooner terminated as provided in the Main Street Loan Agreement. The Main Street Loan Agreement provides that the Main Street Term Loan borrowings bear interest at   12%   per annum.  Interest payments on the outstanding borrowings are due monthly.   
    
  The Company is required to make quarterly principal payments on the Main Street Term Loan through the maturity date in an amount equal to   50%   of Excess Cash Flow generated by the Company during the trailing fiscal quarter (Excess Cash Flow is defined in the Main Street Loan Agreement and is effectively equal to cash flow from operations less capital expenditures less principal payments on capital leases). In the event there were outstanding borrowings on the Main Street Revolver, any quarterly principal payments are first applied to the Main Street Revolver and then to the Main Street Term Loan. During the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company made   $400,000   of principal payments on the Main Street Revolver, of which   $244,000   related to required payments based on Excess Cash Flow for the first quarter of 2016. 
    
  The Company may prepay borrowings under the Main Street Loan Agreement at any time without premium or penalty, subject to certain notice and minimum prepayment requirements.  The obligations of the Company under the Main Street Loan Agreement are secured by substantially all of the assets of the Company, including all intellectual property, equity interests in any subsidiaries, equipment and other personal property.  The Main Street Loan Agreement contains standard representations, warranties and covenants for a transaction of its nature, including, among other things, covenants relating to (i) financial reporting and notification, (ii) payment of obligations, (iii) compliance with applicable laws and (iv) notification of certain events and covenants and restrictive provisions which may, among other things, limit the Company s ability to sell assets, incur additional indebtedness, make investments or loans and create liens.  The Main Street Loan Agreement also contains financial covenants, including a fixed charge coverage ratio covenant and a debt to Adjusted EBITDA ( AEBITDA ) ratio covenant as defined in the Main Street Loan Agreement.  The Main Street Loan Agreement contains events of default customary for similar financings with corresponding grace periods, including failure to pay any principal or interest when due, failure to perform or observe covenants, breaches of representations and warranties, certain cross defaults, certain bankruptcy related events, monetary judgments defaults and a change in control. 
    
  The Main Street Loan Agreement contains certain financial covenants that are measured on a quarterly basis. The Company breached its debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio covenant as of June 30, 2016 and   September 30, 2016   and breached the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant as of   September 30, 2016  , each of which constitutes an event of default under the Main Street Loan Agreement. Main Street has not provided a waiver of any of the existing defaults, and thus, Main Street may seek a variety of remedies under the loan documents including, without limitation, acceleration of the indebtedness owing under the Main Street Loan Agreement. Based on the Company s current financial projections, we believe that it is likely that the Company will breach both of the financial covenants in the Main Street Loan Agreement as of December 31, 2016 and in the future. Accordingly, we are exploring various alternatives to renegotiate our financial covenants and address our liquidity issues, including, without limitation, a potential restructuring of the Main Street and SRS indebtedness, which may involve a conversion of a portion of our debt to equity or a debt refinancing, coupled with a capital raise. Although the maturity date of the Main Street Term Loan is October 17, 2018, the Company has classified this debt as current given the existing defaults and potential acceleration of such indebtedness. 
    
  In connection with the October 2012 acquisition of Affinity, the Company issued the SRS Note to SRS, on behalf of the prior stockholders of Affinity.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the principal balance on the SRS Note was   $1,785,000  , offset by unamortized deferred financing costs related to the SRS Note of   $3,000  . The maturity date of the SRS Note is July 6, 2017. Effective March 1, 2015, the interest rate on the SRS Note is   15%   per annum. Payment of all interest earned after March 1, 2015 is due on July 6, 2017, unless certain trailing AEBITDA targets are met as defined in the SRS Note.  The SRS Note is subordinate to borrowings under the Main Street Loan Agreement, and is only permitted to be repaid if permitted by the terms of the Main Street Loan Agreement.  In addition, under the terms of the Subordination Agreement among the Company, SRS and Main Street, repayment of the principal and accrued interest on the SRS Note is permitted to occur only if the Company s cash balance is   200%   greater than the balance of the SRS Note.  The Company is required to make monthly principal payments in the amount of   $50,000   in the event the Company s trailing   three   month AEBITDA exceeds   $1,500,000  . The Company is required to make additional payments on the principal amount over the remaining term of the SRS Note in an amount equal to   40%   of the Company s trailing   six   month Adjusted EBITDA less   $3,000,000  . During the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company was not required to make any principal payments on the SRS Note.  As of   September 30, 2016  , accrued interest expense on the SRS Note was   $478,000  . 
    
  Deferred financing costs related to our debt agreements of   $143,000   and   $197,000   are included as a direct deduction of the carrying amount of our debt as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The financing costs are amortized  

-   9  - 

using the effective interest method over the term of each loan through each maturity date. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , amortization of deferred financing costs was   $54,000   and   $68,000  , respectively.   

Note 8 - Preferred Stock 
    
  Our Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to   5,000,000   shares of preferred stock.  As of   September 30, 2016  , there were:   100   shares of Series B-1 Preferred Stock authorized, and   no   shares issued or outstanding;   7,500   shares of Series A-2 Preferred Stock authorized and   32   shares issued and outstanding; and   4,000   shares of Series D Preferred Stock authorized and   no   shares issued or outstanding.   
    
  Each share of Series A-2 Preferred Stock has a stated value of   $7,500   per share (the    A-2 Stated Value   ), a liquidation preference equal to the A-2 Stated Value, and is convertible at the holder s election into Common Stock at a conversion price per share of   $2.9835   as of   September 30, 2016  .  Therefore, each share of Series A-2 Preferred Stock is convertible into   2,514   shares of Common Stock as of   September 30, 2016  . The conversion price is subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events set forth in our Certificate of Incorporation. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , there were   no   adjustments to the conversion price. The Series A-2 Preferred Stock is subordinate to the Series B-1 Preferred Stock but senior to all other classes of equity, has weighted average anti-dilution protection and, commencing on January 1, 2013, is entitled to cumulative dividends at a rate of   5%   per annum, payable quarterly, based on the A-2 Stated Value.  Once dividend payments commence, all dividends are payable at the option of the holder in cash or through the issuance of a number of additional shares of Series A-2 Preferred Stock with an aggregate liquidation preference equal to the dividend amount payable on the applicable dividend payment date. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company has recorded   $45,000   in accrued dividends on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet related to the remaining Series A-2 Preferred Stock outstanding.   The Company, at our option, may redeem all or a portion of the Series A-2 Preferred Stock in cash at a price per share of   $8,250   per share (equal to   $7,500   per share multiplied by   110%  ) plus all accrued and unpaid dividends. 
    
  In accordance with ASC Topic 815, we evaluated whether our convertible preferred stock contains provisions that protect holders from declines in our stock price or otherwise could result in modification of the exercise price and/or shares to be issued under the respective preferred stock agreements based on a variable that is not an input to the fair value of a  fixed-for-fixed  option and require a derivative liability.  The Company determined no derivative liability is required under ASC Topic 815 with respect to our convertible preferred stock.  A contingent beneficial conversion amount is required to be calculated and recognized when and if the adjusted conversion price of the convertible preferred stock is adjusted to reflect a down round stock issuance that reduces the conversion price below the   $1.16   fair value of the common stock on the issuance date of the convertible preferred stock.

  Glowpoint 2014 Equity Incentive Plan 
    
  On May 28, 2014, the Glowpoint, Inc. 2014 Equity Incentive Plan (the  2014 Plan ) was approved by the Company s stockholders at the Company s 2014 Annual Meeting of Stockholders.  The purpose of the 2014 Plan is to promote the success of the Company and to increase stockholder value by providing an additional means to attract, motivate, retain and reward selected employees and other eligible persons through the grant of equity awards.  Awards may be granted under the 2014 Plan to officers, employees, directors and consultants of the Company or its subsidiary.  The 2014 Plan permits the grant of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted shares, restricted stock units, cash awards and other awards, including stock bonuses, performance stock, performance units, dividend equivalents, or similar rights to purchase or acquire shares, whether at a fixed or variable price or ratio related to the Company s common stock, upon the passage of time, the occurrence of one or more events, or the satisfaction of performance criteria or other conditions, or any combination thereof, or any similar securities with a value derived from the value of or related to the Company s common stock and/or returns thereon.  A total of   4,400,000   shares of the Company s common stock were initially available for issuance under the 2014 Plan.  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  ,   1,677,000   restricted stock units and   170,000   restricted stock awards were granted under the 2014 Plan.  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   636,000   shares were available for issuance under the 2014 Plan.   
    
  Glowpoint 2000 Stock Incentive Plan 
    
  In June 2010, the Board terminated the Glowpoint 2000 Stock Incentive Plan (as amended, the  2000 Plan ).  Notwithstanding the termination of the 2000 Plan, outstanding awards under the 2000 Plan will remain in effect in accordance  

-   10  - 

with their terms.  As of   September 30, 2016  , options to purchase a total of   13,000   shares of common stock were outstanding under the 2000 Plan.   
    
  Glowpoint 2007 Stock Incentive Plan  
    
  In May 2014, the Board terminated the Glowpoint 2007 Stock Incentive Plan (the  2007 Plan ).  Notwithstanding the termination of the 2007 Plan, outstanding awards under the 2007 Plan will remain in effect in accordance with their terms.  As of   September 30, 2016  , options to purchase a total of   1,209,000   shares of common stock and   193,000   shares of restricted stock were outstanding under the 2007 Plan.   
    
  Stock Options 
    
  The Company periodically grants stock options to employees and directors in accordance with the provisions of our stock incentive plans, with the exercise price of the stock options being set at or above the closing price of our common stock at the date of grant.   
    
  A summary of stock options granted, exercised, expired and forfeited under our stock incentive plans and stock options outstanding as of, and changes made during, the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , is presented below (shares in thousands): 

Stock-based compensation expense related to stock options is allocated as follows for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   (in thousands): 

The remaining unrecognized stock-based compensation expense for options as of   September 30, 2016   was   $107,000   and will be amortized over a weighted average period of approximately   0.32   years.   

Restricted Stock Awards 
    
  A summary of restricted stock awards granted, vested, forfeited and unvested outstanding as of, and changes made during, the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , is presented below (shares in thousands): 

-   11  - 

The number of shares of restricted stock awards vested during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   includes   25,000   shares withheld and repurchased by the Company on behalf of employees to satisfy   $13,000   of tax obligations relating to the vesting of such shares.  Such shares are held in the Company s treasury stock as of   September 30, 2016  .   
    
  Stock-based compensation expense related to restricted stock awards is allocated as follows for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   (in thousands): 

During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company recorded   $93,000   in stock-based compensation expense related to   170,000   shares of restricted stock awards issued in lieu of payment of   $84,000   in cash bonuses earned in 2014.  
    
  During the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  , the Company recorded a reversal of   $110,000   in stock-based compensation expense of which   $26,000   related to expense for unvested awards that were forfeited and   $62,000   related to revised estimates for expense previously recorded on performance-based awards. 
    
  Certain restricted stock awards have performance-based vesting provisions and are subject to forfeiture, in whole or in part, if these performance conditions are not achieved.  Management assesses, on an ongoing basis, the probability of whether the performance criteria will be achieved and, once it is deemed probable, compensation expense is recognized over the relevant performance period.  For those awards not subject to performance criteria, the cost of the restricted stock awards is expensed, which is determined to be the fair market value of the shares at the date of grant, on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.   
    
  The remaining unrecognized stock-based compensation expense for restricted stock awards as of   September 30, 2016   was   $221,000  .  Of this amount,   $66,000   relates to time-based awards with a remaining weighted average period of   0.55   years.  The remaining   $155,000   of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense relates to performance-based awards for which expense will be recognized upon the Company achieving defined revenue targets and other financial goals and will expire   10   years from the grant date.

  Stock-based compensation expense related to restricted stock units is allocated as follows for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   (in thousands): 

-   12  - 

Certain restricted stock unit awards have performance-based vesting provisions and are subject to forfeiture, in whole or in part, if these performance conditions are not achieved.  Management assesses, on an ongoing basis, the probability of whether the performance criteria will be achieved and, once it is deemed probable, compensation expense is recognized over the relevant performance period.  For those awards not subject to performance criteria, the cost of the restricted stock unit awards is expensed, which is determined to be the fair market value of the shares at the date of grant, on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.     
    
  The remaining unrecognized stock-based compensation expense for restricted stock units as of   September 30, 2016   was   $2,089,000  .  Of this amount   $550,000   relates to time-based awards with a remaining weighted average period of   0.90   years.  The remaining   $1,539,000   of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense relates to performance-based awards for which expense will be recognized upon the Company achieving defined revenue targets and other financial goals over fiscal years 2016, 2017 and 2018.

Note 10 - Net Loss Per Share 
    
  Basic net loss per share is computed by dividing net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.  The weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding does not include any potentially dilutive securities or any unvested restricted shares of common stock.  These unvested restricted shares, although classified as issued and outstanding at   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , are considered contingently returnable until the restrictions lapse and will not be included in the basic net loss per share calculation until the shares are vested.  Unvested shares of our restricted stock do not contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends and dividend equivalents.  Unvested restricted stock units are not included in calculations of basic net loss per share, as they are not considered issued and outstanding at time of grant.   
    
  Diluted net loss per share is computed by giving effect to all potential shares of common stock, including stock options, preferred stock, restricted stock units, and unvested restricted stock awards, to the extent they are dilutive. For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , all such common stock equivalents have been excluded from diluted net loss per share as the effect to net loss per share would be anti-dilutive (decrease our net loss per share). 
    
  The following table sets forth the computation of the Company s basic and diluted net loss per share (in thousands, except per share data):  

-   13  - 

The following table represents the potential shares that were excluded from the computation of weighted-average number of shares of common stock in computing the diluted net loss per share for the periods presented because including them would have had an anti-dilutive effect (in thousands):  

Note 11 - Commitments and Contingencies 
    
  Operating Leases 
    
  We lease   two   facilities in Denver, CO and Oxnard, CA that are under operating leases through December 2018 and March 2020, respectively.  Both of these leases require us to pay increases in real estate taxes, operating costs and repairs over certain base year amounts.  Lease payments for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   were   $72,000   and   $218,000  , respectively. Lease payments for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   were   $69,000   and   $195,000  , respectively. 
    
  Future minimum rental commitments under all non-cancelable operating leases as of   September 30, 2016  , are as follows (in thousands): 

Commercial Commitments 
    
  We have entered into a number of agreements with our suppliers to purchase communications and consulting services. Some of the agreements require a minimum amount of services to be purchased over the life of the agreement, or during a specified period of time.  Glowpoint believes that it will meet its commercial commitments.  Historically, in certain instances where Glowpoint did not meet the minimum commitments, no penalties for minimum commitments have been assessed and the Company has entered into new agreements.  It has been our experience that the prices and terms of successor  

-   14  - 

agreements are similar to those offered by other suppliers.  Glowpoint does not believe that any loss contingency related to a potential shortfall should be recorded in the consolidated financial statements because it is not probable, from the information available and from prior experience, that Glowpoint has incurred a liability.   
    
  Contingencies 
    
  On July 23, 2015, UTC Associates Inc. ( UTC ) filed suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Company (the  UTC Litigation ). On September 22, 2015, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. On October 13, 2015, in response to the Company s motion, UTC filed an amended complaint. On November 2, 2015, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint. On February 1, 2016, the Court partially granted and partially denied the dismissal motion. The Court dismissed with prejudice the fraud claim and declined to dismiss the   two   breach of contract claims. The UTC Litigation involved allegations that Glowpoint failed to pay amounts allegedly due under a Technology Development   Operations Outsourcing arrangement dated June 30, 2010 (the  Proposal ). UTC sought monetary damages totaling   $2,107,000  , including   $1,107,000   for damages arising from the breach of an alleged guaranteed minimum provision, and   $1,000,000   for damages arising from the breach of an alleged exclusivity provision. On April 1, 2016, the Company filed its answer to UTC s Complaint and asserted counterclaims against UTC, including for breach of contract, fraud in the inducement, fraud in the execution and fraud, pursuant to which the Company was seeking a judgment awarding monetary damages against UTC in an amount to be determined at trial, voiding the Proposal ab initio and awarding the Company its costs and disbursements, including attorneys  fees, incurred in defending the action.  On April 25, 2016, UTC filed an answer to the Company s counterclaims, denying such counterclaims and asserting purported defenses to them. 
    
  On September 30, 2016, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with UTC related to claims that have been or could have been asserted against one another, including but not limited to claims in the UTC Litigation. Pursuant to the settlement agreement, (i) the Company paid   $325,000   to UTC on September 30, 2016; (ii) the Company and UTC entered into a new services agreement pursuant to which the Company will purchase services from UTC subject to certain terms and conditions set forth therein; and (iii) the Company issued   600,000   shares of the Company s common stock to UTC on October 14, 2016.  The value of the common stock, or   $168,000   (equal to   600,000   shares multiplied by the closing price of the Company s stock of   $0.30   per share on September 30, 2016), was recorded in accrued expenses and other liabilities as of September 30, 2016 and as stock-based expense in general and administrative expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016.  Upon payment and delivery of the foregoing, both the Company and UTC dismissed their respective claims in the UTC Litigation, and each party has released the other party of all potential claims against the other party, including those that were or could have been asserted in the UTC Litigation. 
    
  Letters of Credit

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 
    
  Overview 
    
  Glowpoint, Inc. (   Glowpoint    or    we    or    us    or the    Company   ) is a managed service provider of video collaboration and network applications.  Our services are designed to provide a comprehensive suite of automated and concierge applications to simplify the user experience and expedite the adoption of video as the primary means of collaboration. Our customers include Fortune 1000 companies, along with small and medium enterprises in a variety of industries. We market our services globally through a multi-channel sales approach that includes direct sales and channel partners. The Company was formed as a Delaware corporation in May 2000.  The Company operates in   one   segment and therefore segment information is not presented. 
    
  We experienced a significant decline in revenue in 2015 (21% decrease from 2014) that has continued into 2016. These revenue declines are primarily due to net attrition of customers and lower demand for our services given the competitive environment and pressure on pricing that currently exists in our industry. As a result of the Company s declining revenue and Adjusted EBITDA, the Company breached certain financial covenants in the Main Street Loan Agreement as of June 30, 2016 and   September 30, 2016  . Main Street has not provided a waiver of any of the existing defaults, and thus, Main Street may seek a variety of remedies under the loan documents including, without limitation, acceleration of the indebtedness owing under the Main Street Loan Agreement. The Company anticipates future covenant breaches and reduced cash flow from operations that will require a restructuring of our debt obligations and additional capital to fund investments in product development and sales and marketing as a means to reverse our revenue trends. These factors and the other factors described below raise substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern.  
    
  Results of Operations 
    
  Three and Nine   Months Ended   September 30, 2016   (the        2016   Quarter  and the    2016   Period, respectively) compared to   Three and Nine   Months Ended   September 30, 2015   (the    2015   Quarter , the    2015   Period , respectively)

Total revenue decreased   $4,901,000   to   $14,950,000   in the   2016   Period from   $19,851,000   in the   2015   Period.

Revenue for video collaboration services decreased   $814,000   to   $2,494,000   in the   2016   Quarter from   $3,308,000   in the   2015   Quarter and decreased   $2,957,000   to   $8,403,000   in   2016   Period from   $11,360,000   in the   2015   Period. These decreases in video collaboration revenue are attributable as follows:  
    
           (i) 
    approximately 23% and 31% of the decreases between the   2016   Quarter and the   2015   Quarter and the   2016   Period and the   2015   Period, respectively, are due to lower customer demand for video meeting suites as a result of increased usage of desktop and mobile video products and technologies; and 
       
           (ii) 
    the remaining decreases for these periods are attributable to net attrition of other customers and other factors.

Revenue for network services decreased   $693,000   to   $1,805,000   in the   2016   Quarter from   $2,498,000   in the   2015   Quarter. Revenue for network services decreased   $1,655,000   to   $6,168,000   in the   2016   Period from   $7,823,000   in the   2015   Period. These decreases are mainly attributable to net attrition of customers and lower demand for these services given the competitive environment and pressure on pricing that currently exists in the network services business.   
    
  We expect that the year-over-year total revenue trend for the   2015   Period to the   2016   Period will continue for the remainder of   2016   and into next year given the current dynamic and competitive environment for video collaboration and network services, and due to the limited resources we have to invest in sales and marketing to increase revenue. We remain focused on new customer acquisition and increasing sales of our next-generation video collaboration solutions.  However, we believe that sales cycles associated with selling our services directly to enterprise IT organizations and through our channel partners typically range from six to eighteen months. These factors create uncertainty as to when, and if, we will be able to stabilize and ultimately grow our revenue (see our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 for further discussion). 
    
  Cost of Revenue (exclusive of depreciation and amortization).    Cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, includes all internal and external costs related to the delivery of revenue.  Cost of revenue also includes the cost for taxes which have been billed to customers. Cost of revenue decreased to   $2,609,000   in the   2016   Quarter from   $3,723,000   in the   2015   Quarter. This   $1,114,000   decrease in cost of revenue is mainly attributable to lower costs associated with the   $1,816,000   decrease in revenue during the same period. Cost of revenue, as a percentage of total revenue, was   60%   for both the   2016   Quarter and   2015   Quarter, respectively. Cost of revenue decreased to   $9,187,000   in the   2016   Period from   $11,376,000   in the   2015   Period. This   $2,189,000   decrease in cost of revenue is mainly attributable to lower costs associated with the   $4,901,000   decrease in revenue during the same period. Cost of revenue, as a percentage of total revenue, was 61% and 57% for the   2016   Period and   2015   Period, respectively. The increase in cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue for the   2016   Period as compared to the   2015   Period, is mainly attributable to relatively higher levels of investment in service delivery and infrastructure. We reduced costs in network, personnel and external costs associated with video meeting suites in the   2016   Quarter and   2016   Period as compared with the same periods in   2015  . 
    
  Research and Development  .  Research and development expenses include internal and external costs related to the development of new service offerings and features and enhancements to our existing services. Research and development expenses decreased to   $229,000   in the   2016   Quarter from   $336,000   in the   2015   Quarter and decreased to   $817,000   in the   2016   Period from   $969,000   in the   2015   Period. These decreases are primarily attributable to lower headcount and corresponding personnel costs.  
    
  Sales and Marketing Expenses  .  Sales and marketing expenses decreased to   $70,000   in the   2016   Quarter from   $519,000   in the   2015   Quarter and decreased to   $576,000   in the   2016   Period from   $1,658,000   in the   2015   Period. These decreases are primarily attributable to lower headcount and corresponding personnel costs of   $306,000   and   $626,000  , and reductions of marketing expenditures of   $72,000   and   $267,000  , respectively, between the   2016   and   2015   Quarters and the   2016   and   2015   Periods. 
    
  General and Administrative Expenses  .  General and administrative expenses include direct corporate expenses and costs of personnel in the various corporate support categories, including executive, finance, legal, human resources and information technology.  General and administrative expenses increased by   $286,000   to   $1,664,000   in the   2016   Quarter from   $1,378,000   in the   2015   Quarter. This increase is primarily attributable to an increase of   $579,000   in costs related to the UTC Litigation (see Note 11 in Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements above for further discussion), partially offset by lower personnel costs of   $165,000  , and lower administrative, overhead and other costs of   $107,000  . 
    
  General and administrative expenses decreased by   $158,000   to   $4,009,000   in the   2016   Period from   $4,167,000   in the   2015   Period.  This decrease is mainly attributable to lower personnel costs of   $515,000  , and lower administrative, overhead and other costs of   $325,000  , partially offset by an increase of   $695,000   in costs related to the UTC Litigation. 
    
  Impairment Charges.    Impairment charges in the   2016   Quarter and   2016   Period were   $605,000   and   $630,000  , respectively, as compared to   $4,000   in the   2015   Quarter and   $138,000   in the   2015   Period. The impairment losses for the   2015   Period primarily relate to furniture and leasehold improvements associated with the closure of our former New Jersey office. The impairment charges for the   2016   Quarter and Period primarily relate to an impairment charge on our goodwill (see Note 3 in Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements above for further discussion). The continued future decline of our revenue, cash flows and/or stock price may give rise to a triggering event that may require the Company to record additional impairment charges in the future related our goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets. 
    
  Depreciation and Amortization Expenses  .  Depreciation and amortization expenses decreased   $82,000   to   $455,000   in the   2016   Quarter from   $537,000   in the   2015   Quarter. Depreciation and amortization expenses decreased by   $143,000   to   $1,509,000   in the   2016   Period from   $1,652,000   in the   2015   Period.   

-   17  - 

Loss from Operations.    The Company recorded a loss from operations of   $1,288,000   in the   2016   Quarter as compared to a loss from operations of   $337,000   in the   2015   Quarter.  The Company recorded a loss from operations of   $1,778,000   in the   2016   Period as compared to a loss from operations of   $109,000   in the   2015   Period. The increases in our loss from operations from the   2015   Quarter and Period to our loss from operations in the   2016   Quarter and Period are primarily attributable to decreases in revenue partially offset by lower operating expenses, as discussed above.  
    
  Adjusted EBITDA 
    
  Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as net loss before depreciation, amortization, taxes, severance, stock-based expense, impairment charges and interest and other expense, net.  Adjusted EBITDA is not intended to replace operating loss, net loss, cash flow or other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  Rather, Adjusted EBITDA is an important measure used by management to assess the operating performance of the Company and is used in the calculation of financial covenants in the Main Street Loan Agreement and is used in determining if principal payments are required on the SRS Note.  Adjusted EBITDA as defined here may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies due to differences in accounting policies.  A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss is shown below: 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $1,343,000   of cash and a working capital deficit of   $8,644,000  .  Our cash balance as of   September 30, 2016   includes restricted cash of   $51,000   (as discussed in Note 4).  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we generated a net loss of   $3,021,000   and net cash provided by operating activities of   $265,000  .  We generated cash flow from operations even though we incurred a net loss as our net loss includes certain non-cash operating expenses that are added back to our cash flow from operations (as shown on the condensed consolidated statements of cash flows). A substantial portion of our cash flow from operations is dedicated to the payment of interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund operations, and invest in capital expenditures and sales and marketing. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , our cash flow from operations was reduced by   $841,000   for interest payments on our indebtedness.  
    
  Net cash used in investing activities for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $273,000   and represented the purchase of property and equipment and capitalized internal-use software costs. Net cash used in financing activities for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $413,000  , primarily attributable to   $400,000   of payments made on the Main Street Revolver. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had outstanding borrowings of   $9,000,000   under the Main Street Term Loan and   no   outstanding borrowings on the Main Street Revolver. On October 17, 2016, the Main Street Revolver matured and therefore the Company no longer has access to this revolving loan facility.  While we are in default of the Main Street Loan Agreement (see below), we are not able to access the   $2,000,000   of remaining availability under the Main Street Term Loan. Borrowings under the Main Street Term Loan mature on October 17, 2018 unless sooner terminated as provided in the Main Street Loan Agreement. The Main Street Loan Agreement provides that the Main Street Term Loan borrowings bear interest at   12%   per annum. Interest payments on the outstanding borrowings under the Main Street Term Loan are due monthly. The Company is required to make quarterly principal payments on the Main Street Term Loan through the maturity date in an amount equal to   50%   of Excess Cash Flow generated by the Company during the trailing fiscal quarter (Excess Cash Flow is defined in the Main Street Loan Agreement  

-   18  - 

and effectively equal to cash flow from operations less capital expenditures less principal payments on capital leases). In the event there were outstanding borrowings on the Main Street Revolver, any quarterly principal payments were first applied to the Main Street Revolver and then to the Main Street Term Loan. During the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company made   $400,000   of principal payments on the Main Street Revolver of which   $244,000   related to required payments based on Excess Cash Flow for the first quarter of 2016. 
    
  The Main Street Loan Agreement contains certain financial covenants that are measured on a quarterly basis. The Company breached its debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio covenant as of June 30, 2016 and   September 30, 2016   and breached the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant as of   September 30, 2016  , each of which constitutes an event of default under the Main Street Loan Agreement. Main Street has not provided a waiver of any of the existing defaults, and thus Main Street may seek a variety of remedies under the loan documents including, without limitation, acceleration of the indebtedness owing under the Main Street Loan Agreement. Based on the Company s current financial projections, we believe that it is likely that the Company will breach both of the financial covenants in the Main Street Loan Agreement as of December 31, 2016 and in the future. Accordingly we are exploring various alternatives to renegotiate our financial covenants and address our liquidity issues, including, without limitation, a potential restructuring of the Main Street and SRS indebtedness, which may involve a conversion of a portion of our debt to equity or a debt refinancing, coupled with a capital raise.  
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had outstanding borrowings of   $1,785,000   on the SRS Note. The maturity date of the amended SRS Note is July 6, 2017. Effective March 1, 2015, the interest rate on the SRS Note is   15%   per annum. Payment of all interest earned after March 1, 2015 is due on July 6, 2017, unless certain trailing Adjusted EBITDA targets are met as defined in the amended SRS Note. The SRS Note is subordinate to borrowings under the Main Street Loan Agreement, and is only permitted to be repaid if permitted by the terms of the Main Street Loan Agreement.  In addition, under the terms of the Subordination Agreement among the Company, SRS and Main Street, repayment of the principal and accrued interest on the SRS Note is permitted to occur only if the Company s cash balance is 200% greater than the balance of the SRS Note.  The Company is required to make monthly principal payments in the amount of   $50,000   in the event the Company s trailing   three   month Adjusted EBITDA exceeds   $1,500,000  . The Company is required to make additional payments on the principal amount over the remaining term of the SRS Note in an amount equal to   40%   of the Company s trailing   six   month Adjusted EBITDA less   $3,000,000  . During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company was not required to make any principal payments on the SRS Note.  We expect no principal or interest payments will be required during 2016 on the SRS Note and accrued interest on the SRS Note will increase from   $478,000   as of   September 30, 2016   to   $565,000   as of December 31, 2016. 
    
  Because the maturity date of the SRS Note (July 6, 2017) falls within twelve months following the filing of this Report, the Company believes that, based on our current projection of revenue, expenses, capital expenditures and cash flows, it will not have sufficient resources and cash flows to service its debt obligations, including repayment of the SRS Note, and fund its operations for at least the next twelve months following the filing of this Report. In addition, there can be no assurances that Main Street will not accelerate the indebtedness outstanding under the Main Street Loan Agreement.  In the event that our lenders accelerate the repayment of such indebtedness, we would not have sufficient resources and/or cash flow to repay the indebtedness. While we expect to continue to adjust our cost of revenue and other operating expenses to partially offset the impact of revenue declines associated with our legacy services, a restructuring of our debt or capital infusion is necessary to fund our obligations. We have renegotiated financial covenants and/or refinanced our indebtedness in the past but there is no assurance we will be able to successfully renegotiate or refinance all or any portion of our indebtedness in the future. If we were unable to repay or otherwise refinance the indebtedness under the loan agreements upon acceleration or when otherwise due, our lenders could foreclose on the collateral that secures our obligations under the loan agreements, which could force us into bankruptcy or liquidation. In the event we need access to capital to fund operations or provide growth capital, we would likely need to raise capital in one or more equity offerings. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in raising necessary capital or that any such offering will be on terms acceptable to the Company.  If we are unable to raise additional capital that may be needed on terms acceptable to us, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company. The factors discussed above raise substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from these uncertainties. 
    
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had no off-balance sheet arrangements.   
    
  Inflation 
    
  Management does not believe inflation had a significant effect on the condensed consolidated financial statements for the periods presented.   

-   19  - 

Critical Accounting Policies 
    
  There have been no changes to our critical accounting policies during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  Critical accounting policies and the significant estimates made in accordance with such policies are regularly discussed with our Audit Committee.  Those policies are discussed under    Critical Accounting Policies    in our    Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations    included in Item 7, as well as in our consolidated financial statements and the footnotes thereto for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015  , as filed with the SEC with our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed on   March 17, 2016  . 

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
    
  As a    smaller reporting company    as defined by the rules and regulations of the SEC, we are not required to provide this information.   

Item 4. Controls and Procedures 
    
  Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
    
  The Company s management, with the participation of the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company s disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of   September 30, 2016  . Based on such evaluation, the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of   September 30, 2016  , the Company s disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC s rules and forms and are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including the Company s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  
    
  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
    
  No change in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the fiscal quarter ended   September 30, 2016   that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.   

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION 

Item 1. Legal Proceedings 
    
  On July 23, 2015, UTC Associates Inc. ( UTC ) filed suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against the Company (the  UTC Litigation ). On September 22, 2015, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. On October 13, 2015, in response to the Company s motion, UTC filed an amended complaint. On November 2, 2015, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint. On February 1, 2016, the Court partially granted and partially denied the dismissal motion. The Court dismissed with prejudice the fraud claim and declined to dismiss the   two   breach of contract claims. The UTC Litigation involved allegations that Glowpoint failed to pay amounts allegedly due under a Technology Development   Operations Outsourcing arrangement dated June 30, 2010 (the  Proposal ). UTC sought monetary damages totaling   $2,107,000  , including   $1,107,000   for damages arising from the breach of an alleged guaranteed minimum provision, and   $1,000,000   for damages arising from the breach of an alleged exclusivity provision. On April 1, 2016, the Company filed its answer to UTC s Complaint and asserted counterclaims against UTC, including for breach of contract, fraud in the inducement, fraud in the execution and fraud, pursuant to which the Company was seeking a judgment awarding monetary damages against UTC in an amount to be determined at trial, voiding the Proposal ab initio and awarding the Company its costs and disbursements, including attorneys  fees, incurred in defending the action.  On April 25, 2016, UTC filed an answer to the Company s counterclaims, denying such counterclaims and asserting purported defenses to them. 
    
  On September 30, 2016, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with UTC related to claims that have been or could have been asserted against one another, including but not limited to claims in the UTC Litigation.  Pursuant to the settlement agreement, (i) the Company paid $325,000 to UTC on September 30, 2016; (ii) the Company and UTC entered into a new services agreement pursuant to which the Company will purchase services from UTC subject to certain terms and conditions set forth therein; and (iii) the Company issued 600,000 shares of the Company s common stock to UTC on October 14, 2016.  The value of the common stock, or $168,000 (equal to 600,000 shares multiplied by the closing price of the Company s stock of $0.30 per share on September 30, 2016), was recorded in accrued expenses and other liabilities as of September 30, 2016 and as stock-based

expense in general and administrative expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016.  Upon payment and delivery of the foregoing, both the Company and UTC dismissed their respective claims in the UTC Litigation, and each party has released the other party of all potential claims against the other party, including those that were or could have been asserted in the UTC Litigation.  

Item 1A. Risk Factors 
    
  A description of the risks associated with our business, financial conditions and results of operations is set forth in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015   and filed with the SEC on   March 17, 2016  .  There have been no material changes to these risks during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .   

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds 
    
  There have been no unregistered sales of securities during the period covered by this Report that have not been previously reported in a Current Report on Form 8-K.  The Company has not made any purchases of its own securities during the time period covered by this Report.   

Item 3. Defaults upon Senior Securities 
    
  The Main Street Loan Agreement contains certain financial covenants that are measured on a quarterly basis. The Company breached its debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio covenant as of June 30, 2016 and   September 30, 2016   and breached the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant as of   September 30, 2016  , each of which constitutes an event of default under the Main Street Loan Agreement.  See further discussion in Note 6 to our condensed consolidated financial statements.

  CERTIFICATION OF CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER 
  I, Peter Holst, certify that: 
           1. 
    I have reviewed this quarterly report on Form 10-Q of Glowpoint, Inc.; 
              2. 
    Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the period covered by this report; 
              3. 
    Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report; 
              4. 
    The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have: 
              (a) 
    Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared; 
              (b) 
    Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; 
              (c) 
    Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation;  and 
              (d) 
    Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant s most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant s fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant s internal control over financial reporting. 
              5. 
    The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant's auditors and the audit committee of the registrant's board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions): 
              (a) 
    All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and  
              (b) 
    Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting.
