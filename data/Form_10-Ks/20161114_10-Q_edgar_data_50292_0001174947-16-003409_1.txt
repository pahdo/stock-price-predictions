       INTERIM RESULTS AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION:     

The accompanying unaudited financial statements as of September
23, 2016 and September 25, 2015 and for the six and three months then ended have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles ( GAAP ) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q. In
the opinion of management, the unaudited financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the annual financial statements
and reflect all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly the financial position
as of September 23, 2016 and September 25, 2015 and the results of operations and cash flows for the six and three months then
ended. The financial data and other information disclosed in these notes to the interim financial statements related to these periods
are unaudited. The results for the six and three months ended September 23, 2016, are not necessarily indicative of the results
to be expected for any subsequent quarter or the entire fiscal year. The balance sheet at March 25, 2016 has been derived from
the audited financial statements at that date. 

Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included
in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to the rules and regulations of
the Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ). The Company believes, however, that the disclosures in this report
are adequate to make the information presented not misleading in any material respect. The accompanying financial statements should
be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and notes thereto of IEH Corporation for the fiscal year ended March
25, 2016 included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K as filed with the SEC and the attached Management s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 

Note 2-

  (Unaudited)  

Note 2-    
       SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:  (continued)     

Description of Business:  (continued)   

The customers of the Company services are in the following
markets: Government, Military, Aerospace, Medical, Automotive, Industrial, Test Equipment and Commercial Electronics. The Company
appears on the Military Qualified Product Listing  QPL  to MIL-DTL-55302 and supply customer requested modifications
to this specification. Sales to the Commercial Electronic and Military markets were 39% and 53%, respectively, of the Company s
net sales for the year ended March 25, 2016. The Company s offering of  QPL  items has recently been expanded
to include additional products. 

In order to remain competitive, the Company has an internal
program to upgrade, add and maintain machinery, review material costs and increase labor force productivity. We recently purchased
several machines to increase the productivity of certain processes. This will help us meet this goal. 

Business New Product Development:  

The Company is sought after by many of its customers to
design and manufacture custom connectors. This has created many new products that are innovative designs and employ new technologies.
The Company continues to be successful because of its ability to assist its customers and create a new design, including engineering
drawing packages, in a relatively short period of time. We will continue to support our customers to the best of our ability. 

The circular product line of connectors introduced several
years ago for the medical industry continues to be very rewarding for the Company. The line has been expanded to include connector
cable assemblies utilizing the circular connectors. 

A new product line featuring high density connectors is
being added to the Company s product offering. This offering should be available within the next few months. The Company
expects the new product line to generate additional revenue. 

The standard printed circuit board connectors we produce
are continually being expanded and utilized in many of the military programs being built today. We have recently received approval
for additional products that we can offer under the Military Qualified Product Listing  QPL.  

Accounting Period:  

The Company maintains an accounting period based upon a
52-53 week year, which ends on the nearest Friday in business days to March 31. The year ended March 25, 2016 was comprised of
52 weeks. The current fiscal year, ending on March 31, 2017, will be comprised of 53 weeks.

Note 2-    
       SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:  (continued)     

Revenue Recognition:   

Revenues are recognized at the shipping date of the Company's
products. The Company has historically adopted the shipping terms that title to merchandise passes to the customer at the shipping
point (FOB Shipping Point). At this juncture, title has passed, the Company has recognized the sale, inventory has been relieved,
and the customer has been invoiced. The Company does not offer any discounts, credits or other sales incentives. 

The Company s policy with respect to customer returns
and allowances as well as product warranty is as follows: 

The Company will accept a return of defective product within
one year from shipment for repair or replacement at the Company s option. If the product is repairable, the Company at its
own cost, will repair and return it to the customer. If unrepairable, the Company will either offer an allowance against payment
or will reimburse the customer for the total cost of product. 

Most of the Company s products are custom ordered
by customers for a specific use. The Company provides engineering services as part of the relationship with its customers in developing
the custom product. The Company is not obligated to provide such engineering service to its customers. The Company does not invoice
its customers separately for these services. 

Inventories:  

Inventories are stated at cost, on a first-in, first-out
basis which does not exceed market value. 

The Company manufactures products pursuant to specific technical
and contractual requirements. 

The Company historically purchases material in excess of
its requirements to avail itself of favorable pricing as well as the possibility of receiving additional orders from customers.
This excess may result in material not being used in subsequent periods, which may result in this material being deemed obsolete. 

The Company annually reviews its purchase and usage activity
of its inventory of parts as well as work in process and finished goods to determine which items of inventory have become obsolete
within the framework of current and anticipated orders. The Company based upon historical experience has determined that if a part
has not been used and purchased or an item of finished goods has not been sold in three years, it is deemed to be obsolete. The
Company estimates which materials may be obsolete and which products in work in process or finished goods may be sold at less than
cost. A periodic adjustment, based upon historical experience, is made to inventory in recognition of this impairment.

Note 2-    
       SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES: ( continued )     

Concentration of Credit Risk:  

Financial instruments which potentially subject the Company
to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents and accounts receivable. 

Under the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform
and Consumer Protection Act that was signed into law on July 21, 2010, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) will permanently
insure all accounts maintained with each financial institution up to $250,000 in the aggregate. 

As of September 23, 2016, the Company had funds on deposit
in the amount of $1,514,177 in one financial institution comprised of the following: 

The Company has not experienced any losses in such accounts
and believes its cash balances are not exposed to any significant risk. 

Property, Plant and Equipment:  

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated
depreciation and amortization. The Company provides for depreciation and amortization using the Double Declining Balance method
over the estimated useful lives (5-7 years) of the related assets. 

Maintenance and repair expenditures are charged to operations,
and renewals and betterments are capitalized. Items of property, plant and equipment, which are sold, retired or otherwise disposed
of, are removed from the asset and accumulated depreciation or amortization accounts. Any gain or loss thereon is either credited
or charged to operations. 

Income Taxes:  

The Company follows the policy of treating investment tax
credits as a reduction in the provision for federal income tax in the year in which the credit arises or may be utilized. Deferred
income taxes arise from temporary differences resulting from different depreciation methods used for financial and income tax purposes.
The Company has adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC )
Topic 740,  Income Taxes,  which includes the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ( SFAS )
No. 109,  Accounting for Income Taxes.

Note 2-    
       SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES: ( continued )     

Net Income Per Share:  

The Company has adopted the provisions of ASC Topic 260,
 Earnings per Share,  which includes the provisions of SFAS No. 128,  Earnings Per Share,  which requires the
disclosure of  basic  and  diluted  earnings (loss) per share. Basic earnings per share is computed by
dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each period. Diluted earnings per share
is similar to basic earnings per share except that the weighted average number of common shares outstanding is increased to reflect
the dilutive effect of potential common shares, such as those issuable upon the exercise of stock or warrants, as if they had been
issued. For the six and three months ended September 23, 2016 and September 25, 2015, respectively, there were no items of potential
dilution that would impact on the computation of diluted earnings or loss per share. 

Fair Value of Financial Instruments:  

The carrying value of the Company s financial instruments,
consisting of accounts receivable, accounts payable, and borrowings, approximate their fair value due to the relatively short maturity
(three months) of these instruments. 

Use of Estimates:  

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues
and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Actual amounts could
differ from those estimates. 

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets:  

The Company has adopted the provisions of ASC Topic, 360,
 Property, Plant and Equipment-Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets  which includes the provisions of SFAS No. 144,
 Accounting for The Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,  and requires that long-lived assets and certain identifiable
intangibles to be held and used by an entity be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that
the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The Company has adopted SFAS No. 144. There were no long-lived asset impairments
recognized by the Company for the six and three months ended September 23, 2016 and September 25, 2015, respectively.

Reporting Comprehensive Income:  

The Company has adopted the provisions of ASC Topic, 220,
 Comprehensive Income  which includes the provisions of SFAS No. 130,  Reporting Comprehensive Income.  This Statement
established standards for reporting and display of comprehensive income and its components (revenues, expenses, gains and losses)
in an entity s financial statements. This Statement requires an entity to classify items of other comprehensive income by
their nature in a financial statement and display the accumulated balance of other comprehensive income separately from retained
earnings and additional paid-in capital in the equity section of a statement of balance sheet. There were no material items of
comprehensive income to report for the six and three months ended September 23, 2016 and September 25, 2015, respectively. 

Segment Information:  

The Company has adopted the provisions of ASC Topic, 280,
 Segment Reporting  which includes the provisions of SFAS No. 131,  Disclosures About Segment of An Enterprise and Related
Information.  This Statement requires public enterprises to report financial and descriptive information about its reportable
operating segments and establishes standards for related disclosures about product and services, geographic areas, and major customers.
The adoption of ASC Topic 280 did not affect the Company s presentation of its results of operations or financial position. 

Research and Development:  

The Company provides personalized engineering services to
its customers by designing connectors for specific customer applications. The employment of electromechanical engineers is the
anticipated cornerstone of the Company s future growth. The Company maintains a testing laboratory where its engineers experiment
with new connector designs based on changes in technology and in an attempt to create innovative, more efficient connector designs. 

The Company did not expend any funds on nor receive any
revenues related to customer sponsored research and development activities relating to the development of new designs, techniques
and the improvement of existing designs during the six and three months ended September 23, 2016 and September 25, 2015, respectively.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements:  

The Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB )
has issued certain accounting standards updates as of June 24, 2016 that will become effective in subsequent periods. The Company
believes that none of those updates would have significantly affected the Company s financial accounting measures or disclosures
had they been in effect during the six and three months ended September 23, 2016 and September 25, 2015, and it does not believe
that any of those pronouncements will have a significant impact on the Company s financial statements at the time that they
become effective. 

Note 3-    
       INVENTORIES:     

Inventories are stated at cost, on a first-in, first-out
basis, which does not exceed market value. 

The Company manufactures products pursuant to specific technical
and contractual requirements. The Company historically purchases material in excess of its requirements to avail itself of favorable
pricing as well as the possibility of receiving additional orders from customers. This excess may result in material not being
used in subsequent periods, which may result in this material being deemed obsolete. 

The Company annually reviews its purchase and usage activity
of its inventory of parts as well as work in process and finished goods to determine which items of inventory have become obsolete
within the framework of current and anticipated orders. The Company based upon historical experience has determined that if a part
has not been used and purchased or an item of finished goods has not been sold in three years, it is deemed to be obsolete. 

The Company estimates which materials may be obsolete and
which products in work in process or finished goods may be sold at less than cost. A periodic adjustment, based upon historical
experience, is made to inventory in recognition of this impairment. 

Inventories were comprised of the following:

(as defined in the financing agreement) at an interest rate of 2.5% above JP Morgan Chase s publicly announced rate with
a minimum rate of 12% per annum. The financing agreement has an initial term of one year and will automatically renew for successive
one-year terms, unless terminated by the Company or the Factor upon receiving 60 days prior notice. Funds advanced by the Factor

Forward-Looking Statements  

This report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning
of Section 21E of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ) and Section 27A of the Securities
Act of 1933 (the  Securities Act ). Statements contained in this report which are not statements of historical facts
may be considered forward-looking information with respect to plans, projections, or future performance of the Company as defined
under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties
which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. The words  anticipate ,  believe ,
 estimate ,  expect ,  objective , and  think  or similar expressions used herein
are intended to identify forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements are based on the Company s current views
and assumptions and involve risks and uncertainties that include, among other things, the effects of the Company s business,
actions of competitors, changes in laws and regulations, including accounting standards, employee relations, customer demand, prices
of purchased raw material and parts, domestic economic conditions, including housing starts and changes in consumer disposable
income, and foreign economic conditions, including currency rate fluctuations. Some or all of the facts are beyond the Company s
control. 

Except as may be required by applicable law, we do not undertake
or intend to update or revise our forward-looking statements, and we assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements
contained in this report as a result of new information or future events or developments. Thus, you should not assume that our
silence over time means that actual events are bearing out as expressed or implied in such forward-looking statements. You should
carefully review and consider the various disclosures we make in this report and our other reports filed with the SEC that attempt
to advise interested parties of the risks, uncertainties and other factors that may affect our business. The following discussion
and analysis should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and related footnotes included elsewhere in this quarterly
report which provide additional information concerning the Company s financial activities and condition. 

Critical Accounting Policies  

The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which require the Company to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and revenues and expenses during
the periods reported. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Company believes the following are the critical accounting
policies, which could have the most significant effect on the Company's reported results and require the most difficult, subjective
or complex judgments by management. 

Impairment of Long-Lived Assets:  

 The Company reviews its long-lived assets for impairment
whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If the sum of the expected
cash flows, undiscounted and without interest, is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized
as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. The Company makes estimates of its future cash
flows related to assets subject to impairment review.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations  (continued)   

Critical Accounting Policies  (continued)   

Inventory Valuation:  

 Raw materials and supplies are stated at cost on first-in,
first-out basis, which does not exceed market value. Finished goods and work in process are valued at the lower of actual cost,
determined on a specific identification basis, or market. The Company estimates which materials may be obsolete and which products
in work in process or finished goods may be sold at less than cost, and adjusts their inventory value accordingly. Future periods
could include either income or expense items if estimates change and for differences between the estimated and actual amount realized
from the sale of inventory. 

Income Taxes:  

 The Company records a liability for potential tax assessments
based on its estimate of the potential exposure. Due to the subjectivity and complex nature of the underlying issues, actual payments
or assessments may differ from estimates. Income tax expense in future periods could be adjusted for the difference between actual
payments and the Company's recorded liability based on its assessments and estimates. 

Revenue Recognition:  

 Revenues are recognized at the shipping date of the Company's
products. The Company has historically adopted the shipping terms that title merchandise passes to the customer at the shipping
point (FOB Shipping Point). At this juncture, title has passed, the Company has recognized the sale, inventory has been relieved,
and the customer has been invoiced. The Company does not offer any discounts, credits or other sales incentives. 

The Company s policy with respect to customer returns
and allowances as well as product warranty is as follows: 

The Company will accept a return of defective product
within one year from shipment for repair or replacement at the Company s option. If the product is repairable, the Company
at its own cost will repair and return it to the customer. If unrepairable, the Company will either offer an allowance against
payment or will reimburse the customer for the total cost of the product. 

Most of the Company s products are custom ordered
by customers for a specific use. The Company provides engineering services as part of the relationship with its customers in developing
the custom product. The Company is not obligated to provide such engineering service to its customers. The Company does not charge
separately for these services. 

Research   Development:  

 The Company provides personalized engineering services
to its customers by designing connectors for specific customer applications. The employment of electromechanical engineers is the
anticipated cornerstone of the Company s future growth. The Company maintains a testing laboratory where its engineers experiment
with new connector designs based on changes in technology and in an attempt to create innovative, more efficient connector designs.

The following table sets forth for the periods indicated, percentages
for certain items reflected in the financial data as such items relate to the revenues of the Company: 

Operating revenues for the six months ended September 23, 2016
amounted to $9,719,421 reflecting a 5.35% decrease versus $10,269,162 for the six months ended September 25, 2015. The
decrease in revenues for the current six-month period can be attributed to lower sales in the current first quarter as
compared to the first quarter of the prior year.

Comparative Analysis - Six Months Ended September 23, 2016 and
September 25, 2015  (continued)   

Cost of products sold were $6,091,642 for the six months ended September
25, 2015, or 62.67% of operating revenues. This reflected a $532,507 or 8.04% decrease in the cost of products sold from $6,624,149
or 64.51% of operating revenues for the six months ended September 25, 2015. The decrease in cost of products sold can be attributed
to the decrease in sales in the first quarter. 

Selling, general and administrative expenses were $1,821,165 or
18.74% of operating revenues for the six months ended September 23, 2016 compared to $1,466,634 or 14.28% of operating revenues
for the six months ended September 25, 2015. This category of expense increased by $354,731 or 24.19% from the prior six month
period. The increase can be attributed to an increase in operating expenses inclusive of expenses incurred for a Company sponsored
conference for all of its sales representatives during the first quarter of the current fiscal year. 

Interest expense was $37,483 for the six months ended September
23, 2016 or .39% of operating revenues. For the fiscal six months ended September 25, 2015, interest expense was $10,120 or .10%
of operating revenues. The increase can be attributed to increased advances from the Factor during the quarter ended September
23, 2016. 

Depreciation and amortization of $157,800 or 1.62% of operating
revenues was reported for the six months ended September 23, 2016 as compared to the six month period ended September 25, 2015
of $158,000 or 1.54% of operating revenues. 

The Company reported net income of $874,247 for the six months ended
September 23, 2016 representing basic earnings of $.38 per share as compared to net income of $882,025 or $.38 per share for the
six months ended September 25, 2015. Net income for the current six month period decreased slightly as compared to the net income
for the prior year s six months.

Results of Operations  (continued)   

Operating revenues for the three months ended September 23, 2016
amounted to $5,259,784, reflecting a 3.25% increase when compared to revenues of $5,094,267 for the three months ended September
25, 2015. The increase was due to an increase in commercial billings. 

Cost of products sold were $3,257,646 for the three months ended
September 23, 2016, or 61.93% of operating revenues. This reflected a $149,868 or 4.40% decrease in the cost of products sold from
$3,407,514 or 66.89% of operating revenues for the three months ended September 25, 2015. The decrease in cost of goods sold can
be attributed to the Company s array of products shipped during the three months ended September 23, 2016. 

Selling, general and administrative expenses were $914,648 or 17.39%
of operating revenues for the three months ended September 23, 2016 compared to $788,811 or 15.48% of operating revenues for the
three months ended September 25, 2015. This category of expense increased by $125,837 or 15.95% from the prior comparable three
month period. The increase in this category of expenses was primarily due to an increase in sales commissions. 

Interest expense was $25,971 for the three months ended September
23, 2016 or .49% of operating revenues. For the fiscal three months ended September 25, 2015, interest expense was $5,620 or .12%
of operating revenues. Interest expenses increased by $20,351 or 362.12% over the comparable prior period. The increase can be
attributed to increased advances from the Factor during the current quarter. 

Depreciation and amortization of $72,000 or 1.37% of operating revenues
was reported for the three months ended September 23, 2016 as compared to the three month period ended September 25, 2015, in which
depreciation and amortization of $75,000 or 1.92% of operating revenues was reported. 

The Company reported net income of $536,651 for the three months
ended September 23, 2016 representing basic earnings of $.23 per share as compared to net income of $135,422 or $.06 per share
for the three months ended June 26, 2015. The increase in net income for the current three month period can be attributed primarily
to the cumulative effect of the aforementioned differences.

Liquidity and Capital Resources  

The Company reported working capital of $12,331,725 as of September
23, 2016 compared to a working capital of $11,659,016 as of March 25, 2016. The increase in working capital of $672,709 was attributable
to the following items: 

As a result of the above, the current ratio (current assets to current
liabilities) was 9.22 to 1 at September 23, 2016 as compared to 11.40 to 1 at March 25, 2016. Current liabilities at September
23, 2016 were $1,500,648 compared to $1,121,523 at March 25, 2016. 

For the six months ended September 23, 2016, the Company reported
$359,313 in capital expenditures and depreciation of $157,800. 

The net income of $874,247 for the six months ended September 23,
2016 resulted in an increase in total stockholders  equity to $14,454,815 as compared to total stockholders  equity
of $13,580,568 at March 25, 2016. 

The Company has an accounts receivable financing agreement with
a non-bank lending institution ( Factor ) whereby it can borrow up to 80 percent of its eligible receivables (as defined
in the financing agreement) at an interest rate of 2.5% above JP Morgan Chase s publicly announced prime rate with a minimum
rate of 12% per annum. 

The financing agreement has an initial term of one year and will
automatically renew for successive one-year terms, unless terminated by the Company or its lender upon receiving 60 days prior
notice. 

Funds advanced by the Factor are secured by the Company s
accounts receivable and inventories. At September 23, 2016, the Company reported excess payments to the Factor of $335,963. The
Company reported excess payment to the Factor of $186,114 at March 25, 2016. These excess payments are reported in the accompanying
financial statements as  Excess payments to accounts receivable factor.  

Amendment to Accounts Receivable Financing Agreement.
 Effective November 1, 2016, the Company and the Factor executed an amendment to the accounts receivable financing agreement
dated March 14, 1990 to provide that (i) the applicable interest under such agreement is reduced from 12% to 6% per annum; and
(ii) the current term of such agreement is extended to March 14, 2018 provided that each subsequent renewal term shall remain
one (1) year thereafter in accordance with the terms of the agreement. 

In the past two fiscal years management has been reviewing
its collection practices and policies for outstanding receivables and has revised its collection procedures to a more aggressive
collection policy. As a consequence of this new policy the Company s experience is that its customers have been remitting
payments on a more consistent and timely basis. The Company reviews the collectability of all accounts receivable on a monthly
basis. The reserve is less than 2% of average gross accounts receivable and is considered to be conservatively adequate.

On August 31, 2011, the Company s shareholders approved the
adoption of the Company s 2011 Equity Incentive Plan ( 2011 Plan ) to provide for the grant of stock options
and restricted stock awards to purchase up to 750,000 shares of the Company s common stock to all employees, consultants
and other eligible participants including senior management and members of the Board of Directors of the Company. The 2011 Plan
replaced the prior 2002 Employee Stock Option Plan which had expired on its terms. 

Options granted to employees under the 2011 Plan may be designated
as options which qualify for incentive stock option treatment under Section 422A of the Internal Revenue Code, or options which
do not qualify (non-qualified stock options). 

Under the 2011 Plan, the exercise price of an option designated
as an incentive stock option shall not be less than the fair market value of the Company s common stock on the day the option
is granted. In the event an option designated as an incentive stock option is granted to a ten percent (10%) or greater shareholder,
such exercise price shall be at least 110 percent (110%) of the fair market value of the Company s common stock and the option
must not be exercisable after the expiration of five years from the day of the grant. The 2011 Plan also provides that holders
of options that wish to pay for the exercise price of their options with shares of the Company s common stock must have beneficially
owned such stock for at least six months prior to the exercise date. 

Exercise prices of non-incentive stock options may be less than
the fair market value of the Company s common stock. The aggregate fair market value of shares subject to options granted
to a participant(s), which are designated as incentive stock options, and which become exercisable in any calendar year, shall
not exceed $100,000.

Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations  (continued)    

Liquidity and Capital Resources
 (continued)   

On July 1, 2015, our Board of Directors granted 245,000 options
to purchase shares of the Company s common stock under the 2011 Plan as follows: (i) Michael Offerman, our Chief Executive
Officer, was granted 75,000 options; (ii) Robert Knoth, our Chief Financial Officer, was granted 50,000 options; (iii) four non-executive
officer key employees were granted 110,000 options; and (iv) each of our non-management directors, Allen Gottlieb and Gerald Chafetz,
was granted 5,000 options. The stock options (i) have a ten-year term; (ii) have an exercise price equal to the fair market value
of the Company s common stock as determined under the 2011 Plan, as reported in the OTCBB, on the date of grant ($6.00),
except that the options granted to Michael Offerman has an exercise price equal to 110% of such fair market value because he owns
ten percent (10%) or greater of the Company s outstanding common stock; and (iii) were all immediately vested. In the event
of the termination of each recipient s employment by, or association with, the Company (as applicable), the options will
remain exercisable in accordance with the terms of the 2011 Plan. 

Effective July 15, 2016, the Board of Directors of the Company
unanimously voted to increase the number of directors from three to six directors and elected David Offerman as a Class II director
and Dr. Sonia Marciano and Eric C. Hugel as Class II Directors. 

Effective August 15, 2016, the Board of Directors
also approved the granting of stock options to purchase shares of the Company s common stock under the 2011 Plan to
each of Dr. Marciano and Mr. Hugel as follows: Each of the new non-management directors will receive a grant of options
totaling 5,000 shares each subject to the following vesting schedule: (i) 1,000 shares will vest immediately (August 15,
2016); (ii) 2,000 shares will vest on August 15, 2017; and (iii) 2,000 shares will vest on August 15, 2018. The stock options
(i) have a ten-year term; and (ii) have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the Company s common stock
as determined under the 2011 Plan, as reported in the OTCBB, on the date of grant ($5.30). In the event of the termination
of each recipient s association with the Company, the options will remain exercisable in accordance with the terms of
the 2011 Plan. 

The table below summarizes the option awards for the named executive
officers and non-management directors: 

The Company intends to provide additional information regarding
the compensation awarded to the named executive officers and non-management directors in respect of and during the fiscal year
ended March 25, 2016, in the proxy statement for the Company s 2016 annual meeting of stockholders. 

In 1987, the Company adopted the Cash Bonus Plan for executive officers.
Contributions to the Cash Bonus Plan are made by the Company only after pre-tax operating profits exceed $150,000 for a fiscal
year, and then to the extent of 10% of the excess of the greater of $150,000 or 25% of pre-tax operating profits. The Company accrued
$171,700 for the six months ended September 23, 2016. For the year ended March 25, 2016, the Company s contribution was $227,700.

PART I: FINANCIAL INFORMATION  

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market
Risk  

We are a  smaller reporting company  as defined by Regulation
S-K and as such, are not required to provide this information contained in this item pursuant to Regulation S-K. 

We do not believe that any of our financial instruments have significant
risk associated with market sensitivity. For more information on these investments see Note 2 to our financial statements included
in this Form 10-Q. We are not exposed to significant financial market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and
are only minimally impacted by changes in interest rates. We have not used, and currently do not contemplate using, any derivative
financial instruments. 

Interest Rate Risk   

 At any time, fluctuations in interest rates could affect interest
earnings on our cash and marketable securities. We believe that the effect, if any, of reasonably possible near term changes in
interest rates on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows would not be material. Currently, we do not hedge
these interest rate exposures. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve capital. We have not used derivative
financial instruments in our investment portfolio. 

As of September 23, 2016, our unrestricted cash was $1,514,177 of
which $888,235 was in an interest bearing money market account with and the balance of $625,942 was maintained in non-interest
bearing checking accounts used to pay operating expenses. 

Item 4. Controls and Procedures  

Based on an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company s
 disclosure controls and procedures  (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), the Company s
Chief Executive Officer (who is also our President) and its Chief Financial Officer (who is also our controller and principal accounting
officer) have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Report on Form 10-Q, the Company s disclosure controls
and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company
in this Report that it files or submit under the Exchange Act is, recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified within the SEC s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management,
including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief
Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal controls will prevent all errors
and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance
that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are
resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations
in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud,
if any, within our Company have been detected. Our management, however, believes our disclosure controls and procedures are in
fact effective to provide reasonable assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. In connection with their review
and assessment of our disclosure controls and procedures, the Company has retained the services of an outside consultant to further
assist management in its annual evaluation of such controls and procedures. There have been no changes in our internal control
over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a   15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended September 23, 2016
that have been materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal controls over financial reporting.

PART II: OTHER INFORMATION  

Item 1. Legal Proceedings   

The Company is not a party to or aware of any pending or threatened
legal proceedings which, in the opinion of the Company s management, would result in any material adverse effect on its results
of operations or its financial condition. 

Item 1a. Risk Factors  

You should carefully consider the risks described
below, together with all of following risk factors and the other information included in this report, in considering our business
herein as well as the information included in other reports and prospects. The risks and uncertainties described below are not
the only ones facing our Company. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial
also may impair our business operations, financial condition and/or operating results. If any of the matters or events described
in the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be harmed. In such case,
the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment due to any of these risks. 

Risks Related to Our Business  

Failure to increase our revenue and keep our expenses consistent
with revenues could prevent us from achieving and maintaining profitability.  

We have generated net income of $1,690,110, $1,809,555, and $1,453,707,
respectively, for the fiscal years ended March 25, 2016, March 27, 2015, and March 28, 2014 and $874,247 for the six months ended
September 23, 2016. We have expended, and will continue to be required to expend, substantial funds to pursue product development
projects, enhance our marketing and sales efforts and to effectively maintain business operations. Therefore, we will need to generate
higher revenues to achieve and maintain profitability and cannot assure you that we will be profitable in any future period. 

Our capital requirements are significant and we have historically
partially funded our operations through the financing of our accounts receivable.  

We have an existing accounts receivable financing agreement with
a non-lending institution ( Factor ) whereby we can borrow up to 80 percent of our eligible receivables at an interest
rate of 2.5% above JP Morgan Chase s publicly announced prime rate. No assurances can be given that this financing agreement
will continue into the future. If we are unable to continue with this agreement, our cash flow might adversely be affected.

PART II: OTHER INFORMATION  

Our success is dependent on the performance of our management
and the cooperation, performance and retention of our executive officers and key employees.   

Our business and operations are substantially dependent on the performance
of our senior management team and executive officers. If our management team is unable to perform it may adversely impact our results
of operations and financial condition. We do not maintain  key person  life insurance on any of our executive officers.
The loss of one or several key employees could seriously harm our business. Any reorganization or reduction in the size of our
employee base could harm our ability to attract and retain other valuable employees critical to the success of our business. 

If we lose key personnel or fail to integrate replacement personnel
successfully, our ability to manage our business could be impaired.   

Our future success depends upon the continued service of our key
management, technical, sales, finance, and other critical personnel. We cannot assure you that we will be able to retain them.
Key personnel have left our Company in the past and there likely will be additional departures of key personnel from time to time
in the future. The loss of any key employee could result in significant disruptions to our operations, including adversely affecting
the timeliness of product releases, the successful implementation and completion of Company initiatives, the effectiveness of our
disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting, and the results of our operations. In addition,
hiring, training, and successfully integrating replacement sales and other personnel could be time consuming, may cause additional
disruptions to our operations, and may be unsuccessful, which could negatively impact future revenues. 

Our reported financial results could be adversely affected by
changes in financial accounting standards or by the application of existing or future accounting standards to our business as it
evolves.   

As a result of the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the review
of accounting policies by the SEC and national and international accounting standards bodies, the frequency of accounting policy
changes may accelerate. Possible future changes to accounting standards, could adversely affect our reported results of operations. 

Risks Related to Our Common Stock  

Our stock price is volatile and could decline; we have a very
limited trading market.   

The price of our common stock has been, and is likely to continue
to be, volatile. For example, our stock price during the fiscal year ended March 25, 2016 traded as low as $2.76 per share and
as high as $5.99 per share. During the six month period ended September 23, 2016, our common stock traded in the range of $5.25
per share to $6.79 per share. We cannot assure you that your initial investment in our common stock will not decline.
