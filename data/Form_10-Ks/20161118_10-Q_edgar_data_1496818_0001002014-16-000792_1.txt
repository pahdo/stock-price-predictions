1.           Nature of Operations and Continuance of Business 

Stealth Technologies, Inc. (formerly Excelsis Investments, Inc.) (the "Company") was incorporated in the state of Nevada on May 27, 2010 under the name "Pub Crawl Holdings, Inc". On June 14, 2010, the Company entered into an Assignment Agreement (the "Acquisition") with PB PubCrawl.com LLC ("PubCrawl"), a California limited liability company, whereby the Company acquired a 100% interest in the member shares of PubCrawl in exchange for 500,000 common shares of the Company. The Acquisition was accounted for in accordance with ASC 805-50, Related Issues, as the companies were under common control prior to acquisition. On September 3, 2012, the Company sold their rights to PubCrawl to the former President and Director of the Company.

On November 28, 2012, the Company acquired 100% of the members shares of Stealth Card Inc. (formerly Mobile Dynamic Marketing, Inc.) ("Stealth Card"), a company incorporated in the state of Florida on November 6, 2012, in exchange for the issuance of 1,000,000 common shares.  As part of the acquisition, the Company cancelled 15,000,000 issued and outstanding common shares held by the former President and Director of the Company and the management and directors of Stealth Card acquired 7,500,000 common shares of the Company in a private transaction with the former President and Director of the Company. Effectively, Stealth Card held 73% of the issued and outstanding common shares of the Company and the transaction has been accounted for as a reverse merger, where Stealth Card is deemed to be the acquirer for accounting purposes.

On July 13, 2013, the Company entered into a share exchange agreement with Career Start, Inc. ("Career"), a private corporation formed under the state of Florida on February 4, 2013.  Under the terms of the agreement, the Company acquired the net assets of Career in exchange for 4,714,286 common shares of the Company. The acquisition was between two related parties and has been accounted on a cost basis. On October 24, 2013, the Company effected a corporation name change to Excelsis Investments Inc.

On March 11, 2014, the Company announced its name change from Pub Crawl Holdings to Excelsis Investments, Inc.

On September 1, 2014, the Company entered into a purchase agreement with a non-related party to purchase intangible assets by issuing 30% of the outstanding common shares of the Company as determined on an as-converted, fully-diluted basis, which shall not be subject to dilution by any future issuances for the purchase of 3,000 customer accounts The Company is recognizing the revenue generated from the intangible asset on a net basis.

On November 5, 2014, the Company entered into share exchange agreement with a former officer of the Company in regards to common shares in the Company's wholly-owned subsidiaries, Career Start, Inc ("CSI") and Career Start Management ("CSM"), private corporations incorporated in the state of Florida and New York, respectively. Under the terms of the agreement, the Company received 3,111,429 shares of the Company held by the former officer in exchange for 100% of the issued and outstanding common shares of CSI and CSM. Subsequent to the disposal of the subsidiaries, the Company has turned its focus on the development and retail of stealth cards, a product meant to block RFID (Radio Frequency Identifier Signal) chipped cards from being read when placed in the correct orientation to help users secure their personal information.

On March 14, 2016, the Company incorporated a new wholly owned subsidiary, Safety Technologies Inc., a Nevada company. The Company's intention is to sell products other than the stealth cards, through the subsidiary. As at September 30, 2016, there has been no activity within the subsidiary.

On May 19, 2016, the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, Mobile Dynamic Marketing, Inc. changed its name to Stealth Card Inc.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements

(unaudited)

1.            Nature of Operations and Continuance of Business  (continued) 

These consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which implies that the Company will continue to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business. As at September 30, 2016, the Company has a working capital deficit of $1,505,976 and an accumulated deficit of $3,884,843. The continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon the continued financial support from its management, and its ability to identify future investment opportunities and obtain the necessary debt or equity financing, and generating profitable operations from the Company's future operations. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.

2.     Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

a)     Basis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation

The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("US GAAP") and are expressed in U.S. dollars. These consolidated financial statements comprise the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Safety Technologies Inc., a Nevada company. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated on consolidation.  The Company's fiscal year end is December 31.

b)          Interim Consolidated Financial Statements 

These interim unaudited consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the annual consolidated financial statements and in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods shown. The results of operations for such periods are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for a full year or for any future period.  These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements. Therefore, these financial statements should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and accompanying notes filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. 

c)            Accounts Receivable 

Accounts receivable represents amounts owed from customers for the sale of product. Amounts are presented net of the allowance for doubtful accounts, which represents the Company's best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in the existing accounts receivable balance. The Company determines allowance for doubtful accounts based upon historical experience and current economic conditions.  The Company reviews the adequacy of its allowance for doubtful accounts on a regular basis.  As of September 30, 2016, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had no allowances for doubtful accounts.

d)           Inventory 

Inventory is comprised of stealth cards purchased for resell, and is recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value on a first-in first-out basis.  The Company establishes inventory reserves for estimated obsolete or unsaleable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated realizable value based upon assumptions about future and market conditions.

e)      Intangible Assets

Intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortization and are comprised of customer accounts acquired with an useful life of three years and amortized straight line over three years and patent and trademark development costs, which are currently being developed and has not been placed in use. During the period ended September 30, 2016, the Company incurred $110,471 (2015 - $110,068) in amortization expense.

2.            Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  (continued) 

f)             Basic and Diluted Net Loss per Share 

The Company computes net loss per share in accordance with ASC 260,  Earnings per Share . ASC 260 requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share ("EPS") on the face of the income statement. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net loss available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of shares outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method and convertible preferred stock using the if-converted method. In computing diluted EPS, the average stock price for the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options or warrants. Diluted EPS excludes all dilutive potential shares if their effect is anti-dilutive. As at September 30, 2016, the Company had 15,211,557 (December 31, 2015   28,280,185) potentially dilutive common shares from potential shares issuable for outstanding convertible debentures.

g)      Revenue Recognition

The Company recognizes and accounts for revenue in accordance with ASC 605 as a principal on the sale of goods.  Pursuant to ASC 605,   Revenue Recognition,   revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the amount is fixed and determinable, risk of ownership has passed to the customer and collection is reasonably assured. The Company considered ASC 605-45, Principal Agent Considerations, and determined that the Company acts as a principal in its revenue-earnings activities as they are responsible for the production of goods purchased by the customer, can determine the pricing costs, goods purchased are paid directly by the Company, and has a credit risk with respect to collection of amounts owed by its customers. 

The Company considered ASC 605-45, Principal Agent Considerations, and determined that the Company does not act as the principal in its revenue-earnings activities related to certain service revenues   where the Company does not bear enough of the risks in the transaction to record them on the gross basis  .   Revenues for these activities are recorded based on the net amount earned by the Company.     

h)      Cost of Revenue

For the Company's product sales, cost of revenue consists of inventory sold in each transaction. For the Company's service sales, cost of revenue consists of engineering services provided by a related party.

4.      Derivative Liabilities

The Company records the fair value of the of the conversion price of the convertible debentures disclosed in Note 3 in accordance with ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging. The fair value of the derivative was calculated using a multi-nominal lattice model performed by an independent qualified business valuator. The fair value of the derivative liability is revalued on each balance sheet date with corresponding gains and losses recorded in the consolidated statement of operations. During the period September 30, 2016, the Company recorded a gain on the change in fair value of derivative liability of $418,878 (December 31, 2015   loss of $341,192). As at September 30, 2016, the Company recorded a derivative liability of $72,371 (December 31, 2015 - $491,249).

The following inputs and assumptions were used to value the convertible debentures outstanding during the period ended September 30, 2016:

The debtholder would redeem (with penalties of 0% to 50% depending on the date and full-partial redemption) based on availability of alternative financing of 70%, 80%, and 90%.

The debtholder would automatically convert note at maturity if the registration was effective and the Company is not in default.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates 

We prepared our financial statements and the accompanying notes in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which require management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. We identified certain accounting policies as critical based on, among other things, their impact on the portrayal of our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity and the degree of difficulty, subjectivity, and complexity in their deployment. Critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown. Management routinely discusses the development, selection, and disclosure of each of the critical accounting policies. The following is a discussion of our most critical accounting policies:

Use of Estimates 

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions related to the deferred income tax asset valuation allowances. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely from the Company's estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results, future results of operations will be affected.

Financial Instruments 

Pursuant to ASC 820,  Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures , an entity is required to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the level of independent, objective evidence surrounding the inputs used to measure fair value. A financial instrument's categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. ASC 820 prioritizes the inputs into three levels that may be used to measure fair value:

Level 1

Level 1 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2

Level 2 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data.

Level 3

Level 3 applies to assets or liabilities for which there are unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of the assets or liabilities.

The Company's financial instruments consist principally of cash, accounts receivable, accounts receivable   related party, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, accounts payable   related party, loans payable, amount due to related parties, convertible debenture, and loan payable   related party. Pursuant to ASC 820, the fair value of our cash is determined based on "Level 1" inputs, which consist of quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. We believe that the recorded values of all of our other financial instruments approximate their current fair values because of their nature and respective maturity dates or durations.

ITEM 3.                      QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. 

We are a smaller reporting company as defined by Rule 12b-2 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and are not required to provide the information under this item.

ITEM 4.                      CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, we have evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as required by Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(b) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, the Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer have concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures are not effective.

Management's assessment identified several material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. These material weaknesses include the following:

-

Insufficient number of qualified accounting personnel governing the financial close and reporting process

-

Lack of proper segregation of duties

There was no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the three months ended September 30, 2016 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II - OTHER INFORMATION.

ITEM 1.                      LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. 

a)

On February 19, 2016, unbeknownst to us, a $19,700 default judgment was rendered against us in the case of  George Sharp v. Xumanii et al. , Case No. 37-2013-00048310, pending in the Superior Court of the State of California.  We have filed a motion in that case to vacate the judgment alleging that we were never served with process and the Superior Court never had jurisdiction of the matter.  The motion is currently pending and the Court has not ruled upon the same.

b) 
 
 An action was initiated against us in  Scanner Guard Corporation v. Excelsis Investments, Inc. , et al., Case No. 16-516, pending in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania wherein Scanner Guard alleges that we made false statements about our stealth card.  The plaintiff is a manufacturer and distributor of radio frequency identification (RFID) chip protection cards which are in competition with our stealth cards. We filed an answer to Scanner's complaint, denying the allegations in Scanner's complaint and have asserted certain affirmative defenses.  We intend to vigorously defend this matter.

c) 
 
 An action was initiated against us  in The Marketing Source, Inc. v. Mobile Dynamic Marketing, Inc., a Florida corporation, et al , Case No. 2016-000823-CI, pending in the Circuit Court of the Sixth Judicial Circuit in and for Pinellas County, Florida wherein The Marketing Source alleges that we breached the terms a Marketing Agreement and as a result The Marketing Source is entitled to an unspecified amount of damages, an accounting, and an injunction.  We deny The Marketing Source's allegations and intend to vigorously defend this action.
