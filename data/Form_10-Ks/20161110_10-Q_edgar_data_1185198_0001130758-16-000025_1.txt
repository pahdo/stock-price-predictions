Upon liquidation of the Company or withdrawal by a Managing Member, the Managing Members will contribute to the Company an amount equal to the lesser of the deficit balances in their capital accounts or 1.01% of the total capital contributions of the Limited Members over the amount previously contributed by the Managing Members.

(3)  Real Estate Investments

In February 2015, the Company entered into an agreement to sell the property to an unrelated third party.  On April 20, 2015, the sale closed with the Company receiving net proceeds of $1,550,344, which resulted in a net gain of $424,001.  At the time of sale, the cost and related accumulated depreciation was $1,585,269 and $458,926, respectively.

(3)  Real Estate Investments   (Continued)

On June 9, 2015, the Company purchased a Fresenius Medical Center in Gretna, Louisiana for $3,456,892.  The Company allocated $922,252 of the purchase price to Acquired Intangible Lease Assets, representing in-place lease intangibles of $405,185 and above-market lease intangibles of $517,067. The Company incurred $105,145 of acquisition expenses related to the purchase that were expensed.  The property is leased to Bio-Medical Applications of Louisiana, a subsidiary of Fresenius Medical Care Holdings, Inc., under a Lease Agreement with a remaining primary term of 15.0 years (as of the date of purchase) and annual rent of $224,698.

In November 2015, the Company entered into an agreement to sell its 60% interest in the Sports Authority store in Wichita, Kansas to an unrelated third party.  In May 2016, the agreement was terminated by the buyer.  If the sale was completed, the Company expected to receive net sale proceeds of approximately $1,785,000.  Based on its long-lived asset valuation analysis, the Company determined the Sports Authority store was impaired.  As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2015, a charge to operations for real estate impairment of $637,438 was recognized, which was the difference between the carrying value at December 31, 2015 of $2,422,438 and the estimated fair value of $1,785,000.  The charge was recorded against the cost of the land and building.

On March 2, 2016, the tenant of the Sports Authority store, TSA Stores, Inc., and its parent company, The Sports Authority, Inc., the guarantor of the lease, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization.  In June 2016, the tenant filed a motion with the bankruptcy court to reject the lease for this store effective June 30, 2016, at which time the tenant returned possession of the property to the owners.   As of September 30, 2016, the tenant owed $29,049 of past due rent, which was not accrued for financial reporting purposes.  The owners have listed the property for lease with a real estate broker in the Wichita area.  While the property is vacant, the Company is responsible for its 60% share of real estate taxes and other costs associated with maintaining the property.  The annual rent from this property represents approximately 13% of the total annual rent of the Fund's property portfolio.  The loss of rent and increased expenses related to this property will decrease the Fund's cash flow.  Consequently, beginning with the third quarter of 2016, the Fund reduced its regular quarterly cash distribution rate from $12.85 per Unit to $10.27 per Unit.

(4)  Payable to AEI Fund Management, Inc.  

AEI Fund Management, Inc. performs the administrative and operating functions for the Company.  The payable to AEI Fund Management represents the balance due for those services.  This balance is non-interest bearing and unsecured and is to be paid in the normal course of business.

(5)  Discontinued Operations  

The tenant of the Johnny Carino's restaurants was experiencing financial difficulties and closed the restaurants in Pueblo, Colorado (October 2013) and Lake Charles, Louisiana (January 2014). On March 27, 2014, the tenant filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization.  Shortly thereafter, the tenant filed a motion with the bankruptcy court to reject the leases and returned possession of the properties to the Company.  As of the date of the bankruptcy filing, the tenant owed $97,680 of past due rent, which was not accrued for financial reporting purposes.  While the properties were vacant, the Company was responsible for the real estate taxes and other costs associated with maintaining the properties.  The Company submitted a Proof of Claim for damages to the bankruptcy court for each property.  The tenant's reorganization plan was approved by the bankruptcy court effective February 2, 2015.  In August 2015, the Company received payments totaling $137,474 on its claims from the plan.  In February 2016, the Company received final claim payments totaling $26,843.

In September 2013, the Company decided to sell both Johnny Carino's restaurants and classified them as Real Estate Held for Sale. On August 1, 2014, the Company sold the Lake Charles property to an unrelated third party.  In late March 2016, the Company entered into an agreement to sell the Pueblo property to an unrelated third party.  On August 4, 2016, the sale closed with the Company receiving net proceeds of $749,867, which resulted in a net gain of $99,867.  At the time of sale, the carrying value of the property was $650,000.

The financial results for these properties are reflected as Discontinued Operations in the accompanying financial statements.  The following are the results of discontinued operations:

(6)  Members' Capital  

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company declared distributions of $1,502,976 and $1,629,638, respectively.  The Limited Members received distributions of $1,458,897 and $1,585,799 and the Managing Members received distributions of $44,079 and $43,839 for the periods, respectively.  The Limited Members' distributions represented $35.96 and $38.69 per LLC Unit outstanding using 40,570 and 40,989 weighted average Units in 2016 and 2015, respectively.  The distributions represented $19.34 and $24.96 per Unit of Net Income and $16.62 and $13.73 per Unit of return of contributed capital in 2016 and 2015, respectively.

As part of the distributions discussed above, the Company distributed net sale proceeds of $50,505 and $252,525 in 2016 and 2015, respectively.  The Limited Members received distributions of $50,000 and $250,000 and the Managing Members received distributions of $505 and $2,525 for the periods, respectively.  The Limited Members' distributions represented $1.23 and $6.11 per Unit for the periods, respectively.

During the first nine months of 2016, the Company did not repurchase any Units from the Limited Members.  On April 1, 2015, the Company repurchased a total of 199.52 Units for $128,478 from 12 Limited Members in accordance with the Operating Agreement.  The Company acquired these Units using Net Cash Flow from operations.  The repurchases increase the remaining Limited Members' ownership interest in the Company.  As a result of these repurchases and pursuant to the Operating Agreement, the Managing Members received distributions of $3,973 in 2015.

(7)  Fair Value Measurements  

Fair value, as defined by US GAAP, is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in the principal or most advantageous market.  US GAAP establishes a hierarchy in determining the fair value of an asset or liability.  The fair value hierarchy has three levels of inputs, both observable and unobservable.  US GAAP requires the utilization of the lowest possible level of input to determine fair value.  Level 1 inputs include quoted market prices in an active market for identical assets or liabilities.   Level 2 inputs are market data, other than Level 1 inputs, that are observable either directly or indirectly.  Level 2 inputs include quoted market prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted market prices in an inactive market, and other observable information that can be corroborated by market data.  Level 3 inputs are unobservable and corroborated by little or no market data.

At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had no financial assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis or nonrecurring basis that would require disclosure.  The Company had the following nonfinancial assets measured on a nonrecurring basis that were recorded at fair value during 2016 and 2015.

(7)  Fair Value Measurements   (Continued)

The Sports Authority store in Wichita, Kansas with a carrying amount of $2,422,438 at December 31, 2015, was written down to its estimated fair value of $1,785,000 after completing our long-lived asset valuation analysis.  The resulting impairment charge of $637,438 was included in earnings for the fourth quarter of 2015.  The fair value of the property was based upon a signed purchase agreement, which is considered a Level 3 input in the valuation hierarchy.

ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

This section contains "forward-looking statements" which represent management's expectations or beliefs concerning future events, including statements regarding anticipated application of cash, expected returns from rental income, growth in revenue, the sufficiency of cash to meet operating expenses, rates of distribution, and other matters.  These, and other forward-looking statements, should be evaluated in the context of a number of factors that may affect the Company's financial condition and results of operations, including the following:

Market and economic conditions which affect the value of the properties the Company owns and the cash from rental income such properties generate; 

the federal income tax consequences of rental income, deductions, gain on sales and other items and the effects of these consequences for Members; 

resolution by the Managing Members of conflicts with which they may be confronted; 

the success of the Managing Members of locating properties with favorable risk return characteristics; 

the effect of tenant defaults; and 

the condition of the industries in which the tenants of properties owned by the Company operate. 

Application of Critical Accounting Policies

The Company's financial statements have been prepared in accordance with US GAAP.  Preparing the financial statements requires management to use judgment in the application of these accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions.  These judgments will affect the reported amounts of the Company's assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the dates of the financial statements and will affect the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods.  It is possible that the carrying amount of the Company's assets and liabilities, or the results of reported operations, will be affected if management's estimates or assumptions prove inaccurate.

Management of the Company evaluates the following accounting estimates on an ongoing basis, and has discussed the development and selection of these estimates and the management discussion and analysis disclosures regarding them with the managing member of the Company.

Page 12 of 20 

ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS.  (Continued)

Allocation of Purchase Price of Acquired Properties

Upon acquisition of real properties, the Company records them in the financial statements at cost.  The purchase price is allocated to tangible assets, consisting of land and building, and to identified intangible assets and liabilities, which may include the value of above market and below market leases and the value of in-place leases.  The allocation of the purchase price is based upon the fair value of each component of the property.  Although independent appraisals may be used to assist in the determination of fair value, in many cases these values will be based upon management's assessment of each property, the selling prices of comparable properties and the discounted value of cash flows from the asset.

The fair values of above market and below market in-place leases will be recorded based on the present value (using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases and (ii) an estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in-place leases measured over a period equal to the non-cancelable term of the lease including any bargain renewal periods.  The above market and below market lease values will be capitalized as intangible lease assets or liabilities.  Above market lease values will be amortized as an adjustment of rental income over the remaining term of the respective leases.  Below market leases will be amortized as an adjustment of rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases, including any bargain renewal periods.  If a lease were to be terminated prior to its stated expiration, all unamortized amounts of above market and below market in-place lease values relating to that lease would be recorded as an adjustment to rental income.

The fair values of in-place leases will include estimated direct costs associated with obtaining a new tenant, and opportunity costs associated with lost rentals which are avoided by acquiring an in-place lease.  Direct costs associated with obtaining a new tenant may include commissions, tenant improvements, and other direct costs and are estimated, in part, by management's consideration of current market costs to execute a similar lease.  These direct costs will be included in intangible lease assets on the balance sheet and will be amortized to expense over the remaining term of the respective leases.  The value of opportunity costs will be calculated using the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases over a market absorption period for a similar lease.  These intangibles will be included in intangible lease assets on the balance sheet and will be amortized to expense over the remaining term of the respective leases.  If a lease were to be terminated prior to its stated expiration, all unamortized amounts of in-place lease assets relating to that lease would be expensed.

The determination of the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired will require the use of significant assumptions with regard to the current market rental rates, rental growth rates, discount and capitalization rates, interest rates and other variables.  If management's estimates or assumptions prove inaccurate, the result would be an inaccurate allocation of purchase price, which could impact the amount of reported net income.

Page 13 of 20 

ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS.  (Continued)

Carrying Value of Properties

Properties are carried at original cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. The Company tests long-lived assets for recoverability when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.  For properties the Company will hold and operate, management determines whether impairment has occurred by comparing the property's probability-weighted future undiscounted cash flows to its current carrying value.  For properties held for sale, management determines whether impairment has occurred by comparing the property's estimated fair value less cost to sell to its current carrying value.  If the carrying value is greater than the net realizable value, an impairment loss is recorded to reduce the carrying value of the property to its net realizable value.  Changes in these assumptions or analysis may cause material changes in the carrying value of the properties.

Allocation of Expenses

AEI Fund Management, Inc. allocates expenses to each of the funds they manage primarily on the basis of the number of hours devoted by their employees to each fund's affairs.  They also allocate expenses at the end of each month that are not directly related to a fund's operations based upon the number of investors in the fund and the fund's capitalization relative to other funds they manage.  The Company reimburses these expenses subject to detailed limitations contained in the Operating Agreement.

Results of Operations

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recognized rental income from continuing operations of $1,823,871 and $1,843,926, respectively.  In 2016, rental income increased due to additional rent received from one property acquisition in 2015 and rent increases on five properties.  These increases were partially offset by decreases in rental income due to the sale of one property in 2015 and rent that was not received from the tenant of the Sports Authority store, as discussed below.  Based on the scheduled rent for the properties as of October 31, 2016, the Company expects to recognize rental income from continuing operations of approximately $2,385,000 and $2,255,000 in 2016 and 2017, respectively.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company incurred LLC administration expenses from affiliated parties of $231,442 and $271,009, respectively.  These administration expenses include costs associated with the management of the properties, processing distributions, reporting requirements and communicating with the Limited Members.  During the same periods, the Company incurred LLC administration and property management expenses from unrelated parties of $164,077 and $79,311, respectively.  These expenses represent direct payments to third parties for legal and filing fees, direct administrative costs, outside audit costs, taxes, insurance and other property costs.  These expenses were higher in 2016, when compared to 2015, as a result of expenses related to the Sports Authority store.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company incurred property acquisition expenses of $139,639 related to the purchase of the Fresenius Medical Center in Gretna, Louisiana.

ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS.  (Continued)

In November 2015, the Company entered into an agreement to sell its 60% interest in the Sports Authority store in Wichita, Kansas to an unrelated third party.  In May 2016, the agreement was terminated by the buyer.  If the sale was completed, the Company expected to receive net sale proceeds of approximately $1,785,000.  Based on its long-lived asset valuation analysis, the Company determined the Sports Authority store was impaired.  As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2015, a charge to operations for real estate impairment of $637,438 was recognized, which was the difference between the carrying value at December 31, 2015 of $2,422,438 and the estimated fair value of $1,785,000.  The charge was recorded against the cost of the land and building.

On March 2, 2016, the tenant of the Sports Authority store, TSA Stores, Inc., and its parent company, The Sports Authority, Inc., the guarantor of the lease, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization.  In June 2016, the tenant filed a motion with the bankruptcy court to reject the lease for this store effective June 30, 2016, at which time the tenant returned possession of the property to the owners.   As of September 30, 2016, the tenant owed $29,049 of past due rent, which was not accrued for financial reporting purposes.  The owners have listed the property for lease with a real estate broker in the Wichita area.  While the property is vacant, the Company is responsible for its 60% share of real estate taxes and other costs associated with maintaining the property.  The annual rent from this property represents approximately 13% of the total annual rent of the Fund's property portfolio.  The loss of rent and increased expenses related to this property will decrease the Fund's cash flow.  Consequently, beginning with the third quarter of 2016, the Fund reduced its regular quarterly cash distribution rate from $12.85 per Unit to $10.27 per Unit.

During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recognized gain on sale of real estate of $424,001.  In the fourth quarter of 2014, the Company decided to sell the Advance Auto store in Brownsville, Texas.  In February 2015, the Company entered into an agreement to sell the property to an unrelated third party.  On April 20, 2015, the sale closed with the Company receiving net proceeds of $1,550,344, which resulted in a net gain of $424,001.  At the time of sale, the cost and related accumulated depreciation was $1,585,269 and $458,926, respectively.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recognized interest income of $3,911 and $7,300, respectively.

If a property was classified as Real Estate Held for Sale at December 31, 2013, the Company included the results from operating and selling the property in discontinued operations under prior accounting guidance.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company recognized income from discontinued operations of $95,373, representing a gain on disposal of real estate of $99,867 and bankruptcy claim payments received of $26,843, which were partially offset by property management expenses of $31,337.  For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recognized income from discontinued operations of $85,086, representing bankruptcy claim payments received less property management expenses.

ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS.  (Continued)

The tenant of the Johnny Carino's restaurants was experiencing financial difficulties and closed the restaurants in Pueblo, Colorado (October 2013) and Lake Charles, Louisiana (January 2014). On March 27, 2014, the tenant filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization.  Shortly thereafter, the tenant filed a motion with the bankruptcy court to reject the leases and returned possession of the properties to the Company.  As of the date of the bankruptcy filing, the tenant owed $97,680 of past due rent, which was not accrued for financial reporting purposes.  While the properties were vacant, the Company was responsible for the real estate taxes and other costs associated with maintaining the properties.  The Company submitted a Proof of Claim for damages to the bankruptcy court for each property.  The tenant's reorganization plan was approved by the bankruptcy court effective February 2, 2015.  In August 2015, the Company received payments totaling $137,474 on its claims from the plan.  In February 2016, the Company received final claim payments totaling $26,843.

In September 2013, the Company decided to sell both Johnny Carino's restaurants and classified them as Real Estate Held for Sale. On August 1, 2014, the Company sold the Lake Charles property to an unrelated third party.  In late March 2016, the Company entered into an agreement to sell the Pueblo property to an unrelated third party.  On August 4, 2016, the sale closed with the Company receiving net proceeds of $749,867, which resulted in a net gain of $99,867.  At the time of sale, the carrying value of the property was $650,000.

Management believes inflation has not significantly affected income from operations.  Leases may contain rent increases, based on the increase in the Consumer Price Index over a specified period, which will result in an increase in rental income over the term of the leases.  Inflation also may cause the real estate to appreciate in value.  However, inflation and changing prices may have an adverse impact on the operating margins of the properties' tenants, which could impair their ability to pay rent and subsequently reduce the Net Cash Flow available for distributions.

Liquidity and Capital Resources

During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the Company's cash balances increased $694,813 as a result of cash generated from the sale of property, which was partially offset by distributions paid to the Members in excess of cash generated from operating activities.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company's cash balances decreased $2,178,395 as a result of cash used to purchase property, and distributions paid to the Members and cash used to repurchase Units in excess of cash generated from operating activities, which were partially offset by cash generated from the sale of property.

Net cash provided by operating activities increased from $1,487,741 in 2015 to $1,555,013 in 2016 as a result of a decrease in acquisition expenses in 2016 and net timing differences in the collection of payments from the tenants and the payment of expenses, which were partially offset by a decrease in total rental and interest income in 2016 and an increase in LLC administration and property management expenses in 2016.  During 2015, cash from operations was reduced by $139,639 of acquisition expenses related to the purchase of real estate.  Pursuant to accounting guidance, these expenses were reflected as operating cash outflows.  However, pursuant to the Company's Operating Agreement, acquisition expenses were funded with proceeds from property sales.

ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS.  (Continued)

The major components of the Company's cash flow from investing activities are investments in real estate and proceeds from the sale of real estate.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company generated cash flow from the sale of real estate of $749,867 and $1,550,344, respectively.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company expended $3,456,892 to invest in real properties as the Company reinvested cash generated from property sales completed in 2014 and 2015.

On June 9, 2015, the Company purchased a Fresenius Medical Center in Gretna, Louisiana for $3,456,892.  The property is leased to Bio-Medical Applications of Louisiana, a subsidiary of Fresenius Medical Care Holdings, Inc., under a Lease Agreement with a remaining primary term of 15.0 years (as of the date of purchase) and annual rent of $224,698.

The Company's primary use of cash flow, other than investment in real estate, is distribution payments to Members and cash used to repurchase Units.  The Company declares its regular quarterly distributions before the end of each quarter and pays the distribution in the first week after the end of each quarter.  The Company attempts to maintain a stable distribution rate from quarter to quarter.  The Company may repurchase tendered Units on April 1st and October 1st of each year subject to limitations.

For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company declared distributions of $1,502,976 and $1,629,638, respectively.  Pursuant to the Operating Agreement, distributions of Net Cash Flow were allocated 97% to the Limited Members and 3% to the Managing Members.  Distributions of Net Proceeds of Sale were allocated 99% to the Limited Members and 1% to the Managing Members.  The Limited Members received distributions of $1,458,897 and $1,585,799 and the Managing Members received distributions of $44,079 and $43,839 for the periods, respectively.

As part of the distributions discussed above, the Company distributed net sale proceeds of $50,505 and $252,525 in 2016 and 2015, respectively.  The Limited Members received distributions of $50,000 and $250,000 and the Managing Members received distributions of $505 and $2,525 for the periods, respectively.  The Limited Members' distributions represented $1.23 and $6.11 per Unit for the periods, respectively.

The Company may repurchase Units from Limited Members who have tendered their Units to the Company.  Such Units may be acquired at a discount.  The Company will not be obligated to purchase in any year more than 2% of the total number of Units outstanding on January 1 of such year.  In no event shall the Company be obligated to purchase Units if, in the sole discretion of the Managing Member, such purchase would impair the capital or operation of the Company.

During the first nine months of 2016, the Company did not repurchase any Units from the Limited Members.  On April 1, 2015, the Company repurchased a total of 199.52 Units for $128,478 from 12 Limited Members in accordance with the Operating Agreement.  The Company acquired these Units using Net Cash Flow from operations.  The repurchases increase the remaining Limited Members' ownership interest in the Company.  As a result of these repurchases and pursuant to the Operating Agreement, the Managing Members received distributions of $3,973 in 2015.

ITEM 2.  MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS.  (Continued)

The continuing rent payments from the properties, together with cash generated from property sales, should be adequate to fund continuing distributions and meet other Company obligations on both a short-term and long-term basis.

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements

As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had no material off-balance sheet arrangements that had or are reasonably likely to have current or future effects on its financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources.
