1. ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION 
  Organization 
  NuStar GP Holdings, LLC (NuStar GP Holdings) (NYSE: NSH) is a publicly held Delaware limited liability company. Unless otherwise indicated, the terms  NuStar GP Holdings,   NSH,   we,   our  and  us  are used in this report to refer to NuStar GP Holdings, LLC, to one or more of our consolidated subsidiaries or to all of them taken as a whole. 
    
  We have no operations or sources of income or cash flows other than our investment in NuStar Energy L.P. (NuStar Energy) (NYSE: NS). As of   September 30, 2016  , we owned approximately   15%   of NuStar Energy, consisting of the following: 
             
    the   2%   general partner interest; 
                
    100%   of the incentive distribution rights issued by NuStar Energy, which entitle us to receive increasing percentages of the cash distributed by NuStar Energy, currently at the maximum percentage of   23%  ; and 
        
  NuStar Energy is a publicly held Delaware limited partnership engaged in the transportation of petroleum products and anhydrous ammonia, the terminalling and storage of petroleum products and the marketing of petroleum products. NuStar Energy has terminal and storage facilities in the United States, Canada, Mexico, the Netherlands, including St. Eustatius in the Caribbean, and the United Kingdom. 
    
  Employee Transfer from NuStar GP, LLC.   On March 1, 2016, NuStar GP, LLC, our wholly owned subsidiary, transferred and assigned to NuStar Services Company LLC (NuStar Services Co), a wholly owned subsidiary of NuStar Energy, all of NuStar GP, LLC s employees and related benefit plans, programs, contracts and policies (the Employee Transfer). As a result of the Employee Transfer, NuStar Energy pays employee costs directly and sponsors the long-term incentive plan and other employee benefit plans. Please refer to Note 3 for a discussion of this transfer and our related party agreements and Note 11 for a discussion of the employee benefit plans and long-term incentive plan obligations transferred. 
    
  Basis of Presentation 
  These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NuStar GP Holdings and subsidiaries in which it has a controlling interest. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 
    
  We account for our ownership interest in NuStar Energy using the equity method. Therefore, our financial results reflect a portion of NuStar Energy s net income based on our ownership interest in NuStar Energy. We have no separate operating activities apart from those conducted by NuStar Energy and therefore generate no revenues from operations. 
    
  These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for interim financial information and with the instructions to the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and notes required by GAAP for complete consolidated financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included, and all disclosures are adequate. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature unless disclosed otherwise. Financial information for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   included in these Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements is derived from our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements. Operating results for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending   December 31, 2016  . The consolidated balance sheet as of   December 31, 2015   has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements as of that date. These unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Certain previously reported amounts in the 2015 consolidated financial statements and condensed notes have been reclassified to conform to 2016 presentation.

New Accounting Pronouncements 
  Statement of Cash Flows  . In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued amended guidance that clarifies how entities should present certain cash receipts and cash payments on the statement of cash flows, including but not limited to debt prepayment or debt extinguishment costs; contingent consideration payments made after a business combination; proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims and distributions received from equity method investees. The changes are effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and amendments should be applied retrospectively. We will adopt these provisions January 1, 2018, and we do not expect the guidance to have a material impact on our statements of cash flows or disclosures. 
    
  Unit-Based Payments.   In March 2016, the FASB issued amended guidance that simplifies certain aspects of accounting for unit-based payments to employees, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. The changes are effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and early adoption is permitted. The new requirements should be applied prospectively, retrospectively or using a modified retrospective transition method depending on the area affected by the amended guidance. We adopted this amended guidance effective January 1, 2016, which did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or disclosures. 
    
  Deferred Taxes.   In November 2015, the FASB issued amended guidance that requires deferred tax assets and liabilities to be classified as noncurrent on the balance sheet. The changes are effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016, using either a prospective or retrospective transition method, and early adoption is permitted. We will adopt these provisions on a prospective basis on January 1, 2017, and we do not expect the guidance to have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or disclosures. 

2. INVESTMENT IN NUSTAR ENERGY 
    
  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, NuStar Energy issued   595,050   common units representing limited partner interests at an average price of   $47.39   per unit. NuStar Energy received net proceeds of   $28.3 million  , which includes our contribution of   $0.6 million   in order to maintain our   2.0%   general partner interest. This issuance resulted in a gain of   $2.1 million   for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , which is included in  Other income (expense), net  on our consolidated statements of comprehensive income, and represents the increase in the value of our proportionate share of NuStar Energy s capital. 
    
  On January 2, 2015, NuStar Energy acquired full ownership of ST Linden Terminal, LLC, which owns a refined products terminal in Linden, NJ (the Linden Acquisition). Prior to the Linden Acquisition, the terminal operated as a joint venture between NuStar Energy and Linden Holding Corp, with each party owning   50%  .

3. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
    
  GP Services Agreement.   Prior to the Employee Transfer, NuStar GP, LLC managed the operations of NuStar Energy under a services agreement effective January 1, 2008 pursuant to which employees of NuStar GP, LLC performed services for NuStar Energy s U.S. operations. Employees of NuStar GP, LLC provided services to both NuStar Energy and NuStar GP Holdings; therefore, NuStar Energy reimbursed NuStar GP, LLC for all employee costs incurred prior to the Employee Transfer, other than the expenses allocated specifically to NuStar GP Holdings (the Holdco Administrative Services Expense). The Holdco Administrative Services Expense totaled   $0.4 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , and   $0.2 million   and   $1.3 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The following table summarizes information pertaining to related party transactions reimbursed by NuStar Energy: 

In conjunction with the Employee Transfer, NuStar GP, LLC entered into an Amended and Restated Services Agreement with NuStar Services Co, effective March 1, 2016 (the Amended GP Services Agreement).   The Amended GP Services Agreement provides that NuStar Services Co will furnish administrative services necessary to conduct our business. We will compensate NuStar Services Co for these services through an annual fee of $1.0 million, subject to adjustment based on the annual merit increase percentage applicable to NuStar Services Co employees for the most recently completed fiscal year and for changes in level of service.   The Amended GP Services Agreement will terminate on March 1, 2020 and will automatically renew for successive two-year terms, unless terminated by either party. We incurred administrative expenses related to the Amended GP Services Agreement of   $0.3 million   and   $0.6 million   for the three and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively,     which are reported in related party general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. 
    
  Assignment and Assumption Agreement.   Also on March 1, 2016 and in connection with the Employee Transfer, NuStar Services Co and NuStar GP, LLC entered into an Assignment and Assumption Agreement (the Assignment Agreement). Under the Assignment Agreement, NuStar GP, LLC assigned all of its employee benefit plans, programs, contracts, policies, and various of its other agreements and contracts with certain employees, affiliates and third-party service providers (collectively, the Assigned Programs) to NuStar Services Co. In addition, NuStar Services Co agreed to assume the sponsorship of and all obligations relating to the ongoing maintenance and administration of each of the plans and agreements in the Assigned Programs. 
    
  The following table summarizes the related party transactions and changes to amounts reported on our consolidated balance sheet as a result of the Employee Transfer on March 1, 2016 (thousands of dollars): 

Balance Sheet Items.   We had a payable to NuStar Energy of   $0.1 million   as of   September 30, 2016  , mainly comprised of service fees and expenses paid on behalf of NuStar GP Holdings. As of   December 31, 2015  , we had a receivable from NuStar

     Table of Contents  
  NUSTAR GP HOLDINGS, LLC AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued) 

Energy of   $14.8 million  , mainly comprised of payroll, employee benefit plan expenses and unit-based compensation prior to the Employee Transfer, and   none   as of   September 30, 2016  . We also had a long-term receivable from NuStar Energy as of   December 31, 2015   of   $32.1 million  , representing long-term employee benefits prior to the Employee Transfer, and   none   as of   September 30, 2016  .  

4. DISTRIBUTIONS FROM NUSTAR ENERGY 
    
  The following table reflects the allocation of NuStar Energy s cash distributions earned for the periods indicated among its general and limited partners: 

The following table summarizes information related to NuStar Energy s quarterly cash distributions: 

5. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 
    
  We segregate the inputs used in measuring fair value into three levels: Level 1, defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets; Level 2, defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets or quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; and Level 3, defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists. 
    
  As of December 31, 2015, NuStar Energy restricted and performance unit liabilities of   $3.8 million   were measured at fair value on a recurring basis and categorized as a Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy. As a result of the Employee Transfer, our consolidated balance sheet as of   September 30, 2016     no   longer reflects these liabilities, which were reported in  Accrued compensation expense  on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015. Please refer to Note 3 and Note 11 for a discussion of the employee-related obligations transferred.  
    
  We recognize cash equivalents, receivables, payables and short-term debt in our consolidated balance sheets at their carrying amounts. The fair values of these financial instruments approximate their carrying amounts. The fair value of our short-term debt would fall in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

6. STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS 
    
  Changes in current assets and current liabilities were as follows:    

The above changes in current assets and current liabilities differ from changes between amounts reflected in our consolidated balance sheets due to the non-cash related party transactions associated with the Employee Transfer. Please refer to Note 3 for further details. 
    
  Cash flows related to interest and income tax were as follows: 

7. CREDIT FACILITY 
  Our revolving credit facility dated June 28, 2013 currently has a borrowing capacity of up to   $50.0 million  , of which up to   $10.0 million   may be available for letters of credit. We amended this facility on June 16, 2016 to, among other things, extend its maturity to June 27, 2017.   Our obligations under our revolving credit facility are guaranteed by Riverwalk Holdings, LLC (Riverwalk), a wholly owned subsidiary of NuStar GP Holdings, LLC. Riverwalk has pledged a total of 2,107,918 NuStar Energy common units that it owns to secure its guarantee.   Borrowings under our revolving credit facility are used to fund capital contributions to NuStar Energy to maintain our   2%   general partner interest when NuStar Energy issues additional common units and to meet other liquidity and capital resource requirements. 
    
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had outstanding borrowings of   $30.0 million   and availability of   $20.0 million   for borrowings under our revolving credit facility.   Interest on our revolving credit facility is based upon, at our option, either an alternative base rate or a LIBOR-based rate  . As of   September 30, 2016  , the weighted-average interest rate was   2.6%  . 
    
  Our revolving credit facility requires that NuStar Energy's consolidated debt coverage ratio (as defined in our revolving credit agreement) not exceed 5.00-to-1.00.     We are also required to receive cash distributions each fiscal quarter of at least $16.0 million in respect of our ownership interests in NuStar Energy.   Our management believes that we are in compliance with the covenants in the revolving credit facility as of   September 30, 2016  .

8. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES  
  Contingencies 
  We are not currently a party to any material legal proceedings and have not recorded any accruals for loss contingencies. NuStar Energy is a party to claims and legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of its business, which it believes are not material to its financial position or results of operations. However, due to the inherent uncertainty of litigation, there can be no assurance that the resolution of any particular claim or proceeding would not have a material adverse effect on NuStar Energy s results of operations and ability to pay distributions, which would impact our results of operations and ability to pay distributions. 

9. MEMBERS  EQUITY 
    
  The following table presents changes to our members  equity (in thousands of dollars): 

Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss 
  The following table presents balances of and changes in accumulated other comprehensive loss by component:  

(a)  
    These amounts are components of net periodic pension cost (income), and prior to the Employee Transfer on March 1, 2016, NuStar Energy reimbursed us for these employee costs.  
              (b)  
    Represents the balance of accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the unrecognized components of net periodic benefit cost (income), net of income tax expense of   $2.4 million  , that was transferred to NuStar Services Co in connection with the Employee Transfer as described in Notes 3 and 11.

Cash Distributions

The following table summarizes information related to our quarterly cash distributions: 

10. NET INCOME PER UNIT 
    
  We treat restricted units granted under our long-term incentive plan as participating securities in computing net income per unit pursuant to the two-class method. Basic and diluted net income per unit are the same for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   because we have   no   potentially dilutive securities outstanding. 

11. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS AND UNIT-BASED COMPENSATION 
    
  Prior to the Employee Transfer, NuStar GP, LLC sponsored and maintained the following employee related benefit plans: 

The NuStar Thrift Plan (the Thrift Plan), a qualified employee profit-sharing plan; 
                
    The NuStar Excess Thrift Plan, a benefit plan to those employees whose compensation and/or annual contributions under the Thrift Plan are subject to the limitations applicable to qualified retirement plans; 
                
    The NuStar Pension Plan, a qualified non-contributory defined benefit pension plan; 
                
    The NuStar Excess Pension Plan, a benefit plan to a select group of management or other highly compensated employees (the NuStar Pension Plan and the NuStar Excess Pension Plan are collectively referred to as the Pension Plans);  
                
    The NuStar GP, LLC Retiree Welfare Benefits Plan, a medical benefits plan for certain retired employees; and 
        
  Prior to the Employee Transfer, NuStar Energy reimbursed NuStar GP, LLC for expenses incurred under these plans. Effective March 1, 2016, NuStar Services Co pays employee costs directly and assumed sponsorship and responsibility for the above employee related benefit plans. 
    
  Employee Benefit Plans 
  On March 1, 2016 and in conjunction with the Employee Transfer, we transferred to NuStar Services Co   $32.7 million   in benefit obligations associated with the Pension Plans and other postretirement benefit plans. As a result of the Employee Transfer, our consolidated balance sheet as of   September 30, 2016     no   longer reflects these liabilities, which were primarily reported in  Long-term liabilities  on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015. Additionally, we transferred an accumulated other comprehensive income balance related to the unrecognized components of net periodic benefit cost (income) of   $4.2 million  .

Unit-Based Compensation 
  On March 1, 2016, we transferred to NuStar Services Co all outstanding awards under the Amended 2000 LTIP, which represented   688,647   units, and removed the obligation related to these unit-based awards from our consolidated balance sheet. 
    
  We continue to sponsor and maintain the 2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the 2006 LTIP). Under the 2006 LTIP, NSH units may be awarded to NuStar GP Holdings employees, consultants and directors who perform services for us or our affiliates.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

OVERVIEW 
    
  NuStar GP Holdings, LLC (NuStar GP Holdings) (NYSE: NSH) is a publicly traded Delaware limited liability company. Unless otherwise indicated, the terms  NuStar GP Holdings,   we,   our  and  us  are used in this report to refer to NuStar GP Holdings, LLC, to one or more of our consolidated subsidiaries or to all of them taken as a whole. Our Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is presented in seven sections:

    New Accounting Pronouncements 
     Our only cash generating assets are our ownership interests in NuStar Energy L.P. (NuStar Energy), a publicly traded Delaware limited partnership (NYSE: NS). As of   September 30, 2016  , our aggregate ownership interests of approximately   15%   in NuStar Energy consisted of the following: 

the 2% general partner interest; 
                
    100% of the incentive distribution rights issued by NuStar Energy, which entitle us to receive increasing percentages of the cash distributed by NuStar Energy, currently at the maximum percentage of 23%; and 
      We account for our ownership interest in NuStar Energy using the equity method. Therefore, our financial results reflect a portion of NuStar Energy s net income based on our ownership interest. We have no separate operating activities apart from those conducted by NuStar Energy and therefore generate no revenues from operations. 
    
  NuStar Energy is engaged in the transportation of petroleum products and anhydrous ammonia, the terminalling and storage of petroleum products and the marketing of petroleum products. NuStar Energy has terminal and storage facilities in the United States, Canada, Mexico, the Netherlands, including St. Eustatius in the Caribbean, and the United Kingdom. 
    
  NuStar Energy s partnership agreement requires that it distribute all  Available Cash  to its partners each quarter, and this term is defined in its partnership agreement as cash on hand at the end of the quarter, plus certain permitted borrowings made subsequent to the end of the quarter, less cash reserves determined by NuStar Energy s board of directors. Similarly, we are required by our limited liability company agreement to distribute all of our available cash at the end of each quarter, less reserves established by our board of directors.

Recent Developments 
  Employee Transfer from NuStar GP, LLC.   On March 1, 2016, NuStar GP, LLC, our wholly owned subsidiary, transferred and assigned to NuStar Services Company LLC (NuStar Services Co), a wholly owned subsidiary of NuStar Energy, all of NuStar GP, LLC s employees and related benefit plans, programs, contracts and policies (the Employee Transfer). The Employee Transfer did not materially change our results of operations since NuStar Energy previously reimbursed us for nearly all of NuStar GP, LLC s employee costs. However, as a result of the Employee Transfer, NuStar Services Co pays employee costs directly and sponsors the long-term incentive plan and other employee benefit plans. Please refer to Note 3 of the Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1.  Financial Statements  for further discussion on the Employee Transfer. 
    
  Linden Acquisition.   On January 2, 2015, NuStar Energy acquired full ownership of ST Linden Terminal, LLC, which owns a refined products terminal in Linden, NJ (the Linden Acquisition). Prior to the Linden Acquisition, the terminal operated as a joint venture between NuStar Energy and Linden Holding Corp, with each party owning 50%.

     Table of Contents  

NuStar Energy s net income decreased $13.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015, mainly due to a reduction in operating income for its pipeline segment and an increase in its general and administrative expenses. 
  Equity in Earnings of NuStar Energy 
  The following table summarizes our equity in earnings of NuStar Energy: 

Our equity in earnings related to our general and limited partner interests in NuStar Energy decreased   $2.1 million     for the three months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   the three months ended September 30, 2015  , due to a decrease in NuStar Energy s net income. However, our equity in earnings of NuStar Energy related to our IDRs increased slightly since our IDRs in NuStar Energy entitle us to an increasing amount of NuStar Energy s cash distributions. NuStar Energy s total cash distributions increased as a result of its issuance of units in the third quarter of 2016. 
    
  Other Income (Expense), Net 
  Other income, net increased for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , due to NuStar Energy s issuance of 595,050 common units in the third quarter of 2016. This issuance resulted in a gain of $2.1 million representing the increase in the value of our proportionate share of NuStar Energy s capital.

TRENDS AND OUTLOOK  
    
  We expect our equity in earnings of NuStar Energy to increase or decrease consistent with NuStar Energy s earnings.  
    
  NuStar Energy believes that the fact that it provides both storage and pipeline services, for crude and refined products, to customers in sectors across the energy industry, throughout the country and around the world, offers some insulation from the impact of market fluctuations on its results of operations. Since high crude oil prices have tended to benefit NuStar Energy s producer customers, high prices have also correlated with increased demand for its crude oil pipeline services. On the other hand, depressed crude oil prices, when coupled with an industry expectation of higher prices in the future, or a contango market, has historically correlated with increased demand from trading companies for NuStar Energy s storage services. 
    
  Because of the geographic diversity of NuStar Energy s assets, its results of operations are not dependent on the regions or markets that have been hardest hit by depressed crude oil prices, the domestic shale play regions, which was demonstrated by the fact that, in 2015, revenue from NuStar Energy s Eagle Ford pipeline and storage assets constituted less than 16% of its total pipeline and storage segment revenue. Although NuStar Energy s assets in the Eagle Ford region have experienced lower throughputs as production has slowed, the fact that NuStar Energy has minimum volume throughput contracts with large, creditworthy customers has minimized the negative impact of that slowdown on its results of operations. 
    
  In addition to the diversity of NuStar Energy s customers, its assets, the services it offers and the markets it serves, NuStar Energy believes its contracts, many of which are long-term, take-or-pay arrangements for committed storage or throughput capacity, also help to blunt the impact of volatility of crude oil prices on its results of operations. In the locations at which NuStar Energy s assets are integrated physically with the refineries the assets serve, NuStar Energy believes the results generated by those assets depend to a greater degree on the refinery s continuing need to receive, store and transport the crude and refined products than on crude or refined product prices. 
    
  NuStar Energy s Pipeline Segment 
  NuStar Energy expects earnings for its pipeline segment to benefit from higher forecasted volumes on its refined product pipelines. However, NuStar Energy expects these increases to be more than offset by reduced throughput volumes on its Eagle Ford crude pipelines due to lower shale production in the South Texas region. Due to this reduction in volumes, NuStar Energy expects fourth quarter and full-year 2016 results to be lower than the comparable periods of 2015. 
    
  NuStar Energy s Storage Segment 
  NuStar Energy expects earnings at many of its terminals to benefit from favorable storage contract renewals and higher forecasted throughput volumes, but it expects these increases to be more than offset by higher maintenance expenses and lower throughputs at its Corpus Christi North Beach terminal. NuStar Energy expects lower earnings in the fourth quarter 2016, as compared to the same period in 2015, and comparable or higher earnings for the full-year 2016, as compared to 2015. 
    
  NuStar Energy s Fuels Marketing Segment 
  Although NuStar Energy expects full-year 2016 results to be lower than 2015 for its fuels marketing segment, fourth quarter 2016 results are expected to be slightly higher than the fourth quarter 2015 due to its bunker fuel operations. However, earnings in this segment, as in any margin-based business, are subject to many factors that can increase or reduce margins, which may cause the segment s actual results to vary significantly from NuStar Energy s forecast. 
    
  NuStar Energy s outlook for the partnership, both overall and for any of its segments, may change, as NuStar Energy bases its expectations on its continuing evaluation of a number of factors, many of which are outside its control. These factors include, but are not limited to, the state of the economy and the capital markets, changes to its customers  refinery maintenance schedules and unplanned refinery downtime, supply of and demand for crude oil, refined products and anhydrous ammonia, demand for its transportation and storage services and changes in laws or regulations affecting its assets.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 
    
  General 
  Our cash flows consist of distributions from NuStar Energy on our partnership interests, including the incentive distribution rights that we own. Due to our ownership of NuStar Energy s incentive distribution rights, our portion of NuStar Energy s total distributions may exceed our ownership interest in NuStar Energy. Our primary cash requirements are for distributions to members, capital contributions to maintain our 2% general partner interest in NuStar Energy in the event that NuStar Energy issues additional units, debt service requirements, if any, and general and administrative expenses. In addition, because NuStar GP, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of NuStar GP Holdings, elected to be treated as a taxable entity in August 2006, we may be required to pay income taxes, which may exceed the amount of tax expense recorded in the consolidated financial statements. We expect to fund our cash requirements primarily with the quarterly cash distributions we receive from NuStar Energy and, if necessary, borrowings under our revolving credit facility.  
  Cash Distributions from NuStar Energy 
  NuStar Energy distributes all of its available cash within 45 days following the end of each quarter based on the partnership interests outstanding as of a record date that is set after the end of each quarter. The following table reflects the cash distributions earned for the periods shown with respect to our ownership interests in NuStar Energy and our incentive distribution rights: 

Cash Flows for the   Nine   Months Ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015 
  Cash distributions received from NuStar Energy were $71.9 million for each of the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The cash distributions we received were used principally to fund distributions to our unitholders, totaling $70.2 million for each of the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
    
  Credit Facility 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had outstanding borrowings of   $30.0 million   and availability of   $20.0 million   for borrowings under our revolving credit facility.   Interest on our revolving credit facility is based upon, at our option, either an alternative base rate or a LIBOR-based rate  . As of   September 30, 2016  , the weighted-average interest rate was   2.6%  . Our management believes that we are in compliance with the covenants of our revolving credit facility as of   September 30, 2016  . Please refer to Note 7 of the Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1.  Financial Statements  for a more detailed discussion on our revolving credit facility. 
    
  Investment in NuStar Energy 
  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, NuStar Energy issued   595,050   common units representing limited partner interests at an average price of   $47.39   per unit. NuStar Energy received net proceeds of $28.3 million, which includes our contribution of   $0.6 million   in order to maintain our   2.0%   general partner interest.

     Table of Contents  

Cash Distributions to Unitholders 
  Our limited liability company agreement requires that, within 50 days after the end of each quarter, we distribute all of our available cash to the holders of record of our units on the applicable record date. Available cash is defined as all cash on hand at the end of any calendar quarter less the amount of cash reserves necessary or appropriate, as determined in good faith by our board of directors, to service debt we may incur, if any, and to fund general and administrative expenses, future distributions and other miscellaneous cash requirements. The following table reflects our cash distributions applicable to the period in which the distributions were earned: 

Contingencies 
  We are not currently a party to any material legal proceedings and have not recorded any accruals for loss contingencies. NuStar Energy is a party to claims and legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of its business, which it believes are not material to its financial position or results of operations. However, due to the inherent uncertainty of litigation, there can be no assurance that the resolution of any particular claim or proceeding would not have a material adverse effect on NuStar Energy s results of operations and ability to pay distributions, which would impact our results of operations and ability to pay distributions. 

RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
    
  Please refer to Note 3 of the Condensed Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 1.  Financial Statements  for a discussion of our related party transactions. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
    
  The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Our critical accounting policies are disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .

Item 3. 
    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
       
  Our only cash generating assets are our ownership interests in NuStar Energy, which we account for using the equity method. We have no material market risk other than those market risks affecting NuStar Energy, which could therefore affect the value of our investment. NuStar Energy is exposed to various market risks, including interest rate risk and commodity price risk. For a description of NuStar Energy s market risks and how it manages its exposure to those risks, please see Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  contained in NuStar Energy s Form 10-Q for the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  . 

Item 4. 
    Controls and Procedures 
       
           (a) 
    Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. 
     Our management has evaluated, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) as of the end of the period covered by this report, and has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of   September 30, 2016  . 
           (b) 
    Changes in internal control over financial reporting. 
     There has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our last fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
