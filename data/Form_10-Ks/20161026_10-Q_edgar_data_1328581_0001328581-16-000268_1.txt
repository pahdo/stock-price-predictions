Condensed Notes to Unaudited Quarterly Consolidated Financial Statements 

1. 
    Nature of Operations and Consolidation 
       
  Nature of Operations 
    
  Boise Cascade Company is a building products company headquartered in Boise, Idaho. As used in this Form 10-Q, the terms "Boise Cascade," "we," and "our" refer to Boise Cascade Company and its consolidated subsidiaries. We are one of the largest producers of engineered wood products (EWP) and plywood in North America and a leading U.S. wholesale distributor of building products.  
    
  We operate our business using   three   reportable segments: (1) Wood Products, which manufactures EWP, plywood,  ponderosa pine lumber, studs, and particleboard; (2) Building Materials Distribution, which is a wholesale distributor of building materials; and (3) Corporate and Other, which includes corporate support staff services, related assets and liabilities,  pension plan activity, and foreign currency exchange gains and losses. For more information, see Note 12, Segment Information. 
    
  Consolidation 
    
  The accompanying quarterly consolidated financial statements have not been audited by an independent registered public accounting firm but, in the opinion of management, include all adjustments necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations, and cash flows for the interim periods presented. Except as disclosed within these condensed notes to unaudited quarterly consolidated financial statements, the adjustments made were of a normal, recurring nature. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in our annual consolidated financial statements have been condensed or omitted. The quarterly consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Boise Cascade and its subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany balances and transactions. Quarterly results are not necessarily indicative of results that may be expected for the full year. These condensed notes to unaudited quarterly consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with our   2015   Form 10-K and the other reports we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). 

2. 
    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
       
  Accounting Policies 
    
  The complete summary of significant accounting policies is included in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" in our   2015   Form 10-K. 
    
  Use of Estimates 
    
  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events. These estimates and the underlying assumptions affect the amounts of assets and liabilities reported, disclosures about contingent assets and liabilities, and reported amounts of revenues and expenses. Such estimates include the valuation of accounts receivable, inventories, goodwill, intangible assets, and other long-lived assets; legal contingencies; guarantee obligations; indemnifications; assumptions used in retirement, medical, and workers' compensation benefits; stock-based compensation; fair value measurements; income taxes; and vendor and customer rebates, among others. These estimates and assumptions are based on management's best estimates and judgment. Management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors, including the current economic environment, which management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. We adjust such estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstances dictate. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from these estimates. Changes in these estimates resulting from continuing changes in the economic environment will be reflected in the consolidated financial statements in future periods.   
    
  Vendor and Customer Rebates and Allowances 
    
  We receive rebates and allowances from our vendors under a number of different programs, including vendor marketing programs. At   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , we had   $5.9 million   and   $7.7 million  , respectively, of  
  
    6 

     Table of Contents         

vendor rebates and allowances recorded in "Receivables, Other" on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Rebates and allowances received from our vendors are recognized as a reduction of "Materials, labor, and other operating expenses (excluding depreciation)" when the product is sold, unless the rebates and allowances are linked to a specific incremental cost to sell a vendor's product. Amounts received from vendors that are linked to specific selling and distribution expenses are recognized as a reduction of "Selling and distribution expenses" in the period the expense is incurred. 
    
  We also provide rebates to our customers and our customers' customers based on the volume of their purchases. We provide the rebates to increase the sell-through of our products. The rebates are recorded as a decrease in "Sales." At   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , we had   $34.4 million   and   $27.7 million  , respectively, of rebates payable to our customers recorded in "Accrued liabilities, Other" on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. 
    
  Leases 
    
  We lease a portion of our distribution centers as well as other property and equipment under operating leases. For purposes of determining straight-line rent expense, the lease term is calculated from the date we first take possession of the facility, including any periods of free rent and any renewal option periods we are reasonably assured of exercising. Rental expense for operating leases was   $4.6 million   and   $4.8 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $13.5 million   and   $13.8 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Sublease rental income was not material in any of the periods presented.  
    
  Inventories 
    
  Inventories included the following (work in process is not material): 

Property and Equipment 
    
  Property and equipment consisted of the following asset classes: 

As of   September 30, 2016  ,   $149.1 million   of property and equipment relates to two EWP facilities acquired by us on March 31, 2016. For more information, see Note 5, Acquisitions.

Fair Value 
    
  Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value hierarchy under GAAP gives the highest priority to quoted market prices (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3). In general, and where applicable, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities to determine fair value (Level 1). If quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities are not available to determine fair value, we use quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities or inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly (Level 2). If quoted prices for identical or similar assets are not available or are unobservable, we may use internally developed valuation models, whose inputs include bid prices, and third-party valuations utilizing underlying asset assumptions (Level 3). 
    
  Financial Instruments 
    
  Our financial instruments are cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable, long-term debt, and interest rate swaps. Our cash and restricted cash is recorded at cost, which approximates fair value, and our cash equivalents are money market funds measured at fair value. As of   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , we held   $98.4 million   and   $170.2 million  , respectively, in money market funds that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis using Level 1 inputs. The recorded values of accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate fair values based on their short-term nature. At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the book value of our fixed-rate debt was   $465.5 million   and   $300.0 million  , respectively, and the fair value was estimated to be   $474.6 million   and   $309.0 million  , respectively. The difference between the book value and the fair value is derived from the difference between the period-end market interest rate and the stated rate of our fixed-rate, long-term debt. We estimated the fair value of our fixed-rate debt using quoted market prices of our debt in inactive markets (Level 2 inputs). The interest rate on our term loans and revolving credit facility are based on market rates such as the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or a base rate. Because the interest rate on the term loans and revolving credit facility are based on current market rates, we believe that the estimated fair value of the outstanding balance on our term loans and revolving credit facility approximates book value. As discussed below, we also have interest rate swaps to mitigate our variable interest rate exposure, the fair value of which is measured based on Level 2 inputs. 
    
  Interest Rate Risk and Interest Rate Swaps 
    
  We are exposed to interest rate risk arising from fluctuations in variable-rate LIBOR on our term loans and when we have loan amounts outstanding on our revolving credit facility. Our objective is to limit the variability of interest payments on our debt. To meet this objective, management may enter into receive-variable, pay-fixed interest rate swaps to change the variable-rate cash flow exposure to fixed-rate cash flows. In accordance with our risk management strategy, we actively monitor our interest rate exposure and use derivative instruments from time to time to manage the related risk. We do not speculate using derivative instruments.  
    
  On February 16, 2016 and March 31, 2016, we entered into interest rate swap agreements with notional principal amounts of   $50.0 million   and   $75.0 million  , respectively, to offset risks associated with the variability in cash flows relating to interest payments that are based on one-month LIBOR. Under the interest rate swaps, we receive LIBOR-based variable interest rate payments and make fixed interest rate payments, thereby fixing the interest rate on   $125.0 million   of debt. Payments on the interest rate swaps with notional principal amounts of   $50.0 million   and   $75.0 million   are due on a monthly basis at a fixed rate of   1.007%   and   1.256%  , respectively, and expire in February 2022 and March 2022, respectively. The interest rate swap agreements were not designated as cash flow hedges, and as a result, all changes in the fair value are recognized in "Change in fair value of interest rate swaps" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations rather than through other comprehensive income. At   September 30, 2016  , we recorded a long-term asset of   $44 thousand   recorded in "Other assets" on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and a long-term liability of   $809 thousand   recorded in "Other long-term liabilities" on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, each representing the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements. The swaps were valued based on observable inputs for similar assets and liabilities and other observable inputs for interest rates and yield curves (Level 2 inputs).  
    
  Concentration of Credit Risk 
    
  We are exposed to credit risk related to customer accounts receivable. In order to manage credit risk, we consider customer concentrations and current economic trends and monitor the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations. At   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , receivables from two customers each accounted for approximately   12%   and   10%  , respectively, of total receivables. No other customer accounted for 10% or more of total receivables.

New and Recently Adopted Accounting Standards 
    
  In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230)  . This ASU is intended to reduce diversity in practice in how certain transactions are classified in the statement of cash flows. This new standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted, provided that all of the amendments are adopted in the same period. The guidance requires application using a retrospective transition method. We are evaluating the effect that this guidance will have on our consolidated statements of cash flows.     
    
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,   Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting  . This ASU simplifies several aspects of the accounting for employee share-based payment transactions, including the accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows. This new standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within that reporting period. Early adoption is permitted in any interim or annual period, with adjustments reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. We are evaluating the effect that this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.      
    
  In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,   Leases  . This amendment requires a lessee to recognize substantially all leases (whether operating or finance leases) on the balance sheet as a right-of-use asset and an associated lease liability. Short-term leases of 12 months or less are excluded from this amendment. For leases defined as finance leases under the new standard, the lessee subsequently recognizes interest expense and amortization of the right-of-use asset, similar to accounting for capital leases under current GAAP. For leases defined as operating leases under the new standard, the lessee subsequently recognizes straight-line lease expense over the life of the lease. This new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The guidance is to be applied using a modified retrospective transition method with the option to elect a package of practical expedients. The adoption of this ASU will result in a significant increase to our balance sheet for lease liabilities and right-of-use assets, which has not yet been quantified. We are currently evaluating this and the other effects of this ASU on our financial statements. 
    
  In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11,   Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory  . This ASU requires entities to measure most inventory "at the lower of cost or net realizable value," thereby simplifying the current guidance under which an entity must measure inventory at the lower of cost or market. Although the new standard is not effective until annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, early adoption is permitted. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material effect on our financial statements. 
    
  In May 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-07,   Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosures of Investments in Certain Entities That Calculate Net Asset Value per Share (or Its Equivalent).   This ASU removes the requirement to categorize within the fair value hierarchy all investments for which fair value is measured using the net asset value per share practical expedient. This ASU also removes the requirement to make certain disclosures for all investments that are eligible to be measured at fair value using the net asset value per share practical expedient. Although we adopted the new standard on January 1, 2016, there was no effect on our interim reporting periods. The adoption of this standard will affect certain pension asset disclosures in our annual reporting period and will have no impact on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. 
       
  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers  . This ASU requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The ASU will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in GAAP when it becomes effective. At its July 9, 2015, meeting, the FASB decided to delay the effective date of the revenue recognition standard by one year. The new standard is now effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. However, reporting entities may choose to adopt the standard as of the original effective date. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. We are evaluating the effect that this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. We have not yet selected a transition method nor have we determined the effect of the standard on our financial statements.

There were no other accounting standards recently issued that had or are expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and associated disclosures. 
    
  Reclassifications 
    
  Certain amounts in prior year's consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform with current year's presentation, none of which were considered material.

    Income Taxes 
       
  For the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we recorded   $5.5 million   and   $19.2 million  , respectively, of income tax expense and had an effective rate of   35.6%   and   36.0%  , respectively. For the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , we recorded   $12.6 million   and   $28.8 million  , respectively, of income tax expense and had an effective rate of   36.5%   and   36.6%  , respectively. During the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the primary reason for the difference between the federal statutory income tax rate of   35%   and the effective tax rate was the effect of state taxes, offset partially by other tax credits. During the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , the primary reason for the difference between the federal statutory income tax rate of   35%   and the effective tax rate was the effect of state taxes, offset partially by the domestic production activities deduction. 
    
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , refunds received, net of cash paid for taxes, were   $1.4 million   and   $4.9 million  , respectively.

  Basic net income per common share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Weighted average common shares outstanding for the basic net income per common share calculation includes certain vested restricted stock units (RSUs) as there are no conditions under which those shares will not be issued. Diluted net income per common share is computed by dividing net income by the combination of other potentially dilutive weighted average common shares and the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Other potentially dilutive weighted average common shares include the dilutive effect of stock options, RSUs, and performance stock units (PSUs) for each period using the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock method, the exercise price of a share, the amount of compensation expense, if any, for future service that has not yet been recognized, and the amount of tax benefits that would be recorded in additional paid-in capital, if any, when the share is exercised are assumed to be used to repurchase shares in the current period.  
    
  The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income per common share:  

The computation of the dilutive effect of other potential common shares excludes stock awards representing   0.2 million   shares and   no   shares of common stock, respectively, in the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , and   0.2 million   shares and   0.1 million   shares of common stock, respectively, in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . Under the treasury stock method, the inclusion of these stock awards would have been antidilutive.

    Acquisitions 
       
  On March 31, 2016, our wholly owned subsidiary, Boise Cascade Wood Products, L.L.C., completed the acquisition of Georgia-Pacific LLC's and certain of its affiliates' (collectively, "GP") EWP facilities located in Thorsby, Alabama, and Roxboro, North Carolina, for an aggregate purchase price of   $215.9 million  , including a post-closing adjustment of   $0.3 million   based upon a working capital target (the Acquisition). We funded the Acquisition and related costs with cash on hand, a new   $75.0 million   term loan, and a   $55.0 million   draw under our revolving credit facility. For additional information on the new term loan and draw under our revolving credit facility, see Note 7, Debt. Acquisition-related costs of   $3.6 million   are recorded in "General and administrative expenses" in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  
    
  These facilities complement our existing EWP business and position us to support customers as the U.S. housing recovery continues in the years ahead. The additional EWP capacity will also help us cost effectively deliver products to our customers in the eastern and southeastern United States. Sales, including sales to our Building Materials Distribution segment, and income from operations (excluding sales and marketing costs) from these facilities of   $49.0 million   and   $0.3 million  , respectively, were reported as part of the Wood Products segment for the period of April 1, 2016 through September 30, 2016.  
    
  Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price and related costs over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets of businesses acquired. The primary qualitative factor that contributed to the recognition of goodwill relates to additional capacity and an assembled workforce in key product lines to serve future and existing customers. The facilities are geographically located in a high growth housing area that allows us to optimize our mill system and realize freight and other cost synergies. All of the goodwill was assigned to the Wood Products segment and is deductible for U.S. income tax purposes. 
    
  The following table summarizes the final allocations of the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, based on our estimates of the fair value at the date of the Acquisition: 

Pro Forma Financial Information 
    
  The following pro forma financial information gives effect to the Acquisition as if it had occurred on January 1, 2015. The pro forma financial information also gives effect to the issuance of a   $75.0 million   term loan due March 30, 2026 and a   $55.0 million   draw under our revolving credit facility incurred to partially finance the Acquisition, as if such transactions had occurred on January 1, 2015. The pro forma results are intended for informational purposes only and do not purport to represent what our results of operations would actually have been had the Acquisition and related financing transactions occurred on January 1, 2015. They also do not reflect any revenue enhancements or cost savings, operating synergies, customer attrition, or incremental depreciation upon the restart of laminated veneer lumber assets at Roxboro.

  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , intangible assets represent the values assigned to trade names and trademarks and customer relationships. The trade names and trademarks have indefinite lives and are not amortized. The weighted-average useful life for customer relationships from the date of purchase is approximately   11   years. Amortization expense is expected to be approximately   $0.7 million   per year for the next five years.

Asset-Based Credit Facility 
    
  On May 15, 2015, Boise Cascade and its principal operating subsidiaries, Boise Cascade Wood Products, L.L.C., and Boise Cascade Building Materials Distribution, L.L.C., as borrowers, and Boise Cascade Wood Products Holdings Corp., Chester Wood Products LLC, and Moncure Plywood LLC, as guarantors, entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (Amended Agreement) with Wells Fargo Capital Finance, LLC, as administrative agent, and the banks named therein as lenders. The Amended Agreement includes a   $350 million   senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility (Revolving Credit Facility) maturing on April 30, 2020 and a   $50.0 million   term loan (ABL Term Loan) maturing on May 1, 2022. Interest on borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility and ABL Term Loan are payable monthly. Borrowings under the Amended Agreement are constrained by a borrowing base formula dependent upon levels of eligible receivables and inventory reduced by outstanding borrowings and letters of credit (Availability). On February 11, 2016, we entered into the second amendment to the Amended Agreement so that the LIBOR rate for the ABL Term Loan is determined and adjusted on a monthly basis rather than a daily basis. On June 30, 2016, we entered into a joinder and revolver increase agreement that increased the aggregate revolving commitments from   $350 million   to   $370 million  . Also on June 30, 2016, we entered into the third amendment to the Amended Agreement to make certain modifications to the definition of eligible accounts in the Amended Agreement to increase the concentration limit related to certain accounts owed to the borrowers for purposes of determining borrowing base.  
    
  The Amended Agreement is secured by a first-priority security interest in substantially all of our assets, except for property and equipment. The proceeds of borrowings under the agreement are available for working capital and other general corporate purposes. 
       
  The Amended Agreement contains customary nonfinancial covenants, including a negative pledge covenant and restrictions on new indebtedness, investments, distributions to equity holders, asset sales, and affiliate transactions, the scope of which are dependent on the Availability existing from time to time. The Amended Agreement also contains a requirement that we meet a   1  :1 fixed-charge coverage ratio (FCCR), applicable only if Availability falls below   10%   of the aggregate revolving lending commitments (or   $37 million  ). Availability exceeded the minimum threshold amounts required for testing of the FCCR at all times since entering into the Amended Agreement, and Availability at   September 30, 2016  , was   $354.8 million  . 
    
  The Amended Agreement generally permits dividends only if certain conditions are met, including complying with either (i) pro forma Excess Availability (as defined in the Amended Agreement) equal to or exceeding   25%   of the aggregate Revolver Commitments (as defined in the Amended Agreement) or (ii) (x) pro forma Excess Availability equal to or exceeding   15%   of the aggregate Revolver Commitment and (y) a fixed-charge coverage ratio of   1  :1 on a pro forma basis.  
    
    Revolving Credit Facility 
    
  Interest rates under the Revolving Credit Facility are based, at our election, on either LIBOR or a base rate, as defined in the Amended Agreement, plus a spread over the index elected that ranges from   1.25%   to   1.75%   for loans based on LIBOR  
  
    13 

     Table of Contents         

and from   0.25%   to   0.75%   for loans based on the base rate. The spread is determined on the basis of a pricing grid that results in a higher spread as average quarterly Availability declines. Letters of credit are subject to a fronting fee payable to the issuing bank and a fee payable to the lenders equal to the LIBOR margin rate. In addition, we are required to pay an unused commitment fee at a rate ranging from   0.25%   to   0.375%   per annum (based on facility utilization) of the average unused portion of the lending commitments.  
    
  At both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had   no   borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility and   $5.9 million   and   $5.6 million  , respectively, of letters of credit outstanding. These letters of credit and borrowings, if any, reduce Availability under the Revolving Credit Facility by an equivalent amount. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the minimum and maximum borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility were   zero   and   $101.5 million  , respectively, and the average interest rate on borrowings was approximately   1.71%  .   
    
  ABL Term Loan 
    
  The ABL Term Loan was provided by institutions within the Farm Credit system. Borrowings under the ABL Term Loan may be repaid from time to time at the discretion of the borrowers without premium or penalty. However, any principal amount of ABL Term Loan repaid may not be subsequently re-borrowed.  
    
  Interest rates under the ABL Term Loan are based, at our election, on either LIBOR or a base rate, as defined in the Amended Agreement, plus a spread over the index elected that ranges from   1.75%   to   2.25%   for LIBOR rate loans and from   0.75%   to   1.25%   for base rate loans, both dependent on the amount of Average Excess Availability (as defined in the Amended Agreement). During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the average interest rate on the ABL Term Loan was approximately   2.20%  . 
    
  We have received and expect to continue receiving patronage credits under the ABL Term Loan. Patronage credits are recorded as a reduction to interest expense in the year earned. After giving effect to expected patronage distributions, the effective average net interest rate on the ABL Term Loan was approximately   1.5%  . 
    
  Term Loan 
    
  On March 30, 2016 (Closing Date), Boise Cascade and its principal operating subsidiaries, Boise Cascade Wood Products, L.L.C., and Boise Cascade Building Materials Distribution, L.L.C., as borrowers, and the guarantors party thereto, entered into a term loan agreement (Term Loan Agreement) with American AgCredit, PCA, as administrative agent and sole lead arranger, and the banks named therein as lenders. The Term Loan Agreement was for a   $75.0 million   secured term loan (Term Loan). The outstanding principal balance of the Term Loan amortizes and is payable in equal installments of   $10 million   per year on each of the sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth anniversaries of the Closing Date. The remaining principal balance is due and payable on March 30, 2026. The Term Loan may be repaid from time to time at the discretion of the borrowers without premium or penalty. However, any principal amount of the Term Loan repaid may not be subsequently re-borrowed. Interest on our Term Loan is payable monthly. 
    
  Pursuant to the Term Loan Agreement, the borrowers are required to maintain, as of the end of any fiscal quarter, a Capitalization Ratio lower than   60%  , a Consolidated Net Worth greater than   $350 million  , and Available Liquidity greater than   $100 million   (each as defined in the Term Loan Agreement). In addition, under the Term Loan Agreement, and subject to certain exceptions, the borrowers may not, among other things, (i) incur indebtedness, (ii) incur liens, (iii) make junior payments, (iv) make certain investments, and (v) under certain circumstances, make capital expenditures in excess of   $50 million   during four consecutive quarters. The Term Loan Agreement also includes customary representations of the borrowers and provides for certain events of default customary for similar facilities. 
    
  Interest rates under the Term Loan Agreement are based, at our election, on either the LIBOR or a base rate, as defined in the Term Loan Agreement, plus a spread over the index. The applicable spread for the Term Loan ranges from   1.875%   to   2.125%   for LIBOR rate loans, and   0.875%   to   1.125%   for base rate loans, both dependent on our Interest Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Term Loan Agreement). The Term Loan was issued by three institutions within the Farm Credit system and will be eligible for patronage credits. During the period for which the Term Loan was outstanding, the average interest rate on the Term Loan was approximately   2.34%  . 
    
  We expect to receive patronage credits under the Term Loan. Patronage credits are distributions of profits from banks in the Farm Credit system, which are cooperatives that are required to distribute profits to their members. Patronage distributions, which are generally made in cash, are received in the year after they are earned. Patronage credits are recorded as  
  
    14 

     Table of Contents         

a reduction to interest expense in the year earned. After giving effect to expected patronage distributions, the effective average net interest rate on the Term Loan was approximately   1.6%  . 
    
  Proceeds from the Term Loan were used to partially finance the purchase of Georgia-Pacific LLC s engineered wood products facilities in Thorsby, Alabama and Roxboro, North Carolina (Acquired Facilities). The Term Loan is secured by a first priority mortgage on the Acquired Facilities and a first priority security interest on the equipment and certain tangible personal property located therein. For additional information on the Acquired Facilities, see Note 5, Acquisitions. 
    
  2020 Notes 
    
    On October 22, 2012, Boise Cascade and its wholly owned subsidiary, Boise Cascade Finance Corporation (Boise Finance and together with Boise Cascade, the Co-issuers), issued   $250 million   of   6.375%   senior notes due November 1, 2020 (2020 Notes) through a private placement that was exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (Securities Act). Interest on our 2020 Notes is payable semiannually in arrears on May 1 and November 1. On March 28, 2013, Boise Finance was merged with and into Boise Cascade, with Boise Cascade as the surviving entity and sole issuer of the 2020 Notes. The 2020 Notes are guaranteed by each of our existing and future direct or indirect domestic subsidiaries that is a guarantor or co-borrower under our Amended Agreement. 
    
  On August 15, 2013, we issued an additional   $50 million   in aggregate principal amount of 2020 Notes in a private placement that was exempt from registration under the Securities Act. The additional   $50 million   of 2020 Notes were priced at   103.5%   of their principal amount plus accrued interest from May 1, 2013, and were issued as additional 2020 Notes under the related indenture dated as of October 22, 2012.  
    
  On May 8, 2013 and November 26, 2013, we completed offers to exchange any and all of our   $250 million   and   $50 million  , respectively, outstanding 2020 Notes for a like principal amount of new   6.375%   Senior Notes due 2020 having substantially identical terms to those of the 2020 Notes.   $250 million   and   $49,990,000   in aggregate principal amount (or   100%   and   99.98%  , respectively) of the outstanding 2020 Notes were tendered and accepted for exchange upon closing of the related exchange offers and have been registered under the Securities Act. 
    
  In connection with the issuance of the   $350 million   of   5.625%   senior notes due September 1, 2024 (2024 Notes) described below, we commenced a tender offer to purchase any and all of our   $300.0 million   aggregate principal amount of 2020 Notes then outstanding. On August 29, 2016, we accepted for purchase an aggregate principal amount of   $184.5 million   of the 2020 Notes that were tendered. In connection with these transactions, we recognized a pre-tax loss on the extinguishment of debt of   $9.5 million   during the third quarter of 2016. The loss includes a   $7.6 million   tender premium paid and   $1.9 million   for the net write-off of a portion of the unamortized deferred financing costs and unamortized premium related to the 2020 Notes.  
    
  On August 29, 2016, we irrevocably instructed the trustee for the 2020 notes to issue a redemption notice to holders of the remaining   $115.5 million   in aggregate principal amount of the 2020 Notes outstanding and irrevocably deposited   $122.9 million   of cash received upon the issuance of the 2024 Notes, representing the remaining principal amount, call premium, and all interest payable through   November 1, 2016   (Redemption Date), with the trustee for the 2020 Notes. Upon our irrevocable redemption instructions and deposit, our obligations under the indenture pursuant to which the 2020 Notes were issued were satisfied and discharged, the indenture generally ceased to be of further effect, and we have no further obligations to the 2020 Notes holders. The 2020 Notes have been classified within "Current portion of long-term debt" and the cash on deposit has been recorded as "Restricted cash deposits with trustee," each on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of September 30, 2016.  
    
  On the Redemption Date, the trustee for the 2020 Notes will remit payment to holders of the 2020 Notes. Accordingly, we will recognize an additional pre-tax loss on the extinguishment of debt of   $4.8 million   in the fourth quarter of 2016 which includes a   $3.7 million   redemption premium and   $1.1 million   for the net write-off of the remaining unamortized deferred financing costs and unamortized premium to the 2020 Notes. 
    
  2024 Notes 
    
  On August 29, 2016, Boise Cascade issued the 2024 Notes through a private placement that was exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act. The 2024 Notes mature on September 1, 2024 with interest payable semiannually in arrears on March 1 and September 1, commencing on March 1, 2017. The 2024 Notes are guaranteed by each of our existing and future direct or indirect domestic subsidiaries that is a guarantor under our Amended Agreement.  

15 

     Table of Contents         

Following the sale of our 2024 Notes, as noted above, we used the net proceeds of the sale to repurchase or redeem any and all of the 2020 Notes, to pay fees and expenses related to the offering of the 2024 Notes and incurred in connection with the repurchase or redemption of the 2020 Notes, and for general corporate purposes. 
    
  The 2024 Notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with all of the existing and future senior indebtedness of Boise Cascade Company and of the guarantors, senior to all of their existing and future subordinated indebtedness, effectively subordinated to all of their present and future senior secured indebtedness (including all borrowings with respect to our Amended Agreement to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness), and structurally subordinated to the indebtedness of any subsidiaries that do not guarantee the 2024 Notes.  
    
  The terms of the indenture governing the 2024 Notes, among other things, limit the ability of Boise Cascade and our restricted subsidiaries to: incur additional debt; declare or pay dividends; redeem stock or make other distributions to stockholders; make investments; create liens on assets; consolidate, merge or transfer substantially all of their assets; enter into transactions with affiliates; and sell or transfer certain assets.  
    
  The indenture governing the 2024 Notes provides for customary events of default and remedies. 
    
  Interest Rate Swaps 
    
  For information on interest rate swaps, see Interest Rate Risk and Interest Rate Swaps of Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.  
       
  Cash Paid for Interest 
    
  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , cash payments for interest were   $16.2 million   and   $10.6 million  , respectively. 

8.    Retirement and Benefit Plans 
    
  The following table presents the pension benefit costs: 

During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we contributed   $3.3 million   in cash to the pension plans. For the remainder of   2016  , we expect to make approximately   $0.5 million   in additional cash contributions to the pension plans. 
    
    During the third quarter 2016, we offered a program whereby certain terminated vested participants and active employees of the Boise Cascade Company Pension Plan could elect to take a one-time voluntary lump-sum payment equal to the present value of future benefits. Active employees are required to retire on or before November 1, 2016 to receive their lump-sum benefits. This program closed on September 30, 2016 with participants electing lump-sum payments totaling approximately   $21 million  . Plan participants who elected to participate in the program will receive their lump-sum benefits on November 1, 2016. Settlement expense will be recorded in fourth quarter 2016.

    Stock-Based Compensation 
       
  In February 2016 and 2015, we granted   two   types of stock-based awards under the 2013 Incentive Plan: performance stock units (PSUs) and restricted stock units (RSUs).  
    
  PSU and RSU Awards 
       
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we granted   418,344   PSUs to our officers and other employees, subject to performance and service conditions. For the officers, the number of shares actually awarded will range from   0%   and   200%   of the target amount, depending upon Boise Cascade's 2016 return on invested capital (ROIC), determined in accordance with the related grant agreement. For the other employees, the number of shares actually awarded will range from   0%   to   200%   of the target amount, depending upon Boise Cascade s 2016 EBITDA, defined as income before interest (interest expense, interest income, change in fair value of interest rate swaps, and loss on extinguishment of debt), income taxes, and depreciation and amortization, determined in accordance with the related grant agreement. Because the ROIC and EBITDA components contain a performance condition, we record compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, over the requisite service period based on the most probable number of shares expected to vest.  
       
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , we granted   116,636   PSUs to our officers and other employees, subject to performance and service conditions. During the 2015 performance period, participants earned   63%   of the target based on Boise Cascade s 2015 EBITDA, determined by our Compensation Committee in accordance with the related grant agreement. 
    
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we granted an aggregate of   334,587   and   139,846   RSUs, respectively, to our officers, other employees, and nonemployee directors with only service conditions.  
    
  The PSUs granted to officers, if earned, generally vest over   one   to   three   year periods from the date of grant, while the PSUs granted to other employees vest in   three   equal tranches each year after the grant date. All PSU grants are subject to final determination of meeting the performance condition by the Compensation Committee of our board of directors. The RSUs granted to officers and other employees vest in   three   equal tranches each year after the grant date. The RSUs granted to nonemployee directors vest over a   one  -year period, provided that such vested shares will not be delivered to the directors until   six   months following termination from the board of directors.  
    
  We based the fair value of PSU and RSU awards on the closing market price of our common stock on the grant date, and we record compensation expense over the awards' vesting period. Any shares not vested are forfeited. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the total fair value of PSUs and RSUs vested was   $1.8 million   and   $3.2 million  , respectively. 
    
  The following summarizes the activity of our PSUs and RSUs awarded under the 2013 Incentive Plan for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  :

           (a) 
    Total PSUs forfeited during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   includes   40,726   shares related to the performance condition adjustment, as participants earned   63%   of the target based on Boise Cascade s 2015 EBITDA.

Compensation Expense 
    
  Stock-based compensation expense is recognized only for those awards that are expected to vest, with forfeitures estimated at the date of grant based on our historical experience and future expectations. We recognize the effect of adjusting the estimated forfeiture rates in the period in which we change such estimated rates. We recognize stock awards with only service conditions on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. Most of our share-based compensation expense was recorded in "General and administrative expenses" in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Total stock-based compensation recognized from PSUs, RSUs, and stock options net of estimated forfeitures, was as follows:    

The related tax benefit for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , was   $2.3 million   and   $1.6 million  , respectively. As of   September 30, 2016  , total unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested share-based compensation arrangements was   $10.6 million  , net of estimated forfeitures. This expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of   1.8   years. 

10.    Stockholders' Equity       
    
  Stock Repurchase 
    
  On February 25, 2015, our Board of Directors (Board) authorized a   two million   share repurchase program (Program) pursuant to which we may, from time to time, purchase shares of our common stock through various means including, without limitation, open market transactions, privately negotiated transactions, or accelerated share repurchase transactions. We are not obligated to purchase any shares and there is no set date that the Program will expire. The Board may increase or decrease the number of shares under the Program or terminate the Program in its discretion at any time. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we repurchased   180,100   shares under the Program at a cost of   $2.6 million  , or an average of   $14.62   per share. During 2015, we repurchased   722,911   shares under the Program at a cost of   $23.7 million  , or   $32.80   per share. The shares were purchased with cash on hand and are recorded as "Treasury stock" on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. As of   September 30, 2016  , there were   1,096,989   shares of common stock that may yet be purchased under the Program.

    Transactions With Related Party 
       
  Louisiana Timber Procurement Company, L.L.C. (LTP) is an unconsolidated variable-interest entity that is   50%   owned by us and   50%   owned by Packaging Corporation of America (PCA). LTP procures sawtimber, pulpwood, residual chips, and other residual wood fiber to meet the wood and fiber requirements of us and PCA in Louisiana. We are not the primary beneficiary of LTP as we do not have power to direct the activities that most significantly affect the economic performance of LTP. Accordingly, we do not consolidate LTP's results in our financial statements.  
    
  Sales  
    
  Related-party sales to LTP from our Wood Products segment in our Consolidated Statements of Operations were   $4.0 million   and   $5.0 million  , respectively, during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , and   $13.3 million   and   $16.3 million  , respectively, during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . These sales are recorded in "Sales" in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
    
  Costs and Expenses  
    
  Related-party wood fiber purchases from LTP were   $21.2 million   and   $25.2 million  , respectively, during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , and   $64.7 million   and   $70.3 million  , respectively, during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  . These costs are recorded in "Materials, labor, and other operating expenses (excluding depreciation)" in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.

    Segment Information 
       
  We operate our business using   three   reportable segments: Wood Products, Building Materials Distribution, and Corporate and Other. There are no differences in our basis of measurement of segment profit or loss from those disclosed in Note 15, Segment Information, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" in our   2015   Form 10-K. 
    
  An analysis of our operations by segment is as follows:

           (a) 
    EBITDA is defined as income (loss) before interest (interest expense, interest income, change in fair value of interest rate swaps, and loss on extinguishment of debt), income taxes, and depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is the primary measure used by our  
     
    20 

     Table of Contents         

chief operating decision maker to evaluate segment operating performance and to decide how to allocate resources to segments. We believe EBITDA is useful to investors because it provides a means to evaluate the operating performance of our segments and our company on an ongoing basis using criteria that are used by our internal decision makers and because it is frequently used by investors and other interested parties when comparing companies in our industry that have different financing and capital structures and/or tax rates. We believe EBITDA is a meaningful measure because it presents a transparent view of our recurring operating performance and allows management to readily view operating trends, perform analytical comparisons, and identify strategies to improve operating performance. EBITDA, however, is not a measure of our liquidity or financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss), income (loss) from operations, or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. The use of EBITDA instead of net income (loss) or segment income (loss) has limitations as an analytical tool, including the inability to determine profitability; the exclusion of interest expense, interest income, and     associated significant cash requirements; and the exclusion of depreciation and amortization, which represent unavoidable operating costs. Management compensates for the limitations of EBITDA by relying on our GAAP results. Our measure of EBITDA is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies due to potential inconsistencies in the methods of calculation. 
    
  The following is a reconciliation of net income to EBITDA for the consolidated company:

    Consolidating Guarantor and Nonguarantor Financial Information 
       
  The following consolidating financial information presents the Statements of Comprehensive Income, Balance Sheets, and Statements of Cash Flows related to Boise Cascade and the guarantor and nonguarantor subsidiaries of the 2020 Notes. On August 29, 2016, we irrevocably instructed the trustee for the 2020 Notes to issue a redemption notice to holders of outstanding 2020 Notes and irrevocably deposited funds sufficient to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness due on the 2020 Notes on the Redemption Date. As a result, the indenture governing the 2020 Notes was satisfied and discharged in accordance with its terms. 
    
  The 2020 Notes were guaranteed fully and unconditionally and jointly and severally by each of our existing and future subsidiaries (other than our foreign subsidiaries). Each of our existing subsidiaries that was a guarantor of the 2020 Notes is   100%   owned by Boise Cascade. Other than the consolidated financial statements and footnotes for Boise Cascade and the consolidating financial information, financial statements and other disclosures concerning the guarantors have not been presented because management believes that such information is not material to investors. 
    
  Furthermore, the cancellation provisions in the related indenture regarding guarantor subsidiaries were customary, and did not include an arrangement that permitted a guarantor subsidiary to opt out of the obligation prior to or during the term of the debt. Under the indenture, each guarantor subsidiary was to be automatically released from its obligations as a guarantor upon the sale of the subsidiary or substantially all of its assets to a third party, the designation of the subsidiary as an unrestricted subsidiary for purposes of the covenants included in the indenture, the release of the indebtedness under the indenture, or upon the issuer's exercise of its legal defeasance option or the discharge of its obligations in accordance with the indenture governing the 2020 Notes. In connection with the issuance of the irrevocable notice of redemption of the 2020 Notes and the irrevocable deposit of funds to satisfy and discharge the indenture, the guarantees of the guarantors under the 2020 Notes were automatically released.

ITEM 2. 
    MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS    

Understanding Our Financial Information 
    
  This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes in "Item 1. Financial Statements" of this Form 10-Q, as well as our   2015   Form 10-K. The following discussion includes statements regarding our expectations with respect to our future performance, liquidity, and capital resources. Such statements, along with any other nonhistorical statements in the discussion, are forward-looking. These forward-looking statements include, without limitation, any statement that may predict, indicate, or imply future results, performance, or achievements and may contain the words "may," "will," "expect," "believe," "should," "plan," "anticipate," and other similar expressions. All of these forward-looking statements are based on estimates and assumptions made by our management that, although believed by us to be reasonable, are inherently uncertain. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risks and uncertainties described in "Item 1A. Risk Factors" in our   2015   Form 10-K, as well as those factors listed in other documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

Our future actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by any of the forward-looking statements in this Form 10-Q. 
    
  Background 
    
  Boise Cascade Company is a building products company headquartered in Boise, Idaho. As used in this Form 10-Q, the terms "Boise Cascade," "we," and "our" refer to Boise Cascade Company and its consolidated subsidiaries. Boise Cascade is a large, vertically-integrated wood products manufacturer and building materials distributor. We have three reportable segments: (i) Wood Products, which manufactures engineered wood products (EWP), plywood, ponderosa pine lumber, studs, and particleboard; (ii) Building Materials Distribution (BMD), which is a wholesale distributor of building materials; and (iii) Corporate and Other, which includes corporate support staff services, related assets and liabilities, pension plan activity, and foreign currency exchange gains and losses. For more information, see Note 12, Segment Information, of the Condensed Notes to Unaudited Quarterly Consolidated Financial Statements in "Item 1. Financial Statements" of this Form 10-Q.  

Executive Overview 
    
  We recorded income from operations of   $31.3 million   during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with income from operations of   $40.4 million   during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  . In our Wood Products segment, income decreased   $10.3 million   to   $11.6 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , from   $21.9 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The decrease in segment income was due primarily to higher OSB costs used in the manufacture of I-joists, as well as higher per-unit conversion costs resulting from lower plywood and lumber sales volumes. In addition, depreciation and amortization expense increased $4.6 million due primarily to the acquisition of two EWP facilities on March 31, 2016, and other capital expenditures. In our Building Materials Distribution segment, income increased   $3.7 million   to   $26.4 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , from   $22.7 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  , driven primarily by a higher gross margin of $10.8 million generated from a sales increase of 11%, offset partially by increased selling and distribution expenses and general and administrative expenses of $6.1 million and $1.0 million, respectively. These changes are discussed further in "Our Operating Results" below. 
    
  On March 31, 2016, we completed the purchase of two EWP facilities located in Thorsby, Alabama, and Roxboro, North Carolina (Acquisition) for an aggregate purchase price of $215.9 million, including closing date working capital of $25.9 million. We continue to integrate these facilities into our EWP system in support of our customers in the eastern and southeastern United States, including production and certification of Boise Cascade branded products and the re-start of previously idled LVL production assets at the Roxboro, North Carolina facility.  
    
  We ended   third   quarter   2016   with   $131.2 million   of cash and cash equivalents,   $122.9 million   of restricted cash deposits with trustee, and   $581.6 million   of debt. At   September 30, 2016  , we had   $354.8 million   of unused committed bank line availability under our Revolving Credit Facility. We used   $53.3 million   of cash during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , as cash provided by operating activities and issuances of long-term debt were more than offset by debt payments, restricted cash deposits, the Acquisition, and capital spending. On August 29, 2016, we irrevocably deposited $122.9 million of cash with the trustee of our $300.0 million 6.375% senior notes (2020 Notes) to pay the remaining principal amount, call premium, and all interest payable on November 1, 2016. A further description of our cash sources and uses for the six month comparative periods are discussed further in "Liquidity and Capital Resources" below.

     Table of Contents         

Demand for our products correlates with the level of residential construction activity in the U.S., which has historically been cyclical. As of October 2016, the Blue Chip Economic Indicators consensus forecast for 2017 and 2016 single- and multi-family housing starts in the U.S. were 1.28 and   1.18 million   units, respectively, compared with actual housing starts of 1.11 million in   2015   and 1.00 million in   2014  , as reported by the U.S. Census Bureau. Single-family housing starts have represented approximately two thirds of total housing starts in recent years and are the primary driver of our sales. 
    
  We believe continued employment growth, wage growth, prospective home buyers' access to financing, improved consumer confidence, as well as other factors, will be necessary to increase household formation rates. Improved household formation rates in turn will help stimulate new construction.   
    
  We expect to experience seasonally slower demand in fourth quarter 2016. On an annual basis, housing starts in the U.S. continue to show modest improvement and we remain optimistic that the improvement in demand for our products will continue as household formation rates and residential construction recover. We expect to manage our production levels to our sales demand, which will likely result in operating some of our facilities below their capacity, and could also include temporary plant curtailments in our plywood operations. In addition, maintenance related capital projects at our plywood plant in Chester, South Carolina, will cause that facility to be down for approximately one month during the fourth quarter. Future commodity product pricing could be volatile in response to industry operating rates, net import and export activity, inventory levels in our distribution channels, and seasonal demand patterns.  

Factors That Affect Our Operating Results and Trends 
    
  Our results of operations and financial performance are influenced by a variety of factors, including the following: 

the commodity nature of our products and their price movements, which are driven largely by capacity utilization rates, industry cycles that affect supply and demand, and net import and export activity;    

general economic conditions, including but not limited to housing starts, repair-and-remodeling activity, and light commercial construction, inventory levels of new and existing homes for sale, foreclosure rates, interest rates, unemployment rates, household formation rates, and mortgage availability and pricing, as well as other consumer financing mechanisms, that ultimately affect demand for our products;  

the highly competitive nature of our industry;  

material disruptions and/or major equipment failure at our manufacturing facilities; 

concentration of our sales among a relatively small group of customers;  

our ability to successfully and efficiently complete and integrate potential acquisitions; 

the need to successfully formulate and implement succession plans for certain members of our senior management team; 

labor disruptions, shortages of skilled and technical labor, or increased labor costs;  

availability and affordability of raw materials, including wood fiber and glues and resins;  

substantial ongoing capital investment costs, including those associated with recent acquisitions, and the difficulty in offsetting fixed costs related to those investments if the housing market does not recover further; 

disruptions to information systems used to process and store customer, employee, and vendor information, as well as the technology that manages our operations and other business processes; 

the financial condition and creditworthiness of our customers;  

the cost and availability of third-party transportation services used to deliver the goods we manufacture and distribute, as well as our raw materials; 

the impact of actuarial assumptions and regulatory activity on pension costs and pension funding requirements;  
     
    34 

     Table of Contents         

our indebtedness, including the possibility that we may not generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future borrowings may not be available in amounts sufficient to fulfill our debt obligations and fund other liquidity needs;  

declines in demand for our products due to competing technologies or materials, as well as changes in building code provisions; 

impairment of our long-lived assets, goodwill, and/or intangible assets;  

cost of compliance with government regulations, in particular environmental regulations;  

exposure to product liability, product warranty, casualty, construction defect, and other claims; 

restrictive covenants contained in our debt agreements; 

fluctuations in the market for our equity; and

Sales 
    
  For the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , total sales increased   $75.6 million  , or   8%  , to   $1,067.2 million   from   $991.6 million   during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  . For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , total sales increased   $234.8 million  , or   9%  , to   $2,991.7 million   from   $2,756.9 million   for the same period in the prior year. The change in sales was driven primarily by the changes in sales volumes and prices, as described below, for the products we manufacture and distribute with single-family residential construction activity being the key demand driver of our sales. In   third   quarter   2016  , total U.S. housing starts decreased   2%  , with single-family starts up   2%   from the same period in   2015  . On a year-to-date basis through September 2016, total housing starts increased   4%  , with single-family up   9%   from the same period in 2015. Average composite lumber and average composite panel prices for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , were each 11% higher than in the same period in the prior year, as reflected by Random Lengths composite lumber and panel pricing. For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , average composite lumber and average composite panel prices were up 2% and 1%, respectively, compared with the same period in the prior year. These improvements in composite commodity pricing generally result in improved results in our BMD segment as noted below, particularly due to improved pricing in OSB and dimension lumber products. However, within our Wood Products segment, we manufacture a narrow mix of products included in the composite indexes.  For example, while average composite panel prices increased during the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , plywood prices have been negatively impacted by a strong U.S. dollar and economy relative to other countries, resulting in foreign producers, particularly from South America, selling more of their plywood products into the U.S. Given weak plywood pricing and improved demand for EWP, we have also shifted more veneer to EWP, resulting in the decrease in plywood sales volume noted below.  
    
  Wood Products.    Sales, including sales to our BMD segment, increased   $0.3 million   to   $340.9 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , from   $340.6 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The slight increase in sales was driven primarily by increases in sales volumes of laminated veneer lumber (LVL) and I-joists of 17% and 8%, respectively, resulting in increased sales of $10.5 million and $5.0 million, respectively. These EWP volume increases were due primarily to our acquisition of two EWP facilities on March 31, 2016, as well as improved single-family housing starts. These increases were offset by decreases in plywood and lumber sales volumes of 7% and 16%, or $7.6 million and $4.0 million, respectively, in sales. Sales prices for LVL, I-joists, plywood, and lumber were relatively flat compared with the same period in the prior year. 
    
  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , sales, including sales to BMD, increased   $0.9 million   to   $990.7 million   from   $989.8 million   for the same period in the prior year. The increase in sales was driven primarily by increases in sales volumes of LVL and I-joists of 25% and 14%, respectively, resulting in increased sales of $41.3 million and $24.4 million, respectively. Increased EWP volumes were due primarily to the acquisition, as well as improved single-family housing starts. In addition, sales price increases of 2% in I-joists and 1% in LVL contributed $3.5 million and $2.6 million, respectively, to the increase in sales. These increases were offset by decreases in plywood and lumber sales prices of 9% and 5%, respectively, resulting in decreased sales of $29.2 million and $3.6 million, respectively, as well as decreases in plywood and lumber sales volumes of 7% and 10%, or $27.5 million and $7.4 million, respectively, in sales. 
    
    Building Materials Distribution.    Sales increased     $90.0 million  , or   11%  , to   $889.0 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , from   $799.0 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  . Compared with the same quarter in the prior year, the overall increase in sales was driven by sales volume and sales price increases of 8% and 3%, respectively. By product line, commodity sales increased 15%, or $53.2 million; general line product sales increased 7%, or $21.1 million; and sales of EWP (substantially all of which are sourced through our Wood Products segment) increased 11%, or $15.7 million. 
    
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , sales increased   $272.4 million  , or   12%  , to   $2,456.3 million   from   $2,184.0 million   for the same period in the prior year. Compared with the same period in the prior year, the overall increase in sales was driven by sales volume increases of 12% on flat sales prices. By product line, commodity sales increased 13%, or $132.3 million; general line product sales increased 10%, or $80.9 million; and sales of EWP increased 15%, or $59.1 million. 
    
  Costs and Expenses 
    
  Materials, labor, and other operating expenses (excluding depreciation) increased   $68.0 million  , or   8%  , to   $922.1 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with   $854.1 million   during the same period in the prior year.     In our Wood Products segment, the increase in materials, labor, and other operating expenses was primarily driven by higher sales volumes of EWP, as well as higher per-unit costs of OSB (used in the manufacture of I-joists) of 35%, compared with   third   quarter   2015  . In addition, materials, labor, and other operating expenses as a percentage of sales (MLO rate) in our Wood Products segment increased by 80 basis points. The increase in the MLO rate was primarily the result of lower plywood and lumber sales volumes, as well as higher OSB costs, which resulted in higher labor and wood fiber costs as a percentage of  
  
    38 

     Table of Contents         

sales, offset partially by lower other manufacturing costs. In BMD, the increase in materials, labor, and other operating expenses was driven by higher purchased materials costs as a result of higher sales volumes, compared with   third   quarter   2015  . However, the BMD segment MLO rate was flat compared with third quarter   2015   as modestly improved margins of commodity and general line products were offset by slightly lower margins of EWP. 
    
  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , materials, labor, and other operating expenses (excluding depreciation) increased   $202.6 million  , or   8%  , to   $2,586.4 million  , compared with   $2,383.8 million   in the same period in the prior year. In our Wood Products segment, the increase in materials, labor, and other operating expenses was primarily driven by higher sales volumes of EWP, as well as higher per-unit costs of OSB of 23%, compared with the first nine months of 2015, offset partially by lower per-unit log costs of 3%. In addition, the MLO rate in our Wood Products segment increased by 150 basis points. The increase in the MLO rate was primarily the result of lower plywood and lumber sales prices and volumes, as well as higher OSB costs, which resulted in higher labor and wood fiber costs as a percentage of sales, offset partially by lower other manufacturing costs. In the BMD segment, the increase in materials, labor, and other operating expenses was driven by higher purchased materials costs as a result of higher sales volumes, compared with the first nine months of 2015. However, the BMD segment MLO rate improved 60 basis points compared with the first nine months of   2015   due to improved commodity product margins, as well as improved sales of general line products, which typically carry higher product margins than commodity products. 
    
  Depreciation and amortization expenses increased   $5.2 million  , or   37%  , to   $19.5 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with   $14.2 million   during the same period in the prior year. For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , these expenses increased   $12.1 million  , or   30%  , to   $53.2 million  , compared with   $41.1 million   in the same period in the prior year. The increases in both periods were due primarily to the acquisition of two EWP facilities on March 31, 2016, and other capital expenditures. The idled LVL machinery and equipment at Roxboro, North Carolina, purchased in the Acquisition is being recommissioned. We have begun depreciating individual assets as they are placed in service. 
       
  Selling and distribution expenses increased   $7.4 million  , or   10%  , to   $80.0 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with   $72.7 million   during the same period in the prior year. The increase was due primarily to higher employee-related expenses and shipping and handling costs of $5.0 million and $1.1 million, respectively, primarily as a result of increased sales volumes and improved operating results in our BMD segment. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , selling and distribution expenses increased   $22.1 million  , or   11%  , to   $224.9 million  , compared with   $202.8 million   during the same period in 2015. The increase was due primarily to higher employee-related expenses and shipping and handling costs of $13.3 million and $4.6 million, respectively, primarily as a result of increased sales volumes and improved operating results in our BMD segment.  
    
  General and administrative expenses increased   $3.0 million  , or   27%  , to   $14.4 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with   $11.3 million   for the same period in the prior year. The increase was due primarily to higher employee-related expenses. For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , these expenses increased   $10.7 million  , or   30%  , to   $46.0 million  , compared with   $35.4 million   during the same period in 2015, due primarily to increased employee-related expenses of $5.6 million and acquisition-related expenses of $3.6 million in our Wood Products segment. 
    
  Other (income) expense, net, for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   was insignificant. For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , other (income) expense, net, was   $1.5 million   of income, which included a $1.5 million gain from the sale of a timber deed in our Wood Products segment. For the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , other (income) expense, net, was   $1.3 million   and   $1.7 million  , which included a $0.9 million gain from the sale of a parcel of land in our Wood Products segment.  
    
  Income From Operations  
    
  Income from operations decreased   $9.1 million   to   $31.3 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with   $40.4 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  . Income from operations decreased   $12.9 million   to   $82.6 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with   $95.5 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . 
    
  Wood Products.    Segment income decreased   $10.3 million   to   $11.6 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with   $21.9 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The decrease in segment income was due primarily to higher OSB costs used in the manufacture of I-joists, as well as higher per-unit conversion costs resulting from lower plywood and lumber sales volumes. In addition, depreciation and amortization expense increased $4.6 million due primarily to the acquisition of two EWP facilities on March 31, 2016, and other capital expenditures.

     Table of Contents         

For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , segment income decreased   $32.7 million   to   $33.8 million   from   $66.5 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The decrease in segment income was due primarily to lower plywood and lumber sales prices and higher OSB costs, as well as acquisition related expenses of $3.6 million. In addition, depreciation expense and amortization increased $9.8 million due primarily to the acquisition of two EWP facilities on March 31, 2016, and other capital expenditures. These decreases were offset partially by improved sales volumes and prices of EWP. 
    
    Building Materials Distribution.    Segment income increased   $3.7 million   to   $26.4 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , from   $22.7 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The improvement in segment income was driven primarily by a higher gross margin of $10.8 million generated from a sales increase of 11%, offset partially by increased selling and distribution expenses and general and administrative expenses of $6.1 million and $1.0 million, respectively. 
       
  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , segment income increased   $23.3 million   to   $68.9 million   from   $45.6 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase in segment income was driven primarily by a higher gross margin of $46.5 million generated from a sales increase of 12%, including an improvement in gross margin percentage of 60 basis points. This improvement was offset partially by increased selling and distribution expenses and general and administrative expenses of $19.6 million and $2.6 million, respectively. 
    
    Corporate and Other.    Segment loss increased   $2.4 million   to   $6.7 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , from   $4.3 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2015  , which was due primarily to higher incentive compensation costs, professional fees, and pension expense. For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , segment loss increased   $3.1 million   to   $19.9 million   from   $16.8 million   for the six months ended   September 30, 2015  , primarily due to higher incentive compensation costs, professional fees, and corporate office occupancy expenses. These increases were offset partially by a decrease in pension expense of $1.1 million. 
    
  Other 
    
    Interest Expense.    Interest expense increased   $1.4 million  , or   25%  , to   $7.1 million   for the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with   $5.7 million   during the same period in the prior year. Interest expense increased   $2.6 million  , or   15%  , to   $19.4 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with   $16.8 million   during the same period in the prior year. For both periods, the increase was due primarily to interest expense related to the issuance of $350 million of 5.625% senior notes on August 29, 2016, $125.0 million of receive-variable pay-fixed interest rate swaps, a $75 million term loan entered into on March 30, 2016, and 2016 borrowings under our credit facility, offset partially by a decrease in interest expense from the repayment of   $184.5 million   of the 2020 Notes on August 29, 2016. 
    
    Change in fair value of interest rate swaps.    For information related to our interest rate swaps, see the discussion under "Disclosures of Financial Market Risks" and "Financial Instruments" included in this "Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of this Form 10-Q.  
    
    Loss on extinguishment of debt.    In connection with the issuance of the   $350 million   of   5.625%   senior notes due September 1, 2024 (2024 Notes), we commenced a tender offer to purchase any and all of our   $300.0 million   aggregate principal amount of 2020 Notes then outstanding. On August 29, 2016, we accepted for purchase an aggregate principal amount of   $184.5 million   of the 2020 Notes that were tendered. In connection with these transactions, we recognized a pre-tax loss on the extinguishment of debt of   $9.5 million   during the third quarter of 2016. The loss includes a   $7.6 million   tender premium paid and   $1.9 million   for the net write-off of a portion of the unamortized deferred financing costs and unamortized premium related to the 2020 Notes.  
    
  On August 29, 2016, we irrevocably instructed the trustee for the 2020 Notes to issue a redemption notice to holders of the remaining   $115.5 million   in aggregate principal amount of the 2020 Notes outstanding and irrevocably deposited   $122.9 million   of cash received upon the issuance of the 2024 Notes, representing the remaining principal amount, call premium, and all interest payable through   November 1, 2016  , with the trustee for the 2020 Notes. Accordingly, we expect to recognize an additional pre-tax loss on the extinguishment of debt of   $4.8 million   in the fourth quarter of 2016.

Income Tax Provision 
    
  For the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we recorded   $5.5 million   and   $19.2 million  , respectively, of income tax expense and had an effective rate of   35.6%   and   36.0%  , respectively. For the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , we recorded   $12.6 million   and   $28.8 million  , respectively, of income tax expense and had an effective rate of   36.5%   and   36.6%  , respectively. During the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , the primary reason for the difference between the federal statutory income tax rate of   35%   and the effective tax rate was the effect of state taxes, offset partially by other tax credits. During the   three   and   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , the primary reason for the difference between the federal statutory income tax rate of   35%   and the effective tax rate was the effect of state taxes, offset partially by the domestic production activities deduction. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  We ended   third   quarter   2016   with   $131.2 million   of cash and cash equivalents,   $122.9 million   of restricted cash deposits with the trustee of the 6.375% senior notes, and   $581.6 million   of debt. At   September 30, 2016  , we had   $486.0 million   of available liquidity (cash and cash equivalents and unused borrowing capacity under our senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility). We used   $53.3 million   of cash during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , as cash provided by operating activities and issuances of long-term debt were more than offset by debt payments, restricted cash deposits, the Acquisition, and capital spending. On August 29, 2016, we irrevocably deposited $122.9 million of cash with the trustee of our 2020 Notes to satisfy and discharge our obligations to pay principal and interest, as well as a call premium on the remaining 2020 Notes, which will be redeemed on November 1, 2016. A further description of our cash sources and uses for the   nine   month comparative periods are noted below. 
       
  We believe that our cash flows from operations, combined with our current cash levels and available borrowing capacity, will be adequate to fund debt service requirements and provide cash, as required, to support our ongoing operations, capital expenditures, lease obligations, working capital, and pension contributions for at least the next 12 months. We expect to fund our intra-month working capital requirements in the remainder of 2016 from borrowings under our revolving credit facility and cash on hand. 
    
  Sources and Uses of Cash 
    
  We generate cash primarily from sales of our products, as well as short-term and long-term borrowings. Our primary uses of cash are for expenses related to the manufacture and distribution of building products, including inventory purchased for resale, wood fiber, labor, energy, and glues and resins. In addition to paying for ongoing operating costs, we use cash to invest in our business, service our debt and pension obligations, repurchase our common stock, and meet our contractual obligations and commercial commitments. Below is a discussion of our sources and uses of cash for operating activities, investment activities, and financing activities. 

Operating Activities  
    
  For the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , our operating activities generated   $113.3 million   of cash, compared with   $77.9 million   of cash generated in the same period in   2015  . The   $35.3 million   improvement in cash provided by operations was due primarily to a   $50.4 million   decrease in pension contributions, as well a   $23.3 million   improvement in income from the Building Materials Distribution segment. These changes were offset partially by a   $32.7 million   decrease in the Wood Products segment income, a decrease in income tax refunds, net of taxes paid, of   $3.6 million  , an increase in cash payments for interest of   $5.6 million  , and a   $12.5 million   increase in working capital during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with a   $4.7 million   decrease for the same period in the prior year. See "Our Operating Results" in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for more information related to factors affecting our operating results.

     Table of Contents         

The change in working capital in both periods was primarily attributable to higher receivables and inventories, offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities. The increases in receivables in both periods primarily reflect increased sales of approximately 23% and 17%, comparing sales for the months of September 2016 and 2015 with sales for the months of December 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities provided   $102.3 million   of cash during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared with   $76.5 million   in the same period a year ago. During both periods, seasonally higher inventory purchases and extended terms offered by major vendors to our Building Materials Distribution segment led to the increase in accounts payable. 
    
  Investment Activities 
    
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we used   $215.9 million   for the Acquisition. These facilities will complement our existing Wood Products business and enable us to better serve our customers in the eastern and southeastern United States. During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we used   $55.4 million   and   $56.7 million  , respectively, of cash for purchases of property and equipment, including business improvement and quality/efficiency projects, replacement and expansion projects, restart of idled assets at our recently acquired Roxboro, North Carolina, facility, and ongoing environmental compliance. Excluding acquisitions, we expect capital expenditures in 2016 to total approximately $85 million to $95 million. During 2017, we expect capital expenditures to total approximately $70 million to $80 million. This level of capital expenditures could increase or decrease as a result of a number of factors, including our financial results, future economic conditions, and timing of equipment purchases. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we received asset sales proceeds of $3.0 million, primarily from the sale of a parcel of land in our Wood Products segment. 
    
  Financing Activities  
    
  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , our financing activities generated   $104.2 million   of cash, compared with   $25.0 million   of cash generated in the same period in 2015.  
    
  On August 29, 2016, we issued   $350 million   of   5.625%   senior notes due September 1, 2024 (2024 Notes). In connection with the 2024 Notes issuance, we commenced a tender offer to purchase any and all of our   $300.0 million   aggregate principal amount of 2020 Notes then outstanding. Concurrently, we accepted for purchase an aggregate principal amount of   $184.5 million   of the 2020 Notes that were tendered. In connection with the tender, we paid a tender premium of $7.6 million.  
    
  On August 29, 2016, we irrevocably instructed the trustee for the 2020 notes to issue a redemption notice to holders of the remaining   $115.5 million   in aggregate principal amount of the 2020 Notes outstanding and irrevocably deposited $119.2 million of cash received upon the issuance of the 2024 Notes, representing the remaining principal amount and call premium, in an account with the trustee for the 2020 Notes, to be redeemed on November 1, 2016. Upon our irrevocable redemption instructions and deposit, our obligations under the indenture pursuant to which the 2020 Notes were issued were satisfied and discharged, the indenture generally ceased to be of further effect, and we have no further obligations to the 2020 Notes holders.  
    
  In addition, during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we issued a new $75.0 million term loan (Term Loan) to partially fund the Acquisition. Under our revolving credit facility, we also borrowed $355.0 million to fund intra-month working capital needs and $55.0 million to partially fund the Acquisition, which were subsequently repaid with cash on hand during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . At   September 30, 2016  , we had   no   borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility. We also used $6.3 million of cash for financing costs related to our debt issuances during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  . In addition, we repurchased   180,100   shares of our common stock for   $2.6 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  
    
  During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, our cash generated from financing activities was primarily related to the issuance of a new $50.0 million term loan (ABL Term Loan) offset partially by the repurchase of 722,911 shares of our common stock for   $23.7 million  . Proceeds from the ABL Term Loan were used to fund a $40.0 million discretionary pension contribution and for general corporate purposes. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we had no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility.

Contractual Obligations 
    
  For information about contractual obligations, see Contractual Obligations in "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in our   2015   Form 10-K. There have been no material changes in contractual obligations outside the ordinary course of business since   December 31, 2015  , except for the items noted in the table below.  

_______________________________________  
    
           (a) 
    These borrowings are further explained in Note 7, Debt, of the Condensed Notes to Unaudited Quarterly Consolidated Financial Statements in "Item 1. Financial Statements" of this Form 10-Q. The long-term debt payments for 2016 represent the extinguishment of all remaining 2020 Notes on November 1, 2016, excluding a $3.7 million call premium. The table assumes all other long-term debt is held to maturity.  
       
           (b) 
    Amounts represent estimated interest payments on the 2020 Notes, 2024 Notes, ABL Term Loan, and Term Loan as of September 30, 2016, assuming these notes are held to maturity. Unused commitment fees and letter of credit fees payable under the Revolving Credit Facility are excluded from the table above. In addition, we have excluded our interest rate swaps from interest in the table above. For information regarding average pay rates and average receive rates on our interest rate swaps, see "Financial Instruments" included in this "Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of this Form 10-Q.   
       
           (c) 
    We enter into leases in the normal course of business. We lease a portion of our distribution centers as well as other property and equipment under leases. Some lease agreements provide us with the option to renew the lease or purchase the leased property. Our lease obligations would change if we exercised these renewal options and/or if we entered into additional lease agreements. For more information, see Note 6, Leases, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" in our   2015   Form 10-K.  

Off-Balance-Sheet Activities 
    
  At   September 30, 2016  , and   December 31, 2015  , we had no material off-balance-sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities.  

Guarantees 
    
  Note 5, Debt, and Note 16, Commitments, Legal Proceedings and Contingencies, and Guarantees, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" in our   2015   Form 10-K describe the nature of our guarantees, including the approximate terms of the guarantees, how the guarantees arose, the events or circumstances that would require us to perform under the guarantees, and the maximum potential undiscounted amounts of future payments we could be required to make. As of   September 30, 2016  , there have been no material changes to the guarantees disclosed in our   2015   Form 10-K, except for debt transactions disclosed in Note 7, Debt, of the Condensed Notes to Unaudited Quarterly Consolidated Financial Statements in "Item 1. Financial Statements" of this Form 10-Q.

Table of Contents         

Seasonal and Inflationary Influences 
    
  We are exposed to fluctuations in quarterly sales volumes and expenses due to seasonal factors. These seasonal factors are common in the building products industry. Seasonal changes in levels of building activity affect our building products businesses, which are dependent on housing starts, repair-and-remodeling activities, and light commercial construction activities. We typically report lower sales in the first and fourth quarters due to the impact of poor weather on the construction market, and we generally have higher sales in the second and third quarters, reflecting an increase in construction due to more favorable weather conditions. We typically have higher working capital in the first and second quarters in preparation and response to the building season. Seasonally cold weather increases costs, especially energy consumption, at most of our manufacturing facilities. 
    
  Our major costs of production are wood fiber, labor, and glue and resins. Wood fiber costs and glue and resin costs have been volatile in recent years. 

Employees  
    
  As of   October 23, 2016  , we had approximately   6,230   employees. Approximately   24%   of these employees work pursuant to collective bargaining agreements. As of   October 23, 2016  , we had   nine   collective bargaining agreements. Four agreements, covering approximately 663 employees at our Elgin plywood plant and sawmill, La Grande particleboard plant, Kettle Falls plywood plant, and Woodinville BMD facility, expired on May 31, 2016, but have been indefinitely extended by the parties, subject to either party submitting a ten-day written notice to terminate. We expect these four agreements to be negotiated together. We also have two agreements, covering approximately 49 employees at our Billings BMD facility and Vancouver BMD facility, that are set to expire on March 31, 2017, as well as an agreement, covering approximately 715 employees at our Oakdale and Florien plywood plants, that are set to expire on July 15, 2017. If any of these agreements are not renewed or extended upon their termination, we could experience a material labor disruption or significantly increased labor costs, which could prevent us from meeting customer demand or reduce our sales and profitability.  

Disclosures of Financial Market Risks 
    
  In the normal course of business, we are exposed to financial risks such as changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and commodity prices. As of   September 30, 2016  , there have been no material changes to financial market risks disclosed in our   2015   Form 10-K, except for changes to interest rate risk. 
    
  Interest Rate Risk 
    
  We are exposed to interest rate risk arising from fluctuations in variable-rate LIBOR on our term loans and when we have loan amounts outstanding on our Revolving Credit Facility. At   September 30, 2016  , we had $125.0 million of variable-rate debt outstanding. Our objective is to limit the variability of interest payments on our debt. To meet this objective, management may enter into receive-variable, pay-fixed interest rate swaps to change the variable-rate cash flow exposure to fixed-rate cash flows. In accordance with our risk management strategy, we actively monitor our interest rate exposure and use derivative instruments from time to time to manage the related risk. We do not speculate using derivative instruments.  
    
  On February 16, 2016 and March 31, 2016, we entered into interest rate swap agreements with notional principal amounts of   $50.0 million   and   $75.0 million  , respectively, to offset risks associated with the variability in cash flows relating to interest payments that are based on one-month LIBOR. Under the interest rate swaps, we receive LIBOR-based variable interest rate payments and make fixed interest rate payments, thereby fixing the interest rate on   $125.0 million   of debt. Payments on the interest rate swaps with notional principal amounts of   $50.0 million   and   $75.0 million   are due on a monthly basis at a fixed rate of   1.007%   and   1.256%  , respectively, and expire in February 2022 and March 2022, respectively. The interest rate swap agreements were not designated as cash flow hedges, and as a result, all changes in the fair value are recognized in "Change in fair value of interest rate swaps" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations rather than through other comprehensive income. At   September 30, 2016  , we recorded a long-term asset of   $44 thousand   recorded in "Other assets" on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and a long-term liability of   $809 thousand   recorded in "Other long-term liabilities" on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, each representing the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements.  

Financial Instruments 
    
  The table below provides information as of   September 30, 2016  , about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. The table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected

maturity dates. For obligations with variable interest rate sensitivity, the table sets forth payout amounts based on   September 30, 2016   rates and does not attempt to project future rates. Other instruments subject to market risk, such as obligations for pension plans and other postretirement benefits, are not reflected in the table.

Critical Accounting Estimates 
    
  Critical accounting estimates are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results. These estimates require management's most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to estimate matters that are inherently uncertain. We review the development, selection, and disclosure of our critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our board of directors. For information about critical accounting estimates, see Critical Accounting Estimates in "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in

     Table of Contents         

our   2015   Form 10-K. At   September 30, 2016  , there have been no material changes to our critical accounting estimates from those disclosed in our   2015   Form 10-K, except as noted below. 
    
  Business Combinations  
  From time to time, we may enter into material business combinations. We allocate the total purchase price of a business combination to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date, with the excess purchase price recorded as goodwill. The acquisition method of accounting requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions regarding the fair values of the elements of a business combination as of the date of acquisition, including the fair values (fair value is determined using the income approach, cost approach and/or market approach) of inventory, property, plant, and equipment, and identifiable intangible assets, among others. This method also requires us to refine these estimates over a measurement period not to exceed one year to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized as of that date. If we are required to retroactively adjust provisional amounts that we have recorded for the fair values of assets and liabilities in connection with acquisitions, these adjustments could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, we expense any acquisition-related costs as incurred in connection with each business combination.  
  Significant estimates and assumptions in estimating the fair value of customer relationships and other identifiable intangible assets include future cash flows that we expect to generate from the acquired assets. If the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values, we could record impairment charges. In addition, we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense. If our estimates of the economic lives change, depreciation or amortization expenses could be increased or decreased. 

New and Recently Adopted Accounting Standards 
    
  For information related to new and recently adopted accounting standards, see "New and Recently Adopted Accounting Standards" in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Condensed Notes to Unaudited Quarterly Consolidated Financial Statements in "Item 1. Financial Statements" in this Form 10-Q. 

ITEM 3.          QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
    
  For information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk, see the discussion under "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk" and under the headings "Disclosures of Financial Market Risks" and "Financial Instruments" in "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" in our   2015   Form 10-K. As of   September 30, 2016  , there have been no material changes in our exposure to market risk from those disclosed in our   2015   Form 10-K, except as disclosed in "Disclosures of Financial Market Risks" in "Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" of this Form 10-Q.  

ITEM 4.          CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES    
    
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
    
  We maintain "disclosure controls and procedures," as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act. We have designed these controls and procedures to reasonably assure that information required to be disclosed in our reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act, such as this Form 10-Q, is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms. We have also designed our disclosure controls to provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to our senior management, including our chief executive officer (CEO) and our chief financial officer (CFO), as appropriate, to allow them to make timely decisions regarding our required disclosures.

     Table of Contents         

Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures 
    
  In designing and evaluating our disclosure and/or internal controls and procedures, we recognized that no matter how well conceived and well operated, a control system can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of its inherent limitations, a control system, no matter how well designed, may not prevent or detect misstatements due to error or fraud. Additionally, in designing a control system, our management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. We have also designed our disclosure and internal controls and procedures based in part upon assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. 
    
  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting 
    
  On March 31, 2016, we completed the acquisition of two EWP facilities. In connection with integrating these facilities, we are evaluating and, where necessary, will implement changes in controls and procedures at the facilities as the integration proceeds. This process may result in additions or changes to our internal control over financial reporting. There were no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the   three   months ended   September 30, 2016   that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

PART II OTHER INFORMATION 

ITEM 1.          LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 
    
  We are a party to routine legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business. We are not currently a party to any legal proceedings or environmental claims that we believe would, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.  

ITEM 1A.       RISK FACTORS 
    
  This report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements. Statements that are not historical or current facts, including statements about our expectations, anticipated financial results, projected capital expenditures, and future business prospects, are forward-looking statements. You can identify these statements by our use of words such as "may," "will," "expect," "believe," "should," "plan," "anticipate," and other similar expressions. You can find examples of these statements throughout this report, including "Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations." We cannot guarantee that our actual results will be consistent with the forward-looking statements we make in this report. You should review carefully the risk factors listed in "Item 1A. Risk Factors" in our   2015   Form 10-K, as well as those factors listed in other documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the risk factor below related to our recent acquisition. We do not assume an obligation to update any forward-looking statement. 
    
  Our strategy includes pursuing acquisitions. We may be unable to efficiently integrate acquired operations or successfully complete potential acquisitions. 
    
  We may not be able to integrate the operations of acquired businesses, including the engineered wood products facilities located in Thorsby, Alabama, and Roxboro, North Carolina, in an efficient and cost-effective manner or without significant disruption to our existing operations or realize expected synergies. Acquisitions involve significant risks and uncertainties, including uncertainties as to the future financial performance of the acquired business, difficulties integrating acquired personnel into our business, the potential loss of key employees, customers or suppliers, difficulties in integrating different computer and accounting systems, exposure to unknown or unforeseen liabilities of acquired companies, and the diversion of management attention and resources from existing operations. In the future, we may be unable to successfully complete potential acquisitions due to multiple factors, including those noted above, and potential issues related to regulatory review of the proposed transactions. We may also be required to incur additional debt in order to consummate acquisitions, which debt may be substantial and may limit our flexibility in using our cash flow from operations. Our failure to integrate future acquired businesses effectively or to manage other consequences of our acquisitions could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.

Wells Fargo has agreed to act as the representative of the several Initial Purchasers (the    Representative   ) in connection with the offering and sale of the Notes.     
  The Securities (as defined below) will be issued pursuant to an indenture, dated August 16, 2016, among the Company, the Guarantors (as defined below) and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the    Trustee   ), as amended, modified or supplemented as of the date hereof (the    Indenture   ).  The Notes will be issued only in book-entry form in the name of Cede   Co., as nominee of The Depository Trust Company (the    Depositary   ), pursuant to a letter of representations, to be dated on or before the Closing Date (the    DTC Agreement   ), among the Company and the Depositary. 
  The payment of principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis, jointly and severally, by (i) the entities listed on the signature pages hereof as  Guarantors  and (ii) any subsidiary of the Company that executes an additional guarantee in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, and their respective successors and assigns (collectively, the    Guarantors   ), pursuant to their guarantees (the    Guarantees   ).  The Notes and the Guarantees thereof are herein collectively referred to as the    Securities   . 
  This Agreement, the Securities and the Indenture are referred to herein as the    Transaction Documents  .  
  The Company understands that the Initial Purchasers propose to make an offering of the Securities on the terms and in the manner set forth herein and in the Pricing Disclosure Package (as defined below) and agree that the Initial Purchasers may resell, subject to the conditions set forth herein, all or a portion of the Securities to purchasers (the    Subsequent Purchasers   ) on the terms set forth in the Pricing Disclosure Package (the first time when sales of the Securities are made is referred to as the    Time of Sale   ).

  (d)        Settlements.    The indemnifying party under this Section 8 shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, which will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified party against any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense by reason of such settlement or judgment.  Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an indemnifying party to reimburse the indemnified party for the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel as contemplated by this Section 8, the indemnifying party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, which will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, if (i) such settlement is entered into more than 30 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request and (ii) such indemnifying party shall not have reimbursed the indemnified party in accordance with such request prior to the

date of such settlement.  No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, which will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, effect any settlement, compromise or consent to the entry of judgment in any pending or threatened action, suit or proceeding in respect of which any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity was or could have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such settlement, compromise or consent (i) includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such action, suit or proceeding and (ii) does not include any statements as to or any findings of fault, culpability or failure to act by or on behalf of any indemnified party. 
  SECTION 9.        Contribution.    If the indemnification provided for in Section 8 hereof is for any reason held to be unavailable to or otherwise insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the aggregate amount paid or payable by such indemnified party, as incurred, as a result of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Initial Purchasers, on the other hand, from the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Company and the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Initial Purchasers, on the other hand, in connection with the statements or omissions or inaccuracies in the representations and warranties herein which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.  The relative benefits received by the Company and the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Initial Purchasers, on the other hand, in connection with the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement shall be deemed to be in the same respective proportions as the total net proceeds from the offering of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement (before deducting expenses) received by the Company, and the total discount received by the Initial Purchasers bear to the aggregate initial offering price of the Securities.  The relative fault of the Company and the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Initial Purchasers, on the other hand, shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any such untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact or any such inaccurate or alleged inaccurate representation or warranty relates to information supplied by the Company and the Guarantors, on the one hand, or the Initial Purchasers, on the other hand, and the parties  relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission or inaccuracy. 
  The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses referred to above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 8 hereof, any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with investigating or defending any action or claim.  The provisions set forth in Section 8 hereof with respect to notice of commencement of any action shall apply if a claim for contribution is to be made under this Section 9;   provided  ,   however  , that no additional notice shall be required with respect to any action for which notice has been given under Section 8 hereof for purposes of indemnification. 
  
   26 

The Company, the Guarantors and the Initial Purchasers agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 9 were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the Initial Purchasers were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this Section 9. 
  Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 9, no Initial Purchaser shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the discount received by such Initial Purchaser in connection with the Securities distributed by it.  No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11 of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.  The Initial Purchasers  obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section 9 are several, and not joint, in proportion to their respective commitments as set forth opposite their names in   Schedule A   hereto.  For purposes of this Section 9, each affiliate, director, officer and employee of an Initial Purchaser and each person, if any, who controls an Initial Purchaser within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as such Initial Purchaser, and each director and officer of either the Company or any Guarantor, and each person, if any, who controls either the Company or any Guarantor within the meaning of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company and the Guarantors. 
  SECTION 10.        Termination of this Agreement.    Prior to the Closing Date, this Agreement may be terminated by the Representative by notice given to the Company if at any time:  (i) trading or quotation in any of the Company  securities shall have been suspended or limited by the Commission or trading in securities generally on either the Nasdaq Stock Market or the New York Stock Exchange shall have been suspended or limited, or minimum or maximum prices shall have been generally established on any of such quotation system or stock exchange by the Commission or FINRA; (ii) a general banking moratorium shall have been declared by any of federal, New York or Delaware authorities; (iii) there shall have occurred any outbreak or escalation of national or international hostilities or any crisis or calamity, or any change in the United States or international financial markets, or any substantial change or development involving a prospective substantial change in United States  or international political, financial or economic conditions, as in the judgment of the Representative is material and adverse and makes it impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the offering, sale or delivery of the Securities in the manner and on the terms described in the Pricing Disclosure Package or to enforce contracts for the sale of securities; or (iv) in the judgment of the Representative there shall have occurred any Material Adverse Change.  Any termination pursuant to this Section 10 shall be without liability on the part of (i) the Company or any Guarantor to any Initial Purchaser, except that the Company and the Guarantors shall be obligated to reimburse the expenses of the Initial Purchasers pursuant to Sections 4 and 6 hereof, (ii) any Initial Purchaser to the Company, or (iii) any party hereto to any other party except that the provisions of Sections 8 and 9 hereof shall at all times be effective and shall survive such termination. 
  SECTION 11.        Representations and Indemnities to Survive Delivery.    The respective indemnities, rights of contribution, agreements, representations, warranties and other statements of the Company, the Guarantors, their respective officers and the several Initial Purchasers set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement will remain in full force and effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Initial Purchaser, the Company, any Guarantor or any of  
  
   27

  SECTION 16.        Governing Law and Waiver of Jury Trial Provisions.    THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY CLAIM, CONTROVERSY OR DISPUTE ARISING UNDER OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK APPLICABLE TO AGREEMENTS MADE AND TO BE PERFORMED IN SUCH STATE WITHOUT REGARD TO CONFLICTS OF LAW PRINCIPLES THEREOF.  EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY).  EACH PARTY HERETO (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PERSON HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PERSON WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION. 
  SECTION 17.        Consent to Jurisdiction.

Service of any process, summons, notice or document by mail to such party s address set forth above shall be effective service of process for any Related Proceeding brought in any Specified Court.  The parties irrevocably and unconditionally waive any objection to the laying of venue of any Specified Proceeding in the Specified Courts and irrevocably and unconditionally waive and agree  
  
   29 

not to plead or claim in any Specified Court that any Related Proceeding brought in any Specified Court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. 
  SECTION 18.        Default of One or More of the Several Initial Purchasers.    If any one or more of the several Initial Purchasers shall fail or refuse to purchase Securities that it or they have agreed to purchase hereunder on the Closing Date, and the aggregate amount of Securities which such defaulting Initial Purchaser or Initial Purchasers agreed but failed or refused to purchase does not exceed 10% of the aggregate amount of the Securities to be purchased on such date, the other Initial Purchasers shall be obligated, severally, in the proportions that the amount of Securities set forth opposite their respective names on Schedule A bears to the aggregate amount of Securities set forth opposite the names of all such non-defaulting Initial Purchasers, or in such other proportions as may be specified by the Initial Purchasers with the consent of the non-defaulting Initial Purchasers, to purchase the Securities which such defaulting Initial Purchaser or Initial Purchasers agreed but failed or refused to purchase on the Closing Date.  If any one or more of the Initial Purchasers shall fail or refuse to purchase Securities and the aggregate amount of Securities with respect to which such default occurs exceeds 10% of the aggregate amount of Securities to be purchased on the Closing Date, and arrangements satisfactory to the Initial Purchasers and the Company for the purchase of such Securities are not made within 48 hours after such default, this Agreement shall terminate without liability of any party to any other party except that the provisions of Sections 4, 6, 8 and 9 hereof shall at all times be effective and shall survive such termination.  In any such case either the Initial Purchasers or the Company shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date, as the case may be, but in no event for longer than seven days in order that the required changes, if any, to the Final Offering Memorandum or any other documents or arrangements may be effected. 
  As used in this Agreement, the term    Initial Purchaser    shall be deemed to include any person substituted for a defaulting Initial Purchaser under this Section 18.  Any action taken under this Section 18 shall not relieve any defaulting Initial Purchaser from liability in respect of any default of such Initial Purchaser under this Agreement. 
  SECTION 19.        No Advisory or Fiduciary Responsibility.    The Company and each of the Guarantors acknowledge and agree that:  (i) the purchase and sale of the Securities pursuant to this Agreement, including the determination of the offering price of the Securities and any related discounts and commissions, is an arm s-length commercial transaction between the Company and the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the several Initial Purchasers, on the other hand, and the Company and the Guarantors are capable of evaluating and understanding and understand and accept the terms, risks and conditions of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) in connection with each transaction contemplated hereby and the process leading to such transaction each Initial Purchaser is and has been acting solely as a principal and is not the agent or fiduciary of the Company, and the Guarantors or their respective affiliates, stockholders, creditors or employees or any other party; (iii) no Initial Purchaser has assumed or will assume an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor of the Company and the Guarantors with respect to any of the transactions contemplated hereby or the process leading thereto (irrespective of whether such Initial Purchaser has advised or is currently advising the Company and the Guarantors on other matters) or any other obligation to the Company and the Guarantors except the obligations expressly set forth in this Agreement; (iv) the several Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates may be engaged in a broad range of transactions that involve interests that differ from  
  
   30 

those of the Company and the Guarantors, and the several Initial Purchasers have no obligation to disclose any of such interests by virtue of any fiduciary or advisory relationship; and (v) the Initial Purchasers have not provided any legal, accounting, regulatory or tax advice with respect to the offering contemplated hereby, and the Company and the Guarantors have consulted their own legal, accounting, regulatory and tax advisors to the extent they deemed appropriate. 
  This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings (whether written or oral) between the Company, the Guarantors and the several Initial Purchasers, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof.  The Company and the Guarantors hereby waive and release, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any claims that the Company and the Guarantors may have against the several Initial Purchasers with respect to any breach or alleged breach of fiduciary duty. 
  SECTION 20.        USA Patriot Act  .  In accordance with the requirements of the USA Patriot Act (Title III of Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001)), the Initial Purchasers are required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies their respective clients, including the Company, which information may include the name and address of their respective clients, as well as other information that will allow  the Initial Purchasers to properly identify their respective clients. 
  SECTION 21.        General Provisions.    This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement of the parties to this Agreement and supersedes all prior written or oral and all contemporaneous oral agreements, understandings and negotiations with respect to the subject matter hereof.

  Each Initial Purchaser understands that: 
  Such Initial Purchaser agrees that it has not offered or sold and will not offer or sell the Securities in the United States or to, or for the benefit or account of, a U.S. Person (other than a distributor), in each case, as defined in Rule 902 of Regulation S (i) as part of its distribution at any time and (ii) otherwise until 40 days after the later of the commencement of the offering of the Securities pursuant hereto and the Closing Date, other than in accordance with Regulation S or another exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act.
