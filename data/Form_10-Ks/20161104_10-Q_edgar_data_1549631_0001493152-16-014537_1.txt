NOTE
1 - BASIS OF PRESENTATION   

The
condensed balance sheet of Quarta-Rad, Inc. (the  Company ) as of September 30, 2016, and the condensed statements
of operations for the three-month and nine-month period ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, and cash flows for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, have not been audited. However, in the opinion of management, such information includes all
adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments), which are necessary to properly reflect the financial position
of the Company as of September 30, 2016, the results of operations for the three-months and nine-months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015, and cash flows for the nine-months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

Certain
information and notes normally included in condensed financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) have been condensed or omitted, although management believes
that the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading. Interim period results are not necessarily
indicative of the results to be achieved for an entire year. These condensed financial statements should be read in conjunction
with the audited financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s annual report on Form S-1 for the year
ended December 31, 2015.  

NOTE
2 - NATURE OF BUSINESS   

The
Company distributes detection devices, including but not limited to Geiger counters, to homeowners and interested customers in
North America. The Company targets homebuilders and home renovation contractors.  

NOTE
3 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES   

Use
of Estimates and Assumptions   

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect
the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods.  

Significant
estimates made by management include, among others, provisions for the valuation of accounts receivable and the recoverability
of inventory. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience, knowledge of current conditions and belief of what could
occur in the future considering available information. The Company reviews its estimates on an on-going basis. The actual results
experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely from its estimates. To the extent there are material differences
between the estimates and actual results, future results of operations will be affected.  

Advertising   

The
Company expenses advertising costs, consisting primarily of placement in multiple publications, along with design and printing
costs of sales materials, when incurred. Advertising expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 amounted
to $3,399, $12,454, $1,695, and $7,655, respectively.  

Revenue
Recognition   

Securities
and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin ( SAB ) 101,  Revenue Recognition , as amended by SAB 104,
outlines the basic criteria that must be met to recognize revenue and provide guidance for presentation of revenue and for disclosure
related to revenue recognition policies in financial statements filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Management
believes that the Company s revenue recognition policy conforms to SAB 101 and 104.  

The
Company evaluates the criteria of Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) Emerging Issues Task Force ( EITF )
Issue No. 99-19,  Reporting Revenue   Gross as a Principal Versus Net as an Agent,  in determining whether it is appropriate
to record the gross amount of revenue and related costs or the net amount earned as commissions.  

The
Company imports the goods and pays the import and delivery costs and forwards the goods to a public warehouse. Goods are held
by the Company at a public warehouse until the customers requested ship date. The Company arranging for the maintenance of the
goods while in the warehouse at its expense. The Company has title to the goods when shipped from the manufacturer and in the
public warehouse.  

The
Company believes it meets the indicators for gross reporting. The Company is the primary obligor, it has inventory risk, it has
the ability to determine the price it sells the products to customers, it can change the product, it has supplier discretion,
it can determine the nature, type, characteristics and specification of the products, it has physical risk of inventory as it
purchases the products and assumes the risk of sale, and it has the credit risk for the customer to pay.  

Revenue
is recognized upon shipment of goods from the public warehouse to the customers, which is when title transfers to the customers.  

Shipping
and handling costs billed to the customers are recorded in sales. Shipping and handling costs as incurred by the Company are recorded
in cost of sales.  

The
Company s condensed financial statements are prepared under the accrual method of accounting. Revenues are recognized when
evidence of an agreement exists, the price is fixed or determinable, collectability is reasonably assured and goods have been
delivered or services performed. Please refer to Note 4 for related party transactions. In 2013, the Company began reporting its
revenues as gross revenues rather than net revenues since the Company s revenues are from unrelated, third party sales rather
than consignment sales for its related party.  

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements   

See
Note 2 of our Annual Report on Form S-1 as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015 and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q as
of and for the period ended June 30, 2016 for a description of recent accounting pronouncements, including expected dates of adoption
and estimated effects on our unaudited condensed financial statements.  

NOTE
4 RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS   

The
Company sells radiation monitors and to date has purchased all of it inventory from a company in Russia, which is owned by the
Company s minority shareholder. Total inventory purchased was $431,289 and $548,416 for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and for the year ended December 31, 2015, respectively. The Company owes the Russian affiliate $46,916 and $115,815 and
such amount is included in related party payables in the accompanying condensed balance sheets at September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015, respectively.  

Since
inception, the Company has not compensated its CEO, who is the majority shareholder, and no amounts are due at September 30, 2016
and December 31, 2015.  

NOTE
5  COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES   

Legal   

In
the normal course of business, the Company may become involved in various legal proceedings. The Company knows of no pending or
threatened legal proceeding to which the Company is or will be a party that, if successful, might result in material adverse change
in the Company s business, properties or financial condition.  

NOTE
6 GOING CONCERN   

The
Company s condensed financial statements are prepared using U.S. GAAP applicable to a going concern, which contemplates
the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. While the Company has established a
source of revenues to cover its operating costs it cannot support a salary for its CEO, which causes substantial doubt about its
ability to continue as a going concern. The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company
obtaining adequate capital to implement its business plan. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital, it could be forced
to cease operations.  

Management
intends to focus on raising funds going forward. The Company cannot provide any assurance or guarantee that it will be able to
raise funds. Potential investors must be aware if it is unable to raise funds through the sale of its common stock and generate
sufficient revenues, any investment made into the Company would be lost in its entirety.  

The
ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to successfully accomplish the plans described
in the preceding paragraph and eventually secure other sources of financing and attain profitable operations. The accompanying
condensed financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the Company is unable to continue as
a going concern.  

NOTE
7-STOCKHOLDERS  EQUITY   

The
Company is authorized to issued 50,000,000 share of $0.0001 par value common stock.  

During the three months ended September 30,
2016, the Company received an aggregate of $3,000 from the issuance of 15,000 shares of its common stock.  

NOTE
8 SUBSEQUENT EVENTS   

From
October 1, 2016 through the date of this Form 10-Q, the Company received an aggregate of $50,500 from the issuance of 252,500
shares of common stock.   The Company has performed an evaluation

to be recorded or disclosed herein, except as disclosed above and in the accompanying notes.  

Item
2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations   

The
following is management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and is provided as a
supplement to the accompanying unaudited financial statements and notes to help provide an understanding of our financial condition,
results of operations and cash flows during the periods included in the accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements.  

In
this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q,  Company,   the Company,   us,  and  our 
refer to Quarta-Rad, Inc., a Delaware corporation, unless the context requires otherwise.  

We
intend the following discussion to assist in the understanding of our financial position and our results of operations for the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015. You should refer to the Financial Statements and related
Notes in conjunction with this discussion.  

Results
of Operations   

General   

We
were incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on November 29, 2011 with fiscal year end in December 31. We were formed
to distribute and sell detection devices to homeowners and interested consumers in North America. Initially, our business plan
was to sell products on consignment from Star Systems Japan, a corporation owned by our majority shareholder. We purchased these
products from Quarta-Rad, Ltd., a company owned by our minority shareholder. We also targeted direct-to-consumer sales since we
believe we can distribute these products through the Internet. We have never been party to any bankruptcy, receivership or similar
proceeding, nor have we undergone any material reclassification, merger, consolidation, purchase or sale of a significant amount
of assets not in the ordinary course of business.  

As
of the date of this Form 10-Q, we continue to expand our operations and expect to increase our revenues with additional working
capital. Our chief executive officer and director, Victor Shvetsky, and our director and president, Alexey Golovanov, are our
only employees. Mr. Shvetsky and Mr. Golovanov will devote at least ten hours per week to us but may increase the number of hours
as necessary. In 2012, Messrs. Shvetsky and Golovanov s companies have been the source of commissionable consignment sales
and we did not carry any inventory. In 2013, we discontinued selling the products on consignment from our majority shareholder s
company for a commission or consignment fee and began purchasing inventory directly from Quarta-Rad, Ltd (Russia) ( QRR )
to sell on the Internet to direct consumers and to third party resellers. In 2012, when a reseller placed an order from us we
purchased the product from our related party supplier and have it ship the product directly to the reseller. Beginning in 2013,
we began purchasing the products from Quarta-Rad, Ltd., our related party supplier and it shipped the products to us. We then
shipped the products to a third party online retailer, to hold for Internet sales and sales to our third party resellers.  

We
have begun raising funds pursuant to our registration statement.  

Our
administrative office is located at 1201 N. Orange St., Suite 700, Wilmington, DE 19801, which is a virtual office.  

In
2016, we continued to focus our business operations on the development of our distribution agreements and reseller network as
well as continue to advertise on the Internet. We plan to continue to utilize our website to promote the products to home renovation
contractors and other purchasers of detection devices. We are promoting the detection products by advertising our website and
marketing to independent distributors and others interested in detection devices. We purchase the products from QRR, which is
owned by our minority shareholder and is the original manufacturer for RADEX product line. Under an oral agreement with QRR, we
have the exclusive distribution rights for sale of QRR products in Europe, the US, and Asia (excluding China) for a period of
10 years. We sell the products we purchase from QRR directly to third party buyers and to resellers. The purchase terms require
us to prepay for the products we purchase at a price that is set forth in each purchase order. The prices we pay for the products
has remained constant since the beginning of 2013.  

Critical
Accounting Policy and Estimates.  Our Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations
section discusses our condensed financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these condensed financial statements requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed financial statements
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an on-going basis, management evaluates its
estimates and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition, accrued expenses, financing operations, and contingencies
and litigation. Management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed
to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of
assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under
different assumptions or conditions. The most significant accounting estimates inherent in the preparation of our condensed financial
statements include estimates as to the appropriate carrying value of certain assets and liabilities which are not readily apparent
from other sources. In addition, these accounting policies are described at relevant sections in this discussion and analysis
and in the notes to the condensed financial statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  

The
following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited financial
statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, together with notes thereto, which are included in
this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  

Three
months ended September 30, 2016 compared with the three months ended September 30, 2015   

Revenues.
 Our net revenues decreased $29,605, or 12.39%, to $209,350 for the three-months ended September 30, 2016 compared with $238,955
for the three-months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in revenues was due to a decrease in popularity of our higher priced
RD1212 model, offset by an increase in popularity our RD1503 model.  

Cost
of Goods Sold.  Our Cost of Goods Sold increased $56,642, or 39.52% to $199,959 for the three months ended September 30, 2016
compared to $143,317 for the comparable period in 2015. The increase is due to an overall increase in sales of a higher cost
unit.  

Operating
Expenses.  For the three-months ended September 30, 2016, our total operating expenses increased $1,968, or 7.14%, to $29,540
compared to $27,572 for the three-months ended September 30, 2015. The increase is attributable to the Company s increase
in online advertising and accounting and consulting fees.  

Net
Income (loss).  Our net income changed by $88,215, or 129.60%, to a net loss of $20,149 for the three-months ended September
30, 2016 compared to a net income of $68,066 for the comparable period in 2015. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in
revenues and an increase in our cost of goods sold and operating expenses as discussed above.  

Nine
months ended September 30, 2016 compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2015   

Revenues.
 Our net revenues decreased $3,994, or 0.65%, to $610,084 for the nine-months ended September 30, 2016 compared with $614,078
for the nine-months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in revenues was due to an increase in the popularity of a lower
priced model, offset by decrease in orders from one of our other models.  

Cost
of Goods Sold.  Our Cost of Goods Sold increased $8,649, or 1.70% to $518,653 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016
compared to $510,004 for the comparable period in 2015. The increase is due to the increase in popularity of a higher cost
model, thus leading to the increase of total units shipped (and ordered) while bringing in smaller profit margins and total gross
sales.  

Operating
Expenses.  For the nine-months ended September 30, 2016, our total operating expenses increased $20,266, or 25.00%, to $101,345
compared to $81,079 for the nine-months ended September 30, 2015. Operating expenses were comprised of general and administrative
expenses, advertising and professional and consulting fees. The components of operating expenses are discussed below.  

Net
Income (loss).  Our net income (loss) changed by $32,909, or 143.11%, to a net loss of $9,914 for the nine-months ended September
30, 2016 compared to a net income of $22,995 for the comparable period in 2015. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease in
revenues and an increase in cost of goods sold and operating expenses as discussed above.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources . During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we used cash for operating expenses from cash on hand
and the sale of products on the Internet and from independent, third party resellers.  

Our
total assets were $148,688 and $222,822 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, consisting of $20,510 and
$66,390, respectively in cash. Our working capital surplus was $86,640 and $93,554 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015,
respectively.  

Our
total liabilities were $62,048 and $129,268 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  

Our
stockholders  equity was $86,640 and $93,554 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively and our retained
earnings were $82,140 and $92,054 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  

We
used $48,880 and $66,884 in cash from operating activities for the nine-months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

We
had no cash provided by investing activities for the nine-months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

We
had $3,000 cash provided by financing activities for the nine-months ended September 30, 2016 and $0 for the nine months ended
September 30, 2015, respectively.  

We
do not have sufficient funds for pursuing our plan of operation, but we are in the process of trying to procure funds sufficient
to fund our operations until we are able to finance our operations through cash flow. There can be no assurance that we will be
able to procure funds sufficient for such purpose. If operating difficulties or other factors (many of which are beyond our control)
delay our realization of revenues or cash flows from operations, we may be limited in our ability to pursue our business plan.
Moreover, if our resources from obtaining additional capital or cash flows from operations, once we commence them, do not satisfy
our operational needs or if unexpected expenses arise due to unanticipated pressures or if we decide to expand our business plan
beyond its currently anticipated level or otherwise, we will require additional financing to fund our operations, in addition
to anticipated cash generated from our operations. Additional financing might not be available on terms favorable to us, or at
all. If adequate funds were not available or were not available on acceptable terms, our ability to fund our operations, take
advantage of unanticipated opportunities, develop or enhance our business or otherwise respond to competitive pressures would
be significantly limited. In a worst-case scenario, we might not be able to fund our operations or to remain in business, which
could result in a total loss of our stockholders  investment. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity
or convertible debt securities, the percentage ownership of our stockholders would be reduced, and these newly issued securities
might have rights, preferences or privileges senior to those of existing stockholders.  

The
Company had no formal long-term lines or credit or other bank financing arrangements as of September 30, 2016.  

The
Company has no current plans for the purchase or sale of any plant or equipment.  

The
Company has no current plans to make any changes in the number of employees.  

Income
Tax Expense (Benefit)   

The
Company has a prospective income tax benefit resulting from a net operating loss carry forward and startup costs that may offset
any future operating profit.  

Impact
of Inflation   

The
Company believes that inflation has had a negligible effect on operations over the past quarter.  

Capital
Expenditures   

The
Company expended no amounts on capital expenditures for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015,
respectively.  

Plan
of Operation   

Our
business strategy is to continue to market our website ( www.quartarad.com ). We have used our website to market products
for sale to consumers as well to third party distributors. We will continue to strengthen our presence on e-commerce sites. We
are also focusing on expanding our reseller network by targeting large consumer retail chains.  

The
number of detection devices, which we will be able to sell will depend upon the success of our marketing efforts through our website
and the distributors that we will enter into agreement with to sell the products.  

We
intend to implement the following tasks within the next twelve months:  

Inventory :
(Estimated cost $40,000-$225,000). We intend to purchase inventory to increase our sales. We believe that these funds will be
initially sufficient for us to increase our inventory from Quarta-Rad, Ltd. We intend to pay for this expense from the proceeds
of our public offering on Form S-1.  

Marketing :
(Estimated cost $25,000-$75,000). In addition to the website development costs, we intend to increase our marketing efforts on
the Internet to generate leads and sales. We will also utilize funds to develop marketing brochures and materials to market the
products to industry professionals such as home renovation contractors.  

If
we are able to successfully complete the above goals within the estimated timeframes set forth and are able to raise additional
proceeds that may be needed to secure inventory and marketing funds, those funds would be allocated as follows:    

Secure
Distribution Agreements : (Estimated cost $10,000). We plan to seek and secure distribution agreements for the sale of our
detection devices.  

Our
management does not anticipate the need to hire additional full or part- time employees over the next six (6) months, as the services
provided by our officers and directors and our independent contractor appear sufficient at this time. We believe that our operations
are currently on a small scale that is manageable by these two individuals as well as our independent contractor. Our management s
responsibilities are mainly administrative at this early stage. While we believe that the addition of employees is not required
over the next six (6) months, the professionals we plan to utilize will be considered independent contractors. We do not intend
to enter into any employment agreements with any of these professionals. Thus, these persons are not intended to be employees
of our company.  

Our
management does not expect to incur research costs in the next twelve months; we currently do not own any plants or equipment
that we would seek to sell in the near future; we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements; and we have not paid for expenses
on behalf of our directors. Additionally, we believe that this fact shall not materially change. Our majority shareholder and
director, Victor Shvetsky, has developed a software program called RadexRead, which is currently being used by Quarta-Rad, Ltd
in the manufacture of the RD 1212 product at no cost to the Company.  

Off-Balance
Sheet Arrangements   

None.  

Forward
Looking Statements   

This
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations  in Item 2 of Part I of this report include forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (collectively, the  Reform
Act ). The Reform Act provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements to encourage companies to provide prospective
information about themselves so long as they identify these statements as forward-looking and provide meaningful cautionary statements
identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ from the projected results. All statements, other than
statements of historical fact that we make in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are forward-looking. The words  anticipates, 
 believes,   expects,   intends,   will continue,   estimates,   plans, 
 projects,  the negative of these terms and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.
However, the absence of these words does not mean the statement is not forward-looking.   

Forward-looking
statements involve risks, uncertainties or other factors which may cause actual results to differ materially from the future results,
performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. These statements are based on our management s
beliefs and assumptions, which in turn are based on currently available information. Certain risks, uncertainties or other important
factors are detailed in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and may be detailed from time to time in other reports we file with
the Securities and Exchange Commission, including on Forms 8-K and 10-K.   

We
operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks emerge from time to time. It is not possible for us
to predict all of those risks, nor can we assess the impact of all of those risks on our business or the extent to which any factor
may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement. We believe these forward-looking
statements are reasonable. However, you should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements, which are based on
current expectations. Further, forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and unless required by law,
we expressly disclaim any obligation or undertaking to update publicly any of them in light of new information or future events.   

CRITICAL
ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES   

Our
condensed financial statements and related public financial information are based on the application of accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States (  GAAP  ). GAAP requires the use of estimates; assumptions, judgments
and subjective interpretations of accounting principles that have an impact on the assets, liabilities, revenues and expense amounts
reported. These estimates can also affect supplemental information contained in our external disclosures including information
regarding contingencies, risk and financial condition. We believe our use of estimates and underlying accounting assumptions adhere
to GAAP and are consistently and conservatively applied. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions
that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different
assumptions or conditions. We continue to monitor significant estimates made during the preparation of our condensed financial
statements.  

Use
of Estimates:   

Areas
where significant estimation judgments are made and where actual results could differ materially from these estimates are the
carrying value of certain assets and liabilities which are not readily apparent from other sources and the classification of net
operating loss and tax credit carry forwards.  

We
suggest that our significant accounting policies, as described in our condensed financial statements in the Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies, be read in conjunction with this Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations.  

Item
3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk  

As
a   smaller reporting company   as defined by Item 10 of Regulation S-K, we are not required to provide information
required by this item.  

Item
4. Controls and Procedures  

Disclosure
of controls and procedures.  

As
required by Rule 13a-15 or Rule 15d-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ),
our management, including our principal executive officer and principal accounting officer carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness
of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based
on the foregoing evaluation, we have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of September
30, 2016 and that they do not allow for information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits
under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and
Exchange Commission ( SEC ) rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls
and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under
the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company s management, including its Chief Executive and Principal
Accounting   Financial Officers as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.  

The
material weaknesses relate to the following:  

1.  
      The
    Company does not have a sufficient complement of personnel to establish appropriate segregation of duties.   

2.  
      The
    Company did not implement financial controls that were properly designed to meet the control objective or address all risks
    of the processes or the applicable assertions of the significant accounts.   

Management
believes that the aforementioned material weaknesses did not impact our financial reporting or result in a material misstatement
of our condensed financial statements.  

Changes
in internal controls over financial reporting.  

There
were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this Quarterly Report
on Form 10-Q that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting.
