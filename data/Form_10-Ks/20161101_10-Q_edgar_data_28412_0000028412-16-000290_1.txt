NOTE   1   - BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
  Organization 
  The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with United States (U.S.) generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, the statements do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring accruals) considered necessary for a fair presentation were included. The results of operations for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ending   December 31, 2016  . Certain items in prior periods were reclassified to conform to the current presentation. For further information, refer to the consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto included in the Annual Report of Comerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries (the Corporation) on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  . 
  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
  In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842),  (ASU 2016-02), to increase the transparency and comparability of lease recognition and disclosure. The update requires lessees to recognize lease contracts with a term greater than one year on the balance sheet, while recognizing expenses on the income statement in a manner similar to current guidance. For lessors, the update makes targeted changes to the classification criteria and the lessor accounting model to align the guidance with the new lessee model and revenue guidance. ASU 2016-02 is effective for the Corporation on January 1, 2019 and must be applied using the modified retrospective approach. Early adoption is permitted. The Corporation is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2016-02. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09,  Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718):  Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payments Accounting,  (ASU 2016-09), which intends to simplify accounting for share based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences and classification of awards. Among other items, the update requires excess tax benefits and deficiencies to be recognized as a component of income taxes within the income statement rather than other comprehensive income as required in current guidance. ASU 2016-09 is effective for the Corporation on January 1, 2017. The recognition of excess tax benefits and deficiencies in the income statement must be adopted prospectively. The method of transition required will differ for other items being amended. Early adoption is permitted. The impact to the Corporation upon adoption is dependent on the market value per share of the Corporation's common stock at option expiration dates and restricted stock vesting dates. 
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, "Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments," (ASU 2016-13), which addresses concerns regarding the perceived delay in recognition of credit losses under the existing incurred loss model. The amendment introduces a new, single model for recognizing credit losses on all financial instruments presented on cost basis. Under the new model, entities must estimate current expected credit losses by considering all available relevant information, including historical and current information, as well as reasonable and supportable forecasts of future events. The update also requires additional qualitative and quantitative information to allow users to better understand the credit risk within the portfolio and the methodologies for determining allowance. ASU 2016-13 is effective for the Corporation on January 1, 2020 and must be applied using the modified retrospective approach with limited exceptions. Early adoption is permitted. The Corporation is currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2016-13. 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments,  (ASU 2016-15), which reduces diversity in the presentation of several categories of transactions in the cash flow statement. Among other things, the update clarifies the appropriate classification for proceeds from settlement of bank owned life insurance (BOLI) policies. Based on preliminary assessments, the Corporation expects to change the classification of proceeds from settlement of BOLI policies from operating activities to investing activities. Proceeds from settlement of BOLI policies totaled   $10 million   and   $6 million   for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and   $12 million   for the year ended December 31, 2015. Other changes in classification resulting from this update are not expected to be significant. ASU 2016-15 is effective for the Corporation on January 1, 2018 and must be applied using the retrospective approach. Early adoption is permitted.  
   
  NOTE   2     FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS 
  The Corporation utilizes fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain assets and liabilities and to determine fair value disclosures. The determination of fair values of financial instruments often requires the use of estimates. In cases where quoted market values in an active market are not available, the Corporation uses present value techniques and other valuation methods to estimate the fair values of its financial instruments. These valuation methods require considerable judgment and the resulting estimates of fair value can be significantly affected by the assumptions made and methods used.

Trading securities, investment securities available-for-sale, derivatives and deferred compensation plan liabilities are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Additionally, from time to time, the Corporation may be required to record other assets and liabilities at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, such as impaired loans, other real estate (primarily foreclosed property), nonmarketable equity securities and certain other assets and liabilities. These nonrecurring fair value adjustments typically involve write-downs of individual assets or application of lower of cost or fair value accounting. 
  Refer to Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in the Corporation's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   for further information about the fair value hierarchy, descriptions of the valuation methodologies and key inputs used to measure financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value, as well as a description of the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate fair value disclosures for financial instruments not recorded at fair value in their entirety on a recurring basis. 
  ASSETS AND LIABLILITIES RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS 
  The following tables present the recorded amount of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON A NONRECURRING BASIS 
  The Corporation may be required, from time to time, to record certain assets and liabilities at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. These include assets that are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value that were recognized at fair value below cost at the end of the period. The following table presents assets recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .   No   liabilities were recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 

(a) 
    Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value amounts presented in the table are intended to permit reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the amounts presented in the consolidated balance sheets. 
     Level 3 assets recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   included loans for which a specific allowance was established based on the fair value of collateral and other real estate for which fair value of the properties was less than the cost basis. For both asset classes, the unobservable inputs were the additional adjustments applied by management to the appraised values to reflect such factors as non-current appraisals and revisions to estimated time to sell. These adjustments are determined based on qualitative judgments made by management on a case-by-case basis and are not quantifiable inputs, although they are used in the determination of fair value. 
  The Corporation's Level 3 recurring fair value measurements primarily include auction-rate securities where fair value is determined using an income approach based on a discounted cash flow model and certain interest rate derivative contracts where credit valuation adjustments are significant to the overall fair value of the derivative. The inputs in the table below reflect management's expectation of continued illiquidity in the secondary auction-rate securities market due to a lack of market activity for the issuers remaining in the portfolio, a lack of market incentives for issuer redemptions, and the expectation for a continuing low interest rate environment. The   September 30, 2016   workout periods reflect the view that short-term interest rates could rise at a slower pace in 2016 than was expected at   December 31, 2015  .

ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS NOT RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS 
  The Corporation typically holds the majority of its financial instruments until maturity and thus does not expect to realize many of the estimated fair value amounts disclosed. The disclosures also do not include estimated fair value amounts for items that are not defined as financial instruments, but which have significant value. These include such items as core deposit intangibles, the future earnings potential of significant customer relationships and the value of trust operations and other fee generating businesses. The Corporation believes the imprecision of an estimate could be significant. 
  The carrying amount and estimated fair value of financial instruments not recorded at fair value in their entirety on a recurring basis on the Corporation s consolidated balance sheets are as follows: 

(b) 
    Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value amounts presented in the table are intended to permit reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the amounts presented in the consolidated balance sheets. 
              (c) 
    Included   $8 million   impaired loans held-for-sale recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis at   December 31, 2015  . 
              (d) 
    Included   $1 million   of nonmarketable equity securities recorded at fair value on a nonrecurring basis at   December 31, 2015  .

NOTE   3   - INVESTMENT SECURITIES 
  A summary of the Corporation s investment securities follows: 

(a) 
    Issued and/or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies or U.S. government-sponsored enterprises. 
               (c) 
    The amortized cost of investment securities held-to-maturity included net unrealized losses of   $13 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   $15 million   at   December 31, 2015   related to securities transferred from available-for-sale, which are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss. 
     A summary of the Corporation s investment securities in an unrealized loss position as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   follows: 

(a) 
    Issued and/or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies or U.S. government-sponsored enterprises. 
              (b) 
    Primarily auction-rate securities. 
              (c) 
    Unrealized losses less than $0.5 million. 
     At   September 30, 2016  , the Corporation had   95   securities in an unrealized loss position with no credit impairment, including   52   residential mortgage-backed securities,   28   auction-rate preferred securities and   15   state and municipal auction-rate

     Table of Contents

securities. As of   September 30, 2016  , approximately   96 percent   of the aggregate par value of auction-rate securities have been redeemed or sold since acquisition, of which approximately   90 percent   were redeemed at or above cost. The unrealized losses for these securities resulted from changes in market interest rates and liquidity. The Corporation ultimately expects full collection of the carrying amount of these securities, does not intend to sell the securities in an unrealized loss position, and it is not more-likely-than-not that the Corporation will be required to sell the securities in an unrealized loss position prior to recovery of amortized cost. The Corporation does not consider these securities to be other-than-temporarily impaired at   September 30, 2016  . 
  Sales, calls and write-downs of investment securities available-for-sale are recorded in  net securities losses  on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income, computed based on the adjusted cost of the specific security. The Corporation recognized   no   gains or losses for both the   three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   and   no   gains and   $3 million   and   $2 million   of losses for the   nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , respectively. 
  The following table summarizes the amortized cost and fair values of debt securities by contractual maturity. Securities with multiple maturity dates are classified in the period of final maturity. Expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties. 

Included in the contractual maturity distribution in the table above were residential mortgage-backed securities available-for-sale with total amortized cost and fair value of   $7.7 billion   and   $7.8 billion  , respectively, and residential mortgage-backed securities held-to-maturity with a total amortized cost and fair value of   $1.7 billion  . The actual cash flows of mortgage-backed securities may differ from contractual maturity as the borrowers of the underlying loans may exercise prepayment options. 
  At   September 30, 2016  , investment securities with a carrying value of   $1.5 billion   were pledged where permitted or required by law to secure   $990 million   of liabilities, primarily public and other deposits of state and local government agencies and derivative instruments.

NOTE   4     CREDIT QUALITY AND ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES 
  The following table presents an aging analysis of the recorded balance of loans.

    Primarily loans secured by owner-occupied real estate.

The following table presents loans by credit quality indicator, based on internal risk ratings assigned to each business loan at the time of approval and subjected to subsequent reviews, generally at least annually, and to pools of retail loans with similar risk characteristics. 

(a) 
    Includes all loans not included in the categories of special mention, substandard or nonaccrual. 
              (b) 
    Special mention loans are accruing loans that have potential credit weaknesses that deserve management s close attention, such as loans to borrowers who may be experiencing financial difficulties that may result in deterioration of repayment prospects from the borrower at some future date. 
              (c) 
    Substandard loans are accruing loans that have a well-defined weakness, or weaknesses, such as loans to borrowers who may be experiencing losses from operations or inadequate liquidity of a degree and duration that jeopardizes the orderly repayment of the loan. Substandard loans also are distinguished by the distinct possibility of loss in the future if these weaknesses are not corrected. This category is generally consistent with the "substandard" category as defined by regulatory authorities. 
              (d) 
    Nonaccrual loans are loans for which the accrual of interest has been discontinued. For further information regarding nonaccrual loans, refer to the Nonperforming Assets subheading in Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Accounting Policies - on page F-58 in the Corporation's 2015 Annual Report. A significant majority of nonaccrual loans are generally consistent with the "substandard" category and the remainder are generally consistent with the "doubtful" category as defined by regulatory authorities. 
              (e) 
    Primarily loans to real estate developers. 
              (f) 
    Primarily loans secured by owner-occupied real estate.

There were   no   retail loans secured by residential real estate properties in process of foreclosure included in nonaccrual loans at   September 30, 2016     compared to   $1 million   at   December 31, 2015  . 
  Allowance for Credit Losses 
  The following table details the changes in the allowance for loan losses and related loan amounts.

  Individually Evaluated Impaired Loans 
  The following table presents additional information regarding individually evaluated impaired loans. 

(a) 
    Primarily loans to real estate developers. 
              (b) 
    Primarily loans secured by owner-occupied real estate. 
              (c) 
    Individually evaluated retail loans generally have no related allowance for loan losses, primarily due to policy which results in direct write-downs of most restructured retail loans.

Troubled Debt Restructurings  
  The following tables detail the recorded balance at   September 30, 2016   and   2015   of loans considered to be troubled debt restructurings (TDRs) that were restructured during the   three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , by type of modification. In cases of loans with more than one type of modification, the loans were categorized based on the most significant modification. 

(a) 
    Primarily represents loan balances where terms were extended   90   days or more at or above contractual interest rates. 
              (b) 
    Loan restructurings whereby the original loan is restructured into two notes:  an "A" note, which generally reflects the portion of the modified loan which is expected to be collected; and a "B" note, which is generally fully charged off. 
              (c) 
    Primarily loans to real estate developers. 
              (d) 
    Primarily loans secured by owner-occupied real estate. 
     Commitments to lend additional funds to borrowers whose terms have been modified in TDRs were   $37 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   $6 million   at   December 31, 2015  . 
  The majority of the modifications considered to be TDRs that occurred during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   were principal deferrals. The Corporation charges interest on principal balances outstanding during deferral periods. Additionally, none of the modifications involved forgiveness of principal. As a result, the current and future financial effects of the recorded balance of loans considered to be TDRs that were restructured during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   were insignificant. 
  On an ongoing basis, the Corporation monitors the performance of modified loans to their restructured terms. In the event of a subsequent default, the allowance for loan losses continues to be reassessed on the basis of an individual evaluation of the loan.

The following table presents information regarding the recorded balance at   September 30, 2016   and   2015   of loans modified by principal deferral during the twelve-month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , and those principal deferrals which experienced a subsequent default during the   three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  . For principal deferrals, incremental deterioration in the credit quality of the loan, represented by a downgrade in the risk rating of the loan, for example, due to missed interest payments or a reduction of collateral value, is considered a subsequent default.  

(a) 
    Primarily loans to real estate developers. 
              (b) 
    Primarily loans secured by owner-occupied real estate. 
              (c) 
    Includes bankruptcy loans for which the court has discharged the borrower's obligation and the borrower has not reaffirmed the debt. 
     During the twelve-month periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , loans with a carrying value of   $4 million   and   $2 million  , respectively, were modified by interest rate reduction. During the twelve-month period ended   September 30, 2016  , loans with a carrying value of   $52 million   were restructured into two notes (AB note restructures). For reduced-rate loans and AB Note restructures, a subsequent payment default is defined in terms of delinquency, when a principal or interest payment is   90   days past due. There were   no   subsequent payment defaults of reduced-rate loans or AB note restructures during the   three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
   
  NOTE   5   - DERIVATIVE AND CREDIT-RELATED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
  In the normal course of business, the Corporation enters into various transactions involving derivative and credit-related financial instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rate, foreign currency and other market risks and to meet the financing needs of customers (customer-initiated derivatives). These financial instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of market and credit risk. Market and credit risk are included in the determination of fair value. 
  Market risk is the potential loss that may result from movements in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates or energy commodity prices that cause an unfavorable change in the value of a financial instrument. The Corporation manages this risk by establishing monetary exposure limits and monitoring compliance with those limits. Market risk inherent in interest rate and energy contracts entered into on behalf of customers is mitigated by taking offsetting positions, except in those circumstances when the amount, tenor and/or contract rate level results in negligible economic risk, whereby the cost of purchasing an offsetting contract is not economically justifiable. The Corporation mitigates most of the inherent market risk in foreign exchange contracts entered into on behalf of customers by taking offsetting positions and manages the remainder through individual foreign currency position limits and aggregate value-at-risk limits. These limits are established annually and reviewed quarterly. Market risk inherent in derivative instruments held or issued for risk management purposes is typically offset by changes in the fair value of the assets or liabilities being hedged. 
  Credit risk is the possible loss that may occur in the event of nonperformance by the counterparty to a financial instrument. The Corporation attempts to minimize credit risk arising from customer-initiated derivatives by evaluating the creditworthiness of each customer, adhering to the same credit approval process used for traditional lending activities and obtaining collateral as deemed necessary. Derivatives with dealer counterparties are either cleared through a clearinghouse or settled directly with a single

counterparty. For derivatives settled directly with dealer counterparties, the Corporation utilizes counterparty risk limits and monitoring procedures as well as master netting arrangements and bilateral collateral agreements to facilitate the management of credit risk. Master netting arrangements effectively reduce credit risk by permitting settlement of positive and negative positions and offset cash collateral held with the same counterparty on a net basis. Bilateral collateral agreements require daily exchange of cash or highly rated securities issued by the U.S. Treasury or other U.S. government entities to collateralize amounts due to either party beyond certain risk limits. At   September 30, 2016  , counterparties with bilateral collateral agreements had pledged   $34 million   of marketable investment securities and deposited   $147 million   of cash with the Corporation to secure the fair value of contracts in an unrealized gain position, and the Corporation had pledged   $44 million   of marketable investment securities and posted   $10 million   of cash as collateral for contracts in an unrealized loss position. For those counterparties not covered under bilateral collateral agreements, collateral is obtained, if deemed necessary, based on the results of management s credit evaluation of the counterparty. Collateral varies, but may include cash, investment securities, accounts receivable, equipment or real estate. Included in the fair value of derivative instruments are credit valuation adjustments reflecting counterparty credit risk. These adjustments are determined by applying a credit spread for the counterparty or the Corporation, as appropriate, to the total expected exposure of the derivative. There were   no   derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a liability position at   September 30, 2016  . 
  Derivative Instruments 
  Derivative instruments utilized by the Corporation are negotiated over-the-counter and primarily include swaps, caps and floors, forward contracts and options, each of which may relate to interest rates, energy commodity prices or foreign currency exchange rates. Swaps are agreements in which two parties periodically exchange cash payments based on specified indices applied to a specified notional amount until a stated maturity. Caps and floors are agreements which entitle the buyer to receive cash payments based on the difference between a specified reference rate or price and an agreed strike rate or price, applied to a specified notional amount until a stated maturity. Forward contracts are over-the-counter agreements to buy or sell an asset at a specified future date and price. Options are similar to forward contracts except the purchaser has the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell the asset during a specified period or at a specified future date. 
  Over-the-counter contracts are tailored to meet the needs of the counterparties involved and, therefore, contain a greater degree of credit risk and liquidity risk than exchange-traded contracts, which have standardized terms and readily available price information. The Corporation reduces exposure to market and liquidity risks from over-the-counter derivative instruments entered into for risk management purposes, and transactions entered into to mitigate the market risk associated with customer-initiated transactions, by conducting hedging transactions with investment grade domestic and foreign financial institutions and subjecting counterparties to credit approvals, limits and collateral monitoring procedures similar to those used in making other extensions of credit. In addition, certain derivative contracts executed bilaterally with a dealer counterparty in the over-the-counter market are cleared through a clearinghouse, whereby the clearinghouse becomes the counterparty to the transaction.

The following table presents the composition of the Corporation s derivative instruments held or issued for risk management purposes or in connection with customer-initiated and other activities at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . The table excludes commitments and warrants accounted for as derivatives. 

(a) 
    Notional or contractual amounts, which represent the extent of involvement in the derivatives market, are used to determine the contractual cash flows required in accordance with the terms of the agreement. These amounts are typically not exchanged, significantly exceed amounts subject to credit or market risk and are not reflected in the consolidated balance sheets. 
              (b) 
    Net derivative assets are included in  accrued income and other assets  and net derivative liabilities are included in  accrued expenses and other liabilities  on the consolidated balance sheets. Included in the fair value of net derivative assets and net derivative liabilities are credit valuation adjustments reflecting counterparty credit risk and credit risk of the Corporation. The fair value of net derivative assets included credit valuation adjustments for counterparty credit risk of   $11 million   and   $5 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.

Risk Management 
  As an end-user, the Corporation employs a variety of financial instruments for risk management purposes, including cash instruments, such as investment securities, as well as derivative instruments. Activity related to these instruments is centered predominantly in the interest rate markets and mainly involves interest rate swaps. Various other types of instruments also may be used to manage exposures to market risks, including interest rate caps and floors, total return swaps, foreign exchange forward contracts and foreign exchange swap agreements. 
  The Corporation has entered into interest rate swap agreements for interest rate risk management purposes. These interest rate swap agreements effectively modify the Corporation s exposure to interest rate risk by converting fixed-rate debt to a floating rate. These agreements involve the receipt of fixed-rate interest amounts in exchange for floating-rate interest payments over the life of the agreement, without an exchange of the underlying principal amount. Risk management fair value interest rate swaps generated net interest income of   $15 million   and   $18 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $48 million   and   $52 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The Corporation recognized   $1 million   and   $3 million   of net gains for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $4 million   and   $2 million   of net gains for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, for the ineffective portion of risk management derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges of fixed-rate debt, included in "other noninterest income" in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. 
  Foreign exchange rate risk arises from changes in the value of certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. The Corporation employs spot and forward contracts in addition to swap contracts to manage exposure to these and other risks. There were   no   significant net gains or losses on risk management derivative instruments used as economic hedges in any period presented in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Net gains or losses on these instruments are included in "other noninterest income". 
  The following table summarizes the expected weighted average remaining maturity of the notional amount of risk management interest rate swaps and the weighted average interest rates associated with amounts expected to be received or paid on interest rate swap agreements as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 

Management believes these hedging strategies achieve the desired relationship between the rate maturities of assets and funding sources which, in turn, reduce the overall exposure of net interest income to interest rate risk, although there can be no assurance that such strategies will be successful. 
  Customer-Initiated and Other 
  The Corporation enters into derivative transactions at the request of customers and generally takes offsetting positions with dealer counterparties to mitigate the inherent market risk. Income primarily results from the spread between the customer derivative and the offsetting dealer position.  
  For customer-initiated foreign exchange contracts where offsetting positions have not been taken, the Corporation manages the remaining inherent market risk through individual foreign currency position limits and aggregate value-at-risk limits. These limits are established annually and reviewed quarterly. For those customer-initiated derivative contracts which were not offset or where the Corporation holds a position within the limits described above, the Corporation recognized an   insignificant amount   of net gains in  other noninterest income  in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income for both the   three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , and   $1 million   of net gains for both the   nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  .

Fair values of customer-initiated and other derivative instruments represent the net unrealized gains or losses on such contracts and are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets. Changes in fair value are recognized in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. The net gains recognized in income on customer-initiated derivative instruments, net of the impact of offsetting positions, were as follows  . 

Credit-Related Financial Instruments 
  The Corporation issues off-balance sheet financial instruments in connection with commercial and consumer lending activities. The Corporation s credit risk associated with these instruments is represented by the contractual amounts indicated in the following table. 

The Corporation maintains an allowance to cover probable credit losses inherent in lending-related commitments, including unused commitments to extend credit, letters of credit and financial guarantees. The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments, included in  accrued expenses and other liabilities  on the consolidated balance sheets, was   $45 million   at both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 
  Unused Commitments to Extend Credit 
  Commitments to extend credit are legally binding agreements to lend to a customer, provided there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. These commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Since many commitments expire without being drawn upon, the total contractual amount of commitments does not necessarily represent future cash requirements of the Corporation. Commercial and other unused commitments are primarily variable rate commitments. The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments included   $30 million   and   $33 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively, for probable credit losses inherent in the Corporation s unused commitments to extend credit. 
  Standby and Commercial Letters of Credit 
  Standby letters of credit represent conditional obligations of the Corporation which guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. Standby letters of credit are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements, including commercial paper, bond financing and similar transactions. Commercial letters of credit are issued to finance foreign or domestic trade transactions. These contracts expire in decreasing amounts through the year   2023  . The Corporation may enter into participation arrangements with third parties that effectively reduce the maximum amount of future payments which may be required under standby and commercial letters of credit. These risk participations covered   $282 million   and   $287 million  , respectively, of the   $3.8 billion   and   $4.0 billion   standby and commercial letters of credit outstanding at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. 
  The carrying value of the Corporation s standby and commercial letters of credit, included in  accrued expenses and other liabilities  on the consolidated balance sheets, totaled   $50 million   at   September 30, 2016  , including   $35 million   in deferred fees and   $15 million   in the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments. At   December 31, 2015  , the comparable amounts were   $49 million  ,   $37 million   and   $12 million  , respectively.

  Comerica Incorporated and Subsidiaries 

The following table presents a summary of criticized standby and commercial letters of credit at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . The Corporation's criticized list is generally consistent with the Special mention, Substandard and Doubtful categories defined by regulatory authorities. The Corporation manages credit risk through underwriting, periodically reviewing and approving its credit exposures using Board committee approved credit policies and guidelines. 

Other Credit-Related Financial Instruments 
  The Corporation enters into credit risk participation agreements, under which the Corporation assumes credit exposure associated with a borrower s performance related to certain interest rate derivative contracts. The Corporation is not a party to the interest rate derivative contracts and only enters into these credit risk participation agreements in instances in which the Corporation is also a party to the related loan participation agreement for such borrowers. The Corporation manages its credit risk on the credit risk participation agreements by monitoring the creditworthiness of the borrowers, which is based on the normal credit review process had it entered into the derivative instruments directly with the borrower. The notional amount of such credit risk participation agreement reflects the pro-rata share of the derivative instrument, consistent with its share of the related participated loan. As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the total notional amount of the credit risk participation agreements was approximately   $514 million   and   $559 million  , respectively, and the fair value, included in customer-initiated interest rate contracts recorded in "accrued expenses and other liabilities" on the consolidated balance sheets, was   insignificant   at both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . The maximum estimated exposure to these agreements, as measured by projecting a maximum value of the guaranteed derivative instruments, assuming 100 percent default by all obligors on the maximum values, was approximately   $9 million   and   $5 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. In the event of default, the lead bank has the ability to liquidate the assets of the borrower, in which case the lead bank would be required to return a percentage of the recouped assets to the participating banks. As of   September 30, 2016  , the weighted average remaining maturity of outstanding credit risk participation agreements was   2.4   years. 
   
  NOTE   6   - VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES (VIEs) 
  The Corporation evaluates its interest in certain entities to determine if these entities meet the definition of a VIE and whether the Corporation is the primary beneficiary and should consolidate the entity based on the variable interests it held both at inception and when there is a change in circumstances that requires a reconsideration.  
  The Corporation holds ownership interests in funds in the form of limited partnerships or limited liability companies (LLCs) investing in affordable housing projects that qualify for the low-income housing tax credit (LIHTC). The Corporation also directly invests in limited partnerships and LLCs which invest in community development projects which generate similar tax credits to investors. As an investor, the Corporation obtains income tax credits and deductions from the operating losses of these tax credit entities. These tax credit entities meet the definition of a VIE; however, the Corporation is not the primary beneficiary of the entities, as it does not have both the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the entities and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could be significant to the entities. While the partnership/LLC agreements allow the limited partners/investor members, through a majority vote, to remove the general partner/managing member, this right is not deemed to be substantive. 
  The Corporation accounts for its interests in LIHTC entities using the proportional amortization method. Exposure to loss as a result of the Corporation s involvement with LIHTC entities at   September 30, 2016   was limited to approximately   $406 million  . Ownership interests in other community development projects which generate similar tax credits to investors (other tax credit entities) are accounted for under either the cost or equity method. Exposure to loss as a result of the Corporation's involvement in other tax credit entities at   September 30, 2016   was limited to approximately   $8 million  . 
  Investment balances, including all legally binding commitments to fund future investments, are included in  accrued income and other assets  on the consolidated balance sheets. A liability is recognized in  accrued expenses and other liabilities  on the consolidated balance sheets for all legally binding unfunded commitments to fund tax credit entities (  $150 million   at   September 30, 2016  ). Amortization and other write-downs of LIHTC investments are presented on a net basis as a component of the "provision for income taxes" on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income, while amortization and write-downs of other tax credit investments are recorded in  other noninterest income." The income tax credits and deductions are recorded as a reduction of income tax expense and a reduction of federal income taxes payable. 
  The Corporation provided   no   financial or other support that was not contractually required to any of the above VIEs during the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  .

  NOTE   7   - MEDIUM- AND LONG-TERM DEBT 
  Medium- and long-term debt is summarized as follows: 

(a) 
    The fixed interest rates on these notes have been swapped to a variable rate and designated in a hedging relationship. Accordingly, carrying value has been adjusted to reflect the change in the fair value of the debt as a result of changes in the benchmark rate. 
              (b) 
    The fixed interest rate on   $250 million   of   $650 million   total par value of these notes have been swapped to a variable rate. The remaining amount is not swapped. 
     Subordinated notes with remaining maturities greater than one year qualify as Tier 2 capital. 
  Comerica Bank (the Bank), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Corporation, is a member of the FHLB, which provides short- and long-term funding to its members through advances collateralized by real estate-related assets. Actual borrowing capacity is contingent on the amount of collateral available to be pledged to the FHLB. At   September 30, 2016  ,   $15.3 billion   of real estate-related loans were pledged to the FHLB as blanket collateral for potential future borrowings of approximately   $3.8 billion  . 
  In the second quarter 2016, the Bank borrowed   $2.8 billion   of 10-year, floating-rate FHLB advances due   2026  . The interest rate on each of   eight   notes resets every four weeks, based on the FHLB auction rate, with the reset date of each note scheduled at one-week intervals. At   September 30, 2016   the weighted-average rate on these advances was   0.4045%  . Each note may be prepaid in full, without penalty, at each scheduled reset date. Proceeds were used for general corporate purposes.

In October 2016, the Corporation modified the tax-qualified defined benefit retirement plan (the pension plan) to freeze final average pay benefits as of December 31, 2016, other than for participants who are 60 or older as of December 31, 2016, and added a cash balance plan provision, effective January 1, 2017. In October 2016, the Corporation also modified the non-qualified retirement benefit plan (the non-qualified pension plan) to effectively adjust the final average pay benefit under that plan so that only compensation and service prior to December 31, 2016 is taken into account, other than for active participants on December 31, 2016 who are 60 or older as of that date. Any final average pay benefit that would have been earned under the non-qualified pension plan based on compensation and service after December 31, 2016 will be effectively frozen (other than for active participants age 60 or older). Most active pension plan participants will be converted to a cash balance formula effective January 1, 2017. Generally, active pension plan participants 60 years or older as of December 31, 2016 remain covered by the final average pay formula. Eligible employees currently participating in the retirement account plan, a defined contribution plan covering employees not accruing a benefit in the pension plan, will also be converted to the cash balance pension plan effective January 1, 2017. Final retirement account plan balances will be transferred to the Corporation's 401(k) plan in the first quarter of 2017. Contributions to the retirement account plan will cease for periods beginning after December 31, 2016. 
  As a result of the plan modifications, the Corporation remeasured the pension plan and the non-qualified pension plan as of September 30, 2016. The Corporation updated its significant actuarial assumptions used for the remeasurements including the discount rate, which decreased to   3.64 percent  . The fair value of pension plan assets as of the remeasurement date was   $2.6 billion  . The remeasurement increased the qualified defined benefit pension plan asset by   $41 million  , including a prior service credit of   $201 million   and an actuarial loss of   $160 million  . The non-qualified defined benefit pension plan liability decreased by   $3 million  , including a prior service credit of   $34 million   and an actuarial loss of   $31 million  .  
  For further information on the Corporation's employee benefit plans, refer to Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements in the Corporation's   2015   Annual Report. 
   
  NOTE   11   - INCOME TAXES AND TAX-RELATED ITEMS 
  At   September 30, 2016  , net unrecognized tax benefits were   $15 million  , compared to   $22 million   at   December 31, 2015  . The   decrease   in net unrecognized tax benefits of   $7 million   was primarily due to the recognition of federal settlements. The Corporation anticipates that it is reasonably possible that final settlement of federal and state tax issues will result in a decrease in net unrecognized tax benefits of   $1 million   within the next twelve months. Included in "accrued expense and other liabilities" on the consolidated balance sheets was an   $8 million   liability for tax-related interest and penalties at   September 30, 2016   compared to   $3 million   at   December 31, 2015  . 
  Net deferred tax assets were   $187 million   at   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $199 million   at   December 31, 2015  . The decrease of   $12 million   in net deferred tax assets resulted primarily from an increase in deferred tax liabilities related to unrealized gains on investment securities available-for-sale and the   September 30, 2016   remeasurement of the Corporation's defined benefit pension plans as well as a reversal of deferred tax assets related to expired stock options, partially offset by restructuring charges and an increase in the allowance for loan losses. Included in deferred tax assets at both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   were   $5 million   of state net operating loss carryforwards, which expire between   2016   and   2026  . The Corporation believes that it is more likely than not that the benefit from certain of these state net operating loss carryforwards will not be realized and, accordingly, maintained a valuation allowance of   $3 million   at both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . The determination regarding valuation allowance was based on evidence of loss carryback capacity, projected future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences to absorb the deferred tax assets and assumptions made regarding future events.  
  In the ordinary course of business, the Corporation enters into certain transactions that have tax consequences. From time to time, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) or other tax jurisdictions may review and/or challenge specific interpretive tax positions taken by the Corporation with respect to those transactions. The Corporation believes that its tax returns were filed based upon applicable statutes, regulations and case law in effect at the time of the transactions. The IRS or other tax jurisdictions, an administrative authority or a court, if presented with the transactions, could disagree with the Corporation s interpretation of the tax law.

Based on current knowledge and probability assessment of various potential outcomes, the Corporation believes that current tax reserves are adequate, and the amount of any potential incremental liability arising is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Corporation s consolidated financial condition or results of operations. Probabilities and outcomes are reviewed as events unfold, and adjustments to the reserves are made when necessary. 
   
  NOTE   12   - CONTINGENT LIABILITIES 
  Legal Proceedings 
  As previously reported in the Corporation's Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015   and Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2016, and June 30, 2016, Comerica Bank, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Corporation, was named in November 2011 as a third-party defendant in   Butte Local Development v. Masters Group v. Comerica Bank   ( the case ), for lender liability. The case was tried in January 2014, in the Montana Second District Judicial Court for Silver Bow County in Butte, Montana. On   January 17, 2014  , a jury awarded Masters   $52 million   against the Bank. On July 1, 2015, after an appeal filed by the Corporation, the Montana Supreme Court ("the court") reversed the judgment against the Corporation and remanded the case for a new trial with instructions that Michigan law should apply. The court also reversed punitive and consequential damages previously awarded by the jury. The Corporation believes it has meritorious defenses to the remaining claims in this case and intends to continue to defend itself vigorously. Management believes that current reserves related to this case are adequate in the event of a negative outcome. 
  The Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries are subject to various other pending or threatened legal proceedings arising out of the normal course of business or operations. The Corporation believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it in its other currently outstanding legal proceedings and, with respect to such legal proceedings, intends to continue to defend itself vigorously, litigating or settling cases according to management s judgment as to what is in the best interests of the Corporation and its shareholders. Settlement may result from the Corporation's determination that it may be more prudent financially to settle, rather than litigate, and should not be regarded as an admission of liability. On at least a quarterly basis, the Corporation assesses its potential liabilities and contingencies in connection with outstanding legal proceedings utilizing the latest information available. On a case-by-case basis, reserves are established for those legal claims for which it is probable that a loss will be incurred either as a result of a settlement or judgment, and the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. The actual costs of resolving these claims may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts reserved. Based on current knowledge, and after consultation with legal counsel, management believes that current reserves are adequate, and the amount of any incremental liability arising from these matters is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Corporation s consolidated financial condition, consolidated results of operations or consolidated cash flows. Legal fees of   $4 million   and   $5 million   were included in "other noninterest expenses" on the consolidated statements of income for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $14 million   and   $15 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  For matters where a loss is not probable, the Corporation has not established legal reserves. The Corporation believes the estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses, in excess of reserves established, for all legal proceedings in which it is involved is from   zero   to approximately   $32 million   at   September 30, 2016  . This estimated aggregate range of reasonably possible losses is based upon currently available information for those proceedings in which the Corporation is involved, taking into account the Corporation s best estimate of such losses for those cases for which such estimate can be made. For certain cases, the Corporation does not believe that an estimate can currently be made. The Corporation s estimate involves significant judgment, given the varying stages of the proceedings (including the fact that many are currently in preliminary stages), the existence in certain proceedings of multiple defendants (including the Corporation) whose share of liability has yet to be determined, the numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of the proceedings (including issues regarding class certification and the scope of many of the claims) and the attendant uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such proceedings. Accordingly, the Corporation s estimate will change from time to time, and actual losses may be more or less than the current estimate. 
  In the event of unexpected future developments, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of these matters may be material to the Corporation's consolidated financial condition, consolidated results of operations or consolidated cash flows. 
  For information regarding income tax contingencies, refer to Note   11  . 
   
  NOTE   13   - RESTRUCTURING CHARGES 
  The Corporation approved and launched an initiative in the second quarter 2016 designed to reduce overhead and increase revenue (the GEAR Up initiative). The actions in the initiative include, but are not limited to, a reduction in workforce, a new retirement program, streamlining operational processes, real estate optimization including consolidating   38   banking centers as well as reducing office and operations space, selective outsourcing of technology functions and reduction of technology system applications.

Certain actions associated with the GEAR Up initiative result in restructuring charges. Generally, costs associated with or incurred to generate revenue as part of the initiative are recorded according to the nature of the cost and are not included in restructuring charges. The Corporation considers the following costs associated with the initiative to be restructuring charges: 
             
    Employee costs:   Primarily severance costs in accordance with the Corporation s severance plan. 
                
    Facilities costs:   Costs pertaining to consolidating banking centers and other facilities, such as lease termination costs and decommissioning costs. Also includes accelerated depreciation and impairment of owned property to be sold. 
                
    Technology costs:   Impairment and other costs associated with optimizing technology infrastructure and reducing the number of applications. 
                
    Other costs:   Includes primarily professional fees, as well as other contract termination fees and legal fees incurred in the execution of the initiative.  
     See Note 10 for further information concerning the Corporation's retirement benefit plans. 
  Restructuring charges are recorded as a component of noninterest expenses on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. The following table presents changes in restructuring reserves, cumulative charges incurred to date and total expected restructuring charges: 

(a) 
    Adjustments for non-cash charges include the benefit from forfeitures of nonvested stock compensation in Employee Costs and accelerated depreciation expense in Facilities Costs. 
      Restructuring charges directly attributable to a business segment are assigned to that business segment. Restructuring charges incurred by areas whose services support the overall Corporation are allocated based on the methodology described in Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements in the Corporation's 2015 Annual Report. Total restructuring charges assigned to the Business Bank, Retail Bank and Wealth Management were   $10 million  ,   $8 million   and   $2 million  , respectively, for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   $36 million  ,   $27 million   and   $10 million  , respectively, for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . Remaining expected restructuring charges will be assigned to the business segments using the same methodology. Facilities costs pertaining to the consolidation of banking centers are expected to impact primarily the Retail Bank. 
   
  NOTE   14   - BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION 
  The Corporation has strategically aligned its operations into   three   major business segments: the Business Bank, the Retail Bank and Wealth Management. These business segments are differentiated based on the type of customer and the related products and services provided. In addition to the   three   major business segments, the Finance Division is also reported as a segment. Business segment results are produced by the Corporation s internal management accounting system. This system measures financial results based on the internal business unit structure of the Corporation. The performance of the business segments is not comparable with the Corporation's consolidated results and is not necessarily comparable with similar information for any other financial institution. Additionally, because of the interrelationships of the various segments, the information presented is not indicative of how the segments would perform if they operated as independent entities. The management accounting system assigns balance sheet and income statement items to each business segment using certain methodologies, which are regularly reviewed and refined. From

time to time, the Corporation may make reclassifications among the segments to more appropriately reflect management's current view of the segments, and methodologies may be modified as the management accounting system is enhanced and changes occur in the organizational structure and/or product lines. For comparability purposes, amounts in all periods are based on business unit structure and methodologies in effect at   September 30, 2016  .  
  Effective January 1, 2016, in conjunction with the effective date for regulatory Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) requirements, the Corporation prospectively implemented an additional funds transfer pricing (FTP) charge, primarily for the cost of maintaining liquid assets to support potential draws on unfunded loan commitments and for the long-term economic cost of holding collateral for secured deposits. For further information about the Corporation's FTP methodology, refer to Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements in the Corporation's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. 
  The following discussion provides information about the activities of each business segment. A discussion of the financial results and the factors impacting performance can be found in the section entitled "Business Segments" in the financial review. 
  The Business Bank meets the needs of middle market businesses, multinational corporations and governmental entities by offering various products and services, including commercial loans and lines of credit, deposits, cash management, capital market products, international trade finance, letters of credit, foreign exchange management services and loan syndication services. 
  The Retail Bank includes small business banking and personal financial services, consisting of consumer lending, consumer deposit gathering and mortgage loan origination. In addition to a full range of financial services provided to small business customers, this business segment offers a variety of consumer products, including deposit accounts, installment loans, credit cards, student loans, home equity lines of credit and residential mortgage loans. 
  Wealth Management offers products and services consisting of fiduciary services, private banking, retirement services, investment management and advisory services, investment banking and brokerage services. This business segment also offers the sale of annuity products, as well as life, disability and long-term care insurance products. 
  The Finance segment includes the Corporation s securities portfolio and asset and liability management activities. This segment is responsible for managing the Corporation s funding, liquidity and capital needs, performing interest sensitivity analysis and executing various strategies to manage the Corporation s exposure to liquidity, interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk. 
  The Other category includes discontinued operations, the income and expense impact of equity and cash, tax benefits not assigned to specific business segments, charges of an unusual or infrequent nature that are not reflective of the normal operations of the business segments and miscellaneous other expenses of a corporate nature. 
  For further information on the methodologies which form the basis for these results refer to Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements in the Corporation's 2015 Annual Report.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 
  Net income for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   was   $149 million  , an increase of   $13 million   from   $136 million   reported for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . Excluding the after-tax impact of the third quarter 2016 restructuring charges associated with the Corporation's efficiency and revenue initiative ("GEAR Up") of $13 million, or   $0.08   per share, net income increased $26 million, primarily reflecting an increase in net interest income and a lower provision for credit losses. Net income per diluted common share was   $0.84   and   $0.74   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and average diluted common shares were   176 million   and   181 million   for each respective period. More information regarding GEAR Up is provided under the "Growth in Efficiency and Revenue Initiative" subheading below. 
  Net income for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was   $313 million  , a decrease of   $92 million   from   $405 million   reported for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . Excluding the after-tax impact of 2016 GEAR Up restructuring charges of $46 million, or   $0.27   per share, net income decreased $46 million, primarily reflecting an increase in the provision for credit losses and a benefit to the prior year from a net release of litigation reserves, partially offset by an increase in net interest income. Net income per diluted common share was   $1.76   and   $2.20   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Average diluted common shares were   176 million   and   182 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. 
  Growth in Efficiency and Revenue Initiative 
  The Corporation recently announced additional GEAR Up actions that are expected to add approximately $40 million of additional savings to the target. The GEAR Up initiative now includes expected pre-tax benefits, before restructuring charges, of approximately   $180 million   in full-year 2017 and   $270 million   in full-year 2018. Additional initiatives include a new retirement program for most employees that will replace the current pension plan and retirement account plan, effective January 1, 2017. Active pension plan participants age 60 or older as of December 31, 2016 and current retirees will not be impacted. Based on current actuarial assumptions, this initiative is expected to reduce full-year 2016 pension expense from $14 million to $7 million, resulting in a $4 million benefit in the fourth quarter 2016, and generate annual savings of approximately $35 million in full-year 2017, relative to 2016 expected retirement expense prior to the change. For further information concerning the Corporation's retirement benefit plans, refer to note   10   to the consolidated financial statements. 
             
    Expense reductions are expected to save approximately $25 million in the fourth quarter 2016, approximately   $150 million   in full-year 2017, and approximately   $200 million   in full-year 2018. This is to be achieved through a reduction in workforce, the new retirement program discussed above, streamlining operational processes, real estate optimization including consolidating banking centers as well as reducing office and operations space, selective outsourcing of technology functions and reduction of technology system applications. 
                
    As a result of GEAR Up, the Corporation announced the consolidation of 38 banking centers, of which 19 will be consolidated by the end of 2016 and the remainder before the end of the second quarter 2017. Approximately 30 percent of managerial positions have been removed and nearly 700 employees have been notified that their positions are being eliminated.  
                
    Revenue enhancements are expected to gradually ramp-up to approximately   $30 million   in full-year 2017, gradually increasing to approximately   $70 million   in full-year 2018, through expanded product offerings, enhanced sales tools and training and improved customer analytics to drive opportunities. 
                
    Pre-tax restructuring charges of   $140 million   to   $160 million   in total are expected to be incurred through 2018, including an estimated   $103 million   to   $108 million   by year-end 2016. Restructuring charges totaling   $73 million   were incurred through   September 30, 2016  . For additional information regarding restructuring charges, refer to note   13   to the consolidated financial statements. 
     Fourth Quarter 2016 Outlook Compared to Third Quarter 2016 
  Management expectations for fourth quarter 2016 compared to third quarter 2016, assuming a continuation of the current economic and low-rate environment, are as follows: 
             
    Average loans stable, reflecting growth in National Dealer Services, Technology and Life Sciences and small increases in several other lines of business, offset by seasonality in Mortgage Banker and a continued decline in Energy. 
                
    Net interest income slightly higher, reflecting benefits from a decline in wholesale funding costs and an increase in LIBOR. 
                
    Provision for credit losses expected to remain low, with net charge-offs below historical norms. Provision and net charge-offs expected to be between second quarter 2016 and third quarter 2016 levels. 
                
    Noninterest income relatively stable, excluding income from bank-owned life insurance and deferred compensation asset returns, with fee income expected to remain strong at third quarter 2016 levels. 
                
    Noninterest expenses lower, excluding an estimated   $30 million   to   $35 million   in restructuring expense, with GEAR Up expense savings of approximately $25 million, primarily salaries and benefits (including pension); seasonal increases in  
     
   37

outside processing, marketing and occupancy expected to be partially offset by third quarter 2016 level of deferred compensation expense not expected to repeat. 
             
    Income tax expense to approximate 30 percent of pre-tax income.

Quarterly Analysis of Net Interest Income   Rate/Volume (continued) 

(a) 
    Rate/volume variances are allocated to variances due to volume. 
              (b) 
    Includes investment securities available-for-sale and investment securities held-to-maturity. 
     Net interest income was   $450 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , an increase of   $28 million   compared to   $422 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . The increase in net interest income resulted primarily from the impact of higher yields on loans and Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) deposits, reflecting the benefit from the December 2015 short-term rate increase and increases in LIBOR rates, a larger investment securities portfolio and loan growth, partially offset by higher funding costs, primarily the result of higher costs on variable-rate debt tied to LIBOR rates and new Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) borrowings in the second quarter 2016. Average earning assets increased   $1.4 billion  , or   2 percent  , to   $67.6 billion  , compared to   $66.2 billion   for the same period in   2015  . The increase in average earning assets primarily reflected increases of   $2.1 billion   in average investment securities and   $234 million   in average loans, partially offset by a decrease of   $902 million   in average FRB deposits, included in "interest-bearing deposits with banks" on the consolidated balance sheets. The net interest margin (FTE) for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   increased   12   basis points to   2.66 percent  , from   2.54 percent   for the comparable period in   2015  , primarily from higher yields on loans and the reinvestment of FRB deposits into higher yielding Treasury securities, partially offset by the impact of higher funding costs. The increase in loan yields primarily reflected the benefit from the increase in short-term rates, partially offset by the impact of a higher level of nonaccrual loans in the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in the prior year.

     Net interest income was   $1.3 billion   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , an increase of   $86 million   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . The increase in net interest income resulted primarily from the same reasons as described in the quarterly discussion above, as well as the benefit of one additional day in 2016. Average earning assets increased   $1.2 billion  , or   2 percent  , to   $65.8 billion   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   $64.6 billion   for the same period in   2015  . The increase in average earning assets primarily reflected increases of   $2.3 billion   in average investment securities and   $368 million   in average loans, partially offset by a decrease of   $1.5 billion   in average FRB deposits. The net interest margin (FTE) for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   increased   13   basis points to   2.74 percent  , from   2.61 percent   for the comparable period in   2015  , primarily the result of the same reasons as described in the quarterly discussion above

  Provision for Credit Losses 
  The provision for credit losses was   $16 million   and   $26 million   for the   three-month periods ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $213 million   and   $87 million   for the   nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The provision for credit losses includes both the provision for loan losses and the provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments. 
  The provision for loan losses is recorded to maintain the allowance for loan losses at the level deemed appropriate by the Corporation to cover probable credit losses inherent in the portfolio. The provision for loan losses was   $14 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   $28 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . The decrease in the provision primarily reflected decreases in Technology and Life Sciences and, to a lesser extent, Energy. The provision for loan losses was   $202 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , an increase of   $123 million   compared to   $79 million   for the same period in the prior year. The increase in the provision was primarily driven by Energy and, to a lesser extent, general Middle Market and Small Business, partially offset by a lower provision for Technology and Life Sciences. 
  Net loan charge-offs in the   three months ended September 30, 2016   decreased   $7 million   to   $16 million  , or   0.13 percent   of average total loans, compared to   $23 million  , or   0.19 percent  , for the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . The decrease in net loan charge-offs primarily reflected decreases in Technology and Life Sciences and general Middle Market, partially offset by increases in Energy and Corporate Banking. Net loan charge-offs in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   increased   $61 million   to   $110 million  , or   0.30 percent   of average total loans, compared to   $49 million  , or   0.14 percent  , for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . Excluding Energy, net loan charge-offs in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   totaled   $35 million  , or   0.15 percent   of average total loans. The increase in net loan charge-offs primarily reflected increases in Energy and Private Banking, partially offset by decreases in general Middle Market and Technology and Life Sciences.  
  The provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments is recorded to maintain the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments at the level deemed appropriate by the Corporation to cover probable credit losses inherent in lending-related commitments. The provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments was   $2 million   in the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to a benefit of   $2 million   in the   three months ended September 30, 2015  . The provision for credit losses on lending-related commitments was   $11 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $8 million   for the same period in   2015  . There were   no   lending-related commitment charge-offs for both the   three-month periods

ended September 30, 2016 and 2015  , and charge-offs of   $11 million   and   $1 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The lending-related commitment charge-offs of   $11 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   were the result of sales of Corporate Banking and Energy unfunded commitments. 
  For further information regarding energy and energy-related loans, refer to the "Energy Lending" subheading in the "Risk Management" section of this financial review. An analysis of the allowance for credit losses and nonperforming assets is presented under the "Credit Risk" subheading in the "Risk Management" section of this financial review. 
  Noninterest Income   

           (a) 
    The table below provides further details on certain categories included in other noninterest income. 
       Noninterest income increased   $12 million   to   $272 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   $260 million   for the same period in   2015  , primarily reflecting increases in card fees, due to volume-driven increases from merchant payment processing services and government card programs, and commercial lending fees, largely due to an increase in syndication agent fees. The increase in other noninterest income (refer to the table below) was primarily the result of an increase in deferred compensation asset returns (which offsets an increase in deferred compensation plan expense included in noninterest expenses). 
  Noninterest income increased   $15 million   to   $784 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   $769 million   for the same period in   2015  , primarily due to an increase in card fees, partially offset by decreases in other noninterest income and service charges on deposit accounts. The increase in card fees was largely for the same reasons as described in the quarterly discussion above. The decrease in other noninterest income (refer to table below) primarily reflected decreases in investment banking fees and income from unconsolidated subsidiaries, partially offset by an increase in deferred compensation asset returns. The decrease in income from unconsolidated subsidiaries primarily reflected the termination of a joint venture with a payment processor in the second quarter 2015 and was more than offset by the increase in merchant payment processing services revenue included in card fees. 
  The following table illustrates certain categories included in "other noninterest income" on the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. 

(a) 
    Compensation deferred by the Corporation's officers and directors is invested based on investment selections of the officers and directors. Income earned on these assets is reported in noninterest income and the resulting change in deferred compensation plan liabilities is reported in salaries and benefits expense. Changes in income earned on deferred compensation assets are substantially offset by changes in deferred compensation plan expense.

Noninterest Expenses 

Noninterest expenses increased   $36 million   to   $493 million   for the   three months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   $457 million   for the same period in   2015  . Noninterest expenses increased   $16 million   excluding the third quarter 2016 restructuring charges of   $20 million  . The remaining increase primarily reflected increases in technology-related software expense, FDIC insurance premiums and salaries and benefits expense. The increase in salaries and benefits expense of   $4 million   primarily reflected an increase in deferred compensation plan expense (offset by an increase in deferred compensation asset returns included in noninterest income). 
  Noninterest expenses increased   $124 million   to   $1.5 billion   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   $1.3 billion   for the same period in   2015  . Noninterest expenses increased   $51 million   excluding 2016 restructuring charges of   $73 million  . The remaining increase primarily reflected the benefit to 2015 from a   $32 million   net release of litigation reserves, increases in technology-related software expense, FDIC insurance premiums, and higher outside processing fee expense related to revenue generating activities, partially offset by a $6 million increase in benefit from the sales of leased assets included in other noninterest expenses and a decrease in salaries and benefits expense. The   $5 million   decrease in salaries and benefits expense primarily reflected a decrease in pension expense, partially offset by an increase in regular salaries, mostly due to the impact of merit increases and one more day in 2016, and an increase in deferred compensation plan expense. 
  For further information about restructuring charges associated with the GEAR Up initiative, see Note   13   in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
  Provision for Income Taxes 
  The provision for income taxes was   $64 million   and   $63 million   for the   three-month periods ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, and   $131 million   and   $188 million   for the   nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The provision for income taxes for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   included a benefit of $4 million from the early termination of certain leveraged lease transactions. The provision for income taxes for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   included a benefit of $9 million from the early termination of certain leveraged lease transactions as well as a $4 million charge related to certain tax reserves.  
   
  STRATEGIC LINES OF BUSINESS 
  The Corporation's management accounting system assigns balance sheet and income statement items to each segment using certain methodologies, which are regularly reviewed and refined. These methodologies may be modified as the management accounting system is enhanced and changes occur in the organizational structure and/or product lines. Restructuring charges associated with the GEAR Up initiative were assigned to the segments based on the Corporation's segment reporting methodology, which is described in Note 22 to the consolidated financial statements in the Corporation's 2015 Annual Report. 
  Effective January 1, 2016, in conjunction with the effective date for regulatory Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) requirements, the Corporation prospectively implemented an additional funds transfer pricing (FTP) charge, primarily for the cost of maintaining liquid assets to support potential draws on unfunded loan commitments and for the long-term economic cost of holding collateral for secured deposits.  
  Business Segments 
  The Corporation's operations are strategically aligned into three major business segments: the Business Bank, the Retail Bank and Wealth Management. These business segments are differentiated based upon the products and services provided. In addition to the three major business segments, Finance is also reported as a segment. The Other category includes items not directly associated with these business segments or the Finance segment. The performance of the business segments is not comparable

with the Corporation's consolidated results and is not necessarily comparable with similar information for any other financial institution. Additionally, because of the interrelationships of the various segments, the information presented is not indicative of how the segments would perform if they operated as independent entities. Note   14   to the consolidated financial statements describes the business activities of each business segment and presents financial results of these business segments for the   three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
  The following table presents net income (loss) by business segment.  

(a)    Includes items not directly associated with the three major business segments or the Finance Division. 
  The Business Bank's net income of   $442 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016     decrease  d   $124 million   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . Net interest income of   $1.1 billion   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   decreased   $40 million   compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily reflecting an increase in net funds transfer pricing (FTP) charges, partially offset by an increase in loan yields, the benefit provided by a   $176 million   increase in average loans and one additional day in 2016. The increase in net FTP charges primarily reflected an increase in the cost of funds due to the increase in short-term market rates, lower funding credits due to a   $1.4 billion   decrease in average deposits, and the new 2016 FTP charges for LCR as described above. The provision for credit losses increased   $84 million   to   $200 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase in the provision primarily reflected the increased reserves for energy and energy-related loans. To a lesser extent, general Middle Market and Corporate Banking contributed to the increase in the provision. These increases were partially offset by improvements in credit quality in the remainder of the portfolio. Net credit-related charge-offs of   $113 million   increased   $58 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily reflecting increases in Energy, partially offset by decreases in in general Middle Market and Technology and Life Sciences. Noninterest income for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   was unchanged from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily reflecting decreases of $5 million in investment banking fees, $5 million in income from unconsolidated subsidiaries (largely related to the exit in the second quarter 2015 from a joint venture that provided merchant payment processing services), and small decreases in several other categories of noninterest income, offset by a $15 million increase in card fees. Noninterest expenses for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   increased   $72 million   compared to the same period in the prior year. Excluding restructuring charges of   $36 million   and the impact of a   $30 million   net release of litigation reserves in second quarter 2015, noninterest expenses remained stable, primarily reflecting a $15 million increase in allocated corporate expenses, largely due to increased technology expenses, and higher FDIC insurance expense, partially offset by the benefit from a $6 million increase in gains from the sales of leased assets, lower salaries and benefits expense and smaller decreases in several other categories of noninterest expense.  
  Net income for the Retail Bank of   $10 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   decreased   $38 million  , compared to   $48 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . Net interest income of   $466 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   remained unchanged compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily reflecting higher FTP funding costs due to an increase in short-term lending rates, partially offset by the benefit from a   $105 million   increase in average loans, an increase in loan yields and one additional day in 2016. The FTP benefit provided by a   $692 million   increase in average deposits was more than offset by a lower deposit crediting rate. The provision for credit losses increased   $27 million   to   $13 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to a   $14 million   benefit in the comparable period in the prior year, primarily reflecting an increase in Small Business. Net credit-related charge-offs were   $6 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   compared to   $3 million   in the same period for the prior year. Noninterest income of   $141 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   increased   $5 million   compared to the comparable period in the prior year, primarily due to a $4 million increase in card fees and smaller increases in several other fee categories, partially offset by a $2 million increase in securities losses and a $2 million decrease in service charges on deposit accounts. Noninterest expenses of   $579 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   increased   $37 million   from the comparable period in the prior year. Excluding restructuring charges of   $27 million  , noninterest expense increased   $10 million  , primarily reflecting a $9 million increase in allocated corporate expenses and small increases in several categories of noninterest expenses, partially offset by a $7 million decrease in salaries and benefits expense.  
  Wealth Management's net income of   $53 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   decreased   $10 million  , compared to   $63 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . Net interest income of   $128 million   for the   nine months

ended September 30, 2016   decreased   $5 million   compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily reflecting higher FTP funding costs due to an increase in short-term lending rates, partially offset by the benefit from a   $87 million   increase in average loans and an increase in loan yields. The FTP benefit provided by a   $55 million   increase in average deposits was more than offset by a lower deposit crediting rate. The provision for credit losses was a benefit of   $3 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to a benefit of   $13 million   for the same period in the prior year, primarily due to the benefit to the prior year from net loan recoveries in Private Banking. Net credit-related charge-offs were   $2 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to net loan recoveries of   $8 million   in the same period for the prior year. Noninterest income of   $181 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   increased   $4 million   compared to the comparable period in the prior year, primarily reflecting a $2 million securities loss in the prior year period and smaller increases in several other fee categories. Noninterest expenses of   $229 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   increased   $4 million   from the comparable period in the prior year. Excluding restructuring charges of   $10 million  , noninterest expenses decreased   $6 million  , primarily reflecting a $6 million decrease in salaries and benefits expense as well as smaller increases in several other categories, partially offset by a $4 million increase in allocated corporate expenses. 
  The net loss in the Finance segment was   $191 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to a net loss of   $274 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  . Net interest expense of   $346 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   decreased   $125 million  , compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  , primarily reflecting a decrease in net FTP expense as a result of higher rates charged to the business segments under the Corporation's internal FTP methodology, as well as an increase due to a larger investment securities portfolio. 
  Market Segments 
  Market segment results are provided for the Corporation's three largest geographic markets: Michigan, California and Texas. In addition to the three largest geographic markets, Other Markets is also reported as a market segment. The Finance   Other category includes the Finance segment and the Other category as previously described in the "Business Segments" section of this financial review. Note   14   to these consolidated financial statements presents a description of each of these market segments as well as the financial results for the   three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  .

Net interest income of   $509 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   decreased   $24 million   from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily due to an increase in net FTP funding charges, reflecting higher FTP funding costs and the new FTP charges related to LCR, as well as lower FTP credits reflecting a lower deposit crediting rate and the impact of a   $57 million   decrease in average deposits, as well as the impact of a   $605 million   decrease in average loans, partially offset by an increase in loan yields and one more day in 2016. The provision for credit losses was   $10 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to a benefit of   $15 million   for the comparable period in the prior year. The increase in the provision primarily reflected an increase in Corporate Banking, partially offset by a decrease in general Middle Market. Net credit-related charge-offs were   $6 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to   $10 million   for the comparable period in the prior year, primarily reflecting decreases in general Middle Market and Commercial Real Estate, partially offset by an increase in Corporate Banking. Noninterest income of   $240 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   decreased   $9 million   from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily reflecting a $3 million decrease in service charges on deposit accounts and small decreases in several noninterest income categories, partially offset by a $4 million increase in card fees.

Net interest income of   $360 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   decreased   $30 million   from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily due to an increase in net FTP funding charges, primarily for the same reasons as discussed above and the impact of a   $538 million   decrease in average loans, partially offset by higher loan yields and one additional day in 2016. Average deposits decreased   $812 million  . The provision for credit losses of   $199 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   increased   $125 million   from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily reflecting increased reserves for energy and energy-related loans in the first quarter 2016, partially offset by a decrease in Technology and Life Sciences.

Net interest income of   $265 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   increased   $14 million   from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily due to the FTP benefit provided by a   $615 million   increase in average deposits, the benefit provided by a   $440 million   increase in average loans, an increase in loan yields and one additional day in 2016, partially offset by higher FTP funding costs due to an increase in short-term lending rates and the new FTP charges related to LCR. The provision for credit losses decreased   $13 million   to a benefit of   $7 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to a provision of   $6 million   for the same period in the prior year, primarily reflecting decreases in Corporate Banking, Mortgage Banker Finance, Environmental Services and Commercial Real Estate, partially offset by a increases in Private Banking and Small Business. Net credit-related charge-offs were   $2 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , compared to net charge-offs of   $11 million   for the comparable period in the prior year, primarily reflecting decreases in Corporate Banking and Technology and Life Sciences, partially offset by an increase in Private Banking, primarily due to a benefit to the prior year from net loan recoveries. Noninterest income of   $293 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   increased   $11 million   from the comparable period in the prior year, primarily reflecting a $9 million increase in card fees, a $2 million securities loss in the prior year period, and smaller increases in several other noninterest income categories, partially offset by a decrease in warrant income. Noninterest expenses of   $332 million   for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   increased   $10 million   compared to the same period in the prior year. Excluding restructuring charges of   $10 million  , noninterest expense was unchanged, as an $8 million increase in outside processing expenses tied to revenue generating activities was mostly offset by small decreases in several categories of noninterest expense.  
  The net loss for the Finance   Other category of   $192 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   decreased   $80 million   compared to the   nine months ended September 30, 2015  .

FINANCIAL CONDITION 
  Total assets were   $74.1 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , an increase of   $2.2 billion   from   $71.9 billion   at   December 31, 2015  , primarily reflecting increases of   $1.8 billion   in interest-bearing deposits with banks,   $316 million   in accrued income and other assets, and $  190 million   in total loans. On an average basis, total assets increased   $1.0 billion   to   $72.9 billion   in the   third quarter 2016  , compared to   $71.9 billion   in the   fourth quarter 2015  , resulting primarily from increases of   $1.5 billion   in average investment securities and   $658 million   in average loans, partially offset by a decrease of   $1.3 billion   in average interest-bearing deposits with banks.  
  The following tables provide information about the change in the Corporation's average loan portfolio in the   third quarter 2016  , compared to the   fourth quarter 2015  . 

In general, Middle Market serves customers with annual revenue between $20 million and $500 million, while Corporate serves customers with revenue over $500 million. Changes in average total loans by geographic market are provided in the table above. 
  Investment securities decreased   $16 million   to   $12.5 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , compared to   December 31, 2015  .

On an average basis, investment securities increased   $1.5 billion   in the   third quarter 2016  , compared to the   fourth quarter 2015  , primarily reflecting the purchase of approximately $2.2 billion of U.S. Treasury securities in the fourth quarter 2015, largely from the reinvestment of Federal Reserve Bank deposits into higher yielding securities.  
  Total liabilities increased   $2.1 billion   to   $66.4 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $64.3 billion   at   December 31, 2015  , primarily reflecting an increase of   $2.8 billion   in medium- and long-term debt, partially offset by a decrease of   $592 million   in total deposits. The increase in medium- and long-term debt primarily reflected the addition of $2.8 billion of 10-year, floating rate Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) advances during the second quarter 2016. The decrease in total deposits primarily reflected

decreases of   $1.1 billion   in money market and interest-bearing checking deposits and   $585 million   in customer certificates of deposit partially offset by an increase of   $937 million   in noninterest-bearing deposits. On an average basis, total liabilities   increase  d   $938 million   in the   third quarter 2016  , compared to the   fourth quarter 2015  , primarily due to the second quarter 2016 addition of $2.8 billion of FHLB advances, as discussed above, partially offset by a decrease of   $1.7 billion   in total deposits, comprising a   $2.5 billion   decrease in interest-bearing deposits and an increase of   $827 million   in noninterest-bearing deposits. The   decrease   in average total deposits primarily reflected seasonality, and, to a lesser extent, purposeful pricing discipline and strategic actions in light of new LCR rules, with the largest decreases in Corporate Banking ($1.4 billion), Municipalities ($717 million), and the Financial Services Division ($488 million) partially offset by increases in the remaining general Middle Market businesses ($550 million), Commercial Real Estate ($249 million), and Mortgage Banker Finance ($203 million). The Financial Services Division and Municipalities are included in general Middle Market.

The Corporation periodically conducts stress tests to evaluate potential impacts to the Corporation's forecasted financial condition under various economic scenarios and business conditions. These stress tests are a normal part of the Corporation's overall risk management and capital planning process and are part of the forecasting process used by the Corporation to conduct the enterprise-wide stress test that was part of the Federal Reserve's Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR). For additional information about risk management processes, refer to the "Risk Management" sections of this financial review and the Corporation's 2015 Annual Report. 
  The Federal Reserve completed its 2016 CCAR review in June 2016 and did not object to the Corporation's 2016/2017 capital plan and capital distributions contemplated in the plan for the period ending June 30, 2017. The plan includes equity repurchases of up to $440 million for the four-quarter period commencing in the third quarter 2016 and ending in the second quarter 2017. In the   third quarter 2016  , the Corporation's repurchases under the equity repurchase program totaled   $97 million  . The timing and ultimate amount of future equity repurchases will be subject to various factors, including the Corporation's overall capital position, financial performance and market conditions, including interest rates. Restructuring charges associated with the GEAR Up initiative are not expected to impact the pace of repurchases.  
       
  On April 26, 2016 the Board of Directors of the Corporation (the Board) approved a 1-cent increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.22 per share, and on July 26, 2016, the Board further increased the quarterly dividend to $0.23 per share. Also on July 26, 2016 the Board authorized the repurchase of up to an additional 10.0 million shares of Comerica Incorporated outstanding common stock, in addition to the 5.7 million shares remaining at June 30, 2016 under the Board's prior authorizations for the equity repurchase program initially approved in November 2010. Including the July 26, 2016 authorization, a total of 50.3 million shares and 14.1 million warrants (12.1 million share-equivalents) have been authorized for repurchase under the equity repurchase program since its inception in 2010. There is no expiration date for the Corporation's equity repurchase program.

  RISK MANAGEMENT 
  The following updated information should be read in conjunction with the "Risk Management" section on pages F-24 through F-39 in the Corporation's   2015   Annual Report. 
  Credit Risk 
  Allowance for Credit Losses 
  The allowance for credit losses includes both the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments. The allowance for loan losses represents management's assessment of probable, estimable losses inherent in the Corporation's loan portfolio. The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments, included in "accrued expenses and other liabilities" on the consolidated balance sheets, provides for probable losses inherent in lending-related commitments, including unused commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit.

U.S. economic data for the third quarter of 2016 was consistent with an ongoing moderate expansion, following weaker Gross Domestic Product growth through the first half of the year. Job growth and employment rates continued to improve. Energy price levels remained stable. Looking ahead, the Corporation expects the U.S economy to continue to expand at a moderate pace through the end of 2016 and into 2017.   
  The allowance for loan losses was   $727 million   at   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $634 million   at   December 31, 2015  , an increase of   $93 million  , or   15 percent  . The increase in the allowance for loan losses resulted primarily from a significant increase in reserves for energy and energy-related loans, partially offset by improved credit quality in the remainder of the portfolio. The increase in reserves for energy and energy-related loans reflected additional negative migration into criticized loans, primarily in the first quarter 2016, due to the deteriorating financial condition and increasing leverage of these borrowers, as well as an increased loss estimate in the event of default.  
  The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments includes specific allowances, based on individual evaluations of certain letters of credit in a manner consistent with business loans, and allowances based on the pool of the remaining letters of credit and all unused commitments to extend credit within each internal risk rating. The allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments was   $45 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 
  For additional information regarding the allowance for credit losses, refer to page F-40 in the "Critical Accounting Policies" section and pages F-56 through F-58 in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements of the Corporation's   2015   Annual Report. For additional information regarding energy and energy-related exposures, refer to "Energy Lending" subheading later in this section. 
  Nonperforming Assets 
  Nonperforming assets include loans on nonaccrual status, troubled debt restructured loans (TDRs) which have been renegotiated to less than the original contractual rates (reduced-rate loans) and foreclosed property. TDRs include performing and nonperforming loans. Nonperforming TDRs are either on nonaccrual or reduced-rate status.  
  The following table presents a summary of nonperforming assets and past due loans. 

Nonperforming assets increased   $269 million   to   $660 million   at   September 30, 2016  , from   $391 million   at   December 31, 2015  . The increase in nonperforming assets primarily reflected an increase of   $274 million   in nonaccrual energy and energy-related loans. Nonperforming assets as a percentage of total loans and foreclosed property was   1.34 percent   at   September 30, 2016  , compared to   0.80 percent   at   December 31, 2015  .

Loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing interest were   $48 million   at   September 30, 2016   compared to   $17 million   at   December 31, 2015  . Loans past due 30-89 days   increased     $32 million   to   $161 million   at   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $129 million   at   December 31, 2015  . An aging analysis of loans included in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements provides further information about the balances comprising past due loans. 
  The following table presents a summary of total criticized loans. The Corporation's criticized list is consistent with the Special Mention, Substandard and Doubtful categories defined by regulatory authorities.

Commercial Real Estate Lending 
  The following table summarizes the Corporation's commercial real estate loan portfolio by loan category. 

(a) 
    Primarily loans to real estate developers. 
              (b) 
    Primarily loans secured by owner-occupied real estate. 
     The Corporation limits risk inherent in its commercial real estate lending activities by limiting exposure to those borrowers directly involved in the commercial real estate markets and adhering to conservative policies on loan-to-value ratios for such loans. Commercial real estate loans, consisting of real estate construction and commercial mortgage loans, totaled   $11.8 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , of which   $4.6 billion  , or   39 percent  , were to borrowers in the Commercial Real Estate business line, which includes loans to real estate developers, an increase of   $782 million   compared to   December 31, 2015  . The growth in Commercial Real Estate primarily reflected construction draws and term financing, mainly with existing customers who are proven developers, on projects with favorable risk characteristics (predominantly multifamily projects located in California and Texas). The remaining   $7.2 billion  , or   61 percent  , of commercial real estate loans in other business lines consisted primarily of owner-occupied commercial mortgages, which bear credit characteristics similar to non-commercial real estate business loans. In the Texas market, commercial real estate loans totaled $3.1 billion at   September 30, 2016  , of which $1.7 billion were to borrowers in the Commercial Real Estate business line. Substantially all of the remaining $1.4 billion were owner-occupied commercial mortgages. Loans in the Commercial Real Estate business line secured by properties located in Texas totaled $1.4 billion at   September 30, 2016  , primarily including $899 million for multifamily properties and $225 million for retail properties. No loans in the Commercial Real Estate business line that were secured by properties located in Texas were on nonaccrual status at   September 30, 2016  . 
  The real estate construction loan portfolio primarily contains loans made to long-tenured customers with satisfactory completion experience. Credit quality in the real estate construction loan portfolio remained strong, with   no   loans on nonaccrual status at   September 30, 2016   compared to   $1 million   at   December 31, 2015  , and no real estate construction loan charge-offs in either of the   nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
  Loans in the commercial mortgage portfolio generally mature within three to five years. Of the   $2.2 billion   and   $2.1 billion   of commercial mortgage loans in the Commercial Real Estate business line outstanding at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively,   $8 million   and   $16 million   were on nonaccrual status at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. Commercial mortgage loan net recoveries in the Commercial Real Estate business line were $10 million and $3 million for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. In other business lines,   $36 million   and   $44 million   of commercial mortgage loans were on nonaccrual status at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively.  Commercial mortgage loan net recoveries in other business lines were $5 million and $3 million for the   nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016   and 2015, respectively. 
  Residential Real Estate Lending 
  The following table summarizes the Corporation's residential mortgage and home equity loan portfolios by geographic market. 

Residential real estate loans, which consist of residential mortgages and home equity loans and lines of credit, totaled   $3.7 billion   at   September 30, 2016  . Residential mortgages totaled   $1.9 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , and were primarily larger,

     Table of Contents  

variable-rate mortgages originated and retained for certain private banking relationship customers. Of the   $1.9 billion   of residential mortgage loans outstanding,   $23 million   were on nonaccrual status at   September 30, 2016  . The home equity portfolio totaled   $1.8 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , of which   $1.7 billion   was outstanding under primarily variable-rate, interest-only home equity lines of credit,   $132 million   were on amortizing status and   $44 million   were closed-end home equity loans. Of the   $1.8 billion   of home equity loans outstanding,   $27 million   were on nonaccrual status at   September 30, 2016  . A majority of the home equity portfolio was secured by junior liens at   September 30, 2016  . The residential real estate portfolio is principally located within the Corporation's primary geographic markets. Substantially all residential real estate loans past due 90 days or more are placed on nonaccrual status, and substantially all junior lien home equity loans that are current or less than 90 days past due are placed on nonaccrual status if full collection of the senior position is in doubt. At no later than 180 days past due, such loans are charged off to current appraised values less costs to sell. 
  Energy Lending 
  The Corporation has a portfolio of energy and energy-related loans that are included primarily in "commercial loans" in the consolidated balance sheets. The Corporation has over 30 years of experience in energy lending, with a focus on middle market companies in the oil and gas business. Customers in the Corporation's Energy business line (approximately 200 relationships) are engaged in three segments of the oil and gas business: exploration and production (E P) (  72 percent  ), midstream (  14 percent  ) and energy services (  14 percent  ). E P generally includes such activities as searching for potential oil and gas fields, drilling exploratory wells and operating active wells. Commitments to E P borrowers are subject to semi-annual borrowing base re-determinations based on a variety of factors including updated pricing (reflecting market and competitive conditions), energy reserve levels and the impact of hedging. The midstream sector is generally involved in the transportation, storage and marketing of crude and/or refined oil and gas products. The Corporation's energy services customers provide products and services primarily to the E P segment. About 95 percent of the loans in the Energy business line are Shared National Credits (SNC), which are facilities greater than $20 million shared by three or more federally supervised institutions, reflecting the Corporation's focus on larger middle market companies that have financing needs that generally exceed internal individual borrower credit risk limits. The Corporation seeks to develop full relationships with SNC borrowers.  
  In addition to oil and gas loans in the Energy business line, the Corporation is monitoring a portfolio of loans in other lines of business to companies that have a sizable portion of their revenue related to oil and gas or could be otherwise disproportionately negatively impacted by prolonged lower oil and gas prices ("energy-related"), primarily in general Middle Market, Corporate Banking, Small Business, and Technology and Life Sciences. These companies include downstream businesses such as refineries and petrochemical companies, companies that sell products to E P, midstream and energy services companies, companies involved in developing new technologies for the oil and gas industry, and other similar businesses. 
  The following table summarizes information about the Corporation's portfolio of energy and energy-related loans. 

Loans in the Energy business line were   $2.5 billion  , or approximately   5 percent   of total loans, at   September 30, 2016   and   $3.1 billion  , or approximately   6 percent   of total loans, at   December 31, 2015  , a decrease of   $613 million  , or   20 percent  . Total exposure, including unused commitments to extend credit and letters of credit, was $5.0 billion and $6.1 billion at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. The decrease in total exposure in the Energy business line primarily reflected reduced borrowing bases as a result of the spring re-determinations for E P borrowers, resulting in about a 22 percent average reduction in total commitment for the portion reviewed, while the decrease in outstandings largely reflected energy customers taking actions to adjust their cash flow and reduce their bank debt. Energy-related outstandings were approximately   $420 million   at   September 30, 2016   (approximately 90 relationships), a decrease of   $204 million  , or   33 percent  , compared to   December 31, 2015  . 
  Criticized energy and energy-related loans increased   $259 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  . The increase in criticized loans largely reflected additional negative migration due to the deteriorating financial condition and increasing leverage of these borrowers. Energy and energy-related loans on nonaccrual status increased   $274 million   in the   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , to   $435 million   at   September 30, 2016  . These metrics reflect results of the SNC exam issued in early October 2016. Energy and energy-related net credit-related charge-offs totaled $13 million and $91 million for the   three- and nine- 
  
   55 

     Table of Contents  

month periods ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, compared to net charge-offs of $9 million and $13 million for the same periods in   2015  . Net credit-related charge-offs of $91 million for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   included $20 million from E P, $9 million from midstream, $51 million from energy services and $11 million from the energy-related portfolio. Substantially all of the net charge-offs during the same period 2015 were from the energy-related portfolio. 
  The Corporation's allowance methodology carefully considers the various risk elements within the loan portfolio. At   September 30, 2016  , the reserve allocation for energy and energy-related loans exceeded 8 percent of total energy and energy-related loans. The reserve allocation for energy and energy-related loans appropriately incorporated the changing dynamics in energy and energy-related loans described above, including, but not limited to, migration in the portfolio and the value of collateral considered in determining estimated loss given default. The Corporation continued to incorporate a qualitative reserve component for energy and energy-related loans at   September 30, 2016  . Refer to the  Allowance for Credit Losses  subheading earlier in this section for a discussion of changes in the allowance for loan losses as a result of the above-described events. 
  Automotive Lending 
  Substantially all dealer loans are in the National Dealer Services business line. Loans in the National Dealer Services business line include floor plan financing and other loans to automotive dealerships. Floor plan loans, included in  commercial loans  in the consolidated balance sheets, totaled   $3.8 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , a decrease of   $124 million   compared to   $3.9 billion   at   December 31, 2015  . At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , other loans to automotive dealers in the National Dealer Services business line totaled   $2.5 billion   and   $2.6 billion  , respectively, including   $1.6 billion   and   $1.7 billion   of owner-occupied commercial real estate mortgage loans at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , respectively. Automotive lending also includes loans to borrowers involved with automotive production, primarily Tier 1 and Tier 2 suppliers. Loans to borrowers involved with automotive production totaled approximately   $1.3 billion   at both   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 
  International Exposure 
  International assets are subject to general risks inherent in the conduct of business in foreign countries, including economic uncertainties and each foreign government's regulations. Risk management practices minimize the risk inherent in international lending arrangements. These practices include structuring bilateral agreements or participating in bank facilities, which secure repayment from sources external to the borrower's country. Accordingly, such international outstandings are excluded from the cross-border risk of that country. 
  The Corporation's international strategy is to focus on international companies doing business in North America, with an emphasis on the Corporation's primary geographic markets.  
  The following table summarizes cross-border exposure to entities domiciled in European countries at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 

(a) 
    Primarily United Kingdom and the Netherlands. The Corporation had no exposure to Greece, Portugal or Ireland at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 
     For further discussion of credit risk, see the "Credit Risk" section of pages F-24 through F-33 in the Corporation's 2015 Annual Report. 
  Market and Liquidity Risk 
  Market risk represents the risk of loss due to adverse movements in market rates or prices, including interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and commodity and equity prices. Liquidity risk represents the failure to meet financial obligations coming due resulting from an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding, and the inability to easily unwind or offset specific exposures without significant changes in pricing, due to inadequate market depth or market disruptions. 
  The Asset and Liability Policy Committee (ALCO) of the Corporation establishes and monitors compliance with the policies and risk limits pertaining to market and liquidity risk management activities. ALCO meets regularly to discuss and review market and liquidity risk management strategies, and consists of executive and senior management from various areas of the Corporation, including treasury, finance, economics, lending, deposit gathering and risk management. The Treasury Department

mitigates market and liquidity risk under the direction of ALCO through the actions it takes to manage the Corporation's market, liquidity and capital positions. 
  Market Risk Analytics, within the Office of Enterprise Risk, supports ALCO in measuring, monitoring and managing interest rate risk and coordinating all other market risks. Key activities encompass: (i) providing information and analysis of the Corporation's balance sheet structure and measurement of interest rate and all other market risks; (ii) monitoring and reporting of the Corporation's positions relative to established policy limits and guidelines; (iii) developing and presenting analyses and strategies to adjust risk positions; (iv) reviewing and presenting policies and authorizations for approval; (v) monitoring of industry trends and analytical tools to be used in the management of interest rate and all other market risks; and (vi) developing and monitoring the interest rate risk economic capital estimate. 
  Interest Rate Risk 
  Net interest income is the primary source of revenue for the Corporation. Interest rate risk arises in the normal course of business due to differences in the repricing and cash flow characteristics of assets and liabilities, primarily through the Corporation's core business activities of extending loans and acquiring deposits. The Corporation's balance sheet is predominantly characterized by floating-rate loans funded by a combination of core deposits and wholesale borrowings. Approximately   90 percent   of the Corporation's loans were floating at   September 30, 2016  , of which approximately   80 percent   were based on LIBOR and   20 percent   were based on Prime. This creates sensitivity to interest rate movements due to the imbalance between the floating-rate loan portfolio and the more slowly repricing deposit products. In addition, growth and/or contraction in the Corporation's loans and deposits may lead to changes in sensitivity to interest rate movements in the absence of mitigating actions. Examples of such actions are purchasing investment securities, primarily fixed-rate, which provide liquidity to the balance sheet and act to mitigate the inherent interest sensitivity, and hedging the sensitivity with interest rate swaps. The Corporation actively manages its exposure to interest rate risk, with the principal objective of optimizing net interest income and the economic value of equity while operating within acceptable limits established for interest rate risk and maintaining adequate levels of funding and liquidity. 
  Since no single measurement system satisfies all management objectives, a combination of techniques is used to manage interest rate risk. These techniques examine the impact of interest rate risk on net interest income and the economic value of equity under a variety of alternative scenarios, including changes in the level, slope and shape of the yield curve, utilizing multiple simulation analyses. Simulation analyses produce only estimates of net interest income, as the assumptions used are inherently uncertain. Actual results may differ from simulated results due to many factors, including, but not limited to, the timing, magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates, market conditions, regulatory impacts and management strategies. 
  Sensitivity of Net Interest Income to Changes in Interest Rates 
  The analysis of the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income under various interest rate scenarios is management's principal risk management technique. Management models a base case net interest income under an unchanged interest rate environment and what is believed to be the most likely balance sheet structure. Existing derivative instruments entered into for risk management purposes are included in the analysis, but no additional hedging is currently forecasted. These derivative instruments currently comprise interest rate swaps that convert fixed-rate long-term debt to variable rates. This base case net interest income is then compared against interest rate scenarios in which rates rise or decline in a linear, non-parallel fashion from the base case over 12 months. In the scenarios presented, short-term interest rates increase 200 basis points, resulting in an average increase in short-term interest rates of 100 basis points over the period (+200 scenario). Due to the current low level of interest rates, the analysis reflects a declining interest rate scenario of a 50 basis point drop in short-term interest rates, to zero percent. 
  Each scenario includes assumptions such as loan growth, investment security prepayment levels, depositor behavior, yield curve changes, loan and deposit pricing, and overall balance sheet mix and growth. In the +200 scenario, assumptions related to loan growth are based on historical experience. Because deposit balances have continued to grow significantly in this persistent low rate environment, historical depositor behavior may be less indicative of future trends. As a result, the +200 scenario reflects a greater decrease in deposits than we have experienced historically as rates begin to rise. Investment securities modeling includes the replacement of prepayments and expected funding maturities. In addition, the model reflects deposit pricing based on historical price movements with short-term interest rates, and loan spreads are held at current levels. Changes in actual economic activity may result in a materially different interest rate environment as well as a balance sheet structure that is different from the changes management included in its simulation analysis.

The table below, as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , displays the estimated impact on net interest income during the next 12 months by relating the base case scenario results to those from the rising and declining rate scenarios described above. 

Sensitivity decreased slightly from   December 31, 2015   to   September 30, 2016   primarily due to changes in loan and deposit balances from a revised forecast. The risk to declining interest rates is limited by an assumed floor on interest rates of zero percent. 
  Sensitivity of Economic Value of Equity to Changes in Interest Rates 
  In addition to the simulation analysis on net interest income, an economic value of equity analysis provides an alternative view of the interest rate risk position. The economic value of equity is the difference between the estimate of the economic value of the Corporation's financial assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet instruments, derived through discounting cash flows based on actual rates at the end of the period and the estimated economic value after applying the estimated impact of rate movements. The economic value of equity analysis is based on an immediate parallel 200 basis point increase and 50 basis point decrease in interest rates. 
  The table below, as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , displays the estimated impact on the economic value of equity from the interest rate scenario described above. 

The change in the sensitivity of the economic value of equity to a 200 basis point parallel increase in rates between   December 31, 2015   and   September 30, 2016   was primarily driven by changes in market interest rates at the middle to long end of the curve, which most significantly impact mortgage-backed security prepayments and the value of deposits without a stated maturity. Additionally, changes in actual deposit mix over the period impacted the results modestly. 
  Wholesale Funding 
  The Corporation may access the purchased funds market when necessary, which includes foreign office time deposits and short-term borrowings. Capacity for incremental purchased funds at   September 30, 2016   included short-term FHLB advances, the ability to purchase federal funds, sell securities under agreements to repurchase, as well as issue deposits to institutional investors and issue certificates of deposit through brokers. Purchased funds totaled   $42 million   at   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $55 million   at   December 31, 2015  . At   September 30, 2016  , the Bank had pledged loans totaling   $23.3 billion   which provided for up to   $18.7 billion   of available collateralized borrowing with the FRB. 
  The Bank is a member of the FHLB of Dallas, Texas, which provides short- and long-term funding to its members through advances collateralized by real estate-related assets. Actual borrowing capacity is contingent on the amount of collateral available to be pledged to the FHLB. At   September 30, 2016  ,   $15.3 billion   of real estate-related loans were pledged to the FHLB as blanket collateral for current and potential future borrowings. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Corporation had   $2.8 billion   of outstanding borrowings from the FHLB maturing in 2026, and capacity for potential future borrowings of approximately   $3.8 billion  .  
  In the second quarter 2016, the Bank borrowed   $2.8 billion   of 10-year, floating-rate FHLB advances due   2026  . The interest rate on each of   eight   notes resets every four weeks, based on the FHLB auction rate, with the reset date of each note scheduled at one-week intervals. Each note may be prepaid in full, without penalty, at each scheduled reset date. Proceeds were used for general corporate purposes, including to provide cost-effective funding for upcoming debt maturities. 
  Additionally, as of   September 30, 2016   the Bank had the ability to issue up to   $14 billion   of debt under an existing $15 billion note program which allows the issuance of debt with maturities between three months and 30 years.The Corporation also maintains a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission from which it may issue debt and/or equity securities.

The Corporation satisfies liquidity requirements with either liquid assets or various funding sources. Liquid assets totaled   $19.1 billion   at   September 30, 2016  , compared to   $16.4 billion   at   December 31, 2015  . Liquid assets include cash and due from banks, federal funds sold, interest-bearing deposits with banks, other short-term investments and unencumbered investment securities.  
  In September 2014, U.S. banking regulators issued a final rule implementing a quantitative liquidity requirement in the U.S. generally consistent with the LCR minimum liquidity measure established under the Basel III liquidity framework. Under the rule, the Corporation is subject to a modified LCR standard, which requires a financial institution to hold a minimum level of high-quality liquid assets to fully cover modified net cash outflows under a 30-day systematic liquidity stress scenario. The rule was effective for the Corporation on January 1, 2016. During the transition year, 2016, the Corporation is required to maintain a minimum LCR of 90 percent. Beginning January 1, 2017, and thereafter, the minimum required LCR will be 100 percent. At   September 30, 2016  , the Corporation was in compliance with the fully phased-in LCR requirement, plus a buffer. 
  In the second quarter 2016, U.S. banking regulators issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (the proposed rule) implementing a second quantitative liquidity requirement in the U.S. generally consistent with the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) minimum liquidity measure established under the Basel III liquidity framework. Under the proposed rule, the Corporation will be subject to a modified NSFR standard effective January 1, 2018, which requires a financial institution to hold a minimum level of available longer-term, stable sources of funding to fully cover a modified amount of required longer-term stable funding, over a one-year period. The Corporation does not currently expect the proposed rule to have a material impact on its liquidity needs. 
  The Corporation regularly evaluates its ability to meet funding needs in unanticipated, stressed environments. In conjunction with the quarterly 200 basis point interest rate simulation analyses, discussed in the  Interest Rate Sensitivity  section of this financial review, liquidity ratios and potential funding availability are examined. Each quarter, the Corporation also evaluates its ability to meet liquidity needs under a series of broad events, distinguished in terms of duration and severity. The evaluation as of   September 30, 2016   projected that sufficient sources of liquidity were available under each series of events.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES 
  The Corporation s consolidated financial statements are prepared based on the application of accounting policies, the most significant of which are described in Note   1   to the consolidated financial statements included in the Corporation's 2015 Annual Report. These policies require numerous estimates and strategic or economic assumptions, which may prove inaccurate or subject to variations. Changes in underlying factors, assumptions or estimates could have a material impact on the Corporation s future financial condition and results of operations. At December 31, 2015, the most critical of these significant accounting policies were the policies related to the allowance for credit losses, fair value measurement, goodwill, pension plan accounting and income taxes. These policies were reviewed with the Audit Committee of the Corporation s Board of Directors and are discussed more fully on pages F-40 through F-43 in the Corporation's 2015 Annual Report. As of the date of this report, there have been no significant changes to the Corporation's critical accounting policies or estimates, except as discussed below. 
  Goodwill 
  Goodwill is initially recorded as the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination and is subsequently evaluated at least annually for impairment. Goodwill impairment testing is performed at the reporting unit level, equivalent to a business segment or one level below. The Corporation has three reporting units:  the Business Bank, the Retail Bank and Wealth Management. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, goodwill totaled $635 million, including $380 million allocated to the Business Bank, $194 million allocated to the Retail Bank and $61 million allocated to Wealth Management.   
  The Corporation performs its annual evaluation of goodwill impairment in the third quarter of each year and on an interim basis if events or changes in circumstances between annual tests suggest additional testing may be warranted to determine if goodwill might be impaired. The quantitative goodwill impairment test is a two-step test. The first step compares the estimated fair value of identified reporting units with their carrying amount, including goodwill. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, the second step must be performed to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill and the amount of goodwill impairment, if any. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined as if the reporting unit were being acquired in a business combination. If the implied fair value of goodwill exceeds the goodwill assigned to the reporting unit, there is no impairment. If the goodwill assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess.  
  In performing the annual impairment test, the carrying value of each reporting unit is the greater of economic or regulatory capital. The Corporation assigns economic capital using internal management methodologies on the basis of each reporting unit's credit, operational and interest rate risks, as well as goodwill. To determine regulatory capital, each reporting unit is assigned sufficient capital such that its respective Tier 1 ratio, based on allocated risk-weighted assets, is the same as that of the Corporation. Using this two-pronged approach, the Corporation's equity is fully allocated to its reporting units except for capital held primarily for the risk associated with the securities portfolio, which is assigned to the Finance segment of the Corporation.  
  Determining the fair value of reporting units is a subjective process involving the use of estimates and judgments related to the selection of inputs such as future cash flows, discount rates, comparable public company multiples, applicable control premiums and economic expectations used in determining the interest rate environment. The estimated fair values of the reporting units are determined using a blend of two commonly used valuation techniques: the market approach and the income approach. For the market approach, valuations of reporting units consider a combination of earnings, equity and other multiples from companies with characteristics similar to the reporting unit. Since the fair values determined under the market approach are representative of noncontrolling interests, the valuations accordingly incorporate a control premium. For the income approach, estimated future cash flows and terminal value are discounted. Estimated future cash flows are derived from internal forecasts and economic expectations for each reporting unit which incorporate uncertainty factors inherent to long-term projections. The applicable discount rate is based on the imputed cost of equity capital appropriate for each reporting unit, which incorporates the risk-free rate of return, the level of non-diversified risk associated with companies with characteristics similar to the reporting unit, a size risk premium and a market equity risk premium. 
  The annual test of goodwill impairment was performed as of the beginning of the third quarter 2016. The Corporation's assumptions included modest increases to the Federal funds target rate until eventually reaching a normal interest rate environment, as well as credit costs, reflective of the impact of energy prices, and the impact of the Corporation s GEAR Up initiative. At the conclusion of the first step of the annual goodwill impairment tests performed in the third quarter 2016, the estimated fair values of the Business Bank and Wealth Management substantially exceeded their carrying amounts, including goodwill. The fair value of the Retail Bank exceeded the carrying value by 12 percent and 22 percent as of the 2016 and 2015 annual test of goodwill impairment, respectively.  The decline in the excess value for the Retail Bank was due to the combination of an increase in the amount of regulatory capital allocated to the reporting unit due to higher risk weighted assets and depressed market multiples at the time of the valuation. The results of the annual test of the goodwill impairment test for each reporting unit were subjected to stress testing as appropriate.

Economic conditions impact the assumptions related to interest and growth rates, loss rates and imputed cost of equity capital. The fair value estimates for each reporting unit incorporated current economic and market conditions, including the recent Federal Reserve announcements and the impact of legislative and regulatory changes, to the extent known and as described above. However, further weakening in the economic environment, such as adverse changes in interest rates, a decline in the performance of the reporting units or other factors could cause the fair value of one or more of the reporting units to fall below their carrying value, resulting in a goodwill impairment charge. Additionally, new legislative or regulatory changes not anticipated in management's expectations may cause the fair value of one or more of the reporting units to fall below the carrying value, resulting in a goodwill impairment charge. Any impairment charge would not affect the Corporation's regulatory capital ratios, tangible common equity ratio or liquidity position. 

SUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL DATA 
  The following table provides a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures used in this financial review with financial measures defined by GAAP. 

The tangible common equity ratio removes preferred stock and the effect of intangible assets from capital and the effect of intangible assets from total assets. Tangible common equity per share of common stock removes the effect of intangible assets from common shareholders' equity per share of common stock. The Corporation believes these measurements are meaningful measures of capital adequacy used by investors, regulators, management and others to evaluate the adequacy of common equity and to compare against other companies in the industry.
