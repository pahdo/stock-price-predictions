  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
  (unaudited) 

Note 1.  Basis of Presentation and New Accounting Pronouncements 
    
  Heartland Express, Inc., (the  Company,   we,   us,  or  our ) is a holding company incorporated in Nevada, which owns all of the stock of Heartland Express Inc. of Iowa, Heartland Express Services, Inc., Heartland Express Maintenance Services, Inc., and A   M Express, Inc. Gordon Trucking, Inc. ("GTI") was merged into Heartland Express Inc. of Iowa effective July 1, 2016.  We, and our subsidiaries, operate as one segment.  We, together with our subsidiaries, are a short-to-medium haul truckload carrier (predominately 500 miles or less per load) with corporate headquarters in North Liberty, Iowa.  We primarily provide nationwide asset-based dry van truckload service for major shippers from Washington to Florida and New England to California. 
    
  The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the parent company, Heartland Express, Inc., and its subsidiaries, all of which are wholly owned.  All material intercompany items and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.  The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Regulation S-X.  Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and notes to the financial statements required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements.  In the opinion of management, all normal, recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. The consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes for the year ended   December 31, 2015   included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K of the Company filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 29, 2016.  Interim results of operations are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year or any other interim periods.  There were no changes to the Company's significant accounting policies during the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2016  , except as noted below in regards to the balance sheet classification of deferred taxes. 
    
  In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Boards (FASB) issued ASU 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments,  which addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice. The provisions of this update are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. Based on our initial assessment, we believe the impact of adoption of the standard will not have a material impact on our consolidated cash flows. 
    
  In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, "Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments".  This update requires measurement and recognition of expected versus incurred credit losses for financial assets held. ASU 2016-13 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods therein. Based on our initial assessment, we believe the impact of adoption of the standard will not have a material impact on our financial statements. 
    
  In March, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, "Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting".  This update seeks to simplify several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows. This update becomes effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2017 with early adoption permitted. Based on our initial assessment, we believe the impact of adoption of the standard will not have a material impact on our financial statements. 
  In February, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, "Leases". This update seeks to increase the transparency and comparability among entities by requiring public entities to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclose key information about leasing arrangements. To satisfy the standard s objective, a lessee will recognize a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term and a lease liability for the obligation to make lease payments. Both the right-of-use asset and lease liability will initially be measured at the present value of the lease payments, with subsequent measurement dependent on the classification of the lease as either a finance or an operating lease. For leases with a term of 12 months or less, a lessee is permitted to make an accounting policy election by class of underlying asset not to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities. If a lessee makes this election, it should recognize lease expense for such leases generally on a straight-line basis over the lease term.  
  In transition, lessees are required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach. The modified retrospective approach includes a number of optional practical expedients that companies  
  
   7 

may elect to apply. These practical expedients relate to the identification and classification of leases that commenced before the effective date, initial direct costs for leases that commenced before the effective date, and the ability to use hindsight in evaluating lessee options to extend or terminate a lease or to purchase the underlying asset. The transition guidance also provides specific guidance for sale and leaseback transactions, build-to-suit leases, leveraged leases, and amounts previously recognized in accordance with the business combinations guidance for leases. The new standard is effective for public companies for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted. Based on our initial assessment, we believe the impact of adoption of the standard will not have a material impact on our financial statements. 
  In November, 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2015-17, "Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes". The ASU simplifies the current guidance, which requires entities to separately present deferred tax assets and liabilities as current and non-current in a classified balance sheet.  The ASU will be effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those years (with early adoption allowed). The Company adopted this guidance prospectively and classified deferred tax asset and deferred tax liability amounts, by tax jurisdiction, as non-currrent within our balance sheet beginning March 31, 2016 and for future periods.  Prior periods presented have not been adjusted. 
  In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers(Topic 606), which will replace numerous requirements in U.S. GAAP, including industry-specific requirements, and provide companies with a single revenue recognition model for recognizing revenue from contracts with customers. The core principle of the new standard is that a company should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The two permitted transition methods under the new standard are the full retrospective method, in which case the standard would be applied to each prior reporting period presented and the cumulative effect of applying the standard would be recognized at the earliest period shown, or the modified retrospective method, in which case the cumulative effect of applying the standard would be recognized at the date of initial application. In July 2015, the FASB approved the deferral of the new standard's effective date by one year. The new standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. The FASB will permit companies to adopt the new standard early, but not before the original effective date of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. We have been closely monitoring FASB activity related to the new standard and are evaluating the effect that the new guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. We have not yet selected a transition method nor have we determined the final effect of the standard on our ongoing financial reporting however, based on our initial assessment, we believe the impact of adoption of the standard will not have a material impact on our operating revenue or operating income. 

Note 2.  Use of Estimates 
    
  The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates. There were no significant changes in estimates and assumptions used by management related to our critical accounting policies during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , except for a change in the assumptions related to the likelihood of future payouts which reduced the potential earn-out liability recorded related to an acquisition. 

Note 3.  Segment Information 
    
  We provide multiple transportation services across the United States (U.S.) and parts of Canada. We offer primarily asset-based transportation services in the dry van truckload market and also offer truckload temperature-controlled transportation services and non-asset based brokerage services.  None of our transportation services or geographical-based regional terminals individually meet the definition of a segment.  Our Chief Operating Decision Maker oversees and manages all of our transportation services and regional terminals, on a combined basis, including the legacy transportation services of acquired entities.  As a result of the foregoing, we have determined that we have   one   segment, consistent with the authoritative accounting guidance on disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information.  

Note 4.  Cash and Cash Equivalents 
    
  Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments with insignificant interest rate risk and original maturities of three months or less at acquisition.  At   September 30, 2016  , restricted and designated cash and investments totaled   $12.2 million  , of which   $0.8 million   was included in other current assets and   $11.4 million   was included in other non-current assets in the consolidated balance sheet.  Restricted and designated cash and investments totaled   $11.4 million   at   December 31, 2015  , all of which was included in other non-current assets in the consolidated balance sheet.  The restricted funds represent deposits required by state  
  
   8 

agencies for self-insurance purposes and designated funds that are earmarked for a specific purpose and not for general business use. 

Note 5.  Prepaid Tires, Property, Equipment, and Depreciation 
    
  Property and equipment are reported at cost, net of accumulated depreciation.  Maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred.  New tires are capitalized separately from revenue equipment and are reported separately as  Prepaid tires  in the consolidated balance sheets and amortized over   two years  .  Depreciation expense of   $0.0 million   and   $0.3 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   and   $0.0 million   and   $0.8 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, have been included in communication and utilities in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.  Depreciation for financial statement purposes is computed by the straight-line method for all assets other than tractors.  We recognize depreciation expense on tractors using the 125% declining balance method.  New tractors are depreciated to salvage values of   $15,000   while new trailers are depreciated to salvage values of   $4,000  . 

Note 6.  Other Intangibles, Net and Goodwill 
    
  All intangible assets determined to have finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives. The useful life of an intangible asset is the period over which the asset is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to future cash flows.  There was   no   change in the gross amount of identifiable intangible assets during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  Amortization expense of   $0.5 million  ,   $1.4 million  ,   $0.6 million  , and   $1.8 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, was included in depreciation and amortization in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.  Intangible assets subject to amortization consisted of the following at   September 30, 2016  :   

Carrying amounts of goodwill were as follows: 

Note 7.  Earnings per Share 
    
  Basic earnings per share is based upon the weighted average common shares outstanding during each year.  Diluted earnings per share is based on the basic weighted earnings per share with additional weighted common shares for common stock equivalents.    During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , we had outstanding restricted shares of common stock to certain of our employees under the Company's 2011 Restricted Stock Award Plan (the "Plan").  A reconciliation of the numerator (net income) and denominator (weighted average number of shares outstanding of the basic and diluted earnings per share ("EPS")) for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015   is as follows (in thousands, except per share data): 

9 

Note 8.  Equity 
    
  In September 2001, our Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase   15.4 million   shares, adjusted for stock splits, of our common stock in open market or negotiated transactions using available cash, cash equivalents and investments which was subsequently amended in February 2012.  Approximately   3.3 million   shares remain authorized for repurchase under the program as of   September 30, 2016  .  There were   no   shares repurchased during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  . There were   0.9 million   shares repurchased in the open market during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  .  There were   1.8 million   shares repurchased in the open market during the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  The authorization remains open at   September 30, 2016   and has no expiration date.  The share repurchase authorization is discretionary and may be suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice.   
    
  During the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , our Board of Directors declared regular quarterly dividends totaling   $1.7 million  ,   $5.0 million  , and   $1.7 million  ,   $5.2 million   respectively.  Future payment of cash dividends and the amount of such dividends will depend upon our financial conditions, our results of operations, our cash requirements, our tax treatment, and certain corporate law requirements, as well as factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors.

Note 9.  Stock-Based Compensation 
    
  In July 2011, a Special Meeting of Stockholders of Heartland Express, Inc. was held, at which meeting the approval of the Plan was ratified.  The Plan is administered by the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors.  Per the terms of the awards, employees receiving awards will have all of the rights of a stockholder with respect to the unvested restricted shares including, but not limited to, the right to receive such cash dividends, if any, as may be declared on such shares from time to time and the right to vote such shares at any meeting of our stockholders.  
    
  The Plan made available up to   0.9 million   shares for the purpose of making restricted stock grants to our eligible officers and employees.  During December 2011,   0.4 million   shares were initially granted to employees and no additional shares were granted during 2012.  All shares initially granted in 2011 have vested.  Additional shares granted in 2013 through 2016 have various vesting terms that range from immediate to four years from the date of grant. Once vested, there are no other restrictions on the awards.  Compensation expense associated with these awards is based on the market value of our stock on the grant date.  Our market closing price ranged between   $13.86   and   $18.18   on the various grant dates for the shares issued in 2013.  The Company's market close price ranged between   $21.72   and   $27.47   on the various grant dates during   2014  , ranged between   $19.93   and   $27.29   on the various grant dates during   2015  , and ranged between   $17.06   and   $18.78   on the various grant dates during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  .  There were no significant assumptions made in determining the fair value.  Compensation expense associated with restricted stock awards is included in salaries, wages and benefits in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.  Compensation expense associated with restricted stock awards was   $0.1 million   and   $1.2 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  Compensation expense associated with restricted stock awards was   $0.4 million   and   $1.0 million   for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  As of   September 30, 2016     0.4 million   shares remain available to be granted under the Plan.  Unrecognized compensation expense was   $0.6 million   at   September 30, 2016   which will be recognized over a remaining weighted average period of   1.3   years.   
    
  The following tables summarize our restricted stock award activity for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  .      

11 

Note 10.  Long-Term Debt 
    
  In November 2013, we entered into a credit agreement (the  Credit Agreement ) by and among Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, (the  Bank ), Heartland Express, Inc. of Iowa as the borrower (the  Borrower ), us, and the other members of our consolidated group, as Guarantors.   Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, the Bank provided a five-year,   $250.0 million   unsecured revolving line of credit.  The line of credit is available for working capital, equipment financing, and general corporate purposes.  The Bank's commitment decreased to   $200.0 million   on November 1, 2015 and decreased to   $175.0 million   from November 1, 2016 through October 31, 2018. 
    
  The Credit Agreement is unsecured, with a negative pledge against all assets of our consolidated group, except for debt associated with permitted acquisitions, new purchase-money debt and capital lease obligations as described in the Credit Agreement.  The Credit Agreement matures on October 31, 2018.  The Borrower has the ability to terminate the commitment at any time at no additional cost to the Borrower.  Borrowings under the Credit Agreement can either be, at Borrower's election, (i) one-month or three-month LIBOR (Index) plus   0.625%  , floating, or (ii) Prime (Index) plus   0.0%  , floating.  There is a commitment fee on the unused portion of the Revolver at   0.0625%  , due monthly. 
    
  The Credit Agreement contains customary financial covenants including, but not limited to, (i) a maximum adjusted leverage ratio of   2  :1, measured quarterly on a trailing twelve month basis, (ii) a minimum net income requirement of   $1.00  , measured quarterly on a trailing twelve month basis, (iii) a minimum tangible net worth of   $200 million   requirement, measured quarterly, and (iv) limitations on other indebtedness and liens.  The Credit Agreement also includes customary events of default, conditions, representations and warranties, and indemnification provisions.  We were in compliance with the respective financial covenants at   September 30, 2016  . 

Note 11.  Income Taxes 
    
  We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled.  Such amounts are adjusted, as appropriate, to reflect changes in tax rates expected to be in effect when temporary differences reverse.  The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred taxes is recognized in the period that the change is enacted.  A valuation allowance is recorded  
  
   12 

to reduce the Company's deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.  We had   no   recorded valuation allowance at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 
    
  Our effective tax rate was   37.5%   and   39.4%   for the three months ended and   33.4%  , and   37.0%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  The decrease in the effective tax rate for   2016   is primarily attributable to the favorable impact of the reversal of previously recorded accruals for penalties and interest related to uncertain tax positions where the applicable statute of limitations have now lapsed.  
    
  We recognize the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained.  Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than   50%   likely of being realized. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs.  We record interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. 
    
  At   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , we had a total of   $9.6 million   and   $11.6 million   in gross unrecognized tax benefits, respectively.  Of this amount,   $6.0 million   and   $7.3 million   represents the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact our effective tax rate as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .  Unrecognized tax benefits were a net increase of   $0.1 million   and   $0.2 million   during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  Unrecognized tax benefits were a net decrease of   $2.0 million   and   $1.4 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  The net increases during the three month periods of 2016 and 2015 was mainly due to unrecognized tax benefits resulting from current year tax positions. The net decreases during the nine month periods of 2016 and 2015 were due mainly to the expiration of certain statutes of limitation net of additions with respective states.  This had the effect of decreasing the effective state tax rate during these respective periods.  The total net amount of accrued interest and penalties for such unrecognized tax benefits was   $3.1 million   and   $4.7 million   at   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   and is included in income taxes payable in the consolidated balance sheets.  Income tax expense is increased each period for the accrual of interest on outstanding positions and penalties when the uncertain tax position is initially recorded.  Income tax expense is reduced in periods by the amount of accrued interest and penalties associated with reversed uncertain tax positions due to lapse of applicable statute of limitations, when applicable or when a position is settled.  Net interest and penalties included in income tax expense for the three month period ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was a net expense of approximately   $0.1 million   and   $0.1 million  , respectively.  Net interest and penalties included in income tax expense for the   nine   month period ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   was a benefit of approximately   $1.6 million   and   $1.1 million  , respectively.  Income tax expense increased during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   due to additions for interest and penalty accruals.  Income tax expense was reduced during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   due to reversals of interest and penalties due to lapse of applicable statute of limitations and settlements, net of additions for interest and penalty accruals during the same period.  These unrecognized tax benefits relate to risks associated with state income tax filing positions for our corporate subsidiaries. 
    
  A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows: 

A number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited and ultimately settled.  It is difficult to predict the ultimate outcome or the timing of resolution for uncertain tax positions. It is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits could significantly increase or decrease within the next twelve months. These changes could result from the expiration of the statute of limitations, examinations or other unforeseen circumstances.  We do not have any outstanding litigation related to tax matters.  At this time, management s best estimate of the reasonably possible change in the amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits to be a decrease of approximately   $1.2 million   to a decrease of   $2.2 million   during the next twelve months mainly due to the expiration of certain statute of limitations, net of additions.  The federal statute of limitations remains open for the years 2013 and forward.  Tax years 2005 and forward are subject to audit by state tax authorities depending on the tax code and administrative practice of each state.

Note 12.  Operating Leases 
    
  During 2016, we leased certain revenue equipment of which the majority of these leases were with a commercial tractor dealership, whose owners include a board member.  During 2015, a portion of our operating leases were with the noted commercial tractor dealership.  Rent expense for these leases were   $0.0 million   and   $0.8 million   (including related-party rental payments totaling   $0.0 million   and   $0.8 million  ), for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively.  Rent expense for these leases were   $0.8 million   and   $2.8 million   (including related-party rental payments totaling   $0.8 million  , and   $2.7 million  ), for the   three and nine   months ended   2015  , respectively.  These expenses were included in rent and purchased transportation in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.   The various leases were terminated in June 2016. 
    
  We lease certain terminal facilities under operating leases.  A portion of these leases are with limited liability companies, whose members include a board member and a commercial tractor dealership whose owners include a board member.  Rent expenses for terminal facilities were   $0.5 million   and   $1.6 million   (including related-party rental payments totaling   $0.5 million   and   $1.4 million  ), for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , respectively.  Rent expenses for terminal facilities were   $0.9 million   and   $3.0 million   (including related-party rental payments totaling   $0.8 million   and   $2.8 million  ), for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively.  These expenses were included in rent and purchased transportation in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.  The various leases expire from 2017 through 2018 and contain purchase options and options to renew, except the Pacific, Washington location.  We have renewal options and a right of first refusal on the sale of the Pacific, Washington location property.  We are responsible for all taxes, insurance, and utilities related to the terminal leases. See Note 13 for additional information regarding related party transactions.

  Overview 
    
  We are a short-to-medium haul truckload carrier of general commodities with corporate headquarters in North Liberty, Iowa.  We provide nationwide transportation services to major shippers spanning from Washington to Florida and New England to California as well as parts of Canada.  We offer primarily asset-based transportation services in the dry van truckload market and also offer temperature-controlled transportation services and non asset-based freight brokerage services although such temperature-controlled and non asset-based services are not material sources of revenue.  We provide these transportation services using predominately company-owned revenue equipment.  We also obtain additional capacity through the use of independent contractor tractors, although this source of capacity is not significant to our overall operations.  We generally earn revenue based on the number of miles per load delivered.  We believe the keys to success are maintaining high levels of customer service and safety.  Management believes achieving high levels of customer service and safety is predicated on the availability of late-model equipment and experienced drivers.  Management believes that our service standards, safety record, and equipment availability have made us a core carrier for many of our major customers. 
    
  We achieve operating efficiencies and cost controls through equipment utilization, which is optimized by a common information system platform, a fleet of late model equipment, industry-leading driver to non-driver employee ratio, and effective management of fixed and variable operating costs.  The demand for freight services was strong in 2014 as demand for freight services generally outpaced industry capacity in 2014 and into early 2015.  The demand for freight services generally slowed in the later months of 2015 has continued throughout 2016.  Industry capacity continues to be hindered by an insufficient quantity of qualified drivers, which is further challenged by various regulations that reduce drivers' utilization and availability.  Further, industry conformity to the electronic logging device (ELD) requirement in December 2017 has the potential to further reduce overall industry capacity and driver availability.  We cannot predict how future regulations will impact driver utilization.  An industry shortage of qualified drivers, in conjunction with reduced driver utilization, creates a favorable rate environment, although the rate environment during 2016 has been intense due to industry capacity outpacing general demand for freight services.  We cannot currently predict how long this volatility will continue or its future impact.  
    
  Competition for drivers, which has historically been intense, has recently escalated due to the decreasing numbers of qualified drivers in the industry, and we have experienced increased difficulties attracting and retaining qualified drivers.  We continue to  
  
   16 

explore new strategies to attract and retain qualified drivers.  We hire the majority of our drivers with at least six to nine months of over-the-road experience and safe driving records.  In order to attract and retain experienced drivers who understand the importance of customer service, we have sought to solidify our position as an industry leader in driver compensation in our operating markets.  We implemented increases to our driver pay package, in late 2014 and early 2015, raising driver compensation, on average, by approximately 13%.  Our driver pay package includes future pay increases based on years of continued service to us and increased rates for accident-free miles of operation.  We believe our current compensation package supports our leadership position in terms of driver pay within the industry and rewards our drivers for years of service with safe operating mileage benchmarks, which are critical to our operational and financial performance. 
    
  Containment of fuel cost continues to be one of management's top priorities as fuel expenses, at   14.5%   of operating revenues at   September 30, 2016  , is our highest cost after salaries, wages and benefits to our drivers and other employees and depreciation and amortization.  The average price so far in   2016   has been   $2.27   with the latest Department of Energy ("DOE") price increasing to   $2.48   compared to an average DOE price of   $2.79   during the nine months ended   September 30, 2015  .  Although the average price per gallon in 2016 is the lowest it has been since 2009, we currently cannot predict what fuel prices will be throughout the remainder of 2016.  We are not able to pass through all fuel price increases through fuel surcharge agreements with customers due to tractor idling time, along with empty and out-of-route miles.  Therefore, our operating income is negatively impacted with increased net fuel costs (fuel expense less fuel surcharge revenue) in a rising fuel environment and is positively impacted in a declining fuel environment.  We continue to manage and implement fuel initiative strategies that we believe will effectively manage fuel costs.  These initiatives include strategic fueling of our trucks, whether it be terminal fuel or over-the-road fuel, reducing tractor idle time, controlling out-of-route miles, controlling empty miles, utilizing on-board power units to minimize idling, educating drivers to save energy, trailer skirting, and increasing fuel economy through the purchase of newer, more fuel efficient tractors.  At   September 30, 2016  , 99% of our over-the-road sleeper berth tractor fleet was equipped with idle management controls.  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company s tractor fleet had an average age of   1.6   years and the Company's trailer fleet had an average age of   4.7   years.  
    
  We continue to focus on growing organically by providing quality service to targeted customers with a high density of freight in our regional operating areas.  In addition to the development of our regional operating areas, we have made six acquisitions since 1987.  Future growth depends upon several factors including the level of economic growth and the related customer demand, the available capacity in the trucking industry, our ability to identify and consummate future acquisitions, our ability to integrate operations of acquired companies to realize efficiencies, and our ability to attract and retain experienced drivers that meet our hiring standards. 
    
  We ended the first   nine   months of   2016   with operating revenues of   $472.9 million  , including fuel surcharges, net income of   $43.3 million  , and basic net income per share of   $0.52   on basic weighted average outstanding shares of   83.3 million   compared to operating revenues of   $561.7 million  , including fuel surcharges, net income of   $56.0 million  , and basic net income per share of   $0.64   on basic weighted average shares of   87.7 million   in the first   nine   months of   2015  .  We posted an   86.3%   operating ratio (operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenues) for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   84.2%   for the same period of   2015   and a   9.2%   net margin (net income as a percentage of operating revenues) for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   10.0%   in the same period of   2015  .  We posted an   84.9%   non-GAAP adjusted operating ratio   (1)    (operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenues, net of fuel surcharge) for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   81.8%   for the same period of   2015  .  We had total assets of   $741.7 million   at   September 30, 2016  .  We achieved a return on assets of   8.2%   and a return on equity of   12.6%   over the immediate past four quarters ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   10.0%   and   15.7%  , respectively, for the immediate past four quarters ended   September 30, 2015  .   
    
  Our cash flow from operating activities for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   of   $120.2 million   was   25.4%   of operating revenues, compared to   $142.9 million   and   25.4%   in the same period of   2015  .  During   2016  , we used   $33.5 million   in net investing cash flows, which was the result of net cash used for revenue equipment purchases.  We used   $19.7 million   in financing activities directly related to repurchases of our common stock and payment of dividends.   As a result, our cash and cash equivalents increased   $67.0 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  .  We ended the   third   quarter of   2016   with cash and cash equivalents of   $100.3 million  .

(a) Adjusted operating ratio as reported in this Form 10-Q is based upon total operating expenses, net of fuel surcharge revenue, as a percentage of operating revenue excluding fuel surcharge revenue.  We feel that this measure is more representative of our underlying operations by excluding the volatility of fuel prices which we cannot control.

Results of Operations 
    
  The following table sets forth the percentage relationships of expense items to total operating revenue for the periods indicated: 

Three Months Ended   September 30, 2016   Compared With the Three Months Ended   September 30, 2015    
    
  Operating revenue   decreased     $33.2 million   (  18.2%  ), to   $149.3 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   from   $182.5 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2015  .  The   decrease   in revenue was the result of a   $6.6 million   (  30.1%  )   decrease   in fuel surcharge revenue from   $21.8 million   in   2015   to   $15.2 million   in   2016   and a   decrease   in trucking and other revenues of   $26.6 million   (  16.6%  ).  Operating revenues (the total of trucking and fuel surcharge revenue) are primarily earned based on loaded miles driven in providing truckload transportation services.  The number of loaded miles is affected by general freight supply and demand trends and the number of revenue earning equipment vehicles (tractors).  The number of revenue earning equipment vehicles (tractors) is directly affected by the number of available company drivers and independent contractors providing capacity to us.  Our operating revenues are reviewed regularly on a combined basis across the United States due to the similar nature of our service offerings and related similar base pricing structure.  The net trucking revenue decrease was the result of a decrease in loaded miles due to a decrease in drivers and slowing freight demand in the 2016 period compared to the 2015 period, slightly offset by an increase in the rate per loaded mile compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015  .  
    
  Fuel surcharge revenues represent fuel costs passed on to customers based on customer specific fuel surcharge recovery rates and billed loaded miles.  Fuel surcharge revenues decreased primarily as a result of a   9.5%     decrease   in the average Department of Energy ("DOE") diesel fuel prices during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   September 30, 2015  , as reported by the DOE, along with a decrease in loaded miles. 
    
  Salaries, wages, and benefits   decreased     $10.6 million   (  15.4%  ), to   $58.4 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   from   $69.0 million   in the   2015   period.  Salaries, wages and benefits decreased period over period due to decreases in driver and non-driver wages and lower health insurance and workers compensation costs as compared to the same period in 2015.  Reduction in expense period over period is due mainly to less miles driven and lower overall non-driving headcount.  
    
  Rent and purchased transportation   decreased     $2.7 million   (  33.4%  ), to   $5.5 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   from   $8.2 million   in the comparable period of   2015  .  The decrease was attributable to amounts paid for operating leases of terminal  
  
   19 

locations and revenue equipment (decreased $1.5 million), amounts paid to independent contractors (decreased $1.0 million), and amounts paid to third party carriers on brokered loads (decreased $0.3 million).  The decrease in amounts paid were due to a reduction in leased revenue equipment units, a decrease in miles driven by independent contractors, and a decrease in loads brokered with third party carriers during the   2016   period as compared to   2015  .  During the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , independent contractors accounted for 2.3% of the total fleet miles compared to approximately 3.0% for the same period of   2015  .   
    
  Fuel   decreased     $6.4 million   (  21.9%  ), to   $23.0 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   from   $29.4 million   for the same period of   2015  .  The decrease was primarily the result of a (  9.5%  ) decrease in the average diesel price per gallon as reported by the DOE and lower miles driven.  Fuel cost per mile, net of fuel surcharge revenues,   increased     16.5%   in the   2016   period compared to the same period of   2015  , due mainly to fuel surcharge revenues declining at an increased rate (30.1%), as compared to the decline in overall fuel cost.  
    
  Depreciation   decreased     $1.1 million   (  4.0%  ), to   $27.3 million   during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   from   $28.4 million   in the same period of   2015  .  The decrease is mainly attributable to a decrease in the number of units being depreciated, partially offset by higher average depreciation expense per revenue equipment unit.  Tractor depreciation decreased $0.8 million, on a 5.9% decrease in the number of tractor units depreciated, partially offset by 2.0% higher depreciation recognized per unit during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the   2015   period.  Compared to the same period in   2015  , trailer and other depreciation decreased $0.5 million on an 9.1% decrease in the number of trailer units depreciated during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , partially offset by 4.4% higher depreciation recognized per unit.  
    
  Operating and maintenance expense   decreased     $2.8 million   (  30.6%  ), to   $6.4 million   during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   from   $9.2 million   in the same period of   2015  .  The decrease is mainly due to a decrease in the number of revenue equipment units in the fleet, a decrease in miles driven, and the age of our fleet of revenue equipment.  
    
  Operating taxes and licenses expense   decreased     $0.6 million   (  13.5%  ), to   $3.9 million   during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   from   $4.5 million   in   2015  , due to a decrease in the number of revenue equipment units (tractors and trailers) being licensed and reduced fuel taxes due to less miles driven.  Insurance and claims expense   decreased     $2.8 million   (  38.5%  ), to   $4.5 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   from   $7.4 million   in   2015  , due to decreased severity and frequency of claims.  Other operating expenses decreased   $6.4 million   (  88.6%  ), to   $0.8 million  , during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   from   $7.2 million   in   2015  , as a result of a reduction in the potential earn-out liability due to the 2016 operating environment and the likelihood of future payments ($4.0 million), and a reduction in other variable operating costs related to a decrease in loaded miles driven ($2.4 million). 
    
  Gains on the disposal of property and equipment   decreased     $5.9 million   (  80.1%  ), to   $1.5 million   during the three months ended   September 30, 2016   from   $7.4 million   in the same period of   2015  .  The decrease resulted from a decrease in gains on sales of trailer equipment of $5.5 million and a decrease in gains on sale of tractor and other equipment of $0.4 million.  The decrease in gains on trailer and tractor sales was mainly due to selling fewer units and lower trailer gains per unit sold due to age of equipment sold.  The decrease in gains on trailer sales was due to a 60% decrease in the number of units sold along with a gain per unit decrease of 97%.  The decrease in gains on tractor sales was due to the net effect of a 66% decrease in the number of units sold partially offset by a 106% increase in gain per unit.  We currently anticipate tractor and trailer equipment sale activity during 2016 to generate total estimated gains of approximately $8.0 to $9.0 million.   
    
  Our effective tax rate declined to   37.5%   from   39.4%   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  The decrease in the effective tax rate for   2016   is primarily attributable to the favorable impact of the reversal of previously recorded accruals for penalties and interest related to uncertain tax positions where the applicable statute of limitations have now lapsed.  
    
  As a result of the foregoing, our operating ratio (operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue) was   86.7%   during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   86.4%   during the three months ended   September 30, 2015  .  Our non-GAAP adjusted operating ratio   (1)    (operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenues, net of fuel surcharge) was   85.1%   during the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   84.5%   during the three months ended   September 30, 2015  .  Net income   decreased     $2.6 million   (  17.1%  ), to   $12.5 million   for the three months ended   September 30, 2016  , from   $15.1 million   during the same period in   2015   as a result of the net effects discussed above. 
  
   20 

Nine Months Ended   September 30, 2016   Compared With the Nine Months Ended   September 30, 2015 
    
  Operating revenue   decreased     $88.8 million   (  15.8%  ), to   $472.9 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   from   $561.7 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  .  The   decrease   in revenue was the result of a   $29.9 million   (  40.7%  ) decrease in fuel surcharge revenue from   $73.6 million   in   2015   to   $43.7 million   in   2016   and a decrease in trucking and other revenues of   $58.9 million   (  12.1%  ). Operating revenues (the total of trucking and fuel surcharge revenue) are primarily earned based on loaded miles driven in providing truckload transportation services.  The number of loaded miles is affected by general freight supply and demand trends and the number of revenue earning equipment vehicles (tractors).  The number of revenue earning equipment vehicles (tractors) is directly affected by the number of available company drivers and independent contractors providing capacity to us.  Our operating revenues are reviewed regularly on a combined basis across the United States due to the similar nature of our service offerings and related similar base pricing structure.  The net trucking revenue decrease was the result of a decrease in loaded miles due to a decrease in drivers and slowing freight demand in the 2016 period compared to the 2015 period, partially offset by an increase in the rate per loaded mile compared to the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Fuel surcharge revenues represent fuel costs passed on to customers based on customer specific fuel surcharge recovery rates and billed loaded miles.  Fuel surcharge revenues decreased primarily as a result of a   19.2%     decrease   in the average Department of Energy ("DOE") diesel fuel prices during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to   September 30, 2015  , as reported by the DOE, along with decreased loaded miles during the same period. 
     
  Salaries, wages, and benefits   decreased     $25.6 million   (  12.1%  ), to   $185.3 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   from   $210.9 million   in the   2015   period.  Salaries, wages and benefits decreased period over period due mainly to decreases in driver and non-driver wages and lower health insurance and workers compensation costs as compared to the same period in 2015.  Reduction in expense period over period is due mainly to less miles driven and lower overall non-driving headcount.  
    
  Rent and purchased transportation   decreased     $8.4 million   (  31.5%  ), to   $18.4 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   from   $26.8 million   in the comparable period of   2015  .  The decrease was attributable to amounts paid to third party carriers on brokered loads (decreased $1.3 million), amounts paid for operating leases of terminal locations and revenue equipment (decreased $3.5 million), and amounts paid to independent contractors (decreased $3.6 million).  The decrease in amounts paid were due to a decrease in loads brokered with third party carriers, a decrease in miles driven by independent contractors, and a reduction in leased revenue equipment units during the   2016   period as compared to   2015  .  During the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , independent contractors accounted for 2.4% of the total fleet miles compared to 3.2% during the comparable period of   2015  .   
    
  Fuel   decreased     $29.3 million   (  29.9%  ), to   $68.6 million   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   from   $97.9 million   for the same period of   2015  .  The decrease was primarily the result of a   19.2%   decrease in the average diesel price per gallon as reported by the DOE and lower miles driven.  Fuel cost, net of fuel surcharge revenues,   decreased     3.3%   in the   2016   period compared to the same period of   2015  , due mainly to fuel surcharge revenues declining at an increased rate (40.7%), as compared to the decline in overall fuel cost.  
    
  Depreciation and amortization   decreased     $2.5 million   (  3.0%  ), to   $78.8 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   from   $81.3 million   in the same period of   2015  .  The decrease is mainly attributable to a decrease in the number of units being depreciated, partially offset by higher average depreciation expense per revenue equipment unit.  Tractor depreciation decreased $1.4 million, on a 7.8% decrease in the number of tractor units depreciated, partially offset by 5.7% higher depreciation recognized per unit during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the   2015   period.  Compared to the same period in   2015  , trailer and other depreciation decreased $1.4 million on a 13.8% decrease in the number of trailer units depreciated during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , partially offset by 10.0% higher depreciation recognized per unit.  
    
  Operating and maintenance expense   decreased     $5.7 million   (  22.3%  ), to   $20.0 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   from   $25.7 million   in the same period of   2015  .  The decrease is mainly due to a decrease in the number of revenue equipment units in the fleet, a decrease in miles driven, and the age of our fleet of revenue equipment.  
    
  Operating taxes and licenses expense decreased   $2.0 million   (  14.4%  ), to   $11.7 million   during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   from   $13.7 million   in   2015  , due to a decrease in the number of revenue equipment units (tractors and trailers) being licensed and reduced fuel taxes due to less miles driven.  Insurance and claims expense was consistent during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  Other operating expenses decreased   $10.0 million   (  46.2%  ), to   $11.7 million  , during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   from   $21.7 million   in   2015  , as a result of a reduction in the potential earn-out liability due to the 2016 operating environment and the likelihood of future payments offset by employment related liabilities ($5.5 million), and a reduction in other variable operating costs due to a decrease in miles driven as well as administrative cost reductions ($4.5 million). 
  
   21 

Gains on the disposal of property and equipment   decreased     $20.0 million   (  73.3%  ), to   $7.3 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   from   $27.3 million   in the same period of   2015  .  The decrease resulted from a decrease in gains on sales of trailer equipment of $17.6 million, a decrease in gains on sale of other property of $1.3 million, and a decrease in gains on tractor equipment sales of $1.1 million.  The decrease in gains on trailer sales was the net effect of selling 73% less trailers during   2016  , at 80% lower gains per unit.  The decrease in gains on tractor sales was due to a 54% decrease in the number of units sold offset partially by a gain per unit increase of 83%.  We currently anticipate tractor and trailer equipment sale activity during 2016 to generate total estimated gains of approximately $8.0 to $9.0 million.   
    
  The Company s effective tax rate was   33.4%   and   37.0%   for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively.  The   decrease   in the effective tax rate for   2016   is primarily attributable to the favorable impact of the reversal of previously recorded accruals for penalties and interest related to uncertain tax positions where the applicable statute of limitations have now lapsed.  
    
  As a result of the foregoing, our operating ratio (operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue) was   86.3%   during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   84.2%   during the nine months ended   September 30, 2015  .  Our non-GAAP adjusted operating ratio   (1)    (operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenues, net of fuel surcharge) was   84.9%   during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to   81.8%   during the nine months ended   September 30, 2015  .  Net income   decreased     $12.8 million   (  22.8%  ), to   $43.3 million   for the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , from   $56.0 million   during the same period in   2015   as a result of the net effects discussed above. 
    
  Liquidity and Capital Resources 
    
  The growth of our business requires significant investments in new revenue equipment.  Historically, we have been debt-free, funding revenue equipment purchases with cash flow provided by operating activities and sales of equipment.  Our primary source of liquidity has been cash flow provided by operating activities.  Our primary source of liquidity during   2016   remains cash flow generated from operating activities, although we maintain our line of credit to provide assistance with additional cash requirements to fund capital expenditures.  During the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , we were able to fund revenue equipment purchases with cash flows provided by operating activities and sales of equipment. We currently have no outstanding borrowings on our line of credit.   
    
  On November 11, 2013, we entered into a Credit Agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, (the  Bank ).  Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, the Bank provided a five-year,   $250.0 million   unsecured revolving line of credit which may be used for working capital, equipment financing, and general corporate purposes.  The Bank's commitment decreased to   $200.0 million   on November 1, 2015, and decreased to   $175.0 million   for the period November 1, 2016 through October 31, 2018. 
    
  The Credit Agreement is unsecured, with a negative pledge against all assets of our consolidated group, except for debt associated with permitted acquisitions, new purchase-money debt and capital lease obligations as described in the Credit Agreement.  The  Credit Agreement matures on October 31, 2018, subject to the ability of Heartland Express, Inc. of Iowa (the  Borrower ) to terminate the commitment at any time at no additional cost to the Borrower.  Borrowings under the Credit Agreement can either be, at the Borrower's election, (i) one-month or three-month LIBOR (Index) plus 0.625%, floating, or (ii) Prime (Index) plus 0%, floating.  There is a commitment fee on the unused portion of the line of credit under the Credit Agreement at 0.0625%, due monthly. 
    
  The Credit Agreement contains customary financial covenants including, but not limited to, (i) a maximum adjusted leverage ratio of   2:1  , measured quarterly, (ii) required minimum net income of   $1.00  , measured quarterly, (iii) required minimum tangible net worth of   $200 million  , measured quarterly, and (iv) limitations on other indebtedness and liens.  The Credit Agreement also includes customary events of default, conditions, representations and warranties, and indemnification provisions.  We were in compliance with the respective financial covenants at   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  Operating cash flow during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $120.2 million   compared to   $142.9 million   during the same period of   2015  .  This was primarily a result of net income (excluding non-cash depreciation and amortization, changes in deferred taxes, and gains on disposal of equipment) being approximately   $2.6 million   lower during   2016   compared to   2015   offset by an increase in cash flow generated by operating assets and liabilities of approximately   $25.3 million  .  The net decrease in cash provided by operating assets and liabilities for   2016   compared to the same period of   2015   was primarily attributable to the timing of income tax payments and the associated net income tax payable position comparing the two periods.  Cash flow from operating activities was   25.4%   of operating revenues for the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared with   25.4%   for the same period of   2015  . 

22 

Cash flows used by investing activities was   $33.5 million   during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to cash flows used in investing activities of   $33.6 million   during the comparative   2015   period or an increase in cash of   $0.1 million  . The slight decrease in cash used for investing activities was primarily the net result of a decrease in proceeds from sale of property and equipment, net of trades, with an increase in equipment purchases,   $10.1 million  , change in other assets of   $1.5 million  , offset by the change in designated funds for equipment purchases of   $11.7 million  .  We currently estimate a total of approximately $30 to $35 million in net capital expenditures for the calendar year 2016.  
    
  Cash used in financing activities decreased   $42.8 million   during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the same period of   2015   due mainly to   $16.2 million   less cash used for repurchases of common stock and   $24.6 million   less cash used for repayments of borrowings on the Credit Agreement during   2015  .  There were no borrowings on the Credit Agreement during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  . 
    
  In 2001, our Board of Directors authorized a program to repurchase   15.4 million   shares, adjusted for stock splits, of our common stock in open market or negotiated transactions using available cash, cash equivalents and investments which was subsequently amended in February 2012.  Upon completing prior authorizations, the Board approved new authorizations of   $4.8 million   shares in November, 2015.  Approximately   3.3 million   shares remained authorized for repurchase under the program as of   September 30, 2016   and the program has no expiration date. There were   0.9 million   shares repurchased in the open market during the nine months ended   September 30, 2016   and   1.8 million   shares were repurchased during the nine months ended   September 30, 2015  .  Shares repurchased were accounted for as treasury stock.  The specific timing and amount of repurchases will be determined by market conditions, cash flow requirements, securities law limitations, and other factors.  Repurchases are expected to continue from time to time, as conditions permit, until the number of shares authorized to be repurchased have been bought, or until the authorization to repurchase is terminated, whichever occurs first.  The share repurchase authorization is discretionary and has no expiration date.  The repurchase program may be suspended, modified, or discontinued at any time without prior notice. 
    
  We paid income taxes, net of refunds, of   $29.8 million   and   $24.6 million   in the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  .  The increase was mainly attributable to the amount of current tax receivable at the end of 2014 which lowered estimated payments in 2015. Management believes we have adequate liquidity to meet our current and projected needs in the foreseeable future.  Management believes we will continue to have significant capital requirements over the long-term, which we expect to fund with cash flows provided by operating activities, proceeds from the sale of used equipment and available capacity on the Credit Agreement.  At   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   $100.3 million   in cash and cash equivalents and   $194.5 million   available borrowing capacity on the Credit Agreement.   
    
  Off-Balance Sheet Transactions 
    
  Our liquidity or financial condition is not materially affected by off-balance sheet transactions.  We are a party to certain operating leases to finance a portion of our revenue equipment requirements and terminal facilities.  Operating lease expense during the   nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   was   $2.5 million  .   
    
  Risk Factors 
    
  You should refer to Item 1A of our Annual Report (Form 10-K) for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , under the caption  Risk Factors  for specific details on the following factors that are not within the control of the Company and could affect our financial results. 
             
    Our business is subject to general economic and business factors affecting the trucking industry that are largely out of our control, any of which could have a materially adverse effect on our operating results. 
                
    Our growth may not continue at historical rates, if at all, and any decrease in revenues or profits may impair our ability to implement our business strategy, which could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations. 
                
    We are highly dependent on a few major customers, the loss of one or more of which could have a materially adverse effect on our business. 
                
    Indebtedness under our Credit Agreement could have adverse consequences on our future operations.   
                
    We have significant ongoing capital requirements that could affect our profitability if we are unable to generate sufficient cash from operations and obtain financing on favorable terms.  
                
    Increased prices, reduced productivity, and restricted availability of new revenue equipment and decreased demand and value of used equipment may adversely affect our earnings and cash flows. 
                
    If diesel fuel prices increase significantly, our results of operations could be adversely affected. 
                
    Difficulty in attracting and retaining drivers, including independent contractors, may have a materially adverse effect on our business. 
                
    If our independent contractors are deemed by regulators or judicial process to be employees, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. 
     
   23 

We operate in a highly regulated industry, and increased costs of compliance with, or liability for violation of, existing or future regulations could have a materially adverse effect on our business.  
                
    Safety-related evaluations and rankings under Compliance, Safety, Accountability (CSA) could adversely affect our profitability and operations, our ability to maintain or grow our fleet, and our customer relationships. 
                
    Our operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations, the violations of which could result in substantial fines or penalties. 
                
    We are exposed to risks related to our acquisition of Gordon Trucking, Inc. ("GTI") and we may not be able to achieve the benefits we expected at the time of the acquisition.  Any failure to implement our business strategy with respect to the GTI acquisition could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
                
    We may not make acquisitions in the future, or if we do, we may not be successful in integrating the acquired company, either of which could have a materially adverse effect on our business. 
                
    If we are unable to retain our key employees or find, develop, and retain terminal managers, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. 
                
    Seasonality and the impact of weather affect our operations profitability. 
                
    We self-insure for a significant portion of our claims exposure, which could significantly increase the volatility of, and decrease the amount of, our earnings. 
                
    We are dependent on computer and communications systems, and a systems failure could cause a significant disruption to our business. 
                
    Concentrated ownership of our stock can influence shareholder decisions, may discourage a change in control, and may have an adverse effect on the share price of our stock.   
                
    Efforts by labor unions could divert management's attention and could have a materially adverse effect on our operating results. 

ITEM 3. 
    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK 
       
  General 
    
  We are exposed to market risk changes in interest rates on our long-term debt and from changes in commodity prices, primarily fuel and rubber.  We do not currently use derivative financial instruments for risk management purposes, although we have used instruments in the past for fuel price risk management, and do not use them for either speculation or trading.  Because the majority of our operations are confined to the United States, we are not subject to a material foreign currency risk. 
    
  Interest Rate Risk 
    
  We had   no   debt outstanding at   September 30, 2016   although we had   $194.5 million   in available borrowings on our Credit Agreement.  Borrowings under the Credit Agreement can either be, at our election, (i) one-month or three-month LIBOR (Index) plus 0.625%, floating, or (ii) Prime (Index) plus 0.0%, floating.  The current borrowing rate available on the Credit Agreement was   1.152%  .  Increases in interest rates could impact our interest expense on future borrowings.  
    
  Commodity Price Risk 
    
  We are subject to commodity price risk primarily with respect to purchases of fuel and rubber. We have fuel surcharge agreements with most customers that enable us to pass through most long-term price increases therefore limiting our exposure to commodity price risk.  Fuel surcharges that can be collected do not always fully offset an increase in the cost of fuel as we are not able to pass through fuel costs associated with out-of-route miles, empty miles, and tractor idle time.  Based on our actual fuel purchases for 2015, assuming miles driven, fuel surcharges as a percentage of revenue, percentage of unproductive miles, and miles per gallon remained consistent with 2015 amounts, a $1.00 increase in the average price of fuel, year over year, would decrease our income before income taxes by approximately $7.8 million.  We use a significant amount of tires to maintain our revenue equipment.  We are not able to pass through 100% of price increases from tire suppliers due to the severity and timing of increases and current rate environment.  Historically, we have sought to minimize tire price increases through bulk tire purchases from our suppliers.  Based on our expected tire purchases for   2016  , a 10% increase in the price of tires would increase our tire purchase expense by $1.4 million, resulting in a corresponding decrease in income before income taxes.   

ITEM 4. 
    CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES 
       
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures    We have established disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) to ensure that material information relating to us, including our consolidated  
  
   24 

subsidiaries, is made known to the officers who certify our financial reports and to other members of senior management and the Board of Directors. 
    
  As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including the Chief Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer) and Chief Financial Officer (Principal Accounting and Financial Officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operations of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Exchange Act Rule 15d-15(e).  Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in enabling us to record, process, summarize and report information required to be included in our periodic SEC filings within the required time period.   
    
  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting     There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter ended   September 30, 2016  , that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

25 

PART II 

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS  
    
  We are a party to ordinary, routine litigation and administrative proceedings incidental to our business. These proceedings primarily involve claims for personal injury, property damage, cargo, and workers  compensation incurred in connection with the transportation of freight.  We maintain insurance to cover liabilities arising from the transportation of freight for amounts in excess of certain self-insured retentions.
