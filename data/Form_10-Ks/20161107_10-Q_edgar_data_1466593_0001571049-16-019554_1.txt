CONDENSED NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS   
(not audited) 

In the opinion of management, Otter Tail
Corporation (the Company) has included all adjustments (including normal recurring accruals) necessary for a fair presentation
of the consolidated financial statements for the periods presented. The consolidated financial statements and condensed notes
thereto should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included in the Company's Annual Report
on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. Because of seasonal and other factors, the earnings for the three- and
nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 should not be taken as an indication of earnings for all or any part of the balance
of the year. 

The following condensed notes are numbered to correspond to
numbers of the notes included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. 

1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  

Revenue Recognition  

 Due to the diverse business operations of the Company, revenue
recognition depends on the product produced and sold or service performed. The Company recognizes revenue when the earnings process
is complete, evidenced by an agreement with the customer, there has been delivery and acceptance, the price is fixed or determinable
and collectability is reasonably assured. In cases where significant obligations remain after delivery, revenue recognition is
deferred until such obligations are fulfilled. Provisions for sales returns and warranty costs are recorded at the time of the
sale based on historical information and current trends. In the case of derivative instruments, such as Otter Tail Power Company s
(OTP) 2015 forward energy contracts, marked-to-market and realized gains and losses are recognized on a net basis in revenue in
accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 815,  Derivatives
and Hedging . Gains and losses on forward energy contracts subject to regulatory treatment, if any, are deferred and recognized
on a net basis in revenue in the period realized. 

For the Company s operating companies recognizing revenue
on certain products when shipped, those operating companies have no further obligation to provide services related to such product.
The shipping terms used in these instances are FOB shipping point. 

Agreements Subject to Legally Enforceable Netting Arrangements  

 The Company does not offset assets and liabilities under legally
enforceable netting arrangements on the face of its consolidated balance sheet. 

Fair Value Measurements  

 The Company follows ASC Topic 820,  Fair Value Measurements
and Disclosures  (ASC 820), for recurring fair value measurements. ASC 820 provides a single definition of fair value, requires
enhanced disclosures about assets and liabilities measured at fair value and establishes a hierarchal framework for disclosing
the observability of the inputs utilized in measuring assets and liabilities at fair value. The three levels defined by the hierarchy
and examples of each level are as follows: 

Level 1   Quoted prices are available in active markets
for identical assets or liabilities as of the reported date. The types of assets and liabilities included in Level 1 are highly
liquid and actively traded instruments with quoted prices, such as equities listed by the New York Stock Exchange and commodity
derivative contracts listed on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX). 

Level 2   Pricing inputs are other than quoted prices
in active markets, but are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reported date. The types of assets and liabilities
included in Level 2 are typically either comparable to actively traded securities or contracts, such as treasury securities with
pricing interpolated from recent trades of similar securities, or priced with models using highly observable inputs, such as commodity
options priced using observable forward prices and volatilities. 

Level 3   Significant inputs to pricing have little or
no observability as of the reporting date. The types of assets and liabilities included in Level 3 are those with inputs requiring
significant management judgment or estimation and may include complex and subjective models and forecasts. 

The following tables present, for each of the hierarchy levels,
the Company s assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015:

The valuation techniques and inputs used for the Level 2 fair
value measurements in the table above are as follows: 

Forward Gasoline Purchase Contracts   
These contracts are priced based on NYMEX quoted prices for Reformulated Blendstock for Oxygenate Blending (RBOB) Gasoline contracts.
Prices used for the fair valuation of these contracts are based on NYMEX daily reporting date quoted prices for RBOB contracts
with the same settlement periods. 

Government-Backed and Government-Sponsored Enterprises 
and Corporate Debt Securities Held by the Company s Captive Insurance Company    Fair values are determined on the
basis of valuations provided by a third-party pricing service which utilizes industry accepted valuation models and observable
market inputs to determine valuation. Some valuations or model inputs used by the pricing service may be based on broker quotes. 

Inventories  

 Inventories consist of the following: 

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets  

On September 1, 2015 Miller Welding   Iron Works, Inc.
(BTD-Illinois), a wholly owned subsidiary of BTD Manufacturing, Inc. (BTD), acquired the assets of Impulse Manufacturing, Inc.
(Impulse) of Dawsonville, Georgia. The newly acquired business operates under the name BTD-Georgia. Based on the preliminary purchase
price allocation, the difference in the fair value of assets acquired and the price paid for Impulse resulted in an initial estimate
of acquired goodwill of $8.2 million. A final determination of the purchase price was agreed to in June 2016 resulting in a $2.2
million reduction in acquired goodwill in June 2016. See note 2 to the Company s consolidated financial statements for more
information. 

An assessment of the carrying amounts of the remaining goodwill
of the Company s reporting units reported under continuing operations as of December 31, 2015 indicated the fair values are
substantially in excess of their respective book values and not impaired. 

The following table summarizes changes to goodwill by business
segment during 2016: 

Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their
estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment in accordance with requirements under ASC Topic 360-10-35,  Property,
Plant, and Equipment Overall Subsequent Measurement . 

The following table summarizes the components of the Company s
intangible assets at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

The amortization expense for these intangible assets was: 

The estimated annual amortization expense for these intangible
assets for the next five years is: 

Supplemental Disclosures of Cash Flow Information  

Coyote Station Lignite Supply Agreement   Variable
Interest Entity  In October 2012, the Coyote Station owners, including OTP, entered into a lignite sales agreement (LSA)
with Coyote Creek Mining Company, L.L.C. (CCMC), a subsidiary of The North American Coal Corporation, for the purchase of lignite
coal to meet the coal supply requirements of Coyote Station for the period beginning in May 2016 and ending in December 2040. The
price per ton to be paid by the Coyote Station owners under the LSA will reflect the cost of production, along with an agreed profit
and capital charge. CCMC was formed for the purpose of mining coal to meet the coal fuel supply requirements of Coyote Station
from May 2016 through December 2040 and, based on the terms of the LSA, is considered a variable interest entity (VIE) due to the
transfer of all operating and economic risk to the Coyote Station owners, as the agreement is structured so that the price of the
coal would cover all costs of operations as well as future reclamation costs. The Coyote Station owners are also providing a guarantee
of the value of the assets of CCMC as they would be required to buy certain assets at book value should they terminate the contract
prior to the end of the contract term and are providing a guarantee of the value of the equity of CCMC in that they are required
to buy the entity at the end of the contract term at equity value. Under current accounting standards, the primary beneficiary
of a VIE is required to include the assets, liabilities, results of operations and cash flows of the VIE in its consolidated financial
statements. No single owner of Coyote Station owns a majority interest in Coyote Station and none, individually, has the power
to direct the activities that most significantly impact CCMC. Therefore, none of the owners individually, including OTP, is considered
a primary beneficiary of the VIE and the Company is not required to include CCMC in its consolidated financial statements. 

Under the LSA, all development period costs of the Coyote Creek
coal mine incurred during the development period will be recovered from the Coyote Station owners over the full term of the production
period, which commenced with the initial delivery of coal to Coyote Station in May 2016, by being included in the cost of production.
The development fee and the capital charge incurred during the development period will be recovered from the Coyote Station owners
over the first 52 months of the production period by being included in the cost of production during those months. If the
LSA terminates prior to the expiration of its term or the production period terminates prior to December 31, 2040 and the Coyote
Station owners purchase all of the outstanding membership interests of CCMC as required by the LSA, the owners will satisfy, or
(if permitted by CCMC s applicable lender) assume, all of CCMC s obligations owed to CCMC s lenders under its
loans and leases. The Coyote Station owners have limited rights to assign their rights and obligations under the LSA without the
consent of CCMC s lenders during any period in which CCMC s obligations to its lenders remain outstanding. Coyote Station
started taking delivery of coal and paying for coal and the accumulated development fees and capital charges under the LSA in May
2016. OTP s 35% share of the unrecovered development period costs, development fees and capital charges incurred by CCMC
through September 30, 2016 is $61.7 million. In the event the contract is terminated because regulations or legislation render
the burning of coal cost prohibitive and the assets worthless, OTP s maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement
with CCMC as of September 30, 2016 could be as high as $61.7 million. 

New Accounting Standards 

ASU 2014-09  In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No.
2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)  (ASC 606). ASC 606 is a comprehensive, principles-based accounting
standard which amends current revenue recognition guidance with the objective of improving revenue recognition requirements by
providing a single comprehensive model to determine the measurement of revenue and the timing of revenue recognition. ASC 606 also
requires expanded disclosures to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty
of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. 

Amendments to the ASC in ASU 2014-09, as amended, are effective
for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted, but not any earlier than January 1, 2017. Application
methods permitted are: (1) full retrospective, (2) retrospective using one or more practical expedients and (3) retrospective with
the cumulative effect of initial application recognized at the date of initial application. As of September 30, 2016 the Company
has reviewed its revenue streams and contracts to determine areas where the amendments in ASU 2014-09 will be applicable and is
evaluating transition options. The Company does not plan to adopt the updated guidance prior to January 1, 2018. 

ASU 2015-03  In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU
No. 2015-03,  Interest Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs 
(ASU 2015-03), which requires debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability to be presented in the balance sheet as
a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. ASU 2015-03 is effective for
interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015 and must be applied retrospectively to balance sheets
presented for periods prior to adoption. The Company adopted the updated standards in ASU 2015-03 in the first quarter of 2016.
In conjunction with implementing this update, the Company is reclassifying the remaining balance of unamortized line of credit
issuance costs from the deferred debit section of its consolidated balance sheet to other assets, eliminating the deferred debits
section of its consolidated balance sheet and displaying long-term regulatory assets as a separate line item on its consolidated
balance sheet. The effects of applying the guidance in ASU 2015-03 retrospectively to the Company s December 31, 2015 consolidated
balance sheet and of the associated reclassification of unamortized line of credit issuance costs are shown in the following table: 

ASU 2015-11  In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No.
2015-11,  Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory,  which requires that inventories be measured at
the lower of cost or net realizable value instead of the lower of cost or market value. Net realizable value is defined as the
estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation.
The standards update is effective prospectively for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early
adoption permitted. The Company does not expect the adoption of the updated standard to have a material impact on its consolidated
financial statements. 

ASU 2016-02  In February 2016, the FASB
issued ASU No. 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842)  (ASU 2016-02). ASU 2016-02 is a comprehensive amendment of the ASC,
creating Topic 842, which will supersede the current requirements under ASC Topic 840 on leases and require the recognition
of lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and the disclosure of key information about leasing arrangements.
Topic 842 affects any entity that enters into a lease, with some specified scope exemptions. The main difference between
previous GAAP and Topic 842 is the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified
as operating leases under previous GAAP. Topic 842 retains a distinction between finance leases and operating leases. The
classification criteria for distinguishing between finance leases and operating leases are substantially similar to the
classification criteria for distinguishing between capital leases and operating leases in the previous leases guidance. Topic
842 also requires qualitative and specific quantitative disclosures by lessees and lessors to meet the objective of enabling
users of financial statements to assess the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The amendments
in ASU 2016-02 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those
fiscal years. Early application of the amendments in ASU 2016-02 is permitted. The Company is currently reviewing ASU
2016-02, identifying key impacts to its businesses to determine areas where the amendments in ASU 2016-02 will be applicable
and evaluating transition options. The Company does not currently plan to apply the amendments in ASU 2016-02 to its
consolidated financial statements prior to 2019. 

ASU 2016-09  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU
No. 2016-09,  Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting 
(ASU 2016-09) ,  which is intended to improve and simplify accounting and reporting requirements related to stock-based compensation
programs. The amendments in ASU 2016-09 will change how companies account for certain aspects of share-based payments to employees.
Under the updated standard, excess tax benefits related to vested awards recognized in stockholders' equity under prior guidance
will be recognized in the income statement when the awards vest, and the level of shares that can be withheld to cover income taxes
on awards to satisfy statutory income tax withholding obligations without triggering liability classification has been increased.
The amendments in ASU 2016-09 are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those
annual periods. Early adoption is permitted for any interim or annual period. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this
standard will have on its consolidated financial statements, but does not expect it to be material. 

2. Business Combinations and Segment Information  

Business Combinations  

 On September 1, 2015 BTD-Illinois, a wholly owned subsidiary
of BTD, acquired the assets of Impulse of Dawsonville, Georgia for $30.8 million in cash. A post-closing reduction in the purchase
price of $1.5 million was agreed to in June 2016 resulting in an adjusted purchase price of $29.3 million. The acquired business,
operating under the name BTD-Georgia, is a full-service metal fabricator located 30 miles north of Atlanta, Georgia, which offers
a wide range of metal fabrication services ranging from simple laser cutting services and high volume stamping to complex weldments
and assemblies for metal fabrication buyers and original equipment manufacturers. In addition to serving some of BTD s existing
customers from a location closer to the customers  manufacturing facilities, this acquisition provides opportunities for
growth in new and existing markets for BTD with complementing production capabilities that expand the capacity of services offered
by BTD. Pro forma results of operations have not been presented for this acquisition because the effect of the acquisition was
not material to the Company. 

Below is condensed balance sheet information disclosing the
final allocation of the purchase price assigned to each major asset and liability category of BTD-Georgia: 

The assignment of asset values is based on the final purchase
price. In the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company elected to early adopt ASU No. 2015-16,  Business Combinations (Topic 805):
Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments,  which requires that an acquirer in a business combination recognize
adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment
amounts are determined. The purchase price adjustment agreed to in June 2016 resulted in a $2.2 million reduction to the value
of acquired goodwill, a $0.8 million increase in the fair value of acquired customer relationships and a $0.1 million increase
in acquired liabilities. The changes in the value of customer relationships had an insignificant impact on the Company s
consolidated net income in 2016 related to a change in amortization expense that would have been recorded in 2015 had the adjusted
asset values been established on acquisition in 2015. 

Segment Information  

 The Company's businesses have been classified into three segments
 to be consistent with its business strategy and the reporting and review process used by the Company s
chief operating decision makers.  These businesses sell products and provide services to customers primarily in the United
States. The three segments are: Electric, Manufacturing and Plastics. 

Electric includes the production, transmission, distribution
and sale of electric energy in Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota by OTP. In addition, OTP is a participant in the Midcontinent
Independent System Operator, Inc. (MISO) markets. OTP s operations have been the Company s primary business since 1907. 

Manufacturing consists of businesses in the following manufacturing
activities: contract machining, metal parts stamping, fabrication and painting, and production of material and handling trays and
horticultural containers. These businesses have manufacturing facilities in Georgia, Illinois and Minnesota and sell products primarily
in the United States. 

Plastics consists of businesses producing polyvinyl chloride
(PVC) pipe at plants in North Dakota and Arizona. The PVC pipe is sold primarily in the upper Midwest and Southwest regions of
the United States. 

OTP is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. All of the
Company s other businesses are owned by its wholly owned subsidiary, Varistar Corporation (Varistar). The Company s
corporate operating costs include items such as corporate staff and overhead costs, the results of the Company s captive
insurance company and other items excluded from the measurement of operating segment performance. Corporate assets consist primarily
of cash, prepaid expenses, investments and fixed assets. Corporate is not an operating segment. Rather, it is added to operating
segment totals to reconcile to totals on the Company s consolidated financial statements. 

No single customer accounted for over 10% of the Company s
consolidated revenues in 2015. All of the Company s long-lived assets are within the United States and sales within the United
States accounted for 98.5% and 98.2% of its operating revenues for the respective three-month periods ended September 30, 2016

3. Rate and Regulatory Matters  

Below are descriptions of OTP s major capital expenditure
projects that have had, or will have, a significant impact on OTP s revenue requirements, rates and alternative revenue recovery
mechanisms, followed by summaries of specific electric rate or rider proceedings with the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission
(MPUC), the North Dakota Public Service Commission (NDPSC), the South Dakota Public Utilities Commission (SDPUC) and the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), impacting OTP s revenues in 2016 and 2015. 

Major Capital Expenditure Projects  

Big Stone Plant Air Quality Control System (AQCS)  OTP
completed construction and testing of the Big Stone Plant AQCS in the fourth quarter of 2015 and placed the AQCS into commercial
operation on December 29, 2015. OTP s capitalized cost of the project, excluding Allowance for Funds Used During Construction
(AFUDC), as of September 30, 2016 was approximately $199.3 million. 

Fargo Monticello
345    kiloVolt ( kV )  Capacity Expansion 2020 (CapX2020)
Project (the Fargo Project)   OTP has invested approximately $81.5 million and has a 14.2% ownership interest in
the jointly owned assets of this 240-mile transmission line, and owns 100% of certain assets of the project. The final phase of
this project was energized on April 2, 2015. 

Brookings Southeast Twin Cities 345 kV  CapX2020
 Project (the Brookings Project)  OTP has invested approximately $26.3 million and has a 4.8% ownership interest
in this 250-mile transmission line. The MISO approved the Brookings Project as a Multi-Value Project (MVP) under the  MISO
Open Access Transmission, Energy and Operating Reserve Markets Tariff ( MISO Tariff) in December 2011.  MVPs
are designed to enable the region to comply with energy policy mandates and to address reliability and economic issues affecting
multiple areas within the MISO region. The cost allocation of MVPs is designed to ensure the costs of transmission projects with
regional benefits are properly assigned to those who benefit.  The final segments of this line were energized on March 26,
2015. 

The Big Stone South Brookings MVP and  CapX2020
 Project  This 345 kV transmission line, currently under construction, will extend approximately 70 miles between
a substation near Big Stone City, South Dakota and the Brookings County Substation near Brookings, South Dakota. OTP and Northern
States Power   MN, a subsidiary of Xcel Energy Inc., jointly developed this project with obligations to have equal ownership
interest in the transmission line portion of the project. MISO approved this project as an  MVP  under
the  MISO Tariff  in December 2011. Construction began on this line in the third quarter of 2015
and the line is expected to be in service in fall 2017.  OTP s capitalized cost of this project
as of September 30, 2016 was approximately $56.4 million, which includes assets that are 100% owned by OTP.  

The Big Stone South Ellendale MVP  This
345 kV transmission line will extend 160 to 170 miles between a substation near Big Stone City, South Dakota and a substation near
Ellendale, North Dakota. OTP jointly developed this project with Montana-Dakota Utilities Co., a division of MDU Resources Group,
Inc. (MDU) with obligations of having equal ownership interest in the transmission line portion of the project. Construction began
on this line in the second quarter of 2016 and is expected to be completed in 2019.  OTP s capitalized
cost of this project as of September 30, 2016 was approximately $39.8 million, which includes assets that are 100% owned by OTP.  

Recovery of OTP s major transmission investments is through
the MISO Tariff (several as MVPs) and, currently, Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota Transmission Cost Recovery (TCR) Riders. 

Minnesota  

2016 General Rate Case  On February 16, 2016 OTP
filed a request with the MPUC for an increase in revenue recoverable under general rates in Minnesota. In its filing, OTP requested
an allowed rate of return on rate base of 8.07% and an allowed rate of return on equity of 10.4% based on an equity ratio of 52.5%
of total capital. On February 26, 2016 the Minnesota Department of Commerce (MNDOC) concluded that the filing was complete. On
April 14, 2016 the MPUC issued an order approving an interim rate increase of 9.56% to the base rate portion of customers 
bills, as modified and subject to refund. The request and interim rate information is detailed in the table below: 

The major components of the requested rate increase are summarized
below: 

The deadline for submission of intervenor direct testimony was
August 16, 2016. Direct testimony of the MNDOC included a recommendation for an 8.86% allowed rate of return on equity and direct
testimony of the Minnesota Office of the Attorney General (OAG) included a recommendation for a 6.96% allowed rate of return on
equity. In response, in rebuttal testimony, OTP modified its request to provide for an allowed rate of return on equity of 10.05%.
In rebuttal testimony, the MNDOC revised its recommendation to an 8.66% allowed rate of return on equity, and the Minnesota OAG
revised its recommendation to a 7.14% allowed rate of return on equity. The deadline for submission of surrebuttal testimony was
September 28, 2016. Hearings before the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) occurred on October 13, 14 and 17, 2016. 

Based on OTP s modifications to its original request and
other expected outcomes in the aforementioned rate case, OTP has recorded an estimated interim rate refund of $2.3 million as of
September 30, 2016. 

Expected dates for next steps in the procedural schedule: 

2010 General Rate Case  OTP s most recent
general rate increase in Minnesota of approximately $5.0 million, or 1.6%, was granted by the MPUC in an order issued on April
25, 2011 and effective October 1, 2011. Pursuant to the order, OTP s allowed rate of return on rate base increased from 8.33%
to 8.61% and its allowed rate of return on equity increased from 10.43% to 10.74%. 

Minnesota Conservation Improvement Programs (MNCIP)  OTP
recovers conservation-related costs not included in base rates under the MNCIP through the use of an annual recovery mechanism
approved by the MPUC. OTP requested approval for recovery of its 2014 MNCIP financial incentive and 2014 program costs not included
in base rates from the MPUC in an  

April 1, 2015 filing. On July 9, 2015 the MPUC granted
approval of OTP s 2014 financial incentive of $3.0 million along with an updated surcharge with an effective date of October
1, 2015. Based on results from the 2015 MNCIP program year, OTP recognized a financial incentive of $4.2 million in 2015. The
2015 MNCIP program resulted in a 39% increase in energy savings compared to 2014 program results. On April 1, 2016 OTP requested
approval for recovery of its 2015 MNCIP program costs not included in base rates, a $4.3 million financial incentive and an update
to the MNCIP surcharge from the MPUC. On July 19, 2016 the MPUC issued an order approving OTP s request with an effective
date of October 1, 2016. 

The MNDOC has proposed changes to the MNCIP financial incentive
mechanism. On May 25, 2016 the MPUC adopted the MNDOC s proposed changes to the MNCIP financial incentive. The new model
will provide utilities an incentive of 13.5% of 2017 net benefits, 12% of 2018 net benefits and 10% of 2019 net benefits, assuming
the utility achieves 1.7% savings compared to retail sales. OTP estimates the impact of the new model will reduce the MNCIP financial
incentive by approximately 50% compared to the previous incentive mechanism. 

The MNDOC opened an additional docket to investigate how investor-owned
utilities calculate their avoided costs pertaining to generation capacity, energy, transmission and distribution. Avoided costs
are the basis of MNCIP program benefits which going forward will establish OTP s financial incentive. On May 23, 2016 the
MNDOC accepted OTP s 2017 avoided costs calculation, but is requiring Minnesota investor-owned utilities to undergo an analysis
of transmission and distribution avoided costs for 2018 and 2019 with results to be submitted to the MNDOC by January 31, 2017. 

Transmission Cost Recovery Rider    The
Minnesota Public Utilities Act provides a mechanism for automatic adjustment outside of a general rate proceeding to recover the
costs, plus a return on investment at the level approved in a utility s last general rate case, of new transmission facilities
that meet certain criteria. On February 18, 2015 the MPUC approved OTP s 2014 TCR rider annual update with an effective date
of March 1, 2015. OTP filed an annual update to its Minnesota TCR rider on September 30, 2015 requesting revenue recovery of approximately
$7.8 million. A supplemental filing to the update was made on December 21, 2015 to address an issue surrounding the proration of
accumulated deferred income taxes and, in an unrelated adjustment, the TCR rider update revenue request was reduced to $7.2 million.
On March 9, 2016 the MPUC issued an order approving OTP s annual update to its TCR rider, with an effective date of April
1, 2016. OTP filed an update to its TCR rider on April 29, 2016 to incorporate the impact of bonus depreciation for income taxes,
an adjusted rate of return on rate base and allocation factors to align with its 2016 general rate case request. On July 5, 2016
the MPUC issued an order approving the proposed rates on a provisional basis, as recommended by the MNDOC. The proposed rate changes
went into effect on September 1, 2016. The MPUC granted an extension to the MNDOC to file initial comments in this docket until
November 1, 2016.  

Environmental Cost Recovery Rider   On
December 18, 2013 the MPUC granted approval of OTP s Minnesota Environmental Cost Recovery (ECR) rider for recovery of OTP s
Minnesota jurisdictional share of the revenue requirements of its investment in the Big Stone Plant AQCS effective January 1, 2014.
The ECR rider recoverable revenue requirements include a current return on the project s construction work in progress (CWIP)
balance at the level approved in OTP s most recent general rate case. The MPUC approved OTP s 2014 ECR rider annual
update request on November 24, 2014 with an effective date of December 1, 2014. OTP filed its 2015 annual update on July 31, 2015,
with a request to keep the 2014 annual update rate in place. On December 21, 2015 OTP filed a supplemental filing with updated
financial information. The MPUC issued an order on March 9, 2016 approving OTP s request to leave the 2014 annual update
rate in place. OTP filed an update to its Minnesota ECR rider on April 29, 2016 to incorporate the impact of bonus depreciation
for income taxes, an adjusted rate of return on rate base and allocation factors to align with its 2016 general rate case request,
with an effective date of September 1, 2016. On July 5, 2016 the MPUC issued an order approving the proposed rates on a provisional
basis and granted an extension to the MNDOC to file initial comments in this docket until November 1, 2016. 

North Dakota  

General Rates  OTP s most recent general rate
increase in North Dakota of $3.6 million, or approximately 3.0%, was granted by the NDPSC in an order issued on November 25, 2009
and effective December 2009. Pursuant to the order, OTP s allowed rate of return on rate base was set at 8.62%, and its allowed
rate of return on equity was set at 10.75%. 

Renewable Resource Adjustment  OTP
has a North Dakota Renewable Resource Adjustment (NDRRA) rider which enables OTP to recover the North Dakota share of its investments
in renewable energy facilities it owns in North Dakota. This rider allows OTP to recover costs associated with new renewable energy
projects as they are completed along with a return on investment.  On March 25, 2015  the NDPSC
approved OTP s 2014 annual update to the NDRRA rider, including a change in rate design from an amount per kilowatt-hour
consumed to a percentage of a customer s bill, with an effective date of April 1, 2015. OTP submitted its 2015 annual update
to the NDRRA rider rate on December 31, 2015 with a requested implementation date of April 1, 2016.  On February 25, 2016
OTP made a  supplemental filing to address the impact of bonus depreciation for income taxes and related
deferred tax assets on the NDRRA, as well as an adjustment to the estimated amount of Federal  

Production Tax Credits used. The
NDPSC approved the NDRRA 2015 annual update on June 22, 2016  with an effective date of July 1, 2016 .
The updated NDRRA reflects a reduction in the return on equity (ROE) component of the rate from 10.75%, approved in OTP s
most recent general rate case, to 10.50%.  

Transmission Cost Recovery Rider  North Dakota law
provides a mechanism for automatic adjustment outside of a general rate proceeding to recover jurisdictional capital and operating
costs incurred by a public utility for new or modified electric transmission facilities. For qualifying projects, the law authorizes
a current return on CWIP and a return on investment at the level approved in the utility's most recent general rate case. The NDPSC
approved OTP s 2014 annual update to its TCR rider rate on December 17, 2014 with an effective date of January 1, 2015. On
August 31, 2015 OTP filed its 2015 annual update to its North Dakota TCR rider rate requesting recovery of approximately $10.2
million for 2016 compared with $8.5 million for 2015, including costs assessed by the MISO as well as new costs from the Southwest
Power Pool (SPP) that OTP began incurring January 1, 2016. These new costs are associated with OTP s load connected to the
transmission system of Central Power Electric Cooperative (CPEC). OTP s load became subject to SPP transmission-related charges
when CPEC transmission assets were added to the SPP. The NDPSC approved OTP s 2015 annual update to its TCR rider rate on
December 16, 2015, with an effective date of January 1, 2016. On September 1, 2016 OTP filed its annual update to the TCR rider
requesting a revenue requirement of $5.7 million, which includes a reduction of $2.6 million for a projected over-collection for
2016. Primary drivers of the decrease from the 2015 updated rider rate include the impact of federal bonus depreciation and unresolved
MISO ROE complaint proceedings. OTP filed a supplemental filing on September 14, 2016, requesting that the current true-up over-collection
balance be spread over the next two years for purposes of reducing the volatility of the rates from year to year. An informal hearing
is scheduled for November 30, 2016. 

Environmental Cost Recovery Rider    On
February 8, 2013 OTP filed a request with the NDPSC for an ECR rider to recover OTP s North Dakota jurisdictional share of
the revenue requirements associated with its investment in the Big Stone Plant AQCS. On December 18, 2013 the NDPSC approved OTP s
North Dakota ECR rider based on revenue requirements through the 2013 calendar year and thereafter, with rates effective for bills
rendered on or after January 1, 2014. The ECR provides for a current return on CWIP and a return on investment at the level approved
in OTP s most recent general rate case. The NDPSC approved OTP s 2014 ECR rider annual update request on July 10, 2014
with an August 1, 2014 implementation date. On March 31, 2015 OTP filed its annual update to the ECR. This update included a request
to increase the ECR rider rate from 7.531% to 9.193% of base rates. The NDPSC approved the annual update on June 17, 2015 with
an effective date of July 1, 2015, along with the approval of recovery of OTP s North Dakota jurisdictional share of Hoot
Lake Plant Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS) project costs.  

On March 31, 2016 OTP filed its annual update to the ECR rider
requesting a reduction in the rate from 9.193% to 7.904% of base rates, or a revenue requirement reduction from $12.2 million to
$10.4 million, effective July 1, 2016. The rate reduction request was primarily due to the Company s 2015 bonus depreciation
election for income taxes, which reduces revenue requirements. The filing was approved on June 22, 2016. 

Reagent Costs and Emission Allowances  On July 31,
2014 OTP filed a request with the NDPSC to revise its Fuel Clause Adjustment (FCA) rider in North Dakota to include recovery of
new reagent and emission allowance costs. On February 25, 2015 the NDPSC approved recovery of these costs through modification
of the ECR rider, instead of recovery through the FCA as OTP had proposed. The ECR rider reagent and emissions allowance charge
became effective May 1, 2015. 

South Dakota  

2010 General Rate Case  OTP s most recent
general rate increase in South Dakota of approximately $643,000 or approximately 2.32% was granted by the SDPUC in an order issued
on April 21, 2011 and effective with bills rendered on and after June 1, 2011. Pursuant to the order, OTP s allowed rate
of return on rate base was set at 8.50%. 

Transmission Cost Recovery Rider  South Dakota law
provides a mechanism for automatic adjustment outside of a general rate proceeding to recover jurisdictional capital and operating
costs incurred by a public utility for new or modified electric transmission facilities. The SDPUC approved OTP s 2014 annual
update on February 13, 2015 with an effective date of March 1, 2015. OTP filed its 2015 annual update on October 30, 2015
with a proposed effective date of March 1, 2016. A supplemental filing was made on February 3, 2016 to true-up the filing to include
the impact of bonus depreciation elected for 2015, the inclusion of a deferred tax asset relating to a net operating loss and the
proration of accumulated deferred income taxes. This update included the recovery of new SPP transmission costs OTP began to incur
on January 1, 2016. On February 12, 2016 the SDPUC approved OTP s annual update to its TCR rider, with an effective
date of March 1, 2016. 

Environmental Cost Recovery
Rider   On November 25, 2014 the SDPUC approved OTP s ECR rider request to recover OTP s South
Dakota jurisdictional share of revenue requirements associated with its investment in the Big Stone Plant AQCS and Hoot Lake
Plant MATS projects, with an effective date of December 1, 2014. On August 31, 2015 OTP filed its annual update to the South
Dakota ECR requesting recovery of approximately $2.7 million in annual revenue. The SDPUC approved  

the request on October 15,
2015 with an effective date of November 1, 2015. On August 31, 2016 OTP filed its 2016 update to the ECR rider, requesting
recovery of approximately $2.3 million in annual revenue. The SDPUC approved the request on October 26, 2016 with an
effective date of November 1, 2016. This year s lower revenue requirement is
a result of the implementation of federal bonus depreciation taken on the Big Stone Plant AQCS. 

Reagent Costs and Emission Allowances  On August
1, 2014 OTP filed a request with the SDPUC to revise its FCA rider in South Dakota to include recovery of reagent and emission
allowance costs. On September 16, 2014 the SDPUC approved OTP s request to include recovery of these costs in its South Dakota
FCA rider. 

Revenues Recorded under Rate Riders  

 The following table presents revenue recorded by OTP under rate
riders in place in Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota: 

1 Includes MNCIP costs recovered in base rates.  

FERC  

Multi-Value Transmission Projects    On
December 16, 2010 the FERC approved the cost allocation for a new classification of projects in the MISO region called MVPs.  MVPs
are designed to enable the region to comply with energy policy mandates and to address reliability and economic issues affecting
multiple transmission zones within the MISO region. The cost allocation is designed to ensure that the costs of transmission projects
with regional benefits are properly assigned to those who benefit. On October 20, 2011 the FERC reaffirmed the MVP cost allocation
on rehearing. 

Effective January 1, 2012 the FERC authorized OTP to recover
100% of prudently incurred CWIP and Abandoned Plant Recovery on two projects approved by MISO as MVPs in MISO s 2011 Transmission
Expansion Plan: the Big Stone South Brookings MVP and the Big Stone South Ellendale MVP. 

On November 12, 2013 a group of industrial
customers and other stakeholders filed a complaint with the FERC seeking to reduce the ROE component of the transmission rates
that MISO transmission owners, including OTP, may collect under the MISO Tariff. The complainants are seeking to reduce the 12.38%
ROE used in MISO s transmission rates over a 15-month period ending in February 2015 to a proposed 9.15%. On October 16,
2014 the FERC issued an order finding that the current MISO ROE may be unjust and unreasonable and setting the issue for hearing.
A non-binding decision by the presiding ALJ was issued on December 22, 2015 finding that the MISO transmission owners  ROE
should be 10.32%, and the FERC issued an order on September 28, 2016 setting the base ROE at 10.32%. On November 6, 2014 a group
of MISO transmission owners, including OTP, filed for a FERC incentive of an additional 50-basis points for Regional Transmission
Organization participation (RTO Adder). On January 5, 2015 the FERC granted the request, deferring collection of the RTO Adder
until the FERC issued its order in the ROE complaint proceeding.  Based on the FERC adjustment to the MISO Tariff ROE resulting
from the November 12, 2013 complaint and OTP s incentive rate filing , OTP s ROE will be
10.82% (a 10.32% base ROE plus the 0.5% RTO Adder) effective September 28, 2016.  

On February 12, 2015 another group of stakeholders filed a complaint
with the FERC seeking to reduce the ROE component of the transmission rates that MISO transmission owners, including OTP, may collect
under the MISO Tariff from 12.38% to a proposed 8.67% over a 15-month period ending in May 2016. The FERC issued an order on June
18, 2015 setting the complaint for hearings, which were held the week of February 16, 2016. A non-binding decision by the presiding
ALJ was issued on June 30, 2016 finding that the MISO transmission owners  ROE should be 9.7%. The FERC is expected to issue
its order in the spring of 2017. 

Based on a potential reduction by the FERC in the ROE component
of the MISO Tariff, OTP recorded a reduction in revenue of $0.1 million in the three-month period ended September 30, 2015, and
$1.3 million and $0.9 million in the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and has a $2.4 million
liability on its balance sheet as of September 30, 2016, representing OTP s best estimate of a refund obligation that
would arise, net of amounts that would be subject to recovery under state jurisdictional TCR riders, based on a reduced ROE. As
a result of the FERC order issued on September 28, 2016 in the first complaint proceeding establishing an allowed ROE of 10.32%,
no additional liability was recorded in the third quarter of 2016. 

4. Regulatory Assets and Liabilities  

As a regulated entity, OTP accounts for the financial effects
of regulation in accordance with ASC Topic 980,  Regulated Operations  (ASC 980). This accounting standard allows for the
recording of a regulatory asset or liability for costs that will be collected or refunded in the future as required under regulation.
Additionally, ASC 980-605-25 provides for the recognition of revenues authorized for recovery outside of a general rate case under
alternative revenue programs which provide for recovery of costs and incentives or returns on investment in such items as transmission
infrastructure, renewable energy resources or conservation initiatives. The following tables indicate the amount of regulatory
assets and liabilities recorded on the Company s consolidated balance sheets: 

1 Costs subject to recovery without a rate of return.  

   2 Amount eligible for recovery under an alternative
revenue program which includes an incentive or rate of return.  

1 Costs subject to recovery without a rate
of return.  

   2 Amount eligible for recovery under an alternative
revenue program which includes an incentive or rate of return.  

The regulatory asset related to prior service costs and actuarial
losses on pensions and other postretirement benefits represents benefit costs and actuarial losses subject to recovery through
rates as they are expensed over the remaining service lives of active employees included in the plans. These unrecognized benefit
costs and actuarial losses are required to be recognized as components of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in equity under
ASC Topic 715,  Compensation Retirement Benefits , but are eligible for treatment as regulatory assets based on their
probable recovery in future retail electric rates. 

All Deferred Marked-to-Market Losses recorded as of September
30, 2016 relate to forward purchases of energy scheduled for delivery through December 2020. 

Conservation Improvement Program Costs and Incentives represent
mandated conservation expenditures and incentives recoverable through retail electric rates. 

The Accumulated Asset Retirement Obligation (ARO) Accretion/Depreciation
Adjustment will accrete and be amortized over the lives of property with asset retirement obligations. 

Big Stone II Unrecovered Project Costs   Minnesota are
the Minnesota share of generation and transmission plant-related costs incurred by OTP related to its participation in the abandoned
Big Stone II project. 

North Dakota Renewable Resource Rider Accrued Revenues relate
to qualifying renewable resource costs incurred to serve North Dakota customers that have not been billed to North Dakota customers
as of September 30, 2016. 

Debt Reacquisition Premiums are being recovered from OTP customers
over the remaining original lives of the reacquired debt issues, the longest of which is 192 months. 

The regulatory assets and liabilities related to Deferred Income
Taxes result from changes in statutory tax rates accounted for in accordance with ASC Topic 740,  Income Taxes . 

Minnesota Deferred Rate Case Expenses Subject to Recovery relate
to costs incurred in conjunction with OTP s 2016 rate case in Minnesota currently being recovered over a 24-month period
beginning with the establishment of interim rates in April 2016. 

Big Stone II Unrecovered Project Costs   South Dakota
are the South Dakota share of generation and transmission plant-related costs incurred by OTP related to its participation in the
abandoned Big Stone II project. 

The North Dakota Transmission Cost Recovery Rider Accrued Revenues
relate to revenues earned on qualifying transmission system facilities that have not been billed to North Dakota customers as of
September 30, 2016. 

MISO Schedule 26/26A Transmission Cost Recovery Rider True-ups
relate to the over/under collection of revenue based on comparison of the expected versus actual construction on eligible projects
in the period. The true-ups also include the state jurisdictional portion of MISO Schedule 26/26A for regional transmission cost
recovery that was included in the calculation of the state transmission riders and subsequently adjusted to reflect actual billing
amounts in the schedule. 

The South Dakota Transmission Cost Recovery Rider Accrued Revenues
relate to revenues earned on qualifying transmission system facilities that have not been billed to South Dakota customers as of
September 30, 2016. 

Minnesota Renewable Resource Rider Accrued Revenues relate to
revenues earned on qualifying renewable resource costs incurred to serve Minnesota customers that have not been billed to Minnesota
customers. On April 4, 2013 the MPUC approved OTP s request to set the rider rate to zero effective May 1, 2013 and authorized
that any unrecovered balance be retained as a regulatory asset to be recovered over an 18-month period beginning with the establishment
of interim rates in April 2016. 

The Accumulated Reserve for Estimated Removal Costs  
Net of Salvage is reduced as actual removal costs, net of salvage revenues, are incurred. 

The North Dakota Transmission Cost Recovery Rider Accrued Refund
relates to amounts collected for qualifying transmission system facilities and operating costs incurred to serve North Dakota customers
that are refundable to North Dakota customers as of September 30, 2016. 

The Minnesota Transmission Cost Recovery Rider Accrued Refund
relates to amounts collected for qualifying transmission system facilities and operating costs incurred to serve Minnesota customers
that are refundable to Minnesota customers as of September 30, 2016. 

Revenue for Rate Case Expenses Subject to Refund   Minnesota
relates to revenues collected under general rates to recover costs related to prior rate case proceedings in excess of the actual
costs incurred, which are subject to refund over a 24-month period beginning with the establishment of interim rates in April 2016. 

The Minnesota Environmental Cost Recovery Rider Accrued Refund
relates to amounts collected on the Minnesota share of OTP s investment in the Big Stone Plant AQCS project that are refundable
to Minnesota customers as of September 30, 2016. 

The South Dakota Environmental Cost Recovery Rider Accrued Refund
relates to amounts collected on the South Dakota share of OTP s investments in the Big Stone Plant AQCS and Hoot Lake Plant
MATS projects that are refundable to South Dakota customers as of September 30, 2016. 

The North Dakota Environmental Cost Recovery Rider Accrued Refund
relates to amounts collected on the North Dakota share of OTP s investments in the Big Stone Plant AQCS and Hoot Lake Plant
MATS projects that are refundable to North Dakota customers as of September 30, 2016. 

If for any reason OTP ceases to meet the criteria for application
of guidance under ASC 980 for all or part of its operations, the regulatory assets and liabilities that no longer meet such criteria
would be removed from the consolidated balance sheet and included in the consolidated statement of income as an expense or income
item in the period in which the application of guidance under ASC 980 ceases. 

5. Open Contract Positions Subject to Legally Enforceable
Netting Arrangements  

OTP has certain derivative contracts that are designated as
normal purchases. Individual counterparty exposures for these contracts can be offset according to legally enforceable netting
arrangements. The following table shows forward contract fair value positions subject to legally enforceable netting arrangements
as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:

6. Reconciliation of Common Shareholders  Equity, Common
Shares and Earnings Per Share  

Reconciliation of Common Shareholders  Equity  

Shelf Registration  

 The Company s shelf registration statement filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 11, 2015, under which the Company may offer for sale, from time to time, either separately
or together in any combination, equity, debt or other securities described in the shelf registration statement, including common
shares of the Company, expires on May 11, 2018. On May 11, 2015, the Company entered into a Distribution Agreement with J.P. Morgan
Securities (JPMS) under which it may offer and sell its common shares from time to time in an At-the-Market offering program through
JPMS, as its distribution agent, up to an aggregate sales price of $75 million. 

Common Shares  

 Following is a reconciliation of the Company s common
shares outstanding from December 31, 2015 through September 30, 2016: 

Earnings Per Share  

 The numerator used in the calculation of both basic and diluted
earnings per common share is net income for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. The denominator
used in the calculation of basic earnings per common share is the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the
period excluding nonvested restricted shares granted to the Company s directors and employees, which are considered contingently
returnable and not outstanding for the purpose of calculating basic earnings per share. The denominator used in the calculation
of diluted earnings per common share is derived by adjusting basic shares outstanding for the items listed in the following reconciliation: 

The effect of dilutive shares on earnings per share for the
three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, resulted in no differences greater than $0.01 between basic and
diluted earnings per share in total or from continuing or discontinued operations in either period. 

7. Share-Based Payments  

Stock Incentive Awards  

 In 2016 the following stock incentive awards were granted to
the Company s employees and nonemployee directors under the 2014 Stock Incentive Plan: 

Under the 2016 performance share award agreements, the aggregate
award for performance at target is 81,500 shares. For target performance the Company s executive officers would earn an aggregate
of 54,333 common shares based on the Company s total shareholder return relative to the total shareholder return of the companies
that comprise the Edison Electric Institute Index over the performance measurement period of January 1, 2016 through December 31,
2018, with the beginning and ending share values based on the average closing price of a share of the Company s common stock
for the 20 trading days immediately following January 1, 2016 and the average closing price for the 20 trading days immediately
preceding January 1, 2019, respectively. The Company s executive officers would also earn an aggregate of 27,167 common shares
for achieving the target set for the Company s 3-year average adjusted ROE. Actual payment may range from zero to 150% of
the target amount, or up to an aggregate of 122,250 common shares. The executive officers have no voting or dividend rights related
to these shares until the shares, if any, are issued at the end of the performance measurement period. The terms of these awards
are such that the entire award will be classified and accounted for as a liability, as required under ASC Topic 718,  Compensation Stock
Compensation , and will be measured over the performance period based on the fair value of the award at the end of each reporting
period subsequent to the grant date. 

Under the 2016 performance share award agreements, payment and
the amount of payment in the event of retirement, resignation for good reason or involuntary termination without cause is to be
made at the end of the performance period based on actual performance, subject to proration in certain cases, except that the payment
of performance awards granted to certain officers who are parties to executive employment agreements with the Company is to be
made at the target amount at the date of any such event. The vesting of these performance share award agreements is accelerated
and paid out at target in the event of a change in control, disability or death (and on retirement at or after the age of 62 for
certain officers who are parties to executive employment agreements with the Company). 

Vesting of restricted stock and restricted stock units is accelerated
in the event of a change in control, disability, death or retirement, subject to proration on retirement in certain cases. All
restricted stock units granted to executive officers are eligible to receive dividend equivalent payments on all unvested awards
over the awards  respective vesting periods, subject to forfeiture under the terms of the restricted stock unit award agreements.
The grant-date fair value of each restricted stock unit granted to an executive officer was the average of the high and low market
price per share on the date of grant. The restricted shares granted to the Company s nonemployee directors are eligible for
full dividend and voting rights. Restricted shares not vested and dividends on those restricted shares are subject to forfeiture
under the terms of the restricted stock award agreements. The grant-date fair value of each restricted share was based on the market
value of one share of the Company s common stock on the date of grant. The grant-date fair value of each restricted stock
unit granted to a key employee that is not an executive officer of the Company was based on the market value of one share of the
Company s common stock on the date of grant, discounted for the value of the dividend exclusion on those restricted stock
units over the four-year vesting period. 

The end of the period over which compensation expense is recognized
for the above share-based awards for the individual grantees is the shorter of the indicated vesting period for the respective
awards or the date the grantee becomes eligible for retirement as defined in their award agreement. 

As of September 30, 2016 the remaining unrecognized compensation
expense related to outstanding, unvested stock-based compensation was approximately $5.1 million (before income taxes) which will
be amortized over a weighted-average period of 2.4 years. 

Amounts of compensation expense recognized under the Company s
six stock-based payment programs for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are presented in the table
below: 

8. Retained Earnings Restriction  

The Company is a holding company with no significant operations
of its own. The primary source of funds for payments of dividends to the Company s shareholders is from dividends paid or
distributions made by the Company s subsidiaries. As a result of certain statutory limitations or regulatory or financing
agreements, there are limitations on the amount of distributions allowed to be made by the Company s subsidiaries. 

Both the Company and OTP debt agreements contain restrictions
on the payment of cash dividends on a default or event of default. An event of default would be considered to have occurred if
the Company did not meet certain financial covenants. As of September 30, 2016 the Company was in compliance with these financial
covenants. See note 10 to the Company s consolidated financial statements on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015
for further information on the covenants. 

Under the Federal Power Act, a public utility may not pay dividends
from any funds properly included in a capital account. What constitutes  funds properly included in a capital account 
is undefined in the Federal Power Act or the related regulations; however, FERC has consistently interpreted the provision to allow
dividends to be paid as long as (1) the source of the dividends is clearly disclosed, (2) the dividend is not excessive and (3)
there is no self-dealing on the part of corporate officials. 

The MPUC indirectly limits the amount of dividends OTP can pay
to the Company by requiring an equity-to-total-capitalization ratio between 47.5% and 58.1% based on OTP s 2016 capital structure
petition approved by order of the MPUC on August 2, 2016. OTP s equity to total capitalization ratio including short-term
debt was 52.9% as of September 30, 2016. Total capitalization for OTP cannot currently exceed $1,123,168,000. 

9. Commitments and Contingencies  

Construction and Other Purchase Commitments  

 At December 31, 2015 OTP had commitments under contracts, including
its share of construction program commitments extending into 2019, of approximately $89.6 million. At September 30, 2016 OTP had
commitments under contracts, including its share of construction program commitments, extending into 2019, of approximately $137.4
million. 

Electric Utility Capacity and Energy Requirements and Coal
and Delivery Contracts  

 OTP has commitments for the purchase of capacity and energy
requirements under agreements extending into 2040. In 2016, OTP entered into a $3.5 million electric generating capacity purchase
agreement for the period June 2017 through May 2019. 

OTP has commitments under contracts providing for the purchase
and delivery of a significant portion of its current coal requirements. Current coal purchase agreements for Big Stone Plant and
Coyote Station expire in 2017 and 2040, respectively. In January 2016, OTP entered into an agreement with Cloud Peak Energy Resources
LLC for the purchase of subbituminous coal for Hoot Lake Plant for the period of January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2023. OTP
has no fixed minimum purchase requirements under the agreement but all of Hoot Lake Plant s coal requirements for the period
covered must be purchased under this agreement. 

Operating Leases  

 OTP has obligations to make future operating lease payments
primarily related to land leases and coal rail-car leases. On September 27, 2016 OTP entered into an agreement to lease rail cars
for the delivery of coal to Big Stone Plant through October of 2026 with OTP s share of the lease payments totaling $970,000
over the term of the lease. The Company s  

nonelectric companies have obligations to make future operating lease payments
primarily related to leases of buildings and manufacturing equipment. 

Contingencies  

 Based on the reduction by the FERC in the ROE component of the
MISO Tariff, OTP has a $2.4 million liability on its balance sheet as of September 30, 2016, representing OTP s best estimate
of its current refund obligation related to amounts collected under the MISO Tariff, net of amounts that would be subject to recovery
under state jurisdictional TCR riders. 

OTP was a party to proceedings before the FERC regarding the
calculation, assessment and implementation of MISO Revenue Sufficiency Guarantee (RSG) charges for entities participating in the
MISO wholesale energy market since that market s start on April 1, 2005. As many as 200 utilities, generators and power marketers
participated in the proceedings, which concluded on May 2, 2016. The proceedings fundamentally concerned MISO s application
of its MISO RSG rate on file with FERC to market participants, revisions to the RSG rate based on several FERC orders and FERC s
decision to resettle the markets based on MISO application of the RSG rate to market participants. Several of the FERC s
orders are on review in a set of consolidated cases before the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia (D.C.
Circuit). The consolidated petitions at the D.C. Circuit involve multiple petitioners and intervenors. OTP is both a petitioner
and an intervenor in these cases. The scope of the issues that will be subject to appeal at the D.C. Circuit have not yet been
finalized. In addition, MISO has not made available past billing or resettlement data necessary for determining amounts that might
be payable if the FERC s decisions are reversed. Therefore, the Company cannot estimate OTP s exposure at this time
from a final order reversing the relevant FERC orders. Although the Company cannot estimate OTP s exposure at this time,
a final order reversing the relevant FERC orders could have a material adverse effect on the Company s results of operations. 

Contingencies, by their nature, relate to uncertainties that
require the Company s management to exercise judgment both in assessing the likelihood a liability has been incurred as well
as in estimating the amount of potential loss. The most significant contingencies impacting the Company s consolidated financial
statements are those related to environmental remediation, risks associated with indemnification obligations under divestitures
of discontinued operations and litigation matters. Should all of these known items result in liabilities being incurred, the loss
could be as high as $1.0 million, excluding any liability for RSG charges for which an estimate cannot be made at this time. 

In 2014, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published
proposed standards of performance for CO2 emissions from new fossil fuel-fired power plants, proposed CO2 emission guidelines for
existing fossil fuel-fired power plants and proposed CO2 standards of performance for CO2 emissions from reconstructed and modified
fossil fuel-fired power plants under section 111 of the Clean Air Act. The EPA published final rules for each of these proposals
on October 23, 2015. All of these rules have been challenged on legal grounds and are currently pending before the D.C. Circuit.
On February 9, 2016 the U.S. Supreme Court granted a stay of the CO2 emission guidelines for existing fossil fuel-fired power plants,
pending disposition of petitions for review in the D.C. Circuit and, if a petition for a writ of certiorari seeking review by the
U.S. Supreme Court were granted, any final Supreme Court determination. The D.C. Circuit heard oral argument on challenges to the
CO2 emission guidelines on September 27, 2016 before the full court, and a decision may be rendered in late 2016 or early 2017.
Given the pending litigation, uncertainty regarding the status of the rules will likely continue for some time. OTP is actively
engaged with the stakeholder processes in each of its states that have continued to move forward with planning efforts during the
stay. 

Other  

 The Company is a party to litigation and regulatory enforcement
matters arising in the normal course of business. The Company regularly analyzes current information and, as necessary, provides
accruals for liabilities that are probable of occurring and that can be reasonably estimated. The Company believes the effect on
its consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows, if any, for the disposition of all other matters pending
as of September 30, 2016 will not be material. 

10. Short-Term and Long-Term Borrowings  

The following table presents the status of our lines of credit
as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

On October 31, 2016 both the Otter Tail Corporation Credit Agreement
and the OTP Credit Agreement were amended to extend the expiration dates by one year from October 29, 2020 to October 29, 2021.
Also, the line limit on the Otter Tail Corporation Credit Agreement was reduced from $150 million to $130 million. 

Debt Issuances and Retirements  

2016 Note Purchase Agreement   On September
23, 2016 the Company entered into a Note Purchase Agreement (the 2016 Note Purchase Agreement) with the purchasers named therein,
pursuant to which the Company has agreed to issue to the purchasers, in a private placement transaction, $80 million aggregate
principal amount of the Company s 3.55% Guaranteed Senior Notes due December 15, 2026 (the 2026 Notes). The Company s
obligations under the 2016 Note Purchase Agreement and the 2026 Notes will be guaranteed by the Company s Material Subsidiaries
(as defined in the 2016 Note Purchase Agreement, but specifically excluding OTP). The 2026 Notes are expected to be issued on December
13, 2016, subject to the satisfaction of certain customary conditions to closing. 

The Company may prepay all or any part of the 2026 Notes (in
an amount not less than 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2026 Notes then outstanding in the case of a partial prepayment)
at 100% of the principal amount prepaid, together with unpaid accrued interest and a make-whole amount; provided that if no default
or event of default exists under the 2016 Note Purchase Agreement, any optional prepayment made by the Company of all of the 2026
Notes on or after September 15, 2026 will be made without any make-whole amount. The Company is required to offer to prepay all
of the outstanding 2026 Notes at 100% of the principal amount together with unpaid accrued interest in the event of a Change of
Control (as defined in the 2016 Note Purchase Agreement) of the Company. In addition, if the Company and its Material Subsidiaries
sell a  substantial part  of their assets and use the proceeds to prepay or retire senior Interest-bearing Debt (as
defined in the 2016 Note Purchase Agreement) of the Company and/or a Material Subsidiary in accordance with the terms of the 2016
Note Purchase Agreement, the Company is required to offer to prepay a Ratable Portion (as defined in the 2016 Note Purchase Agreement)
of the 2026 Notes held by each holder of the 2026 Notes. 

The 2016 Note Purchase Agreement contains a number of restrictions
on the business of the Company and the Material Subsidiaries that became effective on execution of the 2016 Note Purchase Agreement.
These include restrictions on the Company s and the Material Subsidiaries  abilities to merge, sell assets, create
or incur liens on assets, guarantee the obligations of any other party, engage in transactions with related parties, redeem or
pay dividends on the Company s and the Material Subsidiaries  shares of capital stock, and make investments. The 2016
Note Purchase Agreement also contains other negative covenants and events of default, as well as certain financial covenants. Specifically,
the Company may not permit the ratio of its Interest-bearing Debt (as defined in the 2016 Note Purchase Agreement) to Total Capitalization
(as defined in the 2016 Note Purchase Agreement) to be greater than 0.60 to 1.00, determined as of the end of each fiscal quarter,
and may not permit the Interest and Dividend Coverage Ratio (as defined in the 2016 Note Purchase Agreement) to be less than 1.50
to 1.00 for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters. The Company is also restricted from allowing its Priority Debt (as
defined in the 2016 Note Purchase Agreement) to exceed 10% of Total Capitalization, determined as of the end of each fiscal quarter.
The 2016 Note Purchase Agreement does not include provisions for the termination of the agreement or the acceleration of repayment
of amounts outstanding due to changes in the Company s or the Material Subsidiaries  credit ratings. 

The Company intends to use the proceeds of the 2026 Notes to
repay existing debt, including the remaining $52,330,000 of its 9.000% Senior Notes due December 15, 2016, and for general corporate
purposes. 

$50 Million Term Loan Agreement   On February
5, 2016 the Company entered into a Term Loan Agreement (the Term Loan Agreement) with the Banks named therein, JPMorgan Chase Bank,
N.A., as administrative agent, and JPMS, as Lead Arranger and Book Runner. The Term Loan Agreement provides for an unsecured term
loan with an aggregate commitment of $50 million that the Company may use for purposes of funding working capital, capital expenditures
and other corporate purposes of the Company and certain of our subsidiaries. Under the Term Loan Agreement, the Company may, on
up to two occasions, enter into additional tranches of term loans in minimum increments of $10 million, subject to the consent
of the lenders and so long as the aggregate amount of outstanding term loans does not exceed $100 million at any time. Borrowings
under the Term Loan Agreement will bear interest at either (1) LIBOR plus 0.90% or (2) the greater of (a) the Prime Rate, (b) the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York Rate plus 0.50% and (c) LIBOR multiplied by the Statutory Reserve Rate plus 1%. The applicable
interest rate will depend on the Company s election of whether to make the advance a LIBOR advance. The Term Loan Agreement
terminates on February 5, 2018. The Term Loan Agreement contains a number of restrictions on the Company, Varistar and certain
subsidiaries of Varistar, including restrictions on their ability to merge, sell assets, make investments, create or incur liens
on assets, guarantee the obligations of any other party and engage in transactions with related parties. The Term Loan Agreement
also contains affirmative covenants and events of default, and certain financial covenants. Specifically, the Company must not
permit the ratio of its Interest-bearing Debt to Total Capitalization to be greater than 0.60 to 1.00 or permit its Interest and
Dividend Coverage Ratio to be less than 1.50 to 1.00 (each measured on a consolidated basis), as provided in the Term Loan Agreement.
The Term Loan Agreement does not include provisions for the termination of the  

agreement or the acceleration of repayment of amounts
outstanding due to changes in the Company s credit ratings. The Company s obligations under the Term Loan Agreement
are guaranteed by Varistar and certain of its subsidiaries. 

On February 5, 2016 the Company borrowed $50 million under the
Term Loan Agreement at an interest rate based on the 30 day LIBOR plus 90 basis points and used the proceeds to pay down borrowings
under the Otter Tail Corporation Credit Agreement that were used to fund the expansion of BTD s Minnesota facilities in 2015
and to fund the September 1, 2015 acquisition of BTD-Georgia. 

The following tables provide a breakdown of the assignment of
the Company s consolidated short-term and long-term debt outstanding as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

11. Pension Plan and Other Postretirement Benefits  

Pension Plan  Components of net periodic pension
benefit cost of the Company's noncontributory funded pension plan are as follows: 

Cash flows  The Company made discretionary plan
contributions totaling $10,000,000 in January 2016. The Company currently is not required and does not expect to make an additional
contribution to the plan in 2016. The Company also made discretionary plan contributions totaling $10,000,000 in January 2015. 

Executive Survivor and Supplemental Retirement Plan  Components
of net periodic pension benefit cost of the Company s unfunded, nonqualified benefit plan for executive officers and certain
key management employees are as follows: 

Postretirement Benefits  Components
of net periodic postretirement benefit cost for health insurance and life insurance benefits for retired OTP and corporate employees,
net of the effect of Medicare Part D Subsidy: 

12. Fair Value of Financial Instruments  

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate
the fair value of each class of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that value: 

Short-Term Debt  The carrying amount approximates
fair value because the debt obligations are short-term and the balances outstanding as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015
related to the Otter Tail Corporation Credit Agreement and the OTP Credit Agreement were subject to variable interest rates of
LIBOR plus 1.75% and LIBOR plus 1.25%, respectively, which approximate market rates. 

Long-Term Debt including Current Maturities  The
fair value of the Company's and OTP s long-term debt is estimated based on the current market indications of rates available
to the Company for the issuance of debt. The Company s long-term debt subject to variable interest rates approximates fair
value. The fair value measurements of the Company s long-term debt issues fall into level 2 of the fair value hierarchy set
forth in ASC 820. 

14. Income Tax Expense   Continuing Operations  

The following table provides a reconciliation of income tax
expense calculated at the net composite federal and state statutory rate on income from continuing operations before income taxes
and income tax expense for continuing operations reported on the Company s consolidated statements of income: 

The following table summarizes the activity related to our unrecognized
tax benefits: 

The balance of unrecognized tax benefits as of September 30,
2016 would reduce the Company s effective tax rate if recognized. The total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of September
30, 2016 is not expected to change significantly within the next 12 months. The Company classifies interest and penalties
on tax uncertainties as components of the provision for income taxes in its consolidated statement of income. There was no amount
accrued for interest on tax uncertainties as of September 30, 2016. 

The Company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated U.S. federal
income tax return and various state income tax returns. As of September 30, 2016, with limited exceptions, the Company is no longer
subject to examinations by taxing authorities for tax years prior to 2013 for federal income taxes and Minnesota and North Dakota
state income taxes. 

16. Discontinued Operations  

On April 30, 2015 the Company sold Foley Company (Foley),
its former water, wastewater, power and industrial construction contractor.  On February 28, 2015 the
Company sold the assets of AEV, Inc. its  former energy and electrical construction contractor .
 On February 8, 2013 the Company completed the sale of substantially all the assets of its former dock and boatlift company
and on November 30, 2012 the Company completed the sale of the assets of its former wind tower manufacturing business. The Company s
Construction and Wind Energy segments were eliminated as a result of the sales of Foley, AEV, Inc. and its former wind tower manufacturing
business. The financial position, results of operations and cash flows of Foley, AEV, Inc., the Company s former dock and
boatlift company and its former wind tower manufacturing business are reported as discontinued operations in the Company s
consolidated financial statements. Following are summary presentations of the results of discontinued operations: 

The above results for the nine months ended September 30, 2015
include net losses from operations of $4.1 million from Foley, $0.8 million from AEV, Inc. and $0.6 million, mainly related to
the settlement of a warranty claim in the second quarter of 2015, from the Company s former waterfront equipment manufacturer,
and net income of $0.2 million from the Company s former wind tower manufacturer related to a reduction in warranty reserves
for expired warranties. Foley and AEV, Inc. entered into fixed-price construction contracts. Revenues under these contracts were
recognized on a percentage-of-completion basis. The method used to determine the progress of completion was based on the ratio
of costs incurred to total estimated costs on construction projects. An increase in estimated costs on one large job in progress
at Foley in excess of previous period cost estimates resulted in pretax charges $4.4 million in the nine-month period ended September
30, 2015. 

Following are summary presentations of the major components
of assets and liabilities of discontinued operations as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

Included in current liabilities of discontinued operations are
warranty reserves. Details regarding the warranty reserves follow: 

The warranty reserve balances as of September 30, 2016 relate
entirely to products produced by the Company s former wind tower and dock and boatlift manufacturing companies. Certain products
sold by the companies carried one to fifteen year warranties.  Although the assets of these companies
have been sold and their operating results are reported under discontinued operations in the Company s consolidated statements
of income, the Company retains responsibility for warranty claims related to the products they produced prior to the sales of these
companies.  

Expenses associated with remediation activities of these companies
could be substantial. For wind towers, the potential exists for multiple claims based on one defect repeated throughout the production
process or for claims where the cost to repair or replace the defective part is highly disproportionate to the original cost of
the part. For example, if the Company is required to cover remediation expenses in addition to regular warranty coverage, the Company
could be required to accrue additional expenses and experience additional unplanned cash expenditures which could adversely affect

The following table summarizes the estimated impact of weather
changes on diluted earnings per share compared with sales under normal weather conditions and the third quarter of 2015: 

The $1.4 million decrease in retail revenue includes: 

A $3.8 million increase in retail revenue related to a 9.56% interim rate increase implemented in April 2016 in conjunction
with Otter Tail Power Company s (OTP's) 2016 general rate increase request in Minnesota.                                                                                                           

A $1.2 million increase in Environmental Cost Recovery (ECR) rider revenue due to the recovery of additional investment and
costs related to the operation of the air quality control system (AQCS) at Big Stone Plant that was placed in service in December
2015.                  

A $0.8 million increase in revenue related to increased kwh sales across all customer classes, offsetting the negative impact
of milder weather on kwh sales and revenue.                                                        

A $0.8 million increase in Conservation Improvement Program (CIP) cost recovery and incentive revenues.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       

A $0.2 million increase in Transmission Cost Recovery (TCR) and Renewable Resource Adjustment (RRA) rider revenues related
to increased investment in transmission plant and renewable energy resources.                                                                                          

more than offset by: 

A $5.3 million decrease in fuel and purchased power cost recovery revenues mainly due to a 48.3% decrease in kwhs purchased
partially offset by a 28.3% increase in generation at a lower fuel-cost-per-kwh than the cost of purchased power.                                                                                                                              

A $2.1 million reduction in interim rate revenues recorded to provide for an estimated refund related to a modification in
OTP s original request and other expected outcomes in the pending Minnesota general rate case.   

A $0.8 million decrease in revenues from reduced demand due to milder weather in the third quarter of 2016, evidenced by a
19.9% decrease in cooling degree days compared to the third quarter of 2015.   

Revenue from wholesale electric sales from company-owned generation
increased $1.3 million while fuel costs for wholesale generation increased $0.8 million, resulting in a $0.5 million increase in
wholesale revenue net of fuel costs. 

Other electric revenues increased $2.3 million as a result of: 

A $2.7 million increase in Midcontinent Independent System Operator, Inc. (MISO) transmission tariff revenues related to increased
investment in regional transmission lines and driven in part by returns on and recovery of Capacity Expansion 2020 (CapX2020) and
MISO-designated multi-value project (MVP) investment costs and operating expenses.                                                                                               

A $0.6 million increase in MISO network integration transmission service revenues as a result of a regional transmission cooperative
terminating its integrated transmission agreement with OTP and becoming a member the Southwest Power Pool (SPP) in 2016.                                                                                                                                     

A $0.2 million increase in steam sales from Big Stone Plant to a nearby ethanol plant as a result of Big Stone Plant being
fully operational in the third quarter of 2016 compared to operating in only August and September of 2015.                                                                                                                       

offset by: 

A $0.9 million decrease in revenue related to a reduction in work performed on projects for another regional transmission owner.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                

A $0.4 million reduction in integrated transmission agreement revenues from two regional transmission providers related to
the curtailment of services under an agreement with one provider and termination of an agreement with the other provider.   

Production fuel costs increased $3.7 million as a result of
a 40.5% increase in kwhs generated from our steam-powered and combustion turbine generators, related to Big Stone Plant and Coyote
Station being fully operational in the third quarter of 2016. In the third quarter of 2015, Big Stone Plant was down for an extended
maintenance outage and Coyote Station was operating at reduced load due to ongoing repairs related to a December 2014 boiler feed
pump failure and fire. 

The cost of purchased power to serve retail customers decreased
$7.3 million due to a 48.3% decrease in kwhs purchased partially offset by an 18.6% increase in the cost per kwh purchased. The
decrease in kwhs purchased was the result of increased availability and generation from company-owned resources. The increased
cost per kwh purchased is related to contractual prices being paid for purchased power under a long-term supply agreement. 

Electric operating and maintenance expenses increased $3.6 million
as a result of: 

A $1.2 million increase in MISO transmission service charges due to increased transmission investment by other MISO members.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            

A $0.9 million increase in operating supply and maintenance costs mainly related to increased generation at Coyote Station
and Big Stone Plant and increased expenditures for vegetation maintenance.                                                                                       

A $0.6 million increase in storm repair and other expenses mainly associated with excessive storm damage in OTP s Minnesota
service area in July of 2016.                                          

A $0.6 million increase in pollution control reagent costs at Big Stone Plant and Coyote Station related to compliance with
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) power plant emission regulations.                                                                                    

A $0.5 million increase in transmission expenses from the SPP as a result of a regional transmission cooperative terminating
its integrated transmission agreement with OTP and becoming a member of the SPP in 2016.                                                                                                     

A $0.2 million increase in CIP program expenditures.                                                                                                                                                                                    

offset by: 

A $0.5 million decrease in costs related to a reduction in work performed on projects for another regional transmission owner.   

Depreciation and amortization expense increased $2.2 million
mainly due to the Big Stone Plant AQCS being placed in service in December 2015. 

Manufacturing  

The $0.3 million decrease in revenues in our Manufacturing segment
includes the following: 

Revenues at BTD Manufacturing, Inc. (BTD) increased $1.6 million, including:   

o   A $3.7 million increase in revenues at BTD-Georgia as a result of BTD acquiring and operating the Georgia plant in September
2015, compared with three months of operations in the third quarter of 2016.   

offset by: 

o  A $2.1 million decrease in revenues at BTD s Minnesota and Illinois plants, mainly related to a decline in sales to manufacturers
of recreational and agricultural equipment and heavy machinery due to softness in end markets served by those manufacturers.   

Revenues at T.O. Plastics, Inc. (T.O. Plastics), our manufacturer of thermoformed plastic and horticultural products, decreased
$1.9 million, including a $1.2 million decrease in industrial market sales and a $0.6 million decrease in revenues from sales of
horticultural containers. The decrease in industrial market sales is primarily due to a continued decline in sales volumes to a
customer insourcing product into its own manufacturing facilities.   

The $0.3 million decrease in cost of products sold in our Manufacturing
segment includes the following: 

Cost of products sold at BTD increased $0.3 million. This includes a $4.0 million increase in cost of products sold at BTD-Georgia,
offset by a $3.7 million decrease in cost of products sold at BTD s other facilities. The $3.7 million decrease is related
to the decrease in sales.   

Cost of products sold at T.O. Plastics decreased $0.6 million as a result of the reduction in sales.   

Operating expenses at BTD increased $0.5 million, mainly in
the areas of labor and benefit costs and computer-related expenditures, and included a $0.2 million increase in operating expenses
at BTD-Georgia. 

Operating expenses at T.O. Plastics decreased $0.4 million as
a result of decreases in selling, benefits and administrative and general expenses. 

The $1.0 million increase in depreciation and amortization expenses
in our Manufacturing segment includes a $0.6 million increase at BTD-Georgia and a $0.5 million increase at BTD s Minnesota
facilities as a result of placing new assets in service in Minnesota in 2015 and 2016, offset by a $0.1 million decrease at T.O.
Plastics. 

Plastics  

The $4.7 million decrease in Plastics segment revenues is the
result of a 10.4% decrease in the price per pound of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe sold, while quarter over quarter sales volume
was essentially unchanged. The decline in sales price per pound is due to a continued softening in sales prices as a result of
lower raw material prices. Increased pipe sales in Colorado and Utah and the Midwest and South-Central regions of the United States
were mostly offset by decreased sales volumes in  

California, Minnesota and North Dakota. Lower material costs, which did not decline
as much as sales prices, resulted in a $2.7 million decrease in costs of product sold. The cost decrease in combination with
a $0.3 million decrease in operating expenses did not offset the impact of lower pipe prices, resulting in a $1.8 million decrease
in Plastics segment operating income. 

The PVC pipe industry is highly sensitive to commodity raw material
pricing volatility. Historically, when resin prices are rising or stable, margins and sales volume have been higher and when resin
prices are falling, sales volumes and margins have been lower. 

Corporate  

Corporate includes items such as corporate staff and overhead
costs, the results of our captive insurance company and other items excluded from the measurement of operating segment performance.
Corporate is not an operating segment. Rather it is added to operating segment totals to reconcile to totals on our consolidated
statements of income. 

Corporate operating expenses decreased $0.4
million between the quarters mainly related to decreases in insurance costs related to reduced claims at our captive
insurance company and reductions in accounting and legal fees, partially offset by an increase in employee benefit costs. 

Interest Charges  

The $0.3 million increase in interest charges in the three months
ended September 30, 2016 compared with the three months ended September 30, 2015 is related to an increase in the average level
of the Company s consolidated variable rate short-term and long-term debt outstanding between the quarters. 

Income Taxes   Continuing Operations 

Income tax expense - continuing operations decreased $1.4 million
in the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared with the three months ended September 30, 2015, mostly as a result of a $2.5
million reduction in income from continuing operations before income taxes. The following table provides a reconciliation of income
tax expense calculated at our net composite federal and state statutory rate on income from continuing operations before income
taxes and income tax expense for continuing operations reported on our consolidated statements of income for the three-month periods
ended September 30: 

Federal PTCs are recognized as wind energy is generated based
on a per kwh rate prescribed in applicable federal statutes. OTP s kwh generation from its wind turbines eligible for PTCs
was essentially the same in the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared with the three months ended September 30, 2015.
North Dakota wind energy credits are based on dollars invested in qualifying facilities and are being recognized on a straight-line
basis over 25 years. 

Discontinued Operations  

On April 30, 2015 we sold Foley Company (Foley), our former
water, wastewater, power and industrial construction contractor.  On February 28, 2015 we sold the assets
of AEV, Inc.  our former energy and electrical construction contractor .  On February 8,
2013 we completed the sale of substantially all the assets of our former dock and boatlift company and on November 30, 2012 we
completed the sale of the assets of our former wind tower manufacturing business. Our Construction and Wind Energy segments were
eliminated as a result of the sales of Foley, AEV, Inc. and our former wind tower manufacturing business. The financial position,
results of operations and cash flows of Foley, AEV, Inc., our former dock and boatlift company and our former wind tower manufacturing
business are reported as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements. Following are summary presentations
of the results of discontinued operations for the three-month periods ended September 30: 

C   omparison
of the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015   

Consolidated operating revenues were $606.9 million for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with $591.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Operating
income was $81.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with $79.5 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2015. The Company recorded diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $1.16 for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 compared to $1.15 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 and total diluted earnings per share
of $1.17 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $1.19 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

Amounts presented in the segment tables that follow for operating
revenues, cost of goods sold and other nonelectric operating expenses for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015
will not agree with amounts presented in the consolidated statements of income due to the elimination of intersegment transactions.
The amounts of intersegment eliminations by income statement line item are listed below: 

Electric  

The following table shows heating and cooling degree days as
a percent of normal: 

The following table summarizes the estimated impact of weather
changes on diluted earnings per share compared with sales under normal weather conditions and to the first nine months of 2015: 

The $2.1 million increase in retail revenue includes: 

A $6.9 million increase in retail revenue related to a 9.56% interim rate increase implemented in April 2016 in conjunction
with OTP's 2016 general rate increase request in Minnesota.   

A $3.2 million increase in ECR rider revenue due to the recovery of additional investment and costs related to the operation
of the AQCS at Big Stone Plant that was placed in service in December 2015.   

A $2.7 million increase in revenue related to an increase in retail kwh sales, mainly to pipeline customers.   

A $2.0 million increase in CIP cost recovery and incentive revenues.   

A $1.9 million increase in TCR rider revenues related to increased investment in transmission plant.   

A $0.3 million increase in RRA rider revenues.   

offset by: 

A $10.2 million decrease in fuel and purchased power cost recovery revenues mainly due to an 18.8% decrease in kwhs, purchased
partially offset by a 22.2% increase in generation at a lower fuel-cost-per-kwh than the cost of purchased power.   

A $2.4 million decrease in revenues related to decreased consumption due to milder weather in the first nine months of 2016,
evidenced by a 13.3% reduction in heating-degree days and 6.1% reduction in cooling-degree days compared to the first nine months
of 2015.   

A $2.3 million reduction in interim rate revenues recorded to provide for an estimated refund related to a modification in
OTP s original request and other expected outcomes in the pending Minnesota general rate case.   

Revenue from wholesale electric sales from company-owned generation
increased $1.8 million while fuel costs for wholesale generation increased $1.4 million, resulting in a $0.4 million increase in
wholesale revenue net of fuel costs as increased plant availability in 2016 has provided greater opportunity for OTP to respond
to market demand. 

Other electric revenues increased $4.8 million as a result
of: 

A $4.9 million increase in MISO transmission tariff revenues related to increased investment in regional transmission lines
and driven in part by returns on and recovery of CapX2020 and MISO designated MVP investment costs and operating expenses.   

A $0.7 million increase in steam sales to an ethanol plant near Big Stone Plant as a result of Big Stone Plant being fully
operational in the first nine months of 2016 compared to being down for maintenance from March through July of 2015.   

offset by: 

A $0.8 million decrease in revenue related to a reduction in work performed on projects for another regional transmission owner.   

Production fuel costs increased $10.6 million as a result of
a 33.2% increase in kwhs generated from our steam-powered and combustion turbine generators, mainly related to Big Stone Plant
being fully operational in the first nine months of 2016. In 2015 Big Stone Plant was off line for maintenance from March through
July. 

The cost of purchased power to serve retail customers decreased
$18.6 million due to an 18.8% decrease in kwhs purchased in combination with a 13.8% decrease in the cost per kwh purchased. Greater
availability of company-owned generation in 2016 reduced the need to purchase electricity to serve retail load. The decreased cost
per kwh purchased was driven by lower market demand mainly resulting from milder weather and lower wholesale energy prices in the
first nine months of 2016 compared with the first nine months of 2015. 

Electric operating and maintenance expenses increased $7.3 million
as a result of: 

$3.1 million in transmission expenses from the SPP beginning in 2016 as a result of a regional transmission cooperative terminating
its integrated transmission agreement with OTP and joining the SPP.   

A $1.5 million increase in pollution control reagent costs at Big Stone Plant and Coyote Station related to compliance with
EPA power plant emission regulations.   

A $1.3 million increase in MISO transmission service charges due to increased transmission investment by other MISO members.   

A $1.3 million increase in CIP program expenditures.   

A $0.7 million increase in storm repair expenses mainly associated with excessive storm damage in OTP's Minnesota service area
in July of 2016.   

A $0.6 million increase in operating supply expenses at Big Stone Plant and Coyote Station as generation at the plants increased
in 2016.   

$0.5 million in expenditures incurred in 2016 to resolve customer rate issues.   

offset by: 

A $1.0 million decrease in labor benefit costs related to a decrease in Corporate stock-based incentive expenses allocated
to OTP.   

A $0.4 million decrease in costs related to a reduction in work performed on projects for another regional transmission owner.   

A $0.3 million reduction in other benefit related expenses.   

Depreciation and amortization expense increased $6.9 million
mainly due to the AQCS at Big Stone Plant being placed in service in December 2015 along with increased investment in transmission
plant with the final phases of the Fargo-Monticello and Brookings-Southeast Twin Cities 345-kV transmission lines placed in service
near the end of the first quarter of 2015. 

The $0.5 million increase in property tax expense is related
to property additions in Minnesota and North Dakota in 2015. 

Manufacturing  

The $10.0 million increase in revenues in our Manufacturing
segment includes the following: 

Revenues at BTD increased $13.3 million, including:   

o   An $18.0 million increase in revenues at BTD-Georgia as a result of BTD acquiring and operating the Georgia plant in September
of 2015 compared to nine months of operations in 2016.   

o   A $5.5 million increase in revenues mainly related to the production of wind tower components at BTD s Illinois plant.   

offset by: 

o   A $10.0 million decrease in revenues related to lower sales to manufacturers of recreational and agricultural equipment due
to softness in end markets served by those manufacturers.   

o   A $0.2 million decrease in revenues from sales of scrap metal due to a reduction in scrap metal prices.   

Revenues at T.O. Plastics decreased $3.3 million due to a reduction in industrial market sales primarily as a result of a continued
decline in sales volumes to a customer insourcing product into its own manufacturing facilities.   

The $3.7 million increase in cost of products sold in our Manufacturing
segment includes the following: 

Cost of products sold at BTD increased $4.8 million. This includes a $16.2 million increase in cost of products sold at BTD-Georgia,
offset by an $11.4 million net decrease in cost of products sold at BTD s other facilities. The $11.4 million decrease
is related to the decrease in sales, partially offset by an increase in costs of products sold at BTD s Illinois plant as
a result of the increase in the production of wind tower components.   

Cost of products sold at T.O. Plastics decreased $1.1 million related to the decrease in sales.   

Gross margins at BTD were positively impacted in the first nine
months of 2016 by changes in customer product mix between periods. 

The $0.3 million increase in operating expenses in our Manufacturing
segment includes the following: 

Operating expenses at BTD increased $1.2 million due to nine months of operations at BTD-Georgia in 2016 compared to one month
in 2015.   

Operating expenses at T.O. Plastics decreased $0.9 million, primarily as a result of a $0.4 million decrease in selling expenses
and a $0.4 decrease in incentive benefits.   

The $3.7 million increase in depreciation and amortization expenses
in our Manufacturing segment includes a $2.3 million increase at BTD-Georgia and a $1.5 million increase at BTD s other plants
mainly as a result of placing new assets in service in Minnesota in 2015 and 2016. 

Plastics  

The $2.7 million decrease in Plastics segment revenues is the
result of a 12.5% decrease in the price per pound of pipe sold, partially offset by an 11.8% increase in pounds of pipe sold. The
decline in sales price per pound is due to softening sales prices as a result of lower raw material prices between the periods.
Increased pipe sales in the Midwest, South-Central and Western regions of the United States were mostly offset by decreased sales
volumes in Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota. Cost of products sold increased $0.3 million due to the increase in sales
volume, partly offset by a 10.3% decrease in the cost per pound of PVC pipe sold, as lower raw material prices did not decline
as much as sales prices. Lower margins have resulted in reduced incentive benefits, which is the main factor contributing to the
$0.4 million decrease in Plastics segment operating expenses. 

The PVC pipe industry is highly sensitive to commodity raw material
pricing volatility. Historically, when resin prices are rising or stable, margins and sales volume have been higher and when resin
prices are falling, sales volumes and margins have been lower. 

Corporate  

Corporate includes items such as corporate staff and overhead
costs, the results of our captive insurance company and other items excluded from the measurement of operating segment performance.
Corporate is not an operating segment. Rather it is added to operating segment totals to reconcile to totals on our consolidated
statements of income. 

Corporate operating expenses decreased $1.2 million as a result
of a $0.7 million decrease in expenditures for contracted services and a $0.5 million decrease in general insurance costs due to
a decrease in claims at our captive insurance company. 

Interest Charges  

The $0.8 million increase in interest charges in the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2015 is related to a $35 million increase in the average
level of the Company s consolidated variable rate short-term and long-term debt outstanding between the periods and a $0.2
million reduction in capitalized interest costs at OTP mainly related to the Big Stone Plant AQCS being placed in service in December
2015. 

Other Income  

The $1.0 million increase in other income includes $0.7 million
in benefit proceeds received from corporate-owned life insurance in the second quarter of 2016 and a $0.4 million increase in life
insurance policy cash surrender value increases in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with the nine months ended
September 30, 2015. 

Income Taxes   Continuing Operations 

Income tax expense - continuing operations increased $1.1 million
in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2015 as a result of a $2.6 million
increase in income from continuing operations before income taxes. The following table provides a reconciliation of income tax
expense calculated at our net composite federal and state statutory rate on income from continuing operations before income taxes
and income tax expense for continuing operations reported on our consolidated statements of income for the nine-month periods ended
September 30: 

Federal PTCs are recognized as wind energy is generated based
on a per kwh rate prescribed in applicable federal statutes. OTP s kwh generation from its wind turbines eligible for PTCs
decreased 2.3% in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with the nine months ended September 30, 2015. North Dakota
wind energy credits are based on dollars invested in qualifying facilities and are being recognized on a straight-line basis over
25 years. 

Discontinued Operations  

On April 30, 2015 we sold Foley, our former water, wastewater,
power and industrial construction contractor.  On February 28, 2015 we sold the assets of AEV, Inc.  our
former energy and electrical construction contractor, resulting in a first quarter 2015 net gain on the sale of $7.2 million .
 On February 8, 2013 we completed the sale of substantially all the assets of our former dock and boatlift company and on
November 30, 2012 we completed the sale of the assets of our former wind tower manufacturing business. Our Construction and Wind
Energy segments were eliminated as a result of the sales of Foley, AEV, Inc. and our former wind tower manufacturing business.
The financial position, results of operations and cash flows of Foley, AEV, Inc., our former dock and boatlift company and our
former wind tower manufacturing business are reported as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements. Following
are summary presentations of the results of discontinued operations for the nine-month periods ended September 30: 

The above results for the nine months ended September 30, 2016
include net income of $0.3 million from the Company s former wind tower manufacturer related to reductions in warranty reserves
for expired warranties and a net loss of $0.2 million to settle indemnification issues related to the former operations of Foley.
The above results for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 include net losses from operations of $4.1 million from Foley, $0.8
million from AEV, Inc. and 

$0.6 million from our former waterfront equipment manufacturer mainly related to the settlement of a
warranty claim in the second quarter of 2015 and net income of $0.2 million from our former wind tower manufacturer related to
a reduction in warranty reserves for expired warranties. Foley and AEV, Inc. entered into fixed-price construction contracts. Revenues
under these contracts were recognized on a percentage-of-completion basis. The method used to determine the percentage of completion
was based on the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs on construction projects in progress. In the first nine months
of 2015, an increase in estimated costs in excess of previous period cost estimates on one large job in progress at Foley resulted
in pretax charges of $4.4 million. Foley also recorded a $1.0 million goodwill impairment charge based on adjustments to its carrying
value in the first quarter of 2015. 

Financial Position  

The following table presents the status of our lines of credit
as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

We believe we have the necessary liquidity to effectively conduct
business operations for an extended period if needed. Our balance sheet is strong and we are in compliance with our debt covenants.
Financial flexibility is provided by operating cash flows, unused lines of credit, strong financial coverages, investment grade
credit ratings and alternative financing arrangements such as leasing. 

We believe our financial condition is strong and our cash, other
liquid assets, operating cash flows, existing lines of credit, access to capital markets and borrowing ability because of investment-grade
credit ratings, when taken together, provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements and future capital expenditures
related to expansion of existing businesses and development of new projects. On May 11, 2015 we filed a shelf registration statement
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) under which we may offer for sale, from time to time, either separately or together
in any combination, equity, debt or other securities described in the shelf registration statement, which expires on May 11, 2018.
On May 11, 2015, we entered into a Distribution Agreement with J.P. Morgan Securities LLC (JPMS) under which we may offer and sell
our common shares from time to time through JPMS, as our distribution agent, up to an aggregate sales price of $75 million
through an At-the-Market offering program. We sold 467,573 shares under this program in the third quarter of 2016 and paid commissions
to JPMS of $202,000. 

Equity or debt financing will be required in the period 2016
through 2020 given the expansion plans related to our Electric segment to fund construction of new rate base investments. Also,
such financing will be required should we decide to reduce borrowings under our lines of credit or refund or retire early any of
our presently outstanding debt, to complete acquisitions or for other corporate purposes. Our operating cash flows and access to
capital markets can be impacted by macroeconomic factors outside our control. In addition, our borrowing costs can be impacted
by changing interest rates on short-term and long-term debt and ratings assigned to us by independent rating agencies, which in
part are based on certain credit measures such as interest coverage and leverage ratios. 

The determination of the amount of future cash dividends to
be declared and paid will depend on, among other things, our financial condition, improvement in earnings per share, cash flows
from operations, the level of our capital expenditures and our future business prospects. As a result of certain statutory limitations
or regulatory or financing agreements, restrictions could occur on the amount of distributions allowed to be made by our subsidiaries.
See note 8 to the Company s consolidated financial statements for more information. The decision to declare a dividend is
reviewed quarterly by the board of directors. On January 28, 2016 our board of directors increased the quarterly dividend from
$0.3075 to $0.3125 per common share. 

Cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations
was $115.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with $81.8 million for the nine months ended September
30, 2015. The $33.3 million increase in cash provided by continuing operations between the periods includes: 

A $10.8 million increase in non-cash depreciation expense.   

A $10.7 million decrease in cash used for accounts payable at OTP, reflecting higher levels of payables in September 2016 for
coal deliveries and transmission services and the payment, in January 2015, of large billings for coal transportation, coal and
power purchased in December 2014.   

A $10.5 million increase in cash from reduced levels of receivables between the periods, including $5.6 million at BTD, $2.5
million at Vinyltech and $1.0 million at T.O. Plastics.   

A $4.0 million refund of 2015 estimated tax payments received in the first quarter of 2016, as a five-year extension of bonus
depreciation for income taxes, approved on December 18, 2015, resulted in the elimination of any federal income tax liability for
the Company in 2015.   

In continuing operations, net cash used in investing activities
was $123.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with $150.5 million for the nine months ended September
30, 2015. The $27.1 million decrease in cash used for investing activities includes: 

A $32.3 million decrease in cash used in acquisitions as we paid $30.8 million to acquire the assets of BTD-Georgia in September
2015 and received a purchase price adjustment of $1.5 million in June 2016.   

A $4.1 million decrease in cash used for investments, reflecting the deposit of $2.5 million in proceeds from the sale of the
assets of AEV, Inc. and Foley into escrow accounts and investments made by the Company s captive insurance company in the
first nine months of 2015, with no similar transactions in the first nine months of 2016.   

A $1.2 million increase in cash from the disposal of noncurrent assets mainly related to the release of $2.0 million in remaining
funds held in escrow accounts in the third quarter of 2016 related to the sales of AEV, Inc. and Foley, offset by a $0.8 million
decrease in investments sold at our captive insurance company between the periods.   

A $7.4 million decrease in capital expenditures in our Manufacturing segment as work on BTD s Minnesota expansion project
was winding down and nearing completion in the first half of 2016 compared to a high level of expenditures in the first nine months
of 2015.   

A $0.9 million decrease in capital expenditures in our PVC pipe companies.   

offset by: 

An $18.9 million increase in capital expenditures at OTP as work on the Big Stone South-Brookings and Big Stone South-Ellendale
345 kV transmission line projects ramped up in the first nine months of 2016 while work on the Big Stone Plant AQCS was winding
down in the first nine months of 2015.   

Investing activities of discontinued operations in the nine
months ended September 30, 2015 include $21.3 million in cash proceeds from the sale of the assets of AEV, Inc., and $11.4 million
from the sale of Foley stock, partially offset by $1.8 million in cash used in investing activities of discontinued operations,
mainly related to the purchase by AEV, Inc. of assets being leased under operating leases prior to the assets being sold. 

Net cash provided by financing activities of continuing operations
was $8.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared with $49.5 million for the nine months ended September
30, 2015. Financing activities in the first nine months of 2016 included $50 million in borrowings under a Term Loan Agreement
and $39.4 million in net proceeds from the issuance of stock under the Company s At-the-Market offering program and
its automatic dividend reinvestment and share purchase plan, offset by $44.3 million in cash used to pay down short-term borrowings
and checks written in excess of cash and $36.0 million in common stock dividend payments. The outstanding short-term borrowings
that were paid down were, in part, used to fund the expansion of BTD s Minnesota facilities in 2015 and the September 1,
2015 acquisition of BTD-Georgia. See note 6 to the Company s consolidated financial statements for further information on
stock issuances and retirements in the first nine months of 2016. 

Net cash provided by financing activities in the first nine
months of 2015 included $76.1 million in short-term borrowings used, in part, to fund capital expenditures, and $11.0 million in
net proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our various stock purchase and dividend reinvestment plans, offset by $34.6 million
in common stock dividend payments, $1.6 million in common stock retirement payments and $1.2 million used to reduce the balance
of checks written in excess of cash. 

CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS  

2016-2020 Capital Expenditures   

 The following table shows our 2015 capital expenditures and
2016 through 2020 capital expenditures and electric utility average rate base anticipated at year-end 2015: 

The capital expenditure plan for the 2016-2020 time period called
for $858 million based on the need for additional wind and solar in rate base and capital spending on a natural gas-fired plant
that is expected to replace Hoot Lake Plant when it is retired in 2021. Taking into account the increased capital expenditure plan
along with the impact of bonus depreciation for income taxes, our compounded annual growth rate in rate base is expected to be
8.0% through 2020, using 2014 as a base year. 

Execution on the currently anticipated electric utility capital
expenditure plan is expected to grow rate base and be a key driver in increasing utility earnings over the 2016 through 2020 timeframe. 

Contractual Obligations   

 Our contractual obligations reported in the table on page 50
of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased $92.7 million in the first nine months of
2016. Our other purchase obligations increased $85.5 million in 2017 and 2018 and $2.7 million in 2019, mainly as a result of additional
purchase obligations entered into in the first nine months of 2016 related to the construction of the Big Stone South-Ellendale
and Big Stone South-Brookings 345 kV transmission line MVPs. Our capacity and energy requirements obligations increased $2.7 million
in 2017 and 2018 and $0.8 million in 2019 as a result of entering into a capacity purchase agreement for the period of June 2017
through May 2019 in May of 2016. Our operating lease obligations increased $0.2 million in 2017 and 2018, $0.2 million in
2019 and 2020, and $0.6 million in the years beyond 2020 as a result of OTP entering into an agreement to lease rail cars for the
delivery of coal to Big Stone Plant through October of 2026. 

CAPITAL RESOURCES  

On May 11, 2015 we filed a shelf registration statement with
the SEC under which we may offer for sale, from time to time, either separately or together in any combination, equity, debt or
other securities described in the shelf registration statement, which expires on May 11, 2018. On May 11, 2015, we entered into
a Distribution Agreement with JPMS under which we may offer and sell our common shares from time to time through JPMS, as our distribution
agent, up to an aggregate sales price of $75 million through an At-the-Market offering program. We sold 467,573 shares under this
program in the third quarter of 2016 and paid commissions to JPMS of $202,000. 

Short-Term Debt   

The following table presents the status of our lines of credit
as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015: 

On October 29, 2012 we entered into a Third Amended and Restated
Credit Agreement (the Otter Tail Corporation Credit Agreement), which is an unsecured $150 million revolving credit facility that
may be increased to $250 million on the terms and subject to the conditions described in the Otter Tail Corporation Credit Agreement.
On October 31, 2016 the Otter Tail Corporation Credit Agreement was amended to extend its expiration date by one year from October
29, 2020 to October 29, 2021 and the unsecured revolving credit facility was reduced from $150 million to $130 million. We can
draw on this credit facility to refinance certain indebtedness and support our operations and the operations of certain of our
subsidiaries. Borrowings under the Otter Tail Corporation Credit Agreement bear interest at LIBOR plus 1.75%, subject to adjustment
based on our senior unsecured credit ratings. We are required to pay commitment fees based on the average daily unused amount available
to be drawn under the revolving credit facility. The Otter Tail Corporation Credit Agreement contains a number of restrictions
on us and the businesses of our wholly owned subsidiary, Varistar Corporation (Varistar) and its subsidiaries, including restrictions
on our and their ability to merge, sell assets, make investments, create or incur liens on assets, guarantee the obligations of
certain other parties and engage in transactions with related parties. The Otter Tail Corporation Credit Agreement also contains
affirmative covenants and events of default, and financial covenants as described below under the heading  Financial Covenants. 
The Otter Tail Corporation Credit Agreement does not include provisions for the termination of the agreement or the acceleration
of repayment of amounts outstanding due to changes in our credit ratings. Our obligations under the Otter Tail Corporation Credit
Agreement are guaranteed by certain of our subsidiaries. Outstanding letters of credit issued by us under the Otter Tail Corporation
Credit Agreement can reduce the amount available for borrowing under the line by up to $40 million. 

On October 29, 2012 OTP entered into a Second Amended and Restated
Credit Agreement (the OTP Credit Agreement), providing for an unsecured $170 million revolving credit facility that may be increased
to $250 million on the terms and subject to the conditions described in the OTP Credit Agreement. On October 31, 2016 the OTP Credit
Agreement was amended to extend its expiration date by one year from October 29, 2020 to October 29, 2021. OTP can draw on this
credit facility to support the working capital needs and other capital requirements of its operations, including letters of credit
in an aggregate amount not to exceed $50 million outstanding at any time. Borrowings under this line of credit bear interest at
LIBOR plus 1.25%, subject to adjustment based on the ratings of OTP s senior unsecured debt. OTP is required to pay commitment
fees based on the average daily unused amount available to be drawn under the revolving credit facility. The OTP Credit Agreement
contains a number of restrictions on the business of OTP, including restrictions on its ability to merge, sell assets, make investments,
create or incur liens on assets, guarantee the obligations of any other party, and engage in transactions with related parties.
The OTP Credit Agreement also contains affirmative covenants and events of default, and financial covenants as described below
under the heading  Financial Covenants.  The OTP Credit Agreement does not include provisions for the termination of
the agreement or the acceleration of repayment of amounts outstanding due to changes in OTP s credit ratings. OTP s
obligations under the OTP Credit Agreement are not guaranteed by any other party. 

Long-Term Debt    

2016 Note Purchase Agreement  On September 23, 2016
we entered into a Note Purchase Agreement (the 2016 Note Purchase Agreement) with the purchasers named therein, pursuant to which
we have agreed to issue to the purchasers, in a private placement transaction, $80 million aggregate principal amount of our 3.55%
Guaranteed Senior Notes due December 15, 2026 (the 2026 Notes). Our obligations under the 2016 Note Purchase Agreement and the
2026 Notes will be guaranteed by our Material Subsidiaries (as defined in the 2016 Note Purchase Agreement, but specifically excluding
OTP). The 2026 Notes are expected to be issued on December 13, 2016, subject to the satisfaction of certain customary conditions
to closing. 

We may prepay all or any part of the 2026 Notes (in an amount
not less than 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2026 Notes then outstanding in the case of a partial prepayment) at
100% of the principal amount prepaid, together with unpaid accrued interest and a make-whole amount; provided that if no default
or event of default exists under the 2016 Note Purchase Agreement, any optional prepayment made by us of all of the 2026 Notes
on or after September 15, 2026 will be made without any make-whole amount. We are required to offer to prepay all of the outstanding
2026 Notes at 100% of the principal amount together with unpaid accrued interest in the event of a Change of Control (as defined
in the 2016 Note Purchase Agreement) of the Company. In addition, if we and our Material Subsidiaries sell a  substantial
part  of our or their assets and use the proceeds to prepay or retire senior Interest-bearing Debt (as defined in the 2016
Note Purchase Agreement) of the Company and/or a Material Subsidiary in accordance with the terms of the 2016 Note Purchase Agreement,
we are required to offer to prepay a Ratable Portion (as defined in the 2016 Note Purchase Agreement) of the 2026 Notes held by
each holder of the 2026 Notes. 

The 2016 Note Purchase Agreement contains a number of restrictions
on the business of the Company and the Material Subsidiaries that became effective on execution of the 2016 Note Purchase Agreement.
These include restrictions on the Company s and the Material Subsidiaries  abilities to merge, sell assets, create
or incur liens on assets, guarantee the obligations of any other party, engage in transactions with related parties, redeem or
pay dividends on the Company s and the Material Subsidiaries  shares of capital stock, and make investments. The 2016
Note Purchase Agreement also contains other  

negative covenants and events of default, as well as certain financial covenants as
described below under the heading  Financial Covenants.  The 2016 Note Purchase Agreement does not include provisions
for the termination of the agreement or the acceleration of repayment of amounts outstanding due to changes in the Company s
or the Material Subsidiaries  credit ratings. 

We intend to use the proceeds of the 2026 Notes to repay existing
debt, including the remaining $52,330,000 of our 9.000% Senior Notes due December 15, 2016, and for general corporate purposes. 

Term Loan Agreement  On February 5, 2016 we entered
into a Term Loan Agreement (the Term Loan Agreement) with the Banks named therein, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (JPMorgan), as administrative
agent, and JPMS, as Lead Arranger and Book Runner. The Term Loan Agreement provides for an unsecured term loan with an aggregate
commitment of $50 million that we may use for purposes of funding working capital, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes
of the Company and certain of our subsidiaries. Under the Term Loan Agreement, we may, on up to two occasions, enter into additional
tranches of term loans in minimum increments of $10 million, subject to the consent of the lenders and so long as the aggregate
amount of outstanding term loans does not exceed $100 million at any time. Borrowings under the Term Loan Agreement will bear interest
at either (1) LIBOR plus 0.90% or (2) the greater of (a) the Prime Rate, (b) the Federal Reserve Bank of New York Rate plus 0.50%
and (c) LIBOR multiplied by the Statutory Reserve Rate plus 1%. The applicable interest rate will depend on our election of whether
to make the advance a LIBOR advance. The Term Loan Agreement terminates on February 5, 2018. 

On February 5, 2016 we borrowed $50 million under the Term Loan
Agreement at an interest rate based on the 30 day LIBOR plus 90 basis points and used the proceeds to pay down borrowings under
the Otter Tail Corporation Credit Agreement that were used to fund the expansion of BTD s Minnesota facilities in 2015 and
to fund the September 1, 2015 acquisition of BTD-Georgia. 

The Term Loan Agreement contains a number of restrictions on
us, Varistar and certain subsidiaries of Varistar, including restrictions on our and their ability to merge, sell assets, make
investments, create or incur liens on assets, guarantee the obligations of any other party and engage in transactions with related
parties. The Term Loan Agreement also contains affirmative covenants and events of default, as well as certain financial covenants
as described below under the heading  Financial Covenants.  The Term Loan Agreement does not include provisions for
the termination of the agreement or the acceleration of repayment of amounts outstanding due to changes in our credit ratings.
Our obligations under the Term Loan Agreement are guaranteed by Varistar and certain of its subsidiaries. 

2013 Note Purchase Agreement  On August 14, 2013
OTP entered into a Note Purchase Agreement (the 2013 Note Purchase Agreement) with the Purchasers named therein, pursuant to which
OTP agreed to issue to the Purchasers, in a private placement transaction, $60 million aggregate principal amount of OTP s
4.68% Series A Senior Unsecured Notes due February 27, 2029 (the Series A Notes) and $90 million aggregate principal amount of
OTP s 5.47% Series B Senior Unsecured Notes due February 27, 2044 (the Series B Notes and, together with the Series A Notes,
the Notes). On February 27, 2014 OTP issued all $150 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes. OTP used a portion of the
proceeds of the Notes to retire its $40.9 million term loan under a Credit Agreement with JPMorgan and to repay $82.5 million of
short-term debt then outstanding under the OTP Credit Agreement. Remaining proceeds of the Notes were used to fund OTP construction
program expenditures. 

The 2013 Note Purchase Agreement states that OTP may prepay
all or any part of the Notes (in an amount not less than 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding in
the case of a partial prepayment) at 100% of the principal amount prepaid, together with accrued interest and a make-whole amount,
provided that if no default or event of default under the 2013 Note Purchase Agreement exists, any optional prepayment made by
OTP of (i) all of the Series A Notes then outstanding on or after November 27, 2028 or (ii) all of the Series B Notes then outstanding
on or after November 27, 2043, will be made at 100% of the principal prepaid but without any make-whole amount. In addition, the
2013 Note Purchase Agreement states OTP must offer to prepay all of the outstanding Notes at 100% of the principal amount together
with unpaid accrued interest in the event of a change of control of OTP. 

The 2013 Note Purchase Agreement contains a number of restrictions
on the business of OTP, including restrictions on OTP s ability to merge, sell assets, create or incur liens on assets, guarantee
the obligations of any other party, and engage in transactions with related parties. The 2013 Note Purchase Agreement also contains
affirmative covenants and events of default, as well as certain financial covenants as described below under the heading  Financial
Covenants.  The 2013 Note Purchase Agreement does not include provisions for the termination of the agreement or the acceleration
of repayment of amounts outstanding due to changes in OTP s credit ratings. The 2013 Note Purchase Agreement includes a  most
favored lender  provision generally requiring that in the event OTP s existing credit agreement or any renewal, extension
or replacement thereof, at any time contains any financial covenant or other provision providing for limitations on interest expense
and such a covenant is not contained in the 2013 Note Purchase Agreement under substantially similar terms or would be more beneficial
to the holders of the Notes than any analogous provision contained in the 2013 Note Purchase Agreement (an  Additional  

Covenant ),
then unless waived by the Required Holders (as defined in the 2013 Note Purchase Agreement), the Additional Covenant will be deemed
to be incorporated into the 2013 Note Purchase Agreement. The 2013 Note Purchase Agreement also provides for the amendment, modification
or deletion of an Additional Covenant if such Additional Covenant is amended or modified under or deleted from the OTP credit agreement,
provided that no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing. 

2007 and 2011 Note Purchase Agreements  On December
1, 2011, OTP issued $140 million aggregate principal amount of its 4.63% Senior Unsecured Notes due December 1, 2021 pursuant to
a Note Purchase Agreement dated as of July 29, 2011 (2011 Note Purchase Agreement). OTP also has outstanding its $155 million senior
unsecured notes issued in four series consisting of $33 million aggregate principal amount of 5.95% Senior Unsecured Notes, Series
A, due 2017; $30 million aggregate principal amount of 6.15% Senior Unsecured Notes, Series B, due 2022; $42 million aggregate
principal amount of 6.37% Senior Unsecured Notes, Series C, due 2027; and $50 million aggregate principal amount of 6.47% Senior
Unsecured Notes, Series D, due 2037 (collectively, the 2007 Notes). The 2007 Notes were issued pursuant to a Note Purchase Agreement
dated as of August 20, 2007 (the 2007 Note Purchase Agreement). 

The 2011 Note Purchase Agreement and the 2007 Note Purchase
Agreement each states that OTP may prepay all or any part of the notes issued thereunder (in an amount not less than 10% of the
aggregate principal amount of the notes then outstanding in the case of a partial prepayment) at 100% of the principal amount prepaid,
together with accrued interest and a make-whole amount. The 2011 Note Purchase Agreement states in the event of a transfer of utility
assets put event, the noteholders thereunder have the right to require OTP to repurchase the notes held by them in full, together
with accrued interest and a make-whole amount, on the terms and conditions specified in the 2011 Note Purchase Agreement. The 2011
Note Purchase Agreement and the 2007 Note Purchase Agreement each also states that OTP must offer to prepay all of the outstanding
notes issued thereunder at 100% of the principal amount together with unpaid accrued interest in the event of a change of control
of OTP. The note purchase agreements contain a number of restrictions on OTP, including restrictions on OTP s ability to
merge, sell assets, create or incur liens on assets, guarantee the obligations of any other party, and engage in transactions with
related parties. The note purchase agreements also include affirmative covenants and events of default, and certain financial covenants
as described below under the heading  Financial Covenants.  

Financial Covenants  We were in compliance with
the financial covenants in our debt agreements as of September 30, 2016. 

No Credit or Note Purchase Agreement contains any provisions
that would trigger an acceleration of the related debt as a result of changes in the credit rating levels assigned to the related
obligor by rating agencies. 

Our borrowing agreements are subject to certain financial covenants.
Specifically: 

Under the Otter Tail Corporation Credit Agreement, the Term Loan Agreement and the 2016 Note Purchase Agreement, we may not
permit the ratio of our Interest-bearing Debt to Total Capitalization to be greater than 0.60 to 1.00 or permit our Interest and
Dividend Coverage Ratio to be less than 1.50 to 1.00 (each measured on a consolidated basis). As of September 30, 2016 our Interest
and Dividend Coverage Ratio calculated under the requirements of the Otter Tail Corporation Credit Agreement, the Term Loan Agreement
and the 2016 Note Purchase Agreement was 3.65 to 1.00.   

Under the 2016 Note Purchase Agreement, we may not permit our Priority Indebtedness to exceed 10% of our Total Capitalization   

Under the OTP Credit Agreement, OTP may not permit the ratio of its Interest-bearing Debt to Total Capitalization to be greater
than 0.60 to 1.00.   

Under the  2007 Note Purchase Agreement and 2011 Note Purchase Agreement, OTP may not permit the
ratio of its Consolidated Debt  to Total Capitalization to be greater than 0.60 to 1.00 or permit its Interest and Dividend
Coverage Ratio to be less than 1.50 to 1.00, in each case as provided in the related borrowing agreement, and  OTP
may not permit its Priority Debt to  exceed 20% of its Total Capitalization, as provided in the related agreement. As of
September 30, 2016 OTP s Interest and Dividend Coverage Ratio and Interest Charges Coverage Ratio, calculated under the requirements
of the  2007 Note Purchase Agreement and 2011 Note Purchase Agreement,  was 3.64 to 1.00.   

Under the 2013 Note Purchase Agreement, OTP may not permit its Interest-bearing Debt to exceed 60% of Total Capitalization
and may not permit its Priority Indebtedness to exceed 20% of its Total Capitalization, each as provided in the 2013 Note Purchase
Agreement.   

As of September 30, 2016 our ratio of interest-bearing debt
to total capitalization was 0.47 to 1.00 on a consolidated basis and 0.47 to 1.00 for OTP. 

OFF-BALANCE-SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  

We and our subsidiary companies have outstanding letters of
credit totaling $4.8 million, but our line of credit borrowing limits are only restricted by $50,000 in outstanding letters of
credit. We do not have any other off-balance-sheet arrangements or any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial
partnerships. These entities are often referred to as structured finance special purpose entities or variable interest entities,
which are established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance-sheet arrangements or for other contractually narrow or limited
purposes. We are not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had such relationships. 

2016 BUSINESS OUTLOOK  

We are reaffirming our consolidated diluted earnings per share
guidance for 2016 to be in the range of $1.50 to $1.65. This guidance reflects the current mix of businesses we own, considers
the cyclical nature of some of our businesses, and reflects current regulatory factors and economic challenges facing our Electric,
Manufacturing and Plastics segments and strategies for improving future operating results. We expect capital expenditures for 2016
to be $159 million compared with $160 million in capital expenditures in 2015. Major projects in our planned expenditures for 2016
include investments in two large transmission line projects for the Electric segment, which positively impact earnings by providing
an immediate return on invested funds through rider recovery mechanisms. 

Segment components of our 2016 earnings per share initial and
revised guidance range compared with 2015 actual earnings are as follows: 

Contributing to our earnings guidance for 2016 are the following
items: 

We now expect 2016 Electric segment net income to be comparable with 2015 segment net income based on:   

o   Normalized weather for the remainder of 2016. Mild weather in the first nine months of 2016 has had a negative impact on diluted
earnings per share of approximately $0.05 compared to our original 2016 expected earnings based on normal temperatures and $0.04
compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015.   

o   Constructive outcome of the rate case filed in Minnesota in February 2016. We are currently receiving revenues under interim
rates (subject to refund) related to this rate case. The Minnesota Public Utilities Commission determines our rates. Our ability
to obtain final rates similar to interim rates and reasonable rates of return depends on regulatory action under applicable statutes
and regulations. We cannot provide assurance our interim rates will become final and that our revised 10.05% requested return on
equity will ultimately be approved. Through September of 2016, OTP revenue has increased $4.6 million as a result of the interim
rate increase, which includes $6.9 million billed and accrued under interim rates net of a $2.3 million provision for
an estimated refund related to a modification in OTP s original request and other expected outcomes in the rate case. Compared
to our original 2016 expected earnings, the refund provision has had a negative impact on diluted earnings per share of approximately
$0.04 through September 30, 2016 and projected to be $0.06 by year-end 2016.   

o   Rider recovery increases, including environmental riders in Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota related to the Big Stone
AQCS environmental upgrades and transmission riders related to the Electric segment s continuing investments in its share
of the MISO-designated MVPs in South Dakota.   

o   Meeting forecasted sales to pipeline and commercial customers.   

o   A decrease in pension costs as a result of an increase in the discount rate from 4.35% to 4.76%.   

offset by:  

o   The effect of the 2015 adoption of bonus depreciation for income taxes reducing projected earnings from Electric segment operations
by $0.06 per share in 2016.   

o   Higher depreciation and property tax expenses due to large capital projects being put into service.   

o   Higher short-term interest costs as major construction projects continue to be funded.   

o   Increased operating expenses associated with reagents.   

o   Increased transmission expenses associated with termination of historic integrated transmission agreements.   

o   Higher post-retirement and post-employment medical costs than initially expected for 2016 due to changes in actuarial estimates
and increased claims in 2016.   

We are increasing our guidance for 2016 net income from our Manufacturing segment based on positive results through the first
nine months of the year driven by improved productivity, despite softening end markets, and continued focus on improved productivity
and cost reductions for the remainder of the year.   

In spite of softening end markets, we expect 2016 net income from our Manufacturing segment to increase over 2015 by $3.0 million
due to:   

o   Increased sales volume at BTD as a result of having BTD-Georgia in place for a full year. Full year sales for BTD-Georgia are
estimated to be $25 million compared with original expectations of $33 million. The decline is due to continued softness in end
markets served by the BTD-Georgia location.   

o   Improved margins on product mix that occurred in the second quarter and improved margins on parts and tooling sales
                                                                                                                               driven by improved productivity as a result of lower expediting costs, costs of quality and maintenance expenses in our
                                                                                                                               Illinois
                                                                                                                               and Minnesota plants.   

offset by: 

o   An expected decline in revenue, excluding the full year impact of BTD-Georgia revenues, of approximately 4%, compared with
an original growth expectation of 7%. This change is due to challenging market conditions impacting end markets served by BTD,
which has significant exposure to agriculture, oil and gas and recreational vehicle end markets. All of these end markets are forecasted
to be down in 2016 compared to 2015.   

o   Continued challenges of on time deliveries, low productivity and end market softness at BTD-Georgia.   

o   Higher facility costs associated with BTD s expansion of its square footage at its Minnesota plants.   

o   A decrease in earnings from T.O. Plastics mainly driven by an expected decrease in operating margins due to a shift in product
mix relating to a customer bringing a product back into its own manufacturing facilities.   

o   Backlog for the manufacturing companies of approximately $42 million for 2016 compared with $45 million one year ago.   

We are maintaining our August guidance for 2016 net income from our Plastics segment. Net income for 2016 from this segment
is expected to be down from 2015 with lower expected operating margins due to tighter spreads between raw material costs and sales
prices, along with higher labor and freight costs.   

We continue to expect lower corporate costs than originally estimated for 2016 due to continued cost reduction efforts.   

Critical Accounting Policies Involving
Significant Estimates  

The discussion and analysis of the financial statements and
results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires
management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and
related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. 

We use estimates based on the best
information available in recording transactions and balances resulting from business operations. Estimates are used for such items
as depreciable lives, asset impairment evaluations, tax provisions, collectability of trade accounts receivable, self-insurance
programs, unbilled electric revenues, warranty reserves and actuarially determined benefits costs and liabilities. As better information
becomes available or actual amounts are known, estimates are revised. Operating results can be affected by revised estimates. Actual
results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Management has discussed the application of
these critical accounting policies and the development of these estimates with the Audit Committee of the board of directors.  A
discussion of critical accounting policies is included under the caption  Critical Accounting Policies Involving Significant
Estimates  on pages 56 through 59 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. There were no material
changes in critical accounting policies or estimates during the quarter ended September 30, 2016. 

Forward Looking Information - Safe Harbor Statement Under
the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995  

In connection with the  safe harbor  provisions of
the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the Act), we have filed cautionary statements identifying important factors
that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those discussed in forward-looking statements made by or on behalf
of the Company. When used in this Form 10-Q and in future filings by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in
our press releases and in oral statements, words such as  may ,  will ,  expect ,  anticipate ,
 continue ,  estimate ,  project ,  believes  or similar expressions are intended to identify
forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Act and are included, along with this statement, for purposes of complying
with the safe harbor provision of the Act. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may
differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements due to, among other factors, the risks and uncertainties
described in the section entitled  Risk Factors  in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2015, as well as the various factors described below: 

Federal and state environmental regulation could require us to incur substantial
capital expenditures and increased operating costs.    

Volatile financial markets and changes in our debt ratings could restrict our ability
to access capital and could increase borrowing costs and pension plan and postretirement health care expenses.    

We rely on access to both short- and long-term capital markets as a source of liquidity
for capital requirements not satisfied by cash flows from operations. If we are not able to access capital at competitive rates,
our ability to implement our business plans may be adversely affected.    

Disruptions, uncertainty or volatility in the financial markets can also adversely
impact our results of operations, the ability of our customers to finance purchases of goods and services, and our financial condition,
as well as exert downward pressure on stock prices and/or limit our ability to sustain our current common stock dividend level.    

We made a $10.0 million discretionary contribution to our defined benefit pension
plan in January 2016. We could be required to contribute additional capital to the pension plan in the future if the market value
of pension plan assets significantly declines, plan assets do not earn in line with our long-term rate of return assumptions or
relief under the Pension Protection Act is no longer granted.    

Any significant impairment of our goodwill would cause a decrease in our asset
values and a reduction in our net operating income.    

Declines in projected operating cash flows at any of our reporting units may result
in goodwill impairments that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial position, as well as financing agreement
covenants.     

The inability of our subsidiaries to provide sufficient earnings and cash flows
to allow us to meet our financial obligations and debt covenants and pay dividends to our shareholders could have an adverse effect
on us.    

We rely on our information systems to conduct our business and failure to protect
these systems against security breaches or cyber-attacks could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Additionally,
if these systems fail or become unavailable for any significant period of time, our business could be harmed.    

Economic conditions could negatively impact our businesses.    

If we are unable to achieve the organic growth we expect, our financial performance
may be adversely affected.    

Our plans to grow and realign our business mix through capital projects, acquisitions
and dispositions may not be successful, which could result in poor financial performance.    

We may, from time to time, sell assets to provide capital to fund investments in
our electric utility business or for other corporate purposes, which could result in the recognition of a loss on the sale of any
assets sold and other potential liabilities. The sale of any of our businesses could expose us to additional risks associated with
indemnification obligations under the applicable sales agreements and any related disputes.    

Significant warranty claims and remediation costs in excess of amounts normally
reserved for such items could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.     

We are subject to risks associated with energy markets.    

We are subject to risks and uncertainties related to the timing and recovery of
deferred tax assets which could have a negative impact on our net income in future periods.     

We may experience fluctuations in revenues and expenses related to our electric
operations, which may cause our financial results to fluctuate and could impair our ability to make distributions to our shareholders
or scheduled payments on our debt obligations, or to meet covenants under our borrowing agreements.     

Actions by the regulators of our electric operations could result in rate reductions,
lower revenues and earnings or delays in recovering capital expenditures.    

OTP s operations are subject to an extensive legal and regulatory framework
under federal and state laws as well as regulations imposed by other organizations that may have a negative impact on our business
and results of operations.    

OTP s electric generating facilities are subject to operational risks that
could result in unscheduled plant outages, unanticipated operation and maintenance expenses and increased power purchase costs.    

Changes to regulation of generating plant emissions, including but not limited
to carbon dioxide emissions, could affect our operating costs and the costs of supplying electricity to our customers.    

Competition from foreign and domestic manufacturers, the price and availability
of raw materials, prices and supply of scrap or recyclable material and general economic conditions could affect the revenues and
earnings of our manufacturing businesses.    

Our plastics operations are highly dependent on a limited number of vendors for
PVC resin and a limited supply of resin. The loss of a key vendor, or any interruption or delay in the supply of PVC resin, could
result in reduced sales or increased costs for this segment.     

We compete against a large number of other manufacturers of PVC pipe and manufacturers
of alternative products. Customers may not distinguish the pipe companies  products from those of our competitors.     

Changes in PVC resin prices can negatively impact PVC pipe prices, profit margins
on PVC pipe sales and the value of PVC pipe held in inventory.    

Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market
Risk  

At September 30, 2016 we had exposure to market risk associated
with interest rates because we had $50 million outstanding subject to a variable interest rate that is indexed to 30 day LIBOR
plus 90 basis points under the Term Loan Agreement that terminates on February 5, 2018. OTP had $37.2 million in short-term debt
outstanding subject to variable interest rates indexed to LIBOR plus 1.25% under its $170 million revolving credit facility. 

All of our remaining consolidated long-term debt outstanding
on September 30, 2016 has fixed interest rates. We manage our interest rate risk through the issuance of fixed-rate debt with varying
maturities, through economic refunding of debt through optional refundings, limiting the amount of variable interest rate debt,
and the utilization of short-term borrowings to allow flexibility in the timing and placement of long-term debt. 

We have not used interest rate swaps to manage net exposure
to interest rate changes related to our portfolio of borrowings. We maintain a ratio of fixed-rate debt to total debt within a
certain range. It is our policy to enter into interest rate transactions and other financial instruments only to the extent considered
necessary to meet our stated objectives. We do not enter into interest rate transactions for speculative or trading purposes. 

The companies in our Manufacturing segment are exposed to market
risk related to changes in commodity prices for steel, aluminum and polystyrene (PS) and other plastics resins. The price and availability
of these raw materials could affect the revenues and earnings of our Manufacturing segment. 

The plastics companies are exposed to market risk related to
changes in commodity prices for PVC resins, the raw material used to manufacture PVC pipe. The PVC pipe industry is highly sensitive
to commodity raw material pricing volatility. Historically, when resin prices are rising or stable, sales volume has been higher
and when resin prices are falling, sales volume has been lower. Operating income may decline when the supply of PVC pipe increases
faster than demand. Due to the commodity nature of PVC resin and the dynamic supply and demand factors worldwide, it is very difficult
to predict gross margin percentages or to assume that historical trends will continue. 

Item 4.  Controls and Procedures  

Under the supervision and with the participation of company
management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and
operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (the Exchange Act)) as of September 30, 2016, the end of the period covered by this report. Based on that evaluation, our
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of
September 30, 2016. 

During the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2016, there were
no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that have materially
affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 

PART II. OTHER INFORMATION  

Item 1.  Legal Proceedings  

We are subject of various pending or threatened legal actions
and proceedings in the ordinary course of our business. Such matters are subject to many uncertainties and to outcomes that are
not predictable with assurance. We record a liability in our consolidated financial statements for costs related to claims, including
future legal costs, settlements and judgments, where we have assessed that a loss is probable and an amount can be reasonably estimated.
We believe the final resolution of currently pending or threatened legal actions and proceedings, either individually or in the
aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows,
excluding any liability for RSG charges described in Note 9 to the Company s consolidated financial statements for which
an estimate cannot be made at this time. 

Item 1A.  Risk Factors  

There has been no material change in the risk factors set forth
under Part I, Item 1A,  Risk Factors  on pages 26 through 32 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December
31, 2015.

ARTICLE I.   INTRODUCTION  

Section 1.01   Purpose .  The
purpose of the Plan is to provide employees of the Company and certain related corporations with an opportunity to share in the

to which shares of Company Common Stock would be converted into cash, securities or other property, other than a merger of the
Company in which shareholders of the Company immediately prior to the merger have substantially the same proportionate ownership
of stock in the surviving corporation immediately after the merger; (ii) any sale, exchange or other transfer (in one transaction
or a series of related transactions) of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company; or (iii) any plan of liquidation

stock of the Company or of all Affiliates. 

Section 2.04   Voluntary Participation .  Participation
in the Plan on the part of a Participant is voluntary and such participation is not a condition of employment nor does participation
in the Plan entitle a Participant to be retained as an employee. 

ARTICLE III.   PAYROLL DEDUCTIONS

Section 3.01   Deduction from
Pay .  The form described in Section 2.02 of the Plan will permit a Participant to elect payroll deductions of any
multiple of $1 but not less than $10 or more than $2,000 per month of such Participant s Current Compensation during such
Purchase Period, subject to such other limitations as the Committee in its sole discretion may impose.  A Participant

Participant may not make any payment into the Stock Purchase Account other than the payroll deductions made pursuant to the Plan. 

ARTICLE IV.   RIGHT TO PURCHASE
SHARES

Participant will have the right to purchase on the last business day of the Purchase Period all, but not less than all, of the
number of whole and fractional shares, computed to three decimal places, of Common Stock that can be purchased at the price specified
in Section 4.02 of the Plan with the entire credit balance in the Participant s Stock Purchase Account, subject to the limitations
that (a) no more than 2,000 shares of Common Stock may be purchased under the Plan by any one Participant for a given Purchase
Period, and (b) in accordance with Section 423(b)(8) of the Code, no more than $25,000 in Fair Market Value (determined at the
beginning of each Purchase Period) of Common Stock and other stock may be purchased under the Plan and all other employee stock
purchase plans (if any) of the Company and the Affiliates by any one Participant for any calendar year.  If the purchases
for all Participants for any Purchase Period would otherwise cause the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock to be sold under
the Plan to exceed the number specified in Section 10.04 of the Plan, each Participant shall be allocated a pro rata portion of
the Common Stock to be sold for such Purchase Period. 

Section 4.02   Purchase Price .  The
purchase price for any Purchase Period shall be that price as announced by the Committee prior to the first business day of that
Purchase Period, which price may, in the discretion of the Committee, be a price which is not fixed or determinable as of the first
business day of that Purchase Period; provided, however, that in no event shall the purchase price for any Purchase Period be less
than the lesser of (a) 85% of the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on the first business day of that Purchase Period or (b)
85% of the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on the last business day of that Purchase Period, in each case rounded up to the
next higher full cent. 

ARTICLE V.   EXERCISE OF RIGHT  

Section 5.01   Purchase of Stock .  On
the last business day of a Purchase Period, the entire credit balance in each Participant s Stock Purchase Account will be
used to purchase the number of whole shares and fractional shares, computed to three decimal places, of Common Stock purchasable
with such amount (subject to the limitations of Section 4.01 of the Plan), unless the Participant has filed with the Company, in
advance of that date and subject to such terms and conditions as the Committee in its sole discretion may impose, a form provided
by the Company which requests the distribution of the entire credit balance in cash (or pursuant to such other procedures established
by the Committee from time to time). 

Section 5.02   Notice of Acceleration
Date .  The Company shall use its best efforts to notify each Participant in writing at least ten days prior to any
Acceleration Date that the then current Purchase Period will end on such Acceleration Date. 

ARTICLE VI.   WITHDRAWAL FROM
PLAN; SALE OF STOCK  

Section 6.01   Voluntary Withdrawal .  A
Participant may, in accordance with such terms and conditions as the Committee in its sole discretion may impose, withdraw from
the Plan and cease making payroll deductions by filing with the Company a form provided for this purpose (or pursuant to such other
procedures established by the Committee from time to time).  In such event, the entire credit balance in the Participant s
Stock Purchase Account will be paid to the Participant in cash within 30 days.  A Participant who withdraws from the
Plan will not be eligible to reenter the Plan until the beginning of the next Purchase Period following the date of such withdrawal. 

Section 6.02   Death .  Subject
to such terms and conditions as the Committee in its sole discretion may impose, upon the death of a Participant, no further amounts
shall be credited to the Participant s Stock Purchase Account.  Thereafter, on the last business day of the Purchase
Period during which such Participant s death occurred and in accordance with Section 5.01 of the Plan, the entire credit
balance in such Participant s Stock Purchase Account will be used to purchase Common Stock, unless such Participant s
estate has filed with the Company, in advance of that day and subject to such terms and conditions as the Committee in its sole
discretion may impose, a form provided by the Company which elects to have the entire credit balance in such Participant s
Stock Account distributed in cash within 30 days after the end of that Purchase Period or at such earlier time as the Committee
in its sole discretion may decide (or pursuant to such other procedures established by the Committee from time to time).  Unless
determined otherwise by the Committee in its sole discretion, Participant may not designate any beneficiaries who, upon death,
are to receive the Common Stock or the amount that otherwise would have been distributed or paid to the Participant s estate. 

Section 6.03   Termination of
Employment .  Subject to such terms and conditions as the Committee in its sole discretion may impose, upon a Participant s
normal or early retirement with the consent of the Company under any pension or retirement plan of the Company or Participating
Affiliate ( Retirement ), no further amounts shall be credited to the Participant s Stock Purchase Account.  Thereafter,
on the last business day of the Purchase Period during which such Participant s Retirement occurred and in accordance with
Section 5.01 of the Plan, the entire credit balance in such Participant s Stock Purchase Account will be used to purchase
Common Stock, unless such Participant has filed with the Company, in advance of that day and subject to such terms and conditions
as the Committee in its sole discretion may impose, a form provided by the Company which elects to receive the entire credit balance
in such Participant s Stock Purchase Account in cash within 30 days after the end of that Purchase Period (or pursuant to
such other procedures established by the Committee from time to time), provided that such Participant shall have no right to purchase
Common Stock in the event that the last day of such a Purchase Period occurs more than three months following the termination of
such Participant s employment with the Company or Participating Affiliate by reason of such a Retirement.  In the
event the Participant ceases to be a Regular Employee due to termination of employment with the Company or a Participating Affiliate
or for any other reason other than death or Retirement, participation in the Plan will cease on the date the Participant ceases
to be a Regular Employee.  In such event, the entire credit balance in such Participant s Stock Purchase Account
will be paid to the Participant in cash within 30 days.  Also in such event, and in the event of Retirement, any shares
of Common Stock in a Participant s Stock Purchase Account that were purchased through payroll deductions must remain in such
Participant s Stock Purchase Account until the two-year holding period set forth in Section 7.03 has been satisfied with
respect to all such shares, at which time such Participant must elect either to sell or to transfer to a DRS account all shares
in the Stock Purchase Account, subject to such terms and conditions as the Committee in its sole discretion may impose.  For
purposes of this Section 6.03, a transfer of employment to any Participating Affiliate or to the Company, or a leave of absence
which has been approved by the Committee, will not be deemed a termination of employment as a Regular Employee. 

ARTICLE VII.   NONTRANSFERABILITY  

Section 7.01   Nontransferable
Right to Purchase .  The right to purchase Common Stock hereunder may not be assigned, transferred, pledged or hypothecated
(whether by operation of law or otherwise), except as provided in Section 6.02 of the Plan, and will not be subject to execution,
attachment or similar process.  Any attempted assignment, transfer, pledge, hypothecation or other disposition or levy
of attachment or similar process upon the right to purchase will be null and void and without effect. 

Section 7.02   Nontransferable
Account .  Except as provided in Section 6.02 of the Plan, the amounts credited to a Stock Purchase Account may not
be assigned, transferred, pledged or hypothecated in any way, and any attempted assignment, transfer, pledge, hypothecation or
other disposition of such amounts will be null and void and without effect. 

Section 7.03   Nontransferable
Shares .  Except as the Committee shall otherwise permit, prior to the second anniversary of the beginning of any
Purchase Period, the Common Stock purchased at the end of such Purchase Period by a Participant pursuant to Section 5.01 of the
Plan may not be assigned, transferred, pledged, hypothecated or otherwise disposed of in any way other than by will or by the laws
of descent and distribution, and any other attempted assignment, transfer, pledge, hypothecation or other disposition of such share
or shares will be null and void and without effect.

impose, the Company will cause the Common Stock then purchased pursuant to Section 5.01 of the Plan to be issued for the benefit
of the Participant and held in the Plan pursuant to Section 8.03 of the Plan. 

Section 8.02   Completion of Issuance .  A

issued for the benefit of the Participant pursuant to Section 8.03 of the Plan. 

Section 8.03   Form of Ownership .  The
Common Stock issued under Section 8.01 of the Plan will be held in the Plan in the name of the Participant or jointly in the name
of the Participant and another person, as the Participant may direct on a form provided by the Company (or pursuant to such other
procedures established by the Committee from time to time), until such time as stock certificates or DRS advices for such shares
of Common Stock are delivered to or for the benefit of the Participant pursuant to Section 8.05 of the Plan. 

Section 8.04   Automatic Dividend
Reinvestment .  Prior to the delivery of stock certificates or DRS advices to or for the benefit of the Participant
under Section 8.05 of the Plan, any and all cash dividends paid on full and fractional shares of Common Stock issued under either
Section 8.01 of the Plan or this Section 8.04 shall be reinvested to acquire either new issue Common Stock or shares of Common
Stock purchased on the open market, as determined by the Committee in its sole discretion.  Purchases of Common Stock
under this Section 8.04 will be (a) with respect to shares newly issued by the Company, invested on the dividend payment date,
or, if that date is not a trading day, the immediately preceding trading day, or (b) with respect to shares purchased on the open
market, normally purchased on the open market within ten business days of the dividend payment date, depending upon market conditions.  The
price per share of the Common Stock issued under this Section 8.04 shall be (x) with respect to shares newly issued by the Company,
the Fair Market Value of the Common Stock on the applicable investment date, or (y) with respect to shares purchased on the open
market, the weighted average price per share at which the Common Stock is actually purchased on the open market for the relevant
period on behalf of all participants in the Plan.  All shares of Common Stock acquired under this Section 8.04 will be
held in the Plan in the same name as the Common Stock upon which the cash dividends were paid. 

Section 8.05   Delivery .  At
any time following the conclusion of the nontransferability period set forth in Section 7.03 of the Plan and subject to such terms
and conditions as the Committee in its sole discretion may impose, by filing with the Company a form provided by the Company for
such purpose (or pursuant to such other procedures as may be established by the Committee from time to time), the Participant may
elect to have the Company cause to be delivered to or for the benefit of the Participant a stock certificate or DRS advice for
the number of whole shares and cash for any fractional share representing the Common Stock purchased pursuant to Section 5.01 of
the Plan.  Subject to such terms and conditions as the Committee in its sole discretion may impose, a Participant may
at any time elect to have the Company cause to be delivered to or for the benefit of the Participant a stock certificate or DRS
advice for the number of whole shares and cash for any fractional share representing the Common Stock purchased pursuant to Section
8.04 of the Plan upon the reinvestment of dividends by filing with the Company a form provided by the Company for such purpose
(or pursuant to such other procedures as may be established by the Committee from time to time).  Such elections will
be processed as soon as practicable after receipt of the applicable notice.  A stock certificate or DRS advice for whole
shares normally will be mailed to the Participant within five business days after receipt of the election notice; provided, however,
that if the notice is received between a dividend record date and a dividend payment date, a stock certificate or DRS advice will
generally not be sent out until the declared dividends have been reinvested pursuant to Section 8.04 of the Plan.  Any
fractional share will be sold and a check for the fractional share sent to the Participant promptly thereafter.
