CAUTIONARY
NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS   

Certain
statements contained in this Form 10-Q of Shepherd s Finance, LLC, other than historical facts, may be considered forward-looking
statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Words such as  may,   will,   expect, 
 anticipate,   believe,   estimate,   continue,   predict,  or other
similar words identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements appear in a number of places in this report, including
without limitation,  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, 
and include statements regarding our intent, belief or current expectation about, among other things, trends affecting the markets
in which we operate, our business, financial condition and growth strategies. Although we believe that the expectations reflected
in these forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future
performance and involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those predicted in the forward-looking
statements as a result of various factors, including but not limited to those set forth in the  Risk Factors  section
of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
If any of the events described in  Risk Factors  occur, they could have an adverse effect on our business, consolidated
financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  

When
considering forward-looking statements, you should keep these risk factors, as well as the other cautionary statements in this
report and in our 2015 Form 10-K in mind. You should not place undue reliance on any forward-looking statement. We are not obligated
to update forward-looking statements.

Description of Business and Basis of Presentation   

Description
of Business   

Description
of Business    

Shepherd s
Finance, LLC and subsidiaries (the  Company ,  we  or  our ) is a finance company that engages
in commercial lending to residential homebuilders, financing construction of single family homes and residential development.
The loans are extended to residential homebuilders and, as such, are commercial loans. We primarily fund our lending and operations
by continued extension of Notes to the general public, which Notes are unsecured subordinated debt. We currently have six sources
of capital:  

Certain
features of the purchase and sale agreements have added liquidity and flexibility, which have lessened the need for the lines
of credit from affiliates. Eventually, the Company intends to permanently replace the lines of credit from affiliates with a secured
line of credit from a bank or through other liquidity.  

Basis
of Presentation    

The
accompanying (a) condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015, which has been derived from audited consolidated
financial statements, and (b) unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) for interim financial information
and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. While certain information and disclosures normally included
in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted pursuant to the rules and regulations
of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ), management believes that the disclosures herein are adequate to
make the unaudited interim condensed consolidated information presented not misleading. In the opinion of management, the unaudited
interim condensed consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the consolidated
financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. Such adjustments are of a normal, recurring
nature. The results of operations for any interim period are not necessarily indicative of results expected for the fiscal year
ending December 31, 2016. These unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with
the 2015 consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K as of
and for the year ended December 31, 2015 (the  2015 Statements ). The accounting policies followed by the Company
are set forth in Note 2 -  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  of the notes to the 2015 Statements.  

2.
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies   

Segment
Reporting   

We
report all ongoing operations in one segment, commercial lending.  

Use
of Estimates   

The
preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
the interim condensed consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. It is reasonably possible that market conditions could deteriorate,
which could materially affect our consolidated financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. Among other effects,
such changes could result in the need to increase the amount of our allowance for loan losses.  

Revenue
Recognition   

Interest
income generally is recognized on an accrual basis. The accrual of interest is generally discontinued on all loans past due 90
days or more. All interest accrued but not collected for loans that are placed on nonaccrual or charged off is reversed against
interest income, unless management believes that the accrued interest is recoverable through liquidation of collateral. Interest
received on nonaccrual loans is applied against principal. Interest on accruing impaired loans is recognized as long as such loans
do not meet the criteria for nonaccrual status.  

Advertising   

Advertising
costs are expensed as incurred and are included in selling, general and administrative. Advertising expenses were $31 and $11
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  

Cash
and Cash Equivalents   

Management
considers highly-liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.  

Fair
Value Measurements   

The
Company follows the guidance of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification Topic (ASC)
825,  Financial Instruments , and ASC 820,  Fair Value Measurements . ASC 825 permits entities to measure many financial
instruments and certain other items at fair value. The objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with
the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without
having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. ASC 820 clarifies that fair value is an exit price, representing the amount
that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants.
Under this guidance, fair value measurements are not adjusted for transaction costs. This guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy
that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted
quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable
inputs (Level 3 measurements). See Note 3.  

Loans
Receivable   

Loans
are stated at the amount of unpaid principal, net of any allowances for loan losses, and adjusted for (1) the net unrecognized
portion of direct costs and nonrefundable loan fees associated with lending, and (2) deposits made by the borrowers used as collateral
for a loan and due back to the builder at or prior to loan payoff. The net amount of nonrefundable loan origination fees and direct
costs associated with the lending process, including commitment fees, is deferred and accreted to interest income over the lives
of the loans using a method that approximates the interest method.  

A
loan is classified as nonaccrual, and the accrual of interest on such loan is discontinued, when the contractual payment of principal
or interest becomes 90 days past due. In addition, a loan may be placed on nonaccrual at any other time management has serious
doubts about further collectability of principal or interest according to the contractual terms, even though the loan is currently
performing. A loan may remain on accrual status if it is in the process of collection or well-secured (i.e., the loan has sufficient
collateral value). Loans are restored to accrual status when the obligation is brought current or has performed in accordance
with the contractual terms for a reasonable period of time and the ultimate collectability of the total contractual principal
and interest is no longer in doubt.  

A
loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect
the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Impaired loans,
or portions thereof, are charged off when deemed uncollectible. Once a loan is 90 days past due, management begins a workout plan
with the borrower or commences its foreclosure process on the collateral.  

Allowance
for Loan Losses   

The
allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level believed adequate by management to absorb probable losses inherent in the loan
portfolio.  

We
establish a collective reserve for all loans which are not more than 60 days past due at the end of a quarter. This collective
reserve takes into account both historical information and a qualitative analysis of housing and other economic factors that may
impact our future realized losses. For loans to one borrower with committed balances less than 10% of our total committed balances
on all loans extended to all customers, we individually analyze for impairment all loans which are more than 60 days past due
at the end of a quarter. For loans to one borrower with committed balances equal to or greater than 10% of our total committed
balances on all loans extended to all customers, we individually analyze all loans for potential impairment. The analysis of loans,
if required, includes a comparison of estimated collateral value to the principal amount of the loan. For impaired loans, if the
value determined is less than the principal amount due (less any builder deposit), then the difference is included in the allowance
for loan loss. As values change, estimated loan losses may be provided for more or less than the previous period, and some loans
may not need a loss provision based on payment history. For homes which are partially complete, we appraise on an as-is and completed
basis, and use the one that more closely aligns with our planned method of disposal for the property.  

For
loans greater than 12 months in age that are individually evaluated for impairment, appraisals have been prepared within the last
13 months. For all loans individually evaluated for impairment, there is also a broker s opinions of value ( BOV )
prepared, if the appraisal is more than six months old. The lower of any BOV prepared in the last six months, or the most recent
appraisal, is used, unless we determine a BOV to be invalid based on the comparable sales used. If we determine a BOV to be invalid,
we will use the appraised value. Appraised values are adjusted down for estimated costs associated with asset disposal. Broker s
opinion of selling price, currently valid sales contracts on the subject property, or representative recent actual closings by
the builder on similar properties may be used in place of a BOV.  

Impaired
Loans   

A
loan is considered to be impaired when it is probable the Company will be unable to collect all principal and interest payments
due in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement. The analysis of impaired loans includes a comparison of estimated
collateral value to the principal amount of the loan. If the value determined is less than the principal amount due (less any
builder deposit), then the difference is included in the allowance for loan loss. As values change, estimated loan losses may
be provided for more or less than the previous period. For homes which are partially complete, we appraise on an as-is and completed
basis, and use the one that more closely aligns with our planned method of disposal for the property.  

Deferred
Financing Costs, Net   

We
defer certain costs associated with financing activities related to the issuance of debt securities (deferred financing costs).
These costs consist primarily of professional fees incurred related to the transactions. Deferred financing costs are amortized
into interest expense over the life of the related debt. We make estimates for the average duration of future investments. If
these estimates are determined to be incorrect in the future, the rate at which we are amortizing the deferred offering costs
as interest expense would be adjusted and could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. The deferred
financing costs are reflected as a reduction in the unsecured notes offering liability. The Company adopted the guidance on the
presentation of debt issuance costs on January 1, 2016, as required. As a result, the Company retrospectively applied the guidance
to the 2015 Consolidated Balance Sheet by reclassifying $599 of deferred financing costs previously classified in the assets section.  

The
following is a roll forward of deferred financing costs:  

The
following is a roll forward of the accumulated amortization of deferred financing costs:  

Income
Taxes   

The
entities included in the consolidated financial statements are organized as pass-through entities under the Internal Revenue Code.
As such, taxes are the responsibility of the members. Other significant taxes for which the Company is liable are recorded on
an accrual basis.  

The
Company applies ASC Topic 740,  Income Taxes . ASC 740 provides guidance for how uncertain tax positions should be recognized,
measured, presented and disclosed in the consolidated financial statements and requires the evaluation of tax positions taken
or expected to be taken in the course of preparing the Company s consolidated financial statements to determine whether
the tax positions are  more-likely-than-not  to be sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions with respect
to income tax at the LLC level not deemed to meet the  more-likely-than-not  threshold would be recorded as a tax
benefit or expense in the appropriate period. Management concluded that there are no uncertain tax positions that should be recognized
in the consolidated financial statements. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to income tax examinations for
years prior to 2013.  

The
Company s policy is to record interest and penalties related to taxes in interest expense on the consolidated statements
of operations. There have been no significant interest or penalties assessed or paid.  

Risks
and Uncertainties   

The
Company is subject to many of the risks common to the commercial lending and real estate industries, such as general economic
conditions, decreases in home values, decreases in housing starts, and high unemployment. These risks, which could have a material
and negative impact on the Company s consolidated financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows include, but
are not limited to, declines in housing starts, unfavorable changes in interest rates, and competition from other lenders. At
September 30, 2016, our loans were significantly concentrated in a suburb of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, so the housing starts and
prices in that area are more significant to our business than other areas until and if more loans are created in other markets.  

Concentrations   

Financial
instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of loans receivable. As
of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, 39% and 37%, respectively, of our outstanding loan commitments consist of loans to
one borrower, and the collateral is in one real estate market, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Accordingly, the ultimate collectability
of a significant portion of these loans is susceptible to changes in market conditions in that area. As of September 30, 2016,
our next two largest customers make up 13% and 7% respectively of our loan commitments, with loans in Sarasota, Florida and Savannah,
Georgia, respectively. As of December 31, 2015, our next two largest customers made up 22% and 6% respectively of our loan commitments,
with loans in Sarasota, Florida and Columbia, South Carolina, respectively.  

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements   

The
FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) . ASU 2014-09 implements
a common revenue standard that clarifies the principles for recognizing revenue. The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is that an
entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the
consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To achieve that core principle,
an entity should apply the following steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer, (ii) identify the performance obligations
in the contract, (iii) determine the transaction price, (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in
the contract and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. ASU 2014-09 is effective for
the Company on January 1, 2018. The Company is still evaluating the potential impact on the Company s consolidated financial
statements.  

In
April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03,  Interest - Imputation of Interest  (Subtopic 835-30):  Simplifying the Presentation
of Debt Issuance Costs . The amendments in this ASU require that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability
be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt
discounts. This guidance required retrospective application. The Company adopted the guidance on January 1, 2016, as required.
See Note 1 -  Deferred Financing Costs, Net  for additional information regarding the adoption of the new guidance  

On
January 5, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,  Financial Instruments Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial
Assets and Financial Liabilities . Changes to the current U.S. GAAP model primarily affect the accounting for equity investments,
financial liabilities under the fair value option, and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments.
In addition, the FASB clarified guidance related to the valuation allowance assessment when recognizing deferred tax assets resulting
from unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities. The accounting for other financial instruments, such as loans, investments
in debt securities, and financial liabilities is largely unchanged. The ASU also eliminates the requirement for public business
entities to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed
for financial instruments measured at amortized cost. The guidance is effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years, and early application is permitted. The Company
is currently evaluating the impact of this amendment on the consolidated financial statements.  

In
February 2016, the FASB issued FASB ASU 2016-02,  Leases  ( ASU 2016-02 ), which eliminates the current tests
for lease classification under U.S. GAAP and requires lessees to recognize the right-to-use assets and related lease liabilities
on the balance sheet. ASU 2016-02 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and early application
is permitted. The new standard provides for a modified retrospective application for leases existing at, or entered into after,
the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this
amendment on the consolidated financial statements.  

In
June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,  Financial Instruments - Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments
 (ASU 2016-13), which introduces the current expected credit losses methodology. Among other things, ASU 2016-13 requires the
measurement of all expected credit losses for financial assets, including available-for-sale debt securities, held at the reporting
date based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability
of the reported amount. The new model will require institutions to calculate all probable and estimable losses that are expected
to be incurred through the loan s entire life. ASU 2016-13 also requires the allowance for credit losses for purchased financial
assets with credit deterioration since origination to be determined in a manner similar to that of other financial assets measured
at amortized cost; however, the initial allowance will be added to the purchase price rather than recorded as credit loss expense.
The disclosure of credit quality indicators related to the amortized cost of financing receivables will be further disaggregated
by year of origination (or vintage). Disaggregation by vintage will be optional for nonpublic business entities. Institutions
are to apply the changes through a cumulative-effect adjustment to their retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting
period in which the standard is effective. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. Early
application will be permitted for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the impact
of these amendments on the consolidated financial statements.  

On
August 26, 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, which amends guidance in ASC 230 on the classification of certain cash receipts
and payments in the statement of cash flows, in order to reduce inconsistent application. The amendments address eight cash flow
issues including debt repayment and extinguishment costs, settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments, contingent consideration
payments following a business combination, proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims and corporate-owned life insurance
policies, distributions received from equity method investees, beneficial interests in securitization transactions and separately
identifiable cash flows. ASU 2016-15 is effective for the Company for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017,
including interim periods within those fiscal years. Entities must apply the guidance retrospectively to all periods presented
but may apply it prospectively from the earliest date practicable if retrospective application would be impracticable. Adoption
of ASU 2016-15 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company s financial statements.  

Subsequent
Events   

Management
of the Company has evaluated subsequent events through November 3, 2016, the date these consolidated financial statements were
issued. See Note 12.

Fair Value   

Utilizing
ASC 820, the Company has established a framework for measuring fair value under U.S. GAAP using a hierarchy, which requires the
Company to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. Fair value measurements are an exit
price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants. Three levels of inputs are used to measure fair value, as follows:  

Level
    1     
      quoted
    prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;   

Level
    2    
      quoted
    prices in active markets for similar assets and liabilities and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability; or   

Level
    3    
      unobservable
    inputs, such as discounted cash flow models or valuations.   

A
financial instrument s level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to
the fair value measurement.  

Fair
Value Measurements of Financial Assets on a Recurring Basis     

The
Company has no financial and non-financial assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis.  

Fair
Value Measurements of Financial Assets on a Non-recurring Basis     

Certain
assets are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis when there is evidence of impairment. The fair values of impaired loans
with specific allocations of the allowance for loan losses are generally based on recent real estate appraisals of the collateral
less estimated cost to sell. Declines in the fair values of other real estate owned subsequent to their initial acquisitions are
also based on recent real estate appraisals less selling costs.  

Impaired
Loans   

Fair
value estimates are determined using the methodology discussed in Note 2. The appraisals are on similar properties at similar
times, however due to the differences in time and properties, the impaired loans are classified as Level 3. There were no impaired
loan assets as of September 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015.  

Foreclosed
assets   

Foreclosed
assets (upon initial recognition or subsequent impairment) are non-financial assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring
basis.  

During
both 2016 and 2015, certain foreclosed assets, upon initial recognition, were measured and reported at fair value. The excess
of fair value measurements of foreclosed assets over the carrying value of the underlying loans result in a gain in non-interest
income. The excess of the carrying value of the underlying loans over the fair value measurements of foreclosed assets are charged-off
to the allowance for possible loan losses. These valuations are Level 3 valuations because the appraisal is comparing similar
properties which sold at a similar date, but not the same. Foreclosed assets were $3,237 and $965 as of September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, respectively. In connection with the measurement and initial recognition of the foregoing foreclosed assets
in 2016, the Company recognized a gain in non-interest income of approximately $44; during 2015, the Company recognized a gain
of approximately $105 subsequent to September 30, 2015. During both 2016 and 2015, no foreclosed assets were remeasured at fair
value subsequent to initial recognition.  

Fair
Value of Financial Instruments    

ASC
825 requires disclosure of fair value information about financial instruments, whether or not recognized on the face of the balance
sheet, for which it is practicable to estimate that value. The following methods and assumptions were used by the Company in estimating
the fair value of its financial instruments:  

Cash
and Cash Equivalents   

The
carrying amount approximates fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments.  

Loans
Receivable and Commitments to Extend Credit   

For
variable rate loans that reprice frequently with no significant change in credit risk, estimated fair values of collateral are
based on carrying values at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The estimated fair values for other loans are calculated
by discounting the future cash flows using current rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit
ratings and the same remaining maturities and approximate carrying values of these instruments at September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015. Because the loans are demand loan and therefore have no known time horizon, there is no significant impact from fluctuating
interest rates. For unfunded commitments to extend credit, because there would be no adjustment between fair value and carrying
amount for the amount if actually loaned, there is no adjustment to the amount before it is loaned. The amount for commitments
to extend credit is not listed in the tables below because there is no difference between carrying value and fair value, and the
amount is not recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as a liability.  

Interest
Receivable   

Although
interest receivable from our customers does not yield additional interest to us, because interest is due roughly 10 days after
it is billed, the impact is negligible and the fair value approximates the carrying value at both September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015.  

Customer
Interest Escrow   

The
customer interest escrow does not yield interest to the customer, but because: 1) the customer loans are demand loans, 2) there
is no way to estimate how long the escrow will be in place, and 3) the interest rate which could be used to discount this amount
is negligible, the fair value approximates the carrying value at both September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015.  

Borrowings
under Credit Facilities   

The
fair value of the Company s borrowings under credit facilities is estimated based on the expected cash flows discounted
using the current rates offered to the Company for debt of the same remaining maturities. As all of the borrowings under credit
facilities or the Notes are either payable on demand or at similar rates to what the Company can borrow funds for today, the fair
value of the borrowings is determined to approximate carrying value at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. The interest
on our Notes offering is paid to our Note holders either monthly or at the end of their investment, compounding on a monthly basis.
For the same reasons as the determination for the principal balances on the Notes, the fair value approximates the carrying value
for the interest as well. The interest payable makes up the bulk of our accounts payable and accrued expenses.  

The
table below is a summary of fair value estimates for financial instruments and the level of the fair value hierarchy (as discussed
in Note 2) within which the fair value measurements are categorized at the periods indicated:

Commercial
Construction and Development Loans    

Pennsylvania
Loans   

On
December 30, 2011, pursuant to a credit agreement (as amended, the  Credit Agreement ) by and between us, Benjamin
Marcus Homes, LLC ( BMH ), Investor s Mark Acquisitions, LLC ( IMA ), and Mark L. Hoskins ( Hoskins )
(collectively, the  Hoskins Group ), we originated two new loan assets, one to BMH as borrower (the  BMH Loan )
and one to IMA as borrower (the  New IMA Loan ). Pursuant to the Credit Agreement and simultaneously with the origination
of the BMH Loan and the New IMA Loan, we also assumed the position of lender on an existing loan to IMA (the  Existing IMA
Loan ) and assumed the position of borrower on another existing loan in which IMA serves as the lender (the  SF Loan ).
Throughout this report, we refer to the BMH Loan, the New IMA Loan, and the Existing IMA Loan collectively as the  Pennsylvania
Loans.   

As
a result of amendments to the Credit Agreement, we converted $1,000 of the SF Loan from debt to preferred equity. The new preferred
equity serves as collateral for the Pennsylvania Loans. There is no liquid market for the preferred equity instrument, so we can
give no assurance as to our ability to generate any amount of proceeds from that collateral. We also reduced the balance of the
SF Loan by $125, which was added to the interest escrow, and repaid the remaining $375 with cash. The interest rate on the Existing
IMA Loan was raised to match the New IMA Loan. Beginning in December 2015, the Hoskins Group invests in our preferred equity in
an amount equal to $10 per closing of a lot payoff in the Hamlets or Tuscany subdivisions.  

Also
as a result of amendments to the Credit Agreement, we funded an additional $750 of interest escrow, we issued several letters
of credit relating to BMH Loan which totaled $90 and $68 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively (the  Letter
of Credit ), and we issued cash bonds for development with $257 outstanding at both September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015. The terms and conditions of the Pennsylvania Loans are set forth in further detail below.  

BMH
Loan    

The
BMH Loan is a revolving demand loan in the original principal amount of up to $4,164, of which $3,568 was funded at closing. We
collected a fee of $750 upon closing of the BMH Loan, which was funded from proceeds of the loan. Additionally, $450 of the loan
proceeds was allocated to an interest escrow account (the  Interest Escrow ). Interest on the BMH Loan accrues annually
at 2.0% (7.0% starting August 1, 2016) plus the greater of (i) 5.0% or (ii) the weighted average price paid by us on or in connection
with all of our borrowed funds (such weighted average price includes interest rates, loan fees, legal fees and any and all other
costs paid by us on our borrowed funds, and, in the case of funds borrowed by us from our affiliates, the weighted average price
paid by such affiliate on or in connection with such borrowed funds) ( COF ).  

The
BMH Loan is secured by a first priority mortgage in residential property consisting of 13 building lots and a parcel of land of
approximately 10 acres which is currently under development, all located in the subdivision commonly known as the Hamlets of Springdale
in Peters Township, Pennsylvania, a suburb of Pittsburgh, as well as the Interest Escrow. The seller of the property securing
the BMH Loan retained a second mortgage in the amount of $400, with a balance of approximately $100 and $157 as of September 30,
2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  

New
IMA Loan    

The
New IMA Loan is a demand loan in the original principal amount of up to $2,225, of which $250 was funded at closing. We collected
a fee of $250 upon closing of the New IMA Loan, which was funded from proceeds of the loan. Interest on the New IMA Loan accrues
annually at 2.0% (7.0% starting August 1, 2016) plus the greater of (i) 5.0% or (ii) the weighted average price paid by us on
or in connection with all of our borrowed funds (such weighted average price includes interest rates, loan fees, legal fees and
any and all other costs paid by us on our borrowed funds, and, in the case of funds borrowed by us from our affiliates, the weighted
average price paid by such affiliate on or in connection with such borrowed funds).  

The
New IMA Loan is secured by a mortgage in residential property originally consisting of 18 lots (5 and 8 lots remained as of September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively) located in the subdivision commonly known as the Tuscany Subdivision in Peters Township,
Pennsylvania, a suburb of Pittsburgh. Construction of the improvements for the Tuscany Subdivision began in December 2012, with
$113 remaining to be completed as of September 30, 2016.  

Existing
IMA Loan    

The
Existing IMA Loan is a demand loan in the original principal amount of $1,687, of which $1,687 was outstanding as of both September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. Interest on the Existing IMA Loan accrued annually at a rate of 7.0% through December 30, 2014.
Beginning December 31, 2014, the interest rate was the same as the New IMA Loan. Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, interest payments
on the Existing IMA Loan are funded from the Interest Escrow, with any shortfall funded by IMA.  

The
Existing IMA Loan is secured by a mortgage in the residential property that also secures the New IMA Loan.  

SF
Loan    

Concurrent
with the execution of the loans above, we entered into the SF Loan with the Hoskins Group, under which we were the borrower. The
SF Loan is described in Note 6.  

Interest
Escrow    

The
Pennsylvania Loans called for a funded Interest Escrow account which was funded with proceeds from the Pennsylvania Loans. The
initial funding on that Interest Escrow was $450. The balance as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was $365 and $267,
respectively. To the extent the balance is available in the Interest Escrow, interest due on certain loans is deducted from the
Interest Escrow on the date due. The Interest Escrow is increased by 20% of lot payoffs on the same loans, and by interest and/or
distributions on the SF Loan and Hoskins Group preferred equity. All of these transactions are noncash to the extent that the
total escrow amount does not need additional funding. The Interest Escrow is also used to contribute to the reduction of the $400
subordinated mortgage upon certain lot sales of the collateral of the BMH Loan.  

A
detail of the financing receivables for the Pennsylvania Loans at September 30, 2016 is as follows:  

A
detail of the financing receivables for the Pennsylvania Loans at December 31, 2015 is as follows:  

(1)
 These are the stated terms; however, in practice, principal will be repaid upon the sale of each developed lot.  

(2)
 These are the stated terms; however, in practice, principal will be repaid upon the sale of each developed lot after the
BMH loan and the New IMA loan are satisfied.  

(3)
 Estimated collateral value is equal to the appraised value of the remaining lots of $1,887, net of the net estimated costs
to finish the development of $113.  

(4)
 Estimated collateral value is equal to the appraised value of the remaining lots of $3,600, net of the net estimated costs
to finish the development of $531 and the first mortgage amount of $731.  

(5)
 The cash bond is in place to guarantee to the township that work will be completed on this project. We will fund this work
and expect to cancel the bond upon completion of the work.  

(6)
 Estimated collateral value is equal to the appraised value of $3,101, net of estimated costs to finish the development of
$150.  

(7)
 Estimated collateral value is equal to the lots  appraised value of $2,556 minus remaining improvements of $430.  

(8)
 In the event of a foreclosure on the property securing certain of our loans, a portion of our collateral is preferred equity
in our Company, which might be difficult to sell, which could impact our ability to eliminate the loan balance. The loans are
collectively cross-collateralized and, therefore, treated as one loan for the purpose of calculating the effective interest rate
and for available remedies upon an instance of default. As lots are released, a specific release price is repaid by the borrower,
with 10% of that amount being used to fund the Interest Escrow (except for the construction funding for homes). The customer will
make cash interest payments only when the Interest Escrow is fully depleted, except for construction funding for homes, where
the customer makes interest payments monthly.  

The
Pennsylvania Loans created in 2011 had a $1,000 loan fee. The expenses incurred related to issuing the loan were approximately
$76, which were netted against the loan amount. The remaining $924, which was netted against the gross loan amount, was recognized
over the expected life of the loans using the straight-line method in accordance with ASC 310-20,  Nonrefundable Fees and Other
Costs . The loan has lasted beyond its expected life.  

The
Company has a credit agreement with its largest borrower which includes a maximum exposure on all three loans, as described in
the chart below. This limit does not include construction loans.

Credit
Quality Information   

The
following table presents credit-related information at the  class  level in accordance with ASC 310-10-50,  Disclosures
about the Credit Quality of Finance Receivables and the Allowance for Credit Losses . A class is generally a disaggregation
of a portfolio segment. In determining the classes, the Company considered the finance receivable characteristics and methods
it applies in monitoring and assessing credit risk and performance.  

The
following table summarizes finance receivables by the risk ratings that regulatory agencies utilize to classify credit exposure
and which are consistent with indicators the Company monitors. Risk ratings are reviewed on a regular basis and are adjusted as
necessary for updated information affecting the borrowers  ability to fulfill their obligations.  

The
definitions of these ratings are as follows:  

Pass
      finance receivables in this category do not meet the criteria for classification in one of the categories below.   

Special
    mention   a special mention asset exhibits potential weaknesses that deserve management s close attention. If
    left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses may, at some future date, result in the deterioration of the repayment prospects.   

Classified
      a classified asset ranges from: 1) assets that are inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity
    of the borrower, and are characterized by the distinct possibility that some loss will be sustained if the deficiencies are
    not corrected to 2) assets with weaknesses that make collection or liquidation in full unlikely on the basis of current facts,
    conditions, and values. Assets in this classification can be accruing or on non-accrual depending on the evaluation of these
    factors.

Foreclosed Assets   

Roll
forward of Foreclosed Assets:  

We
foreclosed on five properties during 2015, of which four were acquired at the foreclosure sale and one was acquired via a deed
in lieu of foreclosure. Three of the properties were lots in Georgia. We have an agreement with a builder to build a house on
one of the lots (which is complete as of September 30, 2016) and will likely start construction on a second home once the first
has a sales agreement. Two of the properties were partially completed homes in Louisiana, one has been finished and work is proceeding
to complete the second of these homes. We acquired one property via a deed in lieu of foreclosure during 2016. This property is
a beach lot in Sarasota, Florida. We have executed the seller s part of an option to purchase the property which expires
in December 2016. If that sale is executed, we will record a small gain on the sale.

Borrowings    

The
following table displays our borrowings:  

Purchase
and Sale Agreements    

In
December 2014, the Company entered into a purchase and sale agreement with 1st Financial Bank USA whereby the purchaser may buy
loans offered to it by us, and we may be obligated to offer certain loans to purchaser. Purchaser is buying senior positions in
the loans they purchase, originally 50%, 60% on new loans as of January 2016, of each loan. Purchaser generally receives the interest
rate we charge the borrower (with a floor of 10%) on their portion of the loan balance, and we receive the rest of the interest
and all of the loan fee. We service the loans. There is an unlimited right for us to call any loan sold, however in any case of
such call, a minimum of 4% of the commitment amount of purchaser must have been received by purchaser in interest, or we must
make up the difference. Also, the purchaser has a put option, which is limited to 10% of the funding provided by purchaser under
all loans purchased in the trailing 12 months.  

In
April 2015, the Company entered into a purchase and sale agreement with Seven Kings Holdings, Inc. ( 7Kings ) as purchaser
and the Company as seller, whereby 7Kings buys loans offered to it by us, providing that their portions of the loans always total
less than $1,500. On or about May 7, 2015, 7Kings assigned its right and interest in the purchase and sale agreement to S.K. Funding,
LLC ( S.K. Funding ), an affiliate of 7Kings. S.K. Funding may adjust the $1,500 with notice, but such change will
not cause a buyback by us. S.K. Funding is buying pari-passu positions in the loans they purchase, generally 50% of each loan.
S.K. Funding generally receives a 9% interest rate on its portion of the loan balance, and we receive the rest of the interest
and all of the loan fees. We service the loans. There is an unlimited right for us to call any loan sold. This transaction is
accounted for as a secured line of credit. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we entered into a modification of our agreement with
S.K. Funding whereby S.K. Funding agreed to buy priority interests of $1,000 each in two large loans we originated. In the first
quarter of 2016, after one of the $1,000 loans repaid, we entered into an additional modification whereby S.K. Funding agreed
to buy priority interests totaling $2,000 in a total of three large loans we originated. The interest rate for the loans covered
by these modifications is 9.5% to S.K. Funding. On June 30, 2016, one of those two loans was terminated with a deed in lieu of
foreclosure. The property is owned by us, and we owe S.K. Funding $1,000 on that property (secured by mortgage) to be repaid upon
the sale of the property. This amount is still covered by our purchase and sale agreement and is included in the totals in the
chart below. On December 31, 2015, S.K. Funding purchased 4% of our common equity from the Wallach family.  

The
purchase and sale agreements are recorded as secured borrowings.  

The
purchase and sale agreements are detailed below:  

The
$6,276 of loans which served as collateral for S.K. Funding, LLC does not include the book value of the foreclosed assets which
also secure their position, which amount is $1,813.  

Affiliate
Loans    

In
December 2011, the Company entered into two secured revolving lines of credit with affiliates, both of whom are members. These
loans have an interest rate of the affiliates  cost of funds, which was 4.18% and 4.20% as of September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015, respectively. They are demand notes. The maximum that can be borrowed under these notes is $1,500, at the discretion
of the lenders. The actual amount borrowed was $0 at both September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, leaving $1,500 in potential
credit availability on those dates. There is no obligation of the affiliates to lend money up to the note amount. The security
for the lines of credit includes all of the assets of the Company. The Company has not borrowed on these lines in either 2015
or 2016.  

S.K.
Funding owns 4% of our common equity. S.K. Funding is also a buyer in a purchase and sale agreement where we are the seller. 7Kings
is an investor in our notes program for $500 and has a $500 unsecured note due from us.  

Other
Unsecured Loans    

In
August 2015, we entered into an unsecured note with 7Kings, under which we are the borrower. The note has a maximum amount outstanding
of $500, of which $500 was outstanding as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. Interest on the 7Kings loan accrues annually
at a rate of 7.5%. The note was due on February 19, 2016, was renewed several times and is now due February 18, 2017, and may
be prepaid at any time without penalty. Interest is due at the end of each month and was $14 in 2015 and $28 in the first nine
months of 2016. On December 31, 2015, S.K. Funding, an affiliate of 7Kings, purchased 4% of our common equity from the Wallach
family.  

In
December 2015, we entered into an unsecured note with an unrelated third party, under which we are the borrower. The note has
a maximum amount outstanding of $100, of which $100 was outstanding on both September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. Interest
on this note accrues annually at a rate of 7.9%. The note is due on June 23, 2017 and may be prepaid at any time without penalty.
Interest accrues and compounds monthly. In April 2016, we entered into an unsecured note with the same unrelated third party,
under which we are the borrower. The note has a maximum amount outstanding of $100, of which $100 was outstanding on September
30, 2016. Interest on this note accrues annually at a rate of 10%. The note is due on April 15, 2020 and may be prepaid at any
time without penalty. Interest accrues and compounds monthly.  

SF
Loan    

The
SF Loan, under which we were the borrower, was an unsecured loan in the original principal amount of $1,500. Interest on the SF
Loan accrued annually at a rate of 5.0%. On December 31, 2014, the Company and the Hoskins Group entered into a series of agreements
which, among other things, 1) converted $1,000 of the SF Loan from debt to preferred equity, 2) repaid $125 of the SF Loan and
applied those proceeds to increase the interest escrow, and 3) required elimination of the remaining balance of the SF Loan with
a cash payment upon the repayment of the construction loan on lot 5 of the Tuscany subdivision. This payment was made in the first
quarter of 2015.  

Notes
Program    

Borrowings
through our public offerings were $10,689 and $8,496 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The effective
interest rate on the borrowings at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was 7.87% and 7.30%, respectively, not including the
amortization of deferred financing costs. There are limited rights of early redemption. We generally offer four durations at any
given time, ranging anywhere from 12 to 48 months. The following table shows the roll forward of our Notes program:  

The
following table shows the maturity of outstanding debt as of September 30, 2016.  

Purchase
and sale agreements are treated as secured lines of credit, where the collateral is demand loans, and therefore they are considered
short term liabilities.

Members  Capital    

There
are currently two classes of units (class A common units and series B cumulative preferred units).  

The
Class A common units are held by three members, all of whom have no personal liability. All Class A common members have voting
rights in proportion to their capital account. There were 2,629 Class A common units outstanding at both September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015. On December 31, 2015, an affiliate of 7Kings, S.K. Funding, purchased 4% of our common equity from the Wallach
family.  

The
series B cumulative preferred units were issued to the Hoskins Group through a reduction in the SF Loan. They are redeemable only
at the option of the Company or upon a change or control or liquidation. Ten units were issued for a total of $1,000. The series
B units have a fixed value which is their purchase price, and preferred liquidation and distribution rights. Yearly distributions
of 10% of the units  value (providing profits are available) are made quarterly. The Hoskins Group series B cumulative preferred
units are also used as collateral for that group s loans to the Company. There is no liquid market for the preferred equity
instrument, so we can give no assurance as to our ability to generate any amount of proceeds from that collateral. In December
of 2015, the Hoskins Group agreed to purchase 0.1 unit for $10 at each closing of a lot to a third party in the Hamlets and Tuscany
subdivisions.  

There
are two additional authorized unit classes: class A preferred units and class B profit units. Once class B profit units are issued,
the existing class A common units will become class A preferred units. Class A preferred units will receive preferred treatment
in terms of distributions and liquidation proceeds.  

The
members  capital balances by class are as follows:

Commitments and Contingencies   

In
the normal course of business there may be outstanding commitments to extend credit that are not included in the consolidated
financial statements. Commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any
condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may
require payment of a fee. Since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon and some of the funding
may come from the earlier repayment of the same loan (in the case of revolving lines), the total commitment amounts do not necessarily
represent future cash requirements. The financial instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit and interest rate
risk in excess of amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements. The Company evaluates each customer s creditworthiness
on a case-by-case basis. Unfunded commitments to extend credit, which have similar collateral, credit risk and market risk to
our outstanding loans, were $8,556 and $7,332 at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  

The
Company has several Letters of Credit relating to the BMH Loan. Refer to the chart in Note 4   Commercial Loans  
Real Estate Development Loan Portfolio Summary for further details describing this commitment.

The
following Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction
with our interim condensed consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto contained elsewhere in this report. The following
Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should also be read in conjunction
with our audited annual consolidated financial statements and related notes and other consolidated financial data included in
the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015. See also  Cautionary Note
Regarding Forward-Looking Statements  preceding Part I.  

Overview   

We
were organized in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in 2007 under the name 84 RE Partners, LLC and changed our name to Shepherd s
Finance, LLC on December 2, 2011. We converted to a Delaware limited liability company on March 29, 2012. Our business is focused
on commercial lending to participants in the residential construction and development industry. We believe this market is underserved
because of the lack of traditional lenders currently participating in the market. We are located in Jacksonville, Florida. Our
operations are governed pursuant to our operating agreement.  

From
2007 through the majority of 2011, we were the lessor in three commercial real estate leases with a then affiliate, 84 Lumber
Company. Beginning in late 2011, we began commercial lending to residential homebuilders. Our current loan portfolio is described
more fully in this section under the sub heading  Commercial Construction and Development Loans.  We have a limited
operating history as a finance company. We currently have four paid employees, including our Executive Vice President of Operations.
We currently use our Chief Executive Officer, Daniel M. Wallach, to originate most of our new loans, and augment that with several
people to whom we pay consulting fees. Our Board of Managers is comprised of Mr. Wallach and three independent Managers  
Bill Myrick, Eric Rauscher, and Kenneth R. Summers. Our officers are responsible for our day-to-day operations, while the Board
of Managers is responsible for overseeing our business.  

The
commercial loans we extend are secured by mortgages on the underlying real estate. We extend and service commercial loans to small-to-medium
sized homebuilders for the purchase of lots and/or the construction of homes thereon. In a few limited circumstances, we lend
money to homebuilders for the purchase of existing homes to be rehabbed. We also extend and service loans for the purchase of
undeveloped land and the development of that land into residential building lots. In addition, we may, depending on our cash position
and the opportunities available to us, do none, any or all of the following: purchase defaulted unsecured debt from suppliers
to homebuilders at a discount (and then secure that debt with real estate or other collateral), purchase defaulted secured debt
from financial institutions at a discount, and purchase real estate in which we will operate our business.  

Our
CEO, Mr. Wallach, has been in the housing industry since 1985. He was the CFO of a multi-billion dollar supplier of building materials
to home builders for 11 years. He also was responsible for that company s lending business for 20 years. During those years,
he was responsible for the creation and implementation of many secured lending programs to builders. Some of these were performed
fully by that company, and some were performed in partnership with banks. In general, the creation of all loans, and the resolution
of defaulted loans, was his responsibility, whether the loans were company loans or loans in partnership with banks. Through these
programs, he was responsible for the creation of approximately $2,000,000 in loans which generated interest spread of $50,000,
after deducting for loan losses. Through the years, he managed the development of systems for reducing and managing the risks
and losses on defaulted loans. Mr. Wallach also was responsible for that company s unsecured debt to builders, which reached
over $300,000 at its peak. He also gained experience in securing defaulted unsecured debt.  

We
had $17,915 and $14,060 in loan assets as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. As of September 30, 2016,
we have a limited number of construction loans in 15 states with 27 borrowers, and have three development loans in Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania. At the end of 2014 and again in April 2015, we entered into purchase and sale agreements for portions of our loans.
The first loan portions sold under the program took place during the first quarter of 2015 and it has allowed us to increase our
loan balances and commitments significantly in 2015 and 2016.  

We
currently have six sources of capital:  

Certain
features of the purchase and sale agreements have added liquidity and flexibility, which have lessened the need for the lines
of credit from affiliates. Eventually, the Company intends to permanently replace the lines of credit from affiliates with a secured
line of credit from a bank or through other liquidity.  

Critical
Accounting Estimates   

To
assist in evaluating our consolidated financial statements, we describe below the critical accounting estimates that we use. We
consider an accounting estimate to be critical if: (1) the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that
were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made, and (2) changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely
to occur from period to period, or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used, would have a material impact
on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.  

Loan
Losses   

Nature
of estimates required   

Loan
losses, as applicable, are accounted for both on the consolidated balance sheets and the consolidated statements of operations.
On the consolidated statements of operations, management estimates the amount of losses to capture during the current year. This
current period amount incurred is referred to as the loan loss provision. The calculation of our allowance for loan losses, which
appears on our consolidated balance sheets, requires us to compile relevant data for use in a systematic approach to assess and
estimate the amount of probable losses inherent in our commercial lending operations and to reflect that estimated risk in our
allowance calculations. We use the policy summarized as follows:  

We
establish a collective reserve for all loans which are not more than 60 days past due at the end of a quarter. This collective
reserve takes into account both historical information and a qualitative analysis of housing and other economic factors that may
impact our future realized losses. For loans to one borrower with committed balances less than 10% of our total committed balances
on all loans extended to all customers, we individually analyze for impairment all loans which are more than 60 days past due
at the end of a quarter. For loans to one borrower with committed balances equal to or greater than 10% of our total committed
balances on all loans extended to all customers, we individually analyze all loans for potential impairment. The analysis of loans,
if required, includes a comparison of estimated collateral value to the principal amount of the loan. For impaired loans, if the
value determined is less than the principal amount due (less any builder deposit), then the difference is included in the allowance
for loan loss. As values change, estimated loan losses may be provided for more or less than the previous period, and some loans
may not need a loss provision based on payment history. For homes which are partially complete, we appraise on an as-is and completed
basis, and use the one that more closely aligns with our planned method of disposal for the property.  

For
loans greater than 12 months in age that are individually evaluated for impairment, appraisals have been prepared within the last
13 months. For all loans individually evaluated for impairment, there is also a broker s opinions of value ( BOV )
prepared, if the appraisal is more than six months old. The lower of any BOV prepared in the last six months, or the most recent
appraisal, is used, unless we determine a BOV to be invalid based on the comparable sales used. If we determine a BOV to be invalid,
we will use the appraised value. Appraised values are adjusted down for estimated costs associated with asset disposal. Broker s
opinion of selling price, currently valid sales contracts on the subject property, or representative recent actual closings by
the builder on similar properties may be used in place of a broker s opinion of value.  

Appraisers
are state certified, and are selected by first attempting to utilize the appraiser who completed the original appraisal report.
If that appraiser is unavailable or not affordable, we use another appraiser who appraises routinely in that geographic area.
BOVs are created by real estate agents. We try to first select an agent we have worked with, and then, if that fails, we select
another agent who works in that geographic area.  

Loan
losses are also impacted when a loan asset is taken through foreclosure or similar means and changed from a loan to a foreclosed
asset. The valuation for foreclosed assets does not include future value, as it does while the asset is a loan, and therefore
the calculation can have a different result.  

Fair
Value   

Nature
of estimates required   

Currently,
fair value of collateral has the potential to impact the calculation of the loan loss provision most heavily. Specifically relevant
to the allowance for loan loss reserve is the fair value of the underlying collateral supporting the outstanding loan balances.
Also the fair value of real estate will affect our foreclosed asset value (which is booked at 100% of fair value, after selling
costs are deducted). Fair value measurements are an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset
or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. Due to a rapidly changing economic market,
an erratic housing market, the various methods that could be used to develop fair value estimates, and the various assumptions
that could be used, determining the collateral s fair value requires significant judgment.

Amortization
of Deferred Financing Costs   

We
amortize our deferred financing costs based on the effective interest method. As such, we make estimates for the duration of the
future investment proceeds we anticipate receiving from our Notes offering. If this estimate is determined to be incorrect in
the future, the rate at which we are amortizing the deferred financing costs as interest expense would be adjusted.  

Currently
we anticipate a consistent average duration of 38 months for the Notes in our current offering. An increasing average duration
over the remaining anticipated length of the Notes offering would decrease the amount of amortization reflected in interest in
the next 12 months, and a decreasing average duration of investments over the remaining anticipated length would increase the
amount reflected in the next 12 months.

Other
Loss Contingencies   

Other
loss contingencies are recorded as liabilities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss
is reasonably estimable. Disclosure is required when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will exceed the
recorded provision. Contingent liabilities are often resolved over long time periods. Estimating probable losses requires analysis
of multiple forecasts that often depend on judgments about potential actions by third parties such as courts, arbitrators, juries,
or regulators.  

Accounting
and Auditing Standards Applicable to  Emerging Growth Companies    

We
are an  emerging growth company  under the recently enacted JOBS Act. For as long as we are an  emerging growth
company,  we are not required to: (1) comply with any new or revised financial accounting standards that have different
effective dates for public and private companies until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies, (2) provide
an auditor s attestation report on management s assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial
reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, (3) comply with any new requirements adopted by the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board, or the PCAOB, requiring mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor s report
in which the auditor would be required to provide additional information about the audit and the financial statements of the issuer
or (4) comply with any new audit rules adopted by the PCAOB after April 5, 2012, unless the SEC determines otherwise. We intend
to take advantage of such extended transition period. Since we will not be required to comply with new or revised accounting standards
on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for other public companies, our consolidated financial statements
may not be comparable to the financial statements of companies that comply with public company effective dates. If we were to
subsequently elect to instead comply with these public company effective dates, such election would be irrevocable pursuant to
Section 107 of the JOBS Act.  

Other
Significant Accounting Policies   

Other
significant accounting policies, not involving the same level of measurement uncertainties as those discussed above, are nevertheless
important to an understanding of the consolidated financial statements. Policies related to credit quality information, fair value
measurements, related party transactions and revenue recognition require difficult judgments on complex matters that are often
subject to multiple and recent changes in the authoritative guidance. Certain of these matters are among topics currently under
reexamination or have recently been addressed by accounting standard setters and regulators. Specific conclusions have not been
reached by these standard setters, and outcomes cannot be predicted with confidence. Also, see Notes 1 and 2 to our consolidated
financial statements, as they discuss accounting policies that we have selected from acceptable alternatives.  

Consolidated
Results of Operations   

Key
financial and operating data for the three and six months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are set forth below. For a more complete
understanding of our industry, the drivers of our business, and our current period results, this discussion should be read in
conjunction with our consolidated financial statements, including the related notes and the other information contained in this
document.  

Interest
Spread   

The
following table displays a comparison of our interest income, expense, fees and spread:  

*annualized
amount as percentage of weighted average outstanding gross loan balance  

There
are three main components that can impact our interest spread:  

Difference between the interest rate received (on our loan assets) and the interest rate paid (on our borrowings).   The
loans we have originated have interest rates which are based on our cost of funds, with a minimum cost of funds of 5%. The margin
is fixed at 2%. Future loans are anticipated to be originated at approximately the same 2% margin. This component is also impacted
by the lending of money with no interest cost (our equity). Our interest income on loans was higher in both the three and nine
month periods ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same periods in 2015. This increase was due to: 1) default interest
charged to a borrower in 2016; 2) a higher interest rate charged to all of our borrowers (caused by an increase in our borrowing
costs); 3) not recognizing interest in 2015 for a borrower we were foreclosing on; and 4) an increase in the rate we are charging
on our development loans. Our interest expense increased in 2016 as we sought to increase our loan balances and found that we
were able to do so by raising the interest rates we paid to our lenders, including the Notes program. Also we were using capital
raised from debt to carry foreclosed assets, and while that raised our interest cost, it did not increase our weighted average
outstanding loan balance.  

The
difference (spread) between the interest income and interest expense was 3% in the three month period ended September 30, 2016,
and 4% for the nine month period ended the same date. The spread was 3% for the three and nine month periods ended September 30,
2015. This increase is due to charging default interest to one of our borrowers during 2016, and not charging interest during
default of a borrower during 2015.  

Fee income.   Fee income is displayed in the table above. The two loans originated in December 2011 had a net origination
fee of $924. This fee was recognized over the life of the loans, and has been fully recognized as of August, 2016. In both 2016
and 2015, this fee was 4% of the average outstanding balance on those loans. All of our construction loans have a 5% fee on the
amount we commit to lend, which is amortized over the expected life of each of those loans. When loans pay back quicker than their
expected life, the remaining unrecognized fee is recognized upon the termination of the loan. In the nine months ended September
30, 2016 and 2015, this fee was 6% and 7%, respectively, of the average outstanding balance on those loans. This decrease was
due to a longer weighted average duration of our loan portfolio in the 2016. In the future, we anticipate creating loans with
fees ranging between 4 and 5% of the maximum loan amount, and we anticipate that our fee percentage in 2016 vs. 2015 will be slightly
higher due to construction loans being a higher portion of our balances in 2016, and slightly lower due to the 2011 loans only
having fee income through July 2016. After July 2016, the interest rate on those loans increases to offset the decrease in fee
income, but that amount will be reflected in the difference between the interest rate received and the interest rate paid amounts
described in the previous paragraph. Fee income for both the three months periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was 6%.  

Amount of nonperforming assets.   In 2015 we had loan assets we were foreclosing on which were not paying interest,
and in 2016 we had no such loan assets. Our real estate assets we owned (after we foreclosed on loans and took possession of the
property serving as collateral) do not have an interest return either, and the balance of those has risen over the last four quarters.
On September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we carried cash balances of $561 and $1,341, respectively, which also do not have
a material return.  

Loan
Loss Provision   

We
recorded $4 in both of the three month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, in loss reserve related to our
collective reserve (loans not individually impaired). We recorded $10 and $6 in the nine month periods ended September 30, 2016
and 2015, respectively, in loss reserve related to our collective reserve. In addition, we reserved $15 and $36 in the three and
nine month periods ended September 30, 2015 in our specific reserve (for loans individually impaired) specifically related to
loans we were foreclosing on in 2015. We anticipate that the collective reserve will increase as our balances rise throughout
2016.  

SG A
Expenses   

The
following table displays our SG A expenses:  

We
began paying our CEO effective January 1, 2016. Our CEO s total compensation (including bonus accrual and benefits) was
approximately $313 and $0 in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and was $90 and $0 in the three
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We also have additional staff in the field and in the office. Advertising
increased due to expenses related to new builder efforts. Loan and foreclosed asset expenses increased due to expenses related
to having real estate which we foreclosed on. Travel expense was higher due to our field representatives and more site visits
to potential loan jobsites. We anticipate additional travel and advertising expenses in 2016 due to now having three field staff,
the first of which was hired in December of 2015.  

Consolidated
Financial Position   

Cash
and Cash Equivalents   

We
try to avoid borrowing on our line of credit from affiliates. To accomplish this, we must carry some cash for liquidity. This
amount generally grows as our Company grows. At September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had $561 and $1,341, respectively,
in cash. When we create new loans, they typically do not have significant outstanding loan balances for several months. We anticipate
loan production to increase in 2016, therefore increasing the average amount of cash we may hold, unless we obtain a line of credit
from a financial institution.

deferred financing costs were $988 and $935 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The accumulated amortization
of those costs was $540 and $336 as of the same dates. We expect that the gross deferred financing amount will continue to increase
over time as more of the anticipated financing costs are deferred when paid, and expensed over the life of the debt associated
with the financing using the effective interest method. We also expect that the amortization expense and the accumulated amortization
will increase in 2016 as compared to 2015.  

The
deferred financing costs are reflected as a reduction in the unsecured notes offering liability. The Company adopted the guidance
on the presentation of debt issuance costs on January 1, 2016, as required. As a result, the Company retrospectively applied the
guidance to the 2015 Consolidated Balance Sheet by reclassifying $599 of deferred financing costs previously classified in the
assets section.

Loans
Receivable   

In
December 2011, we originated two new loans and assumed a lender s position on a third loan, which, net of unearned loan
fees, had total balances of $5,218 and $6,004 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively (these amounts do not
include the construction loans mentioned below). These loans were all to borrowers that are affiliated with each other, and are
cross-collateralized. Collectively, the development loans and home construction loans to the borrower are referred to herein as
the  Pennsylvania Loans.  No individual impairment has been deemed necessary for these loans. The purpose of the loans
was to develop two subdivisions in a suburb of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The Hamlets subdivision is a five phase subdivision of
81 lots, of which 52 have been developed and sold, 15 are developed and not sold, and 13 are being developed as of September 30,
2016. The Tuscany subdivision is a single phase 18 lot subdivision, with 5 lots remaining as of September 30, 2016. A portion
of the collateral of the Pennsylvania Loans is preferred equity interests in us which might be difficult to sell to reduce the
loan balance.  

As
a result of amendments to the Credit Agreement, we converted $1,000 of the SF Loan from debt to preferred equity. The new preferred
equity serves as collateral for the Pennsylvania Loans. There is no liquid market for the preferred equity instrument, so we can
give no assurance as to our ability to generate any amount of proceeds from that collateral. We also reduced the balance of the
SF Loan by $125, which was added to the Interest Escrow, and repaid the remaining $375 with cash. The interest rate on the Existing
IMA Loan was raised to match the New IMA Loan. As of September 30, 2016, the Hoskins Group invests in our preferred equity in
an amount equal to $10 per closing of a lot payoff in the Hamlets or Tuscany subdivisions.  

Also
as a result of amendments to the Credit Agreement, we funded an additional $750 of interest escrow, we issued several letters
of credit relating to BMH Loan which totaled $90 and $68 September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively (the  Letter
of Credit ), and we issued cash bonds for development with $257 outstanding at both September 30, 2016 and December 31,
2015. The terms and conditions of the Pennsylvania Loans are set forth in further detail below.  

We
have other borrowers, all of whom borrow money for the purpose of building new homes.

below are included as part of the Pennsylvania Loans discussed above.  

(1)   
      The
    value is determined by the appraised value adjusted for remaining costs to be paid and third party mortgage balances. Part
    of this collateral is $1,100 of preferred equity in our Company. In the event of a foreclosure on the property securing certain
    of our loans, a portion of our collateral is preferred equity in our Company, which might be difficult to sell, which could
    impact our ability to eliminate the loan balance.

During
the first three quarters of 2016, we added 14 new customers and 6 new states. Our second largest customer stopped paying interest
on two large loans. This was resolved by the customer deeding one property to us in lieu of foreclosure, and the customer partnered
with another company to bring the other loan current. The new company also made a $97 deposit into an interest escrow to keep
the loan current. Another of our frequent borrowers has moved on to other lenders. We believe that overall demand for our product
is high. In the third quarter of 2016, we closed 16 loans with 10 customers in 9 states.

At
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, there were no loans acquired with deteriorated credit quality, loans past due 90 or
more days, impaired loans, or loans on nonaccrual status.  

The
special mention loan as of September 30, 2016 is a loan to our second largest borrower, in Sarasota, Florida. This customer stopped
paying interest on two large loans. This was resolved by the customer deeding one property to us in lieu of foreclosure, and the
customer partnered with another company to bring the other loan current. The new company also made a $97 deposit in June 2016
into an interest escrow to keep the loan current. We determined to keep this loan as a special mention loan at September 30, 2016.
There is no specific reserve for this loan, and it is still included in the collective reserve calculation.

Foreclosed
Assets   

Roll
forward of Foreclosed Assets:  

We
foreclosed on five properties during 2015, of which four were acquired at the foreclosure sale and one was acquired via a deed
in lieu of foreclosure. Three of the properties were lots in Georgia. We have an agreement with a builder to build a house on
one of the lots (which is complete as of September 30, 2016) and will likely start construction on a second home once the first
has a sales agreement. Two of the properties were partially completed homes in Louisiana, one has been finished and work is proceeding
to complete the second of these homes. We acquired one property via a deed in lieu of foreclosure during 2016. This property is
a beach lot in Sarasota, Florida. We have executed the seller s part of an option to purchase the property which expires
in December 2016. If that sale is executed, we will record a small gain on the sale.  

One
of the homes in Louisiana, and the beach lot in Florida are currently being marketed for sale. The remaining home in Louisiana
is progressing through construction. The home we built in Georgia is under contract to sell in November, which closing, if it
occurs, will provide for a small gain. We will most likely construct homes on the remaining two lots in Georgia, and we are progressing
to start one of those homes in the near future.  

Accrued
interest on loans   

The
interest our customers owe on loans was $208 and $146 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Of those figures,
$12 and $2 was interest past due by at least 1 day as of the same dates, respectively.  

Other
Assets   

Other
assets at September 30, 2016 were $89, of which $71 were for software and related equipment for loan document preparation. This
cost is being amortized over a three year period.  

Customer
Interest Escrow   

The
Pennsylvania Loans called for a funded interest escrow account which was funded with proceeds from the Pennsylvania Loans. The
initial funding on that interest escrow was $450. The balance as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was $365 and $267,
respectively. To the extent the balance is available in the interest escrow, interest due on certain loans is deducted from the
interest escrow on the date due. The interest escrow is increased by 20% of lot payoffs on the same loans, and by interest and/or
distributions on the SF Loan and Hoskins Group preferred equity. All of these transactions are noncash to the extent that the
total escrow amount does not need additional funding. The interest escrow is also used to contribute to the reduction of the $400
subordinated mortgage upon certain lot sales of the collateral of that loan.  

Thirteen
and ten other loans active as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 also have interest escrows. The cumulative balance of
all interest escrows other than the Pennsylvania Loans was $274 and $231 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.

Notes
Payable Unsecured   

At
the same time that we extended the Pennsylvania Loans in December 2011, we assumed a note payable to our borrowing customer for
$1,500, which was the balance until December 2014. This loan was unsecured and had the same priority as the Notes. It was also
collateral for the loans we extended to this customer. In December 2014, we converted $1,000 of this note payable to preferred
equity and moved $125 of the note payable to the interest escrow. In January 2015, we repaid the remaining $375 to the borrower.
In addition, we owed $10,689 and $8,496 in Notes payable under our Notes offering as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015,
respectively. In August 2015, we borrowed $500 through a note with Seven Kings Holdings, Inc. ( 7Kings ), which is
currently due in February of 2017. We also have two notes to a third party for $100 each which are due in June 2017 and April
2020. We expect our Notes payable unsecured balance to increase as we raise funds in our Notes offering.  

Notes
Payable Related Party   

We
have two lines of credit from affiliates, which had a combined, outstanding balance of $0 as of both September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015. We had $1,500 available to us on the affiliate lines as of both September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, although there
is no obligation of the affiliates to lend money up to the note amount. We intend to have a line of credit or multiple lines of
credit in the future, and intend to eventually replace these lines from affiliates with lines from unrelated financial institutions.
However, we can make no assurance that we will obtain a line of credit with an unrelated financial institution on favorable terms
or at all. Certain features of the purchase and sale agreement with the Loan Purchaser have added liquidity and flexibility, which
have lessened the need for the lines of credit from affiliates.  

S.K.
Funding, LLC ( S.K. Funding ), an affiliate of 7Kings, owns 4% of our common equity. S.K. Funding is also a buyer
in a purchase and sale agreement where we are the seller. 7Kings is an investor in our notes program for $500 and has a $500 unsecured
note due from us.  

Purchase
and Sale Agreements    

In
December 2014, the Company entered into a purchase and sale agreement with 1st Financial Bank USA whereby the purchaser may buy
loans offered to it by us, and we may be obligated to offer certain loans to purchaser. Purchaser is buying senior positions in
the loans they purchase, originally 50%, 60% on new loans as of January 2016, of each loan. Purchaser generally receives the interest
rate we charge the borrower (with a floor of 10%) on their portion of the loan balance, and we receive the rest of the interest
and all of the loan fee. We service the loans. There is an unlimited right for us to call any loan sold, however in any case of
such call, a minimum of 4% of the commitment amount of purchaser must have been received by purchaser in interest, or we must
make up the difference. Also, the purchaser has a put option, which is limited to 10% of the funding provided by purchaser under
all loans purchased in the trailing 12 months.  

In
April 2015, the Company entered into a purchase and sale agreement with 7Kings as purchaser and the Company as seller, whereby
7Kings buys loans offered to it by us, providing that their portions of the loans always total less than $1,500. On or about May
7, 2015, 7Kings assigned its right and interest in the purchase and sale agreement to S.K. Funding, an affiliate of 7Kings. S.K.
Funding may adjust the $1,500 with notice, but such change will not cause a buyback by us. S.K. Funding is buying pari-passu positions
in the loans they purchase, generally 50% of each loan. S.K. Funding generally receives a 9% interest rate on its portion of the
loan balance, and we receive the rest of the interest and all of the loan fees. We service the loans. There is an unlimited right
for us to call any loan sold. This transaction is accounted for as a secured line of credit. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we
entered into a modification of our agreement with S.K. Funding whereby S.K. Funding agreed to buy priority interests of $1,000
each in two large loans we originated. In the first quarter of 2016, after one of the $1,000 loans repaid, we entered into an
additional modification whereby S.K. Funding agreed to buy priority interests totaling $2,000 in a total of three large loans
we originated. The interest rate for the loans covered by these modifications is 9.5% to S.K. Funding. On June 30, 2016, one of
those two loans was terminated with a deed in lieu of foreclosure. The property is owned by us, and we owe S.K. Funding $1,000
on that property (secured by mortgage) to be repaid upon the sale of the property. This amount is still covered by our purchase
and sale agreement and is included in the totals in the chart below. On December 31, 2015, S.K. Funding purchased 4% of our common
equity from the Wallach family.  

The
purchase and sale agreements are recorded as secured borrowings.  

The
purchase and sale agreements are detailed below:  

The
$6,276 of loans which served as collateral for S.K. Funding, LLC does not include the book value of the foreclosed assets which
also secure their position, which amount is $1,813.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources   

Our
operations are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, particularly related to the concentration of our current operations,
a significant portion of which are to a single customer and geographic region, as well as the evolution of the current economic
environment and its impact on the United States real estate and housing markets. Both the concentration of risk and the economic
environment could directly or indirectly cause or magnify losses related to certain transactions and access to and cost of adequate
financing.  

The
Company s anticipated primary sources of liquidity going forward are:  

The
    purchase and sale agreements, which are allowing for a significant increase in loan balances;   

The
    continued issuance of Notes to the general public through our second public Notes offering, which was declared effective by
    the SEC on September 29, 2015, and has been registered and declared effective in 44 states as of September 30, 2016. We began
    to advertise for our Notes offerings in March 2013 and received an aggregate of approximately $10,689 and $8,496 in Notes
    proceeds as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively (net of redemptions). We anticipate continuing our capital
    raising efforts in 2016, focusing on the efforts that have proven fruitful;   

Interest
    income and/or principal repayments related to the loans. The Company s ability to fund its operations remains dependent
    upon the ability of our largest borrower, whose loan commitments represented 39% and 37% of our total outstanding loan commitments
    as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, to continue paying interest and/or principal. The risk of our
    largest customer not paying interest is mitigated in the short term by having an interest escrow, which had a balance of $365
    and $267 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. While a default by this large customer could impact
    our cash flow and/or profitability in the long term, we believe that, in the short term, a default might impact profitability,
    but not liquidity, as we are generally not receiving interest payments from the customer on the development loan portion of
    the customer s balance while the customer is performing (this interest is being credited from the interest escrow).
    This customer is in good standing with us and is current on their construction loan interest payments. As of September 30,
    2016, our next two largest customers make up 13% and 7% respectively of our loan commitments, with loans in Sarasota, Florida
    and Savannah, Georgia, respectively. As of December 31, 2015, our next two largest customers made up 22% and 6% respectively
    of our loan commitments, with loans in Sarasota, Florida and Columbia, South Carolina, respectively; and   

Funds
    borrowed from affiliated creditors.    

We
generated net income of $477 and $230 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively and cash flow from operations
of $734 and $743 for the same periods. There were many factors which cause our cash flow from operations to be higher than our
net income, the largest of which are the increase in accrued interest we owe our Note holders and the amortization of deferred
financing costs (which lowers our net income while not impacting our cash flow from operations). At September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015, we had cash on hand of $561 and $1,341, respectively, and our outstanding debt totaled $17,211 and $12,779, respectively,
of which $5,822 and $3,683 was secured, respectively. The secured amount is from our purchase and sale agreements, which add liquidity
and allow us to expand our business. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the amount that we have not loaned, but are
obligated to potentially lend to our customers based on our agreements with them, was $8,556 and $7,332, respectively. Our availability
on our line of credit from our members was $1,500 at both September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. Our members are not obligated
to fund requests under our line of credit.  

Our
current plan is to expand the commercial lending program by using current liquidity and available funding (including funding from
our Notes program). We have anticipated the costs of this expansion and the continuing costs of maintaining our public company
status, and we anticipate generating, through normal operations, the cash flows and liquidity necessary to meet our operating,
investing, and financing requirements. As noted above, the three most significant factors driving our current plans are the purchase
and sale agreements, continued payments of principal and/or interest by our largest borrower, and the public offering of Notes.
If actual results differ materially from our current plan or if expected financing is not available, we believe we have the ability
and intent to obtain funding and generate net worth through additional debt or equity infusions of cash, if needed. There can
be no assurance, however, that we will be able to implement our strategies or obtain additional financing under favorable terms,
if at all.  

Our
business of borrowing money and re-lending it to generate interest spread is our primary use of capital resources. There are several
risks in any financing company of this nature, and we will discuss significant risks here and how they relate to our Company and
what, if any, mitigation techniques we have or may employ.  

First,
any financial institution needs to match the maturities of its borrowings with the maturities of its assets. The bulk of most
financial institutions  borrowings are in the form of public investments or deposits. These generally have maturities that
are either set periods of time, or upon the demand of the investor/depositor. The risk is that either obligations come due before
funds are available to be paid out (a shortage of liquidity) or that funds are repaid before the obligation comes due (idle cash,
as described herein). To mitigate these risks, we are not offering demand deposits (for instance, a checking account). Instead,
we are offering Notes with varying maturities between one and four years, which are typically longer than the average life of
the loans we extend. However, we have the option to repay the Notes early, if we wish, without penalty. These items protect us
against this risk of matching of debt and asset maturity.  

Second,
financial institutions must have daily liquidity on their debt side, to offset variations in loan balances on a daily basis. Borrowers
can repay their Notes at any time, and they will request draws as they are ready for them. Further, construction loans are not
funded 100% initially, so there are contractual obligations on the lender s part to fund loans in the future. Most financial
institutions mitigate this risk by having a secured line of credit from the Federal Reserve Bank. We have the same risk from customer
repayments and draws as banks, and we intend to mitigate this risk by obtaining a secured line of credit with a bank. Our current
debt financing consists of the two demand loans from our members, our purchase and sale agreement, two unsecured notes, and our
unsecured Notes from the public offering. The loan balance from our members on both September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was
$0. We had balances on our purchase and sale agreements (which are treated like secured lines of credit in our consolidated financial
statements) of $5,822 and $3,683 on September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The loan balance on all unsecured
notes not part of the Notes program was $700 and $600 on September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The balance of
debt from the Notes offering was $10,689 and $8,496 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. If we are able
to refinance the demand loans with a bank line of credit, we intend to maintain the outstanding balance on the line at approximately
10% of our committed loan amount. Failure to refinance the demand loans in the future with a larger bank line of credit may result
in a lack of liquidity, or low loan production. Future lines of credit from banks will have expiration dates or be demand loans,
which will have risks associated with those maturities.  

Third,
financial institutions have the risk of swings in market rates on borrowing and lending, which can make borrowing money to fund
loans to their customers or fund their operations costly. The rates at which institutions can borrow are not necessarily tied
to the rates at which they can lend. In our case, we are lending to customers using a rate which varies monthly with our cost
of funds. So while we somewhat mitigate this risk, we are still open to the problem of, at the time of originating loans, wanting
to originate new loans at a rate that would be profitable, but that rate not being competitive in the market. Lack of lending
may cause us to repay Notes early and lose interest spread dollars, hurting our profitability and ability to repay.  

We
currently (or may in the future) generate liquidity from:  

proceeds
    from our purchase and sale agreements;   

proceeds
    from the Notes;   

interest
    and fee income;   

repayments
    of loan receivables;   

borrowings
    in the form of the demand loans from our members;   

borrowings
    from lines of credit with banks (not in place yet);   

sale
    of property obtained through foreclosure (none to date); and   

other
    sources as we determine in the future.   

We
currently (or may in the future) use liquidity to:  

make
    payments on other borrowings, including loans from affiliates;   

pay
    Notes on their scheduled due date and Notes that we are required to redeem early;   

make
    interest payments on the Notes; and   

to
    the extent we have remaining net proceeds and adequate cash on hand, fund any one or more of the following activities:   

to
    extend commercial construction loans to homebuilders to build single or multi-family homes or develop lots;   

to
    make distributions to equity owners, including the preferred equity;   

for
    working capital and other corporate purposes;   

to
    purchase defaulted secured debt from financial institutions at a discount;   

to
    purchase defaulted unsecured debt from suppliers to homebuilders at a discount and then secure it with real estate or other
    collateral;   

to
    purchase real estate, in which we will operate our business; and   

to
    redeem Notes which we have decided to redeem prior to maturity.   

The
Company s anticipated primary sources of liquidity going forward are the purchase and sale agreements, continued issuance
of Notes to the general public, interest income and principal repayments related to loans it extends, as well as funds borrowed
from affiliated creditors. Therefore, the Company s ability to fund its operations is dependent upon these sources of liquidity.  

In
the fourth quarter of 2016, the company signed an agreement to buy the shell of an office building in which to operate, located
near its current office in Jacksonville, Florida. The company will close on this building purchase in the first quarter of 2017,
and will need to fund the cost of the interior build out. The company anticipates the total cost to be approximately $850, and
intends to seek reasonable bank financing for a portion of that, if available.  

Inflation,
Interest Rates, and Housing Starts   

Since
we are in the housing industry, we are affected by factors that impact that industry. Housing starts impact our customers 
ability to sell their homes. Faster sales mean higher effective interest rates for us, as the recognition of fees we charge is
spread over a shorter period. Slower sales mean lower effective interest rates for us. Slower sales are likely to increase the
default rate we experience.  

Housing
inflation has a positive impact on our operations. When we lend initially, we are lending a percentage of a home s expected
value, based on historical sales. If those estimates prove to be low (in an inflationary market), the percentage we loaned of
the value actually decreases, reducing potential losses on defaulted loans. The opposite is true in a deflationary housing price
market. It is our opinion that values are average in many of the housing markets in the U.S. today, and our lending against these
values is safer than loans made by financial institutions in 2006 to 2008.  

Interest
rates have several impacts on our business. First, rates affect housing (starts, home size, etc.). High long term interest rates
may decrease housing starts, having the effects listed above. Higher interest rates will also affect our investors. We believe
that there will be a spread between the rate our Notes yield to our investors and the rates the same investors could get on deposits
at FDIC insured institutions. We also believe that the spread may need to widen if these rates rise. For instance, if we pay 7%
above average CD rates when CDs are paying 0.5%, when CDs are paying 3%, we may have to have a larger than 7% difference. This
may cause our lending rates, which are based on our cost of funds, to be uncompetitive. High interest rates may also increase
builder defaults, as interest payments may become a higher portion of operating costs for the builder. Below is a chart showing
three year U.S. treasury rates, which are being used by us here to approximate CD rates. Short term interest rates have risen
slightly but are generally low historically.

Housing
prices are also generally correlated with housing starts, so that increases in housing starts usually coincide with increases
in housing values, and the reverse is generally true. Below is a graph showing single family housing starts from 2000 through
today.

To
date, changes in housing starts, CD rates, and inflation have not had a material impact on our business.

Sheet Arrangements

of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had no off-balance sheet transactions, nor do we currently have any such arrangements

As

regarding required disclosure.

                                         Agreement, we agreed to issue and sell to Investor s Mark Acquisitions, LLC ( IMA )
                                         and Benjamin Marcus Homes, L.L.C. ( BMH ), in multiple closings, up to 5
                                         Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units ( Preferred Units ) at a liquidation
                                         preference of $100,000 per unit. Specifically, IMA and BMH agreed to purchase 1/10th
                                         of a Preferred Unit for $10,000 upon the closing of each lot sold by IMA in the Tuscany

    loan balances, 4% was used to increase cash for future loan balances, 11% was used to reduce senior debt, and 1% was used
