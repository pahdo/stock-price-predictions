Note 1     Organization    
  Healthcare Trust, Inc. (including, as required by context, Healthcare Trust Operating Partnership, LP (the "OP") and its subsidiaries, the "Company") invests in healthcare real estate, such as seniors housing and medical office buildings ("MOB"), located in the United States for investment purposes. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company owned   163   properties located in   29   states and comprised of   8.4 million   rentable square feet. 
  The Company, which was incorporated on October 15, 2012, is a Maryland corporation that elected and qualified to be taxed as a real estate investment trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes ("REIT") beginning with its taxable year ended December 31, 2013. Substantially all of the Company's business is conducted through the OP. 
  In February 2013, the Company commenced its initial public offering (the "IPO") on a "reasonable best efforts" basis of up to   $1.7 billion   of common stock,   $0.01   par value per share, at a price of   $25.00   per share, subject to certain volume and other discounts. The Company closed its IPO in November 2014. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had received   $2.2 billion   from its IPO and from proceeds received under the distribution reinvestment plan ("DRIP"). 
  In 2015, the Company s board of directors (the "Board") determined that it was in the Company s best interest to evaluate strategic alternatives, including a listing on a national securities exchange. In April 2016, the Board, led by its independent directors, announced that it had initiated a strategic review process (the "Strategic Review") to identify, examine, and consider a range of strategic alternatives available to the Company with the objective of maximizing shareholder value. The Board formed a special committee (the "Special Committee") to evaluate various options in connection with the Strategic Review. The Special Committee engaged Morgan Stanley   Co. LLC ("Morgan Stanley") and KeyBanc Capital Markets ("KeyBanc") as financial advisors, with Morgan Stanley as lead advisor. The Board also formed a separate special committee to address conflicts of interest. The Board retained Gibson, Dunn   Crutcher LLP ("Gibson") as special legal counsel in connection with the Strategic Review.  
  On October 6, 2016, the Company announced that the Special Committee had concluded the Strategic Review and recommended that the Company continue to execute its business plan and focus on managing and strengthening its assets. The Special Committee and the committee to address conflicts of interest were terminated by the Board.  
  On April 7, 2016 (the "NAV Pricing Date"), the Board approved an estimate of per share net asset value ("NAV"). Subsequent valuations will occur periodically, at the discretion of the Board, provided that such estimates will be made at least annually. Pursuant to the DRIP, the Company's stockholders can elect to reinvest distributions by purchasing shares of the Company's common stock. Prior to the NAV Pricing Date, the Company offered shares pursuant to the DRIP at   $23.75   per share, which was   95%   of the initial offering price of shares of common stock in the IPO. Effective April 7, 2016, the Company began offering shares pursuant to the DRIP at the then-current NAV approved by the Board (see   Note 8     Common Stock  ). 
  The Company has no employees. Healthcare Trust Advisors, LLC (the "Advisor") has been retained by the Company to manage the Company's affairs on a day-to-day basis. The Company has retained Healthcare Trust Properties, LLC (the "Property Manager") to serve as the Company's property manager. The Advisor and Property Manager are under common control with AR Global Investments, LLC (the successor business to AR Capital, LLC, "AR Global"), the parent of the Company's sponsor, American Realty Capital VII, LLC (the "Sponsor"), as a result of which they are related parties, and each have received or will receive compensation, fees and expense reimbursements from the Company for services related to managing its business. The Advisor, Healthcare Trust Special Limited Partnership, LLC (the "Special Limited Partner") and Property Manager also have received or will receive compensation, fees and expense reimbursements related to the investment and management of the Company's assets.  
   
  Note 2   Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 
  The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements of the Company included herein were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP") for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. The information furnished includes all adjustments and accruals of a normal recurring nature, which, in the opinion of management, are necessary for a fair presentation of results for the interim periods. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The results of operations for the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   are not necessarily indicative of the results for the entire year or any subsequent interim period.

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

  (Unaudited) 

These unaudited consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto as of and for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , which are included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on   March 11, 2016  .  There have been no significant changes to the Company's significant accounting policies during the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   other than the updates described below. 
  Reclassifications 
  Certain prior year amounts within rental income, resident services and fee income, contingent purchase price consideration, interest and other income, cash flows from operating activities and cash flows from financing activities have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation. 
  Principles of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation  
  The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, its wholly-owned subsidiaries and consolidated joint venture arrangements in which the Company has controlling financial interests. The portions of the consolidated joint venture arrangements not owned by the Company are presented as non-controlling interests as of and during the period consolidated. All inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. 
  The Company evaluates its relationships and investments to determine if it has variable interests. A variable interest is an investment or other interest that will absorb portions of an entity's expected losses or receive portions of the entity's expected residual returns. If the Company determines that it has a variable interest in an entity, it evaluates whether such interest is in a variable interest entity ("VIE"). A VIE is broadly defined as an entity where either (1) the equity investors as a group, if any, lack the power through voting or similar rights to direct the activities of an entity that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance or (2) the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity's activities without additional subordinated financial support. The Company consolidates any VIEs when it is determined to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE's operations. 
  A variable interest holder is considered to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE if it has the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance and has the obligation to absorb losses of, or the right to receive benefits from, the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE. The Company qualitatively assesses whether it is (or is not) the primary beneficiary of a VIE. Consideration of various factors include, but are not limited to, the Company's ability to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance, its form of ownership interest, its representation on the entity's governing body, the size and seniority of its investment, its ability and the rights of other investors to participate in policy making decisions and to replace the manager of and/or liquidate the entity. 
  The Company continually evaluates the need to consolidate joint ventures based on standards set forth in GAAP. In determining whether the Company has a controlling interest in a joint venture and the requirement to consolidate the accounts of that entity, management considers factors such as ownership interest, power to make decisions and contractual and substantive participating rights of the partners/members as well as whether the entity is a VIE for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. 
  The Company has determined the OP is a VIE of which the Company is the primary beneficiary. Substantially all of the Company's assets and liabilities are held by the OP. 
  Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued revised guidance relating to revenue recognition. Under the revised guidance, an entity is required to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The revised guidance was to become effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption was not permitted under GAAP. The revised guidance allows entities to apply the full retrospective or modified retrospective transition method upon adoption. In July 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date of the revised guidance by one year to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, although entities will be allowed to early adopt the guidance as of the original effective date. The Company has not yet selected a transition method and is currently evaluating the impact of this new guidance.

  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

  (Unaudited) 

In January 2015, the FASB issued updated guidance that eliminates from GAAP the concept of an event or transaction that is unusual in nature and occurs infrequently being treated as an extraordinary item. The revised guidance is effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. Any amendments may be applied either prospectively or retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. Early adoption was permitted provided that the guidance was applied from the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The Company elected to adopt this new guidance as of September 30, 2015. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
  In February 2015, the FASB amended the accounting for consolidation of certain legal entities. The amendments modify the evaluation of whether certain legal entities are VIEs or voting interest entities, eliminates the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership and affect the consolidation analysis of reporting entities that are involved with VIEs (particularly those that have fee arrangements and related party relationships). The revised guidance is effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption was permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The Company has elected to adopt this guidance effective January 1, 2016. The Company has evaluated the impact of the adoption of this new guidance on its consolidated financial statements and has determined that the OP is considered a VIE. However, the Company meets the disclosure exemption criteria as the Company is the primary beneficiary of the VIE and the Company s partnership interest in a business and the assets of the OP can be used for purposes other than settling its obligations, such as paying distributions. As such, this standard did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 
  In April 2015, the FASB amended the presentation of debt issuance costs on the balance sheet. The amendment requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability. In August 2015, the FASB added that, for line of credit arrangements, the SEC staff would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line, regardless of whether or not there are any outstanding borrowings. The revised guidance is effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption was permitted for financial statements that have not previously been issued. The Company has elected to adopt this guidance effective January 1, 2016. The adoption of this revised guidance resulted in the reclassification of   $2.0 million   and   $2.2 million   of deferred financing costs related to the Company's mortgage notes payable from deferred costs, net to mortgage notes payable, net of deferred financing costs in the Company's consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2015. 
  In September 2015, the FASB issued an update that eliminates the requirement to adjust provisional amounts from a business combination and the related impact on earnings by restating prior period financial statements for measurement period adjustments. The new guidance requires that the cumulative impact of measurement period adjustments on current and prior periods, including the prior period impact on depreciation, amortization and other income statement items and their related tax effects, shall be recognized in the period the adjustment amount is determined. The cumulative adjustment would be reflected within the respective financial statement line items affected. The revised guidance is effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption was permitted. The Company elected to adopt this guidance as of September 30, 2015. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact to the Company's financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
  In January 2016, the FASB issued an update that amends the recognition and measurement of financial instruments. The new guidance revises an entity s accounting related to equity investments and the presentation of certain fair value changes for financial liabilities measured at fair value. Among other things, it also amends the presentation and disclosure requirements associated with the fair value of financial instruments. The revised guidance is effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is not permitted for most of the amendments in the update. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this new guidance.

In February 2016, the FASB issued an update that sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both lessees and lessors. The new standard requires lessees to apply a dual approach, classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase by the lessee. This classification will determine whether lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight line basis over the term of the lease, respectively. A lessee is also required to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term greater than 12 months regardless of their classification. Leases with a term of 12 months or less will be accounted for similar to existing guidance for operating leases today. The new standard requires lessors to account for leases using an approach that is substantially equivalent to existing guidance for sales-type leases, direct financing leases and operating leases. The revised guidance is effective on January 1, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this new guidance. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued guidance which requires an entity to determine whether the nature of its promise to provide goods or services to a customer is performed in a principal or agent capacity and to recognize revenue in a gross or net manner based on its principal/agent designation. This guidance is effective for public business entities for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this new guidance.  
  In March 2016, the FASB issued an update that changes the accounting for certain aspects of share-based compensation. Among other things, the revised guidance allows companies to make an entity-wide accounting policy election to either estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest or account for forfeitures when they occur. The revised guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The Company has adopted the provisions of this guidance beginning January 1, 2016 and determined that there is no impact to the Company s consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The Company's policy is to account for forfeitures as they occur. 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued guidance on how certain transactions should be classified and presented in the statement of cash flows as either operating, investing or financing activities. Among other things, the update provides specific guidance on where to classify debt prepayment and extinguishment costs, payments for contingent consideration made after a business combination and distributions received from equity method investments. The revised guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this new guidance. 
  In October 2016, the FASB issued guidance where a reporting entity will need to evaluate if it should consolidate a VIE. The amendments change the evaluation of whether a reporting entity is the primary beneficiary of a VIE by changing how a single decision maker of a VIE treats indirect interests in the entity held through related parties that are under common control with the reporting entity. The revised guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this new guidance.

  As of   December 31, 2015  , the Company had investment securities with an aggregate fair value of   $1.1 million  . These investments were considered available-for-sale securities and, therefore, increases or decreases in the fair value of these investments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income as a component of equity on the consolidated balance sheets unless the securities are considered to be other than temporarily impaired, at which time the losses would be reclassified to expense.

The following table details the unrealized gains and losses on investment securities as of   December 31, 2015  : 

During the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company sold its investments in preferred stock with a cost basis and sale price of   $1.1 million  , which resulted in a realized gain on sale of investment of   $0.1 million  . 
  During the three months ended   September 30, 2015  , the Company sold certain of its investments in preferred stock, common stock and real estate income funds with a cost basis of   $14.9 million   for   $15.1 million  , which resulted in a realized gain on sale of investment of   $0.2 million  . During the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  , the Company sold certain of its investments in preferred stock, common stock and real estate income funds and its investment in a senior note with a cost basis of   $18.8 million   for   $19.3 million  , which resulted in a realized gain on sale of investment of   $0.4 million  .  
   
  Note 5   Revolving Credit Facility  
  On March 21, 2014, the Company entered into a senior secured credit facility in the amount of   $50.0 million   (the "Credit Facility"). On April 15, 2014 the amount available under the Credit Facility was increased to   $200.0 million  . 
  On June 26, 2015, the Company entered into an amendment to the Credit Facility which, among other things, allowed for borrowings of up to   $500.0 million  . On July 31, 2015, the available borrowings were increased to   $565.0 million  . The Credit Facility also contains a subfacility for letters of credit of up to   $25.0 million  . The Credit Facility contains an "accordion" feature to allow the Company, under certain circumstances, to increase the aggregate borrowings under the Credit Facility to a maximum of   $750.0 million  . 
  The Company has the option, based upon its leverage, to have the Credit Facility priced at either: (a) LIBOR, plus an applicable margin that ranges from   1.60%   to   2.20%  ; or (b) the Base Rate, plus an applicable margin that ranges from   0.35%   to   0.95%  . Base Rate is defined in the Credit Facility as the greater of (i) the fluctuating annual rate of interest announced from time to time by the lender as its  prime rate,  (ii)   0.5%   above the federal funds effective rate or (iii) the applicable one-month LIBOR plus   1.0%  . 
  The Credit Facility provides for monthly interest payments for each Base Rate loan and periodic payments for each LIBOR loan, based upon the applicable LIBOR loan period, with all principal outstanding being due on the maturity date of March 21, 2019. The Credit Facility may be prepaid at any time, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty (subject to standard breakage costs). In the event of a default, the lender has the right to terminate its obligations under the Credit Facility and to accelerate the payment on any unpaid principal amount of all outstanding loans. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the balance outstanding under the Credit Facility was   $476.5 million  , with an effective interest rate of   2.0%  . The Company's unused borrowing capacity was   $41.5 million  , based on assets assigned to the Credit Facility as of   September 30, 2016  . Availability of borrowings is based on a pool of eligible unencumbered real estate assets. There was   $430.0 million   in advances outstanding as of   December 31, 2015  . 
  The Credit Facility requires the Company to meet certain financial covenants, including the maintenance of certain financial ratios (such as specified debt to equity and debt service coverage ratios) as well as the maintenance of a minimum net worth. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company was in compliance with the financial covenants under the Credit Facility.

Note 7   Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
  GAAP establishes a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on the observability of inputs used in measuring financial instruments at fair value. GAAP establishes market-based or observable inputs as the preferred source of values, followed by valuation models using management assumptions in the absence of market inputs. The three levels of the hierarchy are described below:  
  Level 1     Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date.  
  Level 2     Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset and liability or can be corroborated with observable market data for substantially the entire contractual term of the asset or liability.  
  Level 3     Unobservable inputs that reflect the entity's own assumptions that market participants would use in the pricing of the asset or liability and are consequently not based on market activity, but rather through particular valuation techniques.  
  The determination of where an asset or liability falls in the hierarchy requires significant judgment and considers factors specific to the asset or liability. In instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Company evaluates its hierarchy disclosures each quarter and depending on various factors, it is possible that an asset or liability may be classified differently from quarter to quarter. However, the Company expects that changes in classifications between levels will be rare. 
  The Company has or had investments in common stock, redeemable preferred stock, real estate income funds and a senior note that are traded in active markets and therefore, due to the availability of quoted market prices in active markets, the Company has classified these investments as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy. 
  The following table presents information about the Company's assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of   December 31, 2015  , aggregated by the level in the fair value hierarchy within which those instruments fall. The Company did not own any assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of   September 30, 2016  . 

The Company is required to disclose the fair value of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that value. The fair value of short-term financial instruments such as cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, straight-line rent receivable, net, prepaid expenses and other assets, deferred costs, net, accounts payable and accrued expenses, deferred rent and distributions payable approximates their carrying value on the consolidated balance sheets due to their short-term nature. The fair values of the Company's remaining financial instruments that are not reported at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets are reported below: 

_______________________________ 
   The fair value of the mortgage notes payable is estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis, based on the Advisor's experience with similar types of borrowing arrangements. Advances under the Credit Facility are considered to be reported at fair value, because the Credit Facility's interest rate varies with changes in LIBOR.

Note 8     Common Stock    
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Company had   88.6 million   and   86.1 million   shares of common stock outstanding, respectively, including unvested restricted shares and shares issued pursuant to the DRIP and had received total proceeds of   $2.2 billion   and   $2.1 billion  , respectively, including proceeds from shares issued pursuant to the DRIP. 
  In April 2013, the Board authorized, and the Company declared, a distribution payable on a monthly basis to stockholders of record on a daily basis at a rate equal to   $0.0046575343   per day, which is equivalent to   $1.70   per annum, per share of common stock, which began in May 2013. In March 2016, the Board ratified the existing distribution amount equivalent to   $1.70   per annum, and, for calendar year 2016, affirmed a change to the daily distribution payable to stockholders of record each day during the applicable period to   $0.0046448087   per day per share of common stock to accurately reflect that 2016 is a leap year. Distributions are payable by the 5th day following each month end to stockholders of record at the close of business each day during the prior month. Distribution payments are dependent on the availability of funds. The Board may reduce the amount of distributions paid or suspend distribution payments at any time and therefore distribution payments are not assured. 
  Share Repurchase Program 
  The Board has adopted a Share Repurchase Program (as amended, the "SRP") which enables stockholders to sell their shares to the Company in limited circumstances. The SRP permits investors to sell their shares back to the Company after they have held them for at least one year, subject to the significant conditions and limitations described below. 
  Prior to the time that the Company s shares are listed on a national securities exchange and until the NAV Pricing Date (other than with respect to a repurchase request that was made in connection with a stockholder's death or disability), the repurchase price per share depended on the length of time investors held such shares, as follows: after one year from the purchase date   the lower of   $23.13   or   92.5%   of the amount they actually paid for each share; after two years from the purchase date   the lower of   $23.75   or   95.0%   of the amount they actually paid for each share; after three years from the purchase date   the lower of   $24.38   or   97.5%   of the amount they actually paid for each share; and after four years from the purchase date   the lower of   $25.00   or   100.0%   of the amount they actually paid for each share (in each case, as adjusted for any stock distributions, combinations, splits and recapitalizations). In cases of requests for death and disability, the repurchase price was be equal to the price actually paid for each share. 
  In accordance with the First SRP Amendment (described below) and beginning with the NAV Pricing Date, the price per share that the Company will pay to repurchase its shares will be equal to its NAV multiplied by a percentage equal to (i)   92.5%  , if the person seeking repurchase has held his or her shares for a period greater than one year and less than two years; (ii)   95.0%  , if the person seeking repurchase has held his or her shares for a period greater than two years and less than three years; (iii)   97.5%  , if the person seeking repurchase has held his or her shares for a period greater than three years and less than four years; or (iv)   100.0%  , if the person seeking repurchase has held his or her shares for a period greater than four years. In cases of requests for death and disability, the repurchase prices will be equal to NAV at the time of repurchase. Subject to limited exceptions, stockholders who redeem their shares of our common stock within the first four months from the date of purchase will be subject to a short-term trading fee of   2%   of the aggregate NAV per share of the shares of common stock received.  
  Repurchases of shares of the Company's common stock, when requested, are at the sole discretion of the Board. Until the First SRP Amendment (described below), the Company limited the number of shares repurchased during any calendar year to   5%   of the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding on December 31st of the previous calendar year. In addition, the Company was only authorized to repurchase shares in a given quarter up to the amount of proceeds received from its DRIP in that same quarter. 
  On January 26, 2016, the Board approved and amended the SRP (the "First SRP Amendment") to supersede and replace the existing SRP. Under the First SRP Amendment, repurchases of shares of the Company's common stock, when requested, are at the sole discretion of the Board and generally will be made semiannually (each six-month period ending June 30 or December 31, a  fiscal semester ). Repurchases for any fiscal semester will be limited to a maximum of   2.5%   of the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the previous fiscal year (the "Prior Year Outstanding Shares"), with a maximum for any fiscal year of   5.0%   of the Prior Year Outstanding Shares. In addition, the Company is only authorized to repurchase shares in a given fiscal semester up to the amount of proceeds received from its DRIP in that same fiscal semester. If the NAV Pricing Date occurs during any fiscal semester, any repurchase requests received during such fiscal semester will be paid at the applicable NAV then in effect.

On June 28, 2016, the Board further amended the Company s SRP (the "Second SRP Amendment") to provide for one twelve-month repurchase period for calendar year 2016 (the  2016 Repurchase Period ) instead of two semi-annual periods ending June 30 and December 31. The annual limit on repurchases under the SRP remains unchanged and continues to be limited to a maximum of   5.0%   of the Prior Year Outstanding Shares and is subject to the terms and limitations set forth in the SRP. Accordingly, the 2016 Repurchase Period will be limited to a maximum of   5.0%   of the Prior Year Outstanding Shares and continue to be subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the SRP, as amended. Following calendar year 2016, the repurchase periods will return to two semi-annual periods and applicable limitations set forth in the SRP. The Second SRP Amendment also provides, for calendar year 2016 only, that any amendments, suspensions or terminations of the SRP will become effective on the day following the Company s public announcement of such amendments, suspension or termination. The Second SRP Amendment became effective on July 30, 2016 and will only apply to repurchase periods in calendar year 2016. 
  When a stockholder requests redemption and the redemption is approved, the Company will reclassify such obligation from equity to a liability based on the settlement value of the obligation. Shares purchased under the SRP will have the status of authorized but unissued shares. The following table reflects the number of shares repurchased cumulatively through   September 30, 2016  : 

_____________________________ 
            (2) 
    Excludes   2.4 million   shares that have been requested for repurchase and are not yet fulfilled as of   September 30, 2016  . These shares, and all additional shares requested prior to December 31, 2016, will be considered for repurchase, to the extent the requests are not withdrawn by December 31, 2016. All requested shares will be subject to the annual limitations set forth in the SRP. The   6,660   shares above represent unaccrued repurchases for the year ended December 31, 2015 that were finalized in January 2016.  
     Distribution Reinvestment Plan 
  Pursuant to the DRIP, stockholders may elect to reinvest distributions by purchasing shares of common stock in lieu of receiving cash. No dealer manager fees or selling commissions are paid with respect to shares purchased under the DRIP. The shares purchased pursuant to the DRIP have the same rights and are treated in the same manner as the shares issued pursuant to the IPO. The Board may designate that certain cash or other distributions be excluded from reinvestment pursuant to the DRIP. The Company has the right to amend any aspect of the DRIP or terminate the DRIP with ten days' notice to participants. Shares issued under the DRIP are recorded as equity in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet in the period distributions are declared. During the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company issued   2.4 million   and   2.5 million   shares of common stock pursuant to the DRIP, generating aggregate proceeds of   $56.0 million   and   $58.8 million  , respectively. 
   
  Note 9       Related Party Transactions and Arrangements 
  As of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  , the Special Limited Partner owned   8,888   shares of the Company's outstanding common stock. The Advisor and its affiliates may incur and pay costs and fees on behalf of the Company. 
  Realty Capital Securities, LLC (the "Former Dealer Manager") served as the dealer manager of the IPO. American National Stock Transfer, LLC ("ANST"), a subsidiary of the parent company of the Former Dealer Manager, provided other general professional services through January 2016. RCS Capital Corporation ("RCAP"), the parent company of the Former Dealer Manager and certain of its affiliates that provided the Company with services, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in January 2016, prior to which it was also under common control with AR Global, the parent of the Company's Sponsor. In May 2016, RCAP and its affiliated debtors emerged from bankruptcy under the new name Aretec Group, Inc.

On January 14, 2015, the Company purchased the Specialty Hospital portfolio from American Realty Capital Healthcare Trust, Inc. ("HCT") for a contract purchase price of   $39.4 million  . At the time of such purchase, the Sponsor and the Advisor and the sponsor and advisor of HCT were under common control. 
  The limited partnership agreement of the OP provides for a special allocation, solely for tax purposes, of excess depreciation deductions of up to   $10.0 million   to the Company's Advisor, a limited partner of the OP.  In connection with this special allocation, the Company's Advisor has agreed to restore a deficit balance in its capital account in the event of a liquidation of the OP and has agreed to provide a guaranty or indemnity of indebtedness of the OP. 
  Fees Paid in Connection with the IPO 
  The Former Dealer Manager was paid fees in connection with the sale of the Company's common stock in the IPO. The Company paid the Former Dealer Manager a selling commission of up to   7.0%   of the per share purchase price of offering proceeds before reallowance of commissions earned by participating broker-dealers. In addition, the Company paid the Former Dealer Manager up to   3.0%   of the gross proceeds from the sale of shares, before reallowance to participating broker-dealers, as a dealer manager fee. The Former Dealer Manager was permitted to reallow its dealer manager fee to participating broker-dealers. A participating broker-dealer could elect to receive a fee equal to   7.5%   of the gross proceeds from the sale of shares by such participating broker-dealer, with   2.5%   thereof paid at the time of such sale and   1.0%   thereof paid on each anniversary of the closing of such sale up to and including the fifth anniversary of the closing of such sale. If this option had been elected, the dealer manager fee would have been reduced to   2.5%   of gross proceeds. During the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  , the Company received approximately   $2,000   from the Former Dealer Manager for an unconsummated share transaction. The Company did not incur any commissions or fees in connection with the sale of the Company's common stock in the IPO from the Former Dealer Manager during the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and the   three months   ended   September 30, 2015  . The Company did not have any amounts outstanding to the Former Dealer Manager for fees in connection with the sale of the Company's common stock in the IPO as of   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  . 
  The Advisor and its affiliates received compensation and reimbursement for services relating to the IPO, including transfer agent services provided by an affiliate of the Former Dealer Manager.  All offering costs incurred by the Company or its affiliated entities on behalf of the Company were charged to additional paid-in capital on the accompanying balance sheet during the IPO. The Company did not incur any charges or reimbursements for services relating to the IPO from the Advisor or any of its affiliates during the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   or   2015  . The Company did not have any amounts outstanding to the Advisor or any of its affiliates for charges or reimbursements for services relating to the IPO as of   September 30, 2016   or   December 31, 2015  . 
  The Company was responsible for paying offering and related costs from the IPO, excluding commissions and dealer manager fees, up to a maximum of   2.0%   of gross proceeds received from the IPO, measured at the end of the IPO. Offering costs, excluding selling commissions and dealer manager fees, in excess of the   2.0%   cap as of the end of the IPO were to be the Advisor's responsibility. As of the end of the IPO, offering and related costs, excluding selling commissions and dealer manager fees, did not exceed   2.0%   of gross proceeds received from the IPO.  In aggregate, offering costs including selling commissions and dealer manager fees were the Company's responsibility up to a maximum of   12.0%   of the gross proceeds received from the IPO as determined at the end of the IPO.  As of the end of the IPO in November 2014, offering costs were less than   12.0%   of the gross proceeds received in the IPO.  
  Fees Paid in Connection With the Operations of the Company 
  The Advisor is paid an acquisition fee equal to   1.0%   of the contract purchase price of each acquired property and   1.0%   of the amount advanced for a loan or other investment. The Advisor is also reimbursed for services provided for which it incurs investment-related expenses, or insourced expenses. The amount reimbursed for insourced expenses may not exceed   0.5%   of the contract purchase price of each acquired property and   0.5%   of the amount advanced for a loan or other investment. Additionally, the Company reimburses the Advisor for third party acquisition expenses. The aggregate amount of acquisition fees and financing coordination fees (as described below) may not exceed   1.5%   of the contract purchase price and the amount advanced for a loan or other investment for all the assets acquired. In no event will the total of all acquisition fees, acquisition expenses and any financing coordination fees payable with respect to the Company's portfolio of investments or reinvestments exceed   4.5%   of the contract purchase price of the Company's portfolio to be measured at the close of the acquisition phase or   4.5%   of the amount advanced for all loans or other investments.

If the Advisor provides services in connection with the origination or refinancing of any debt that the Company obtains and uses to acquire properties or to make other permitted investments, or that is assumed, directly or indirectly, in connection with the acquisition of properties, the Company will pay the Advisor a financing coordination fee equal to   0.75%   of the amount available and/or outstanding under such financing, subject to certain limitations.  
  Until March 31, 2015, for its asset management services, the Company issued the Advisor an asset management subordinated participation by causing the OP to issue (subject to periodic approval by the Board) to the Advisor performance-based restricted, forfeitable partnership units of the OP designated as "Class B Units." The Class B Units were intended to be profit interests and vest, and are no longer subject to forfeiture, at such time as: (x) the value of the OP's assets plus all distributions made equals or exceeds the total amount of capital contributed by investors plus a   6.0%   cumulative, pre-tax, non-compounded annual return thereon (the "economic hurdle"); (y) any one of the following occurs: (1) a listing; (2) an other liquidity event or (3) the termination of the advisory agreement by an affirmative vote of a majority of the Company's independent directors without cause; and (z) the Advisor is still providing advisory services to the Company (the "performance condition"). Unvested Class B Units will be forfeited immediately if: (a) the advisory agreement is terminated for any reason other than a termination without cause; or (b) the advisory agreement is terminated by an affirmative vote of a majority of the Company's independent directors without cause before the economic hurdle has been met. 
  When approved by the Board, the Class B Units were issued to the Advisor quarterly in arrears pursuant to the terms of the limited partnership agreement of the OP.  The number of Class B Units issued in any quarter was equal to: (i) the excess of (A) the product of (y) the cost of assets multiplied by (z)   0.1875%   over (B) any amounts payable as an oversight fee (as described below) for such calendar quarter; divided by (ii) the value of one share of common stock as of the last day of such calendar quarter, which is equal initially to   $22.50   (the IPO price minus the selling commissions and dealer manager fees). The value of issued Class B Units will be determined and expensed when the Company deems the achievement of the performance condition to be probable.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company cannot determine the probability of achieving the performance condition. The Advisor receives distributions on vested and unvested Class B Units equal to the distribution rate received on the Company's common stock. Such distributions on issued Class B Units are included in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss until the performance condition is considered probable to occur. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Board had approved the issuance of   359,250   Class B Units to the Advisor in connection with this arrangement. 
  On May 12, 2015, the Company, the OP and the Advisor entered into an amendment (the  Amendment ) to the advisory agreement, which, among other things, provided that the Company would cease causing the OP to issue Class B Units in the OP to the Advisor or its assignees related to any period ending after March 31, 2015. Effective April 1, 2015, the Company began paying an asset management fee to the Advisor or its assignees as compensation for services rendered in connection with the management of the Company s assets. The asset management fee is payable on the first business day of each month in the amount of   0.0625%   multiplied by the lesser of (a) cost of assets or (b) fair value of assets for the preceding monthly period. The asset management fee is payable to the Advisor or its assignees in cash, in shares, or a combination of both, the form of payment to be determined in the sole discretion of the Advisor. For the purposes of the payment of any fees in shares (a) prior to the NAV Pricing Date, each share was valued at   $22.50  , (b) after the NAV Pricing Date and prior to any listing on a national securities exchange, if it occurs, each share will be valued at the then-current NAV per share and (c) at all other times, each share shall be valued by the Board in good faith at the fair market value. 
  Unless the Company contracts with a third party, the Company pays the Property Manager a property management fee of   1.5%   of gross revenues from the Company's stand-alone single-tenant net leased properties and   2.5%   of gross revenues from all other types of properties, respectively. The Company also reimburses the Property Manager for property level expenses. If the Company contracts directly with third parties for such services, the Company will pay them customary market fees and will pay the Property Manager an oversight fee of up to   1.0%   of the gross revenues of the property managed.  In no event will the Company pay the Property Manager or any affiliate of the Property Manager both a property management fee and an oversight fee with respect to any particular property.

Effective June 1, 2013, the Company entered into an agreement with the Former Dealer Manager to provide strategic advisory services and investment banking services required in the ordinary course of the Company's business, such as performing financial analysis, evaluating publicly traded comparable companies and assisting in developing a portfolio composition strategy, a capitalization structure to optimize future liquidity options and structuring operations. Strategic advisory fees were amortized over the estimated remaining term of the IPO and, as such, have been fully amortized as of December 31, 2014. The Former Dealer Manager and its affiliates also previously provided transfer agency services, as well as transaction management and other professional services. These fees were included in general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss.  
  The following table details amounts incurred, forgiven and payable in connection with the Company's operations-related services described above as of and for the periods presented: 

_______________ 
           (1)  
    Prior to April 1, 2015, the Company caused the OP to issue (subject to periodic approval by the Board) to the Advisor restricted performance based Class B Units for asset management services. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Board had approved the issuance of   359,250   Class B Units to the Advisor in connection with this arrangement. Effective April 1, 2015, in connection with the Amendment, the Company began paying an asset management fee to the Advisor or its assignees in cash, in shares, or a combination of both and no longer issues any Class B Units. 
     The Company reimburses the Advisor's costs of providing administrative services, subject to the limitation that the Company did not reimburse the Advisor for any amount by which the Company's operating expenses at the end of the four preceding fiscal quarters exceeded the greater of (a)   2.0%   of average invested assets and (b)   25.0%   of net income other than any additions to reserves for depreciation, bad debt or other similar non-cash expenses and excluding any gain from the sale of assets for that period (the "2%/25% Limitation"), unless the Company's independent directors determined that such excess was justified based on unusual and nonrecurring factors which they deemed sufficient, in which case the excess amount could be reimbursed to the Advisor in subsequent periods. Additionally, the Company reimburses the Advisor for personnel costs; however, the Company may not reimburse the Advisor for personnel costs in connection with services for which the Advisor receives acquisition fees, acquisition expenses or real estate commissions or for persons serving as executive officers of the Company. The 2%/25% Limitation was removed from the advisory agreement in connection with the amendment and restatement of to the advisory agreement in June 2015. 
  In order to improve operating cash flows and the ability to pay distributions from operating cash flows, the Advisor may elect to forgive and absorb certain fees. Because the Advisor may forgive or absorb certain fees, cash flow from operations that would have been paid to the Advisor may be available to pay distributions to stockholders. The fees that are forgiven are not deferrals and, accordingly, will not be paid to the Advisor in the future. During the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  , the Advisor elected to forgive   $1.2 million   in fees. There were no such fees forgiven during the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and the   three months   ended   September 30, 2015  . In certain instances, to improve the Company's working capital, the Advisor may elect to absorb a portion of the Company's property operating and general and administrative costs, which the Company will not repay. No such fees were absorbed during the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   or   2015  .

The predecessor to AR Global was a party to a services agreement with RCS Advisory Services, LLC, a subsidiary of the parent company of the Former Dealer Manager ( RCS Advisory ), pursuant to which RCS Advisory and its affiliates provided the Company and certain other companies sponsored by AR Global with services (including, without limitation, transaction management, compliance, due diligence, event coordination and marketing services, among others) on a time and expenses incurred basis or at a flat rate based on services performed. The predecessor to AR Global instructed RCS Advisory to stop providing such services in November 2015 and no services have since been provided by RCS Advisory. 
  The Company was also party to a transfer agency agreement with ANST, a subsidiary of the parent company of the Former Dealer Manager, pursuant to which ANST provided the Company with transfer agency services (including broker and stockholder servicing, transaction processing, year-end IRS reporting and other services), and supervisory services overseeing the transfer agency services performed by DST Systems, Inc., a third-party transfer agent ("DST"). AR Global received written notice from ANST on February 10, 2016 that it would wind down operations by the end of the month and would withdraw as the transfer agent effective February 29, 2016. On February 26, 2016, the Company entered into a definitive agreement with DST to provide the Company directly with transfer agency services (including broker and stockholder servicing, transaction processing, year-end IRS reporting and other services). 
  Fees and Participations Paid in Connection with a Listing or the Liquidation of the Company's Real Estate Assets 
  Fees Incurred in Connection with a Listing 
  In 2015, the Board determined that it was in the Company s best interest to evaluate strategic alternatives, including a listing on a national securities exchange. Accordingly, in March 2015, the Company formally engaged KeyBanc and RCS Capital ("RCS Capital"), the investment banking and capital markets division of the Former Dealer Manager, and in May 2015, the Company formally engaged BMO Capital Markets Corp. ("BMO"), as financial advisors. Pursuant to the agreements with KeyBanc, BMO and RCS Capital, they each would have received a listing advisory fee equal to   $1.5 million   if the Company's shares were listed on a national securities exchange. In the event of a sale or acquisition transaction, KeyBanc, BMO and RCS Capital each would have received a proposed transaction fee equal to   0.25%   of the value of the transaction. The agreements with KeyBanc, RCS Capital and BMO were terminated in January 2016. No fees were incurred in connection with these agreements during the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   or   2015  . 
  The Board, led by its independent directors, announced in April 2016 that it had initiated the Strategic Review. On October 6, 2016, the Company announced that the Special Committee concluded the Strategic Review and recommended that the Company continue to execute its business plan and focus on managing and strengthening its assets. See   Note 1     Organization  . 
  Other Liquidation Related Fees and Participations 
  The Company will pay the Advisor an annual subordinated performance fee calculated on the basis of the Company's total return to stockholders, payable annually in arrears, such that for any year in which the Company's total return on stockholders' capital exceeds   6.0%   per annum, the Advisor will be entitled to   15.0%   of the excess total return but not to exceed   10.0%   of the aggregate total return for such year. This fee will be paid only upon the sale of assets, distributions or other event which results in the return on stockholders' capital exceeding   6.0%   per annum. No subordinated performance fees were incurred during the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   or   2015  . 
  The Company may pay the Advisor a brokerage commission on the sale of property, not to exceed the lesser of   2.0%   of the contract sale price of the property and   50.0%   of the total brokerage commission paid if a third party broker is also involved; provided, however, that in no event may the real estate commissions paid to the Advisor, its affiliates and unaffiliated third parties exceed the lesser of   6.0%   of the contract sales price and a reasonable, customary and competitive real estate commission, in each case, payable to the Advisor if the Advisor or its affiliates, subject to approval by a majority of the independent directors upon a finding that the Advisor provided a substantial amount of services in connection with the sale. During the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company incurred   $0.1 million   in brokerage commissions on the sale of one property and during the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , the Company incurred   $0.3 million   in brokerage commissions on the sale of three properties. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   $0.2 million   of brokerage commissions payable to the Advisor. No such fees were incurred during the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  .

The Special Limited Partner will be entitled to receive a subordinated participation in the net sales proceeds of the sale of real estate assets from the OP equal to   15.0%   of remaining net sale proceeds after return of capital contributions to investors plus payment to investors of a   6.0%   cumulative, pre-tax non-compounded annual return on the capital contributed by investors. The Special Limited Partner will not be entitled to the subordinated participation in net sale proceeds unless the Company's investors have received a   6.0%   cumulative, pre-tax non-compounded annual return on their capital contributions. No such participation in net sales proceeds became due and payable during the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   or   2015  . 
  If the common stock of the Company is listed on a national exchange, the Special Limited Partner will be entitled to receive a subordinated incentive listing distribution from the OP equal to   15.0%   of the amount by which the adjusted market value of real estate assets plus distributions exceeds the aggregate capital contributed by investors plus an amount equal to a   6.0%   cumulative, pre-tax non-compounded annual return to investors. The Special Limited Partner will not be entitled to the subordinated incentive listing distribution unless investors have received a   6.0%   cumulative, pre-tax non-compounded annual return on their capital contributions. No such distribution was incurred during the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   or   2015  . Neither the Special Limited Partner nor any of its affiliates can earn both the subordinated participation in the net sales proceeds and the subordinated incentive listing distribution. 
  Upon termination or non-renewal of the advisory agreement with the Advisor, with or without cause, the Special Limited Partner will be entitled to receive distributions from the OP equal to   15.0%   of the amount by which the sum of the Company's market value plus distributions exceeds the sum of the aggregate capital contributed by investors plus an amount equal to an annual   6.0%   cumulative, pre-tax, non-compounded annual return to investors. The Special Limited Partner may elect to defer its right to receive a subordinated distribution upon termination until either a listing on a national securities exchange or other liquidity event occurs. 
   
  Note 10   Economic Dependency 
  Under various agreements, the Company has engaged or will engage the Advisor, its affiliates and entities under common control with the Advisor to provide certain services that are essential to the Company, including asset management services, supervision of the management and leasing of properties owned by the Company and asset acquisition and disposition decisions, as well as other administrative responsibilities for the Company including accounting services and investor relations. 
  As a result of these relationships, the Company is dependent upon the Advisor and its affiliates. In the event that the Advisor and its affiliates are unable to provide the Company with the respective services, the Company will be required to find alternative providers of these services. 
   
  Note 11   Equity-Based Compensation 
  Restricted Share Plan 
  The Company has an employee and director incentive restricted share plan (the "RSP"), which provides for the automatic grant of   1,333   restricted shares of common stock to each of the independent directors, without any further approval by the Board or the stockholders, after initial election to the Board and after each annual stockholder meeting, with such shares vesting annually beginning with the one year anniversary of initial election to the Board and the date of the next annual meeting, respectively. Restricted stock issued to independent directors will vest over a   five  -year period in increments of   20.0%   per annum. The RSP provides the Company with the ability to grant awards of restricted shares to the Company's directors, officers and employees (if the Company ever has employees), employees of the Advisor and its affiliates, employees of entities that provide services to the Company, directors of the Advisor or of entities that provide services to the Company, certain consultants to the Company and the Advisor and its affiliates or to entities that provide services to the Company. The total number of common shares granted under the RSP may not exceed   5.0%   of the Company's outstanding shares of common stock on a fully diluted basis at any time and in any event will not exceed   3.4 million   shares (as such number may be adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, combinations and similar events).

Restricted share awards entitle the recipient to receive shares of common stock from the Company under terms that provide for vesting over a specified period of time. For restricted share awards granted prior to July 1, 2015, such awards would typically be forfeited with respect to the unvested shares upon the termination of the recipient's employment or other relationship with the Company. For restricted share awards granted on or after July 1, 2015, such awards provide for accelerated vesting of the portion of the unvested shares scheduled to vest in the year of the recipient's voluntary termination or the failure to be re-elected to the Board. Restricted shares may not, in general, be sold or otherwise transferred until restrictions are removed and the shares have vested. Holders of restricted shares may receive cash distributions prior to the time that the restrictions on the restricted shares have lapsed. Any distributions payable in shares of common stock shall be subject to the same restrictions as the underlying restricted shares. The following table reflects restricted share award activity for the period presented: 

As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had   $0.2 million   of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested restricted share awards granted under the Company's RSP. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of   3.4 years  .  
  Compensation expense related to restricted stock was approximately   $43,000   and   $30,000   during the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Compensation expense related to restricted stock was approximately   $73,000   and   $36,000   during the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. Compensation expense related to restricted stock is recorded as general and administrative expense in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. 
  Other Share-Based Compensation 
  The Company may issue common stock in lieu of cash to pay fees earned by the Company's directors at the respective director's election. There are no restrictions on the shares issued since these payments in lieu of cash relate to fees earned for services performed.   No   such shares were issued during the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   or   2015  .

  Note 13   Non-controlling Interests 
  The Company is the sole general partner and holds substantially all of the units of limited partner interests in the OP ("OP Units"). As of   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Advisor held   90   OP Units, which represents a nominal percentage of the aggregate OP ownership.

In November 2014, the Company partially funded the purchase of an MOB from an unaffiliated third party by causing the OP to issue   405,908   OP Units, with a value of   $10.1 million  , or   $25.00   per unit, to the unaffiliated third party. 
  A holder of OP Units has the right to distributions and has the right to convert OP Units for the cash value of a corresponding number of shares of the Company's common stock or, at the option of the OP, a corresponding number of shares of the Company's common stock, in accordance with the limited partnership agreement of the OP, provided, however, that such OP Units must have been outstanding for at least one year. The remaining rights of the limited partners in the OP are limited, however, and do not include the ability to replace the general partner or to approve the sale, purchase or refinancing of the OP's assets. During the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , OP Unit non-controlling interest holders were paid distributions of   $0.2 million  . During the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , OP Unit non-controlling interest holders were paid distributions of   $0.5 million  .  
  The Company has an investment arrangement with an unaffiliated third party whereby such investor receives an ownership interest in certain of the Company's property-owning subsidiaries and is entitled to receive a proportionate share of the net operating cash flow derived from the subsidiaries' property. Upon disposition of a property subject to non-controlling interest, the investor will receive a proportionate share of the net proceeds from the sale of the property. The investor has no recourse to any other assets of the Company. Due to the nature of the Company's involvement with the arrangement and the significance of its investment in relation to the investment of the third party, the Company has determined that it controls each entity in this arrangement and therefore the entities related to this arrangement are consolidated within the Company's financial statements. A non-controlling interest is recorded for the investor's ownership interest in the properties. 
  The following table summarizes the activity related to investment arrangements with the unaffiliated third party.    No   distributions were made related to these investment arrangements during the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  .

The Company had the following potentially dilutive securities as of   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , which were excluded from the calculation of diluted loss per share attributable to stockholders as the effect would have been antidilutive: 

Note 15       Segment Reporting    
  During the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , the Company operated in   three   reportable business segments for management and internal financial reporting purposes: medical office buildings, triple-net leased healthcare facilities, and seniors housing   operating properties ("SHOP"). 
  The Company evaluates performance and makes resource allocations based on its three business segments. The medical office building segment primarily consists of MOBs leased to healthcare-related tenants under long-term leases, which may require such tenants to pay a pro rata share of property-related expenses. The triple-net leased healthcare facilities segment primarily consists of investments in seniors housing communities, hospitals, inpatient rehabilitation facilities and skilled nursing facilities under long-term leases, under which tenants are generally responsible to directly pay property-related expenses. The SHOP segment consists of direct investments in seniors housing communities, primarily providing assisted living, independent living and memory care services, which are operated through engaging independent third-party managers. There were no intersegment sales or transfers during the periods presented. 
  The Company evaluates the performance of the combined properties in each segment based on net operating income ("NOI"). NOI is defined as total revenues, excluding contingent purchase price consideration, less property operating and maintenance expense. NOI excludes all other items of expense and income included in the financial statements in calculating net income (loss). The Company uses NOI to assess and compare property level performance and to make decisions concerning the operation of the properties. The Company believes that NOI is useful as a performance measure because, when compared across periods, NOI reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating expenses and acquisition activity on an unleveraged basis, providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income (loss).  
  NOI excludes certain components from net income (loss) in order to provide results that are more closely related to a property's results of operations. For example, interest expense is not necessarily linked to the operating performance of a real estate asset and is often incurred at the corporate level. In addition, depreciation and amortization, because of historical cost accounting and useful life estimates, may distort operating performance at the property level. NOI presented by the Company may not be comparable to NOI reported by other REITs that define NOI differently. The Company believes that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of the Company's operating results, NOI should be examined in conjunction with net income (loss) as presented in the Company's consolidated financial statements. NOI should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) as an indication of the Company's performance or to cash flows as a measure of the Company's liquidity or ability to make distributions.

Total rental expense from operating leases was   $0.1 million   and   $0.3 million   during the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  , respectively. During the   three and nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , interest expense related to capital leases was approximately   $21,000   and   $0.1 million  , respectively.  
  Litigation and Regulatory Matters 
  In the ordinary course of business, the Company may become subject to litigation, claims and regulatory matters. There are no material legal or regulatory proceedings pending or known to be contemplated against the Company or its properties. 
  Environmental Matters 
  In connection with the ownership and operation of real estate, the Company may potentially be liable for costs and damages related to environmental matters. As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had not been notified by any governmental authority of any non-compliance, liability or other claim, and is not aware of any other environmental condition that it believes will have a material adverse effect on the results of operations. 
  Development Project Funding 
  In August 2015, the Company entered into an asset purchase agreement and development agreement to acquire land and construction in progress, and subsequently fund the remaining construction, of a skilled nursing facility in Jupiter, Florida for   $82.0 million  . As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company had funded   $10.0 million   and   $43.1 million   for the land and construction in progress, respectively. Concurrent with the acquisition, the Company entered into a loan agreement and lease agreement with an affiliate of the project developer. The loan agreement is intended to provide working capital to the tenant during the initial operating period of the facility and allows for borrowings of up to   $2.7 million   from the Company on a non-revolving basis. Any outstanding principal balances under the loan will bear interest at   7.0%   per year, payable on the first day of each fiscal quarter. As of   September 30, 2016  , there were no amounts outstanding due to the Company pursuant to the loan agreement. 
   
  Note 17     Subsequent Events 
  The Company has evaluated subsequent events through the filing of this   Quarterly   Report on Form   10-Q   and determined that there have not been any events that have occurred that would require adjustments to disclosures in the consolidated financial statements except for the following: 
  Conclusion of Strategic Review 
  In April 2016, the Board, led by its independent directors, announced that it had initiated the Strategic Review. On October 6, 2016, the Company announced that the Special Committee had concluded the Strategic Review. Refer to   Note 1     Organization   for more information on the conclusion of the Strategic Review. 
  Changes in Board of Directors 
  On October 6, 2016, William M. Kahane resigned from the Board. Mr. Kahane did not resign pursuant to any disagreement with the Company. Following Mr. Kahane s resignation, the Board appointed Edward M. Weil, Jr. to serve as a member of the  Board, effective as of that same date. 
  On October 11, 2016, Randolph C. Read resigned from the Board, including his roles as non-executive chairman, audit committee member and nominating and corporate governance committee member. Mr. Read did not resign pursuant to any disagreement with the Company. Simultaneously with Mr. Read s resignation, the Board appointed Leslie D. Michelson, then a member of the Board, to serve as non-executive chairman of the Board, effective as of that same date. Following approval by the Board,   3,480   unvested restricted shares of common stock owned by Mr. Read became vested simultaneously with his resignation as a member of the Board.  
  Following Mr. Read s resignation on October 11, 2016, the Company entered into a consulting agreement (the  Consulting Agreement ) with International Capital Markets Group, Inc. ( ICMG ), a company controlled by Mr. Read. The Consulting Agreement provides for ICMG to provide strategic consulting services to the Company at the request of the new non-executive chairman of the Board, Leslie D. Michelson. For the performance of these services, the Company has agreed to pay ICMG approximately   $38,000   on October 21, 2016, approximately   $25,000   on November 21, 2016 and approximately   $25,000   on December 31, 2016.

The Credit Agreements and related loan documents were issued through Fannie Mae s ( Lender ) Multifamily MBS program and assigned by Capital One and KeyBank to the Lender at closing. The Credit Agreements provide for initial aggregate borrowings of   $60.0 million  .  
  The credit facility with KeyBank (the  KeyBank Facility ) and the credit facility with Capital One (the  Capital One Facility , and together with the KeyBank Facility, the  Fannie Credit Facilities ) each provide for an initial   $30.0 million   of advances. The Company may request future advances under the Fannie Credit Facilities by borrowing against the value of the initial mortgaged properties or adding eligible properties to the collateral pool, subject to customary conditions, including satisfaction of minimum debt service coverage and maximum loan-to-value tests. The initial advances under the Fannie Credit Facilities will mature on November 1, 2026. Until December 1, 2016, borrowings under the KeyBank Facility and the Capital One Facility will initially bear interest at   3.15%   and   3.156%  , respectively, per annum. Beginning December 1, 2016 the Fannie Credit Facilities will bear an annual interest rate that will vary on a monthly basis and will be equal to the sum of the current One Month LIBOR and   2.62%  , with a floor of   2.62%  .  One Month LIBOR  means the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate for one month U.S. dollar-denominated deposits. Effective October 31, 2016, in conjunction with the execution of the Fannie Credit Facilities, the OP entered into two interest rate cap agreements (the "IR Caps") with an unrelated third party, which cap interest paid on amounts outstanding under the Fannie Credit Facilities to a maximum of   3.5%  . The IR Caps terminate on November 1, 2019. The Credit Agreements require borrowers to enter into replacement interest rate cap or swap agreements upon termination of the IR Caps to the extent any variable rate loans are outstanding on the date of termination. 
  The KeyBank Facility is initially secured by first-priority mortgages on four of the Company s seniors housing properties located in Michigan, Missouri and Kansas. The Capital One Facility is initially secured by first-priority mortgages on two of the Company s seniors housing properties located in Florida. Each of the security agreements securing the Fannie Credit Facilities are cross-defaulted and cross-collateralized with the other security agreements securing the Fannie Credit Facilities. The Fannie Credit Facilities are non-recourse, subject to standard  bad boy  carve-outs and environmental indemnities, which obligations are guaranteed by the OP on an unsecured basis. 
  The initial advances under the Fannie Credit Facilities may not be prepaid until November 1, 2017, after which they may be prepaid in full or in part through July 31, 2026 with payment of a   1%   prepayment premium, and may be freely prepaid in full or in part thereafter.  The Credit Agreements provide for optional acceleration by Lender upon an event of default. The Credit Agreements contain customary events of default, including the breach of transfer prohibitions, principal or interest payment defaults and bankruptcy-related defaults. 
  Upon an event of default under the Credit Agreements, payment of any unpaid amounts under the applicable Fannie Credit Facility may be accelerated by Lender and Lender may exercise its rights with respect to the applicable pool of seniors housing properties securing the Fannie Credit Facilities.

Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
   
  The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Healthcare Trust, Inc. and the notes thereto. As used herein, the terms the "Company," "we," "our" and "us" refer to Healthcare Trust, Inc., a Maryland corporation, including, as required by context, Healthcare Trust Operating Partnership, LP (our "OP"), a Delaware limited partnership, and its subsidiaries. The Company is externally managed by Healthcare Trust Advisors, LLC (our "Advisor"), a Delaware limited liability company. Capitalized terms used herein, but not otherwise defined, have the meaning ascribed to those terms in "Part I    Financial Information" included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and contained herein. 
  Forward-Looking Statements 
  Certain statements included in this   Quarterly   Report on Form   10-Q   are forward-looking statements. Those statements include statements regarding the intent, belief or current expectations of the Company and members of our management team, as well as the assumptions on which such statements are based, and generally are identified by the use of words such as "may," "will," "seeks," "anticipates," "believes," "estimates," "expects," "plans," "intends," "should" or similar expressions. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by such forward-looking statements. Further, forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise forward-looking statements to reflect changed assumptions, the occurrence of unanticipated events or changes to future operating results over time, unless required by law. 
  The following are some of the risks and uncertainties, although not all risks and uncertainties, that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those presented in our forward-looking statements: 
             
    Certain of our executive officers and directors are also officers, managers or holders of a direct or indirect controlling interest in our Advisor and other entities affiliated with AR Global Investments, LLC (the successor business to AR Capital, LLC, "AR Global"), the parent of our sponsor, American Realty Capital VII, LLC (the "Sponsor"). As a result, certain of our executive officers and directors, our Advisor and its affiliates face conflicts of interest, including significant conflicts created by our Advisor's compensation arrangements with us and other investment programs advised by affiliates of AR Global and conflicts in allocating time among these investment programs and us. These conflicts could result in unanticipated actions that adversely affect us. 
                
    Because investment opportunities that are suitable for us may also be suitable for other investment programs advised by affiliates of AR Global, our Advisor and its affiliates face conflicts of interest relating to the purchase of properties and other investments and such conflicts may not be resolved in our favor, meaning that we could invest in less attractive assets, which could reduce the investment return to our stockholders. 
                
    Although we intend to list our shares of common stock on a national stock exchange when we believe market conditions are favorable to do so, there is no assurance that our shares of common stock will be listed. No public market currently exists, or may ever exist, for shares of our common stock and our shares are, and may continue to be, illiquid. 
                
    We focus on acquiring a diversified portfolio of healthcare-related assets located in the United States and are subject to risks inherent in concentrating investments in the healthcare industry. 
                
    If our Advisor loses or is unable to obtain qualified personnel, our ability to implement our investment strategies could be delayed or hindered. 
                
    The healthcare industry is heavily regulated, and new laws or regulations, changes to existing laws or regulations, loss of licensure or failure to obtain licensure could result in the inability of tenants to make lease payments to us.  
                
    We are depending on our Advisor to select investments and conduct our operations. Adverse changes in the financial condition of our Advisor or our relationship with our Advisor could adversely affect us. 
                
    We may be unable to pay distributions with cash flows from operations, or maintain cash distributions or increase distributions over time. 
                
    We are obligated to pay fees, which may be substantial, to our Advisor and its affiliates. 
                
    We depend on tenants for our revenue and, accordingly, our revenue is dependent upon the success and economic viability of our tenants. 
                
    We may not be able to achieve our rental rate objectives on new and renewal leases and our expenses could be greater, which may impact our results of operations. 
                
    Increases in interest rates could increase the amount of our debt payments and limit our ability to pay distributions. 
     
    33 

     Table of Contents  

We are permitted to pay distributions of unlimited amounts from any source. There are no established limits on the amount of borrowings that we may use to fund distribution payments, except for those imposed by Maryland law.  
                
    Any distributions, especially those not covered by our cash flows from operations, may reduce the amount of capital available for other purposes included investment in properties and other permitted investments and may negatively impact the value of our stockholders' investment. 
                
    We have not and may not in the future generate cash flows sufficient to pay our distributions to stockholders and, as such, we may be required to fund distributions from borrowings, which may be at unfavorable rates and could restrict the amount we can borrow for investments and other purposes, or depend on our Advisor or our property manager, Healthcare Trust Properties, LLC (the "Property Manager") to waive fees or reimbursement of certain expenses and fees to fund our operations. There is no assurance these entities will waive such amounts or that we will be able to borrow funds at all. 
                
    We are subject to risks associated with any dislocations or liquidity disruptions that may exist or occur in the credit markets of the United States from time to time. 
                
    We are subject to risks associated with changes in general economic, business and political conditions including the possibility of intensified international hostilities, acts of terrorism, and changes in conditions of United States or international lending, capital and financing markets. 
                
    We may fail to continue to qualify to be treated as a real estate investment trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes ("REIT"), which would result in higher taxes, may adversely affect our operations and would reduce the value of an investment in our common stock and the cash available for distributions.  
                
    We may be deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "Investment Company Act"), and thus subject to regulation under the Investment Company Act. 
                
    The offering price and repurchase price for our shares, including shares sold pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan ("DRIP") may not, among other things, accurately reflect the value of our assets and may not represent what stockholders may receive upon a liquidation of our assets. 
      
  Overview 
  We invest in healthcare real estate, such as seniors housing and medical office buildings ("MOB"), located in the United States for investment purposes. As of   September 30, 2016  , we owned   163   properties located in   29   states and comprised of   8.4 million   rentable square feet. 
  We were incorporated on October 15, 2012 as a Maryland corporation that elected and qualified to be taxed as a REIT beginning with our taxable year ended December 31, 2013. Substantially all of our business is conducted through the OP. 
  In February 2013, we commenced our initial public offering ("IPO") on a "reasonable best efforts" basis of up to   $1.7 billion   of common stock,   $0.01   par value per share, at a price of   $25.00   per share, subject to certain volume and other discounts. We closed our IPO in November 2014. As of   September 30, 2016  , we have received   $2.2 billion   from our IPO and from proceeds received under the DRIP. 
  In 2015, our board of directors (the "Board") determined that it was in our best interest to evaluate strategic alternatives, including a listing on a national securities exchange. The Board, led by its independent directors, announced on April 22, 2016 that it had initiated a strategic review process (the "Strategic Review") to identify, examine, and consider a range of strategic alternatives available to us with the objective of maximizing shareholder value. The Board formed a special committee (the "Special Committee") to evaluate various options in connection with the Strategic Review. The Special Committee engaged Morgan Stanley   Co. LLC ("Morgan Stanley") and KeyBanc Capital Markets as financial advisors, with Morgan Stanley as lead advisor. The Board also formed a separate special committee to address conflicts of interest. The Board retained Gibson, Dunn   Crutcher LLP as special legal counsel in connection with the Strategic Review. 
  On October 6, 2016, we announced that the Special Committee had concluded the Strategic Review and recommended that we continue to execute our business plan and focus on managing and strengthening our assets. The Special Committee and the committee to address conflicts of interest were terminated by the Board. 
  On April 7, 2016 (the "NAV Pricing Date"), the Board approved a per share estimate of net asset value ("NAV") equal to $22.27, estimated as of December 31, 2015. Subsequent estimates of per share NAV will occur periodically, at the discretion of the Board, provided that such estimates will be made at least annually. Pursuant to the DRIP, our stockholders can elect to reinvest distributions by purchasing shares of our common stock. Prior to the NAV Pricing Date, we offered shares pursuant to the DRIP at   $23.75   per share, which was   95%   of the initial offering price of shares of common stock in the IPO. Effective April 7, 2016, we began offering shares pursuant to the DRIP at the then-current NAV approved by the Board.

We have no employees. The Advisor has been retained by us to manage our affairs on a day-to-day basis. We have retained the Property Manager to serve as our property manager. The Advisor and Property Manager are under common control with AR Global, the parent of our Sponsor, as a result of which they are related parties, and each have received or will receive compensation, fees and expense reimbursements for services related to managing of our business. The Advisor, Healthcare Trust Special Limited Partnership, LLC and Property Manager also have received or will receive compensation, fees and expense reimbursements from us related to the investment and management of our assets.  
   
  Significant Accounting Estimates and Critical Accounting Policies 
  Set forth below is a summary of the significant accounting estimates and critical accounting policies that management believes are important to the preparation of our financial statements. Certain of our accounting estimates are particularly important for an understanding of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management. As a result, these estimates are subject to a degree of uncertainty. These significant accounting estimates and critical accounting policies include: 
  Revenue Recognition 
  Our rental income is primarily related to rent received from tenants in our medical office buildings ("MOB") and triple-net leased healthcare facilities. Rent from tenants in our MOB and triple-net leased healthcare facilities operating segments is recorded in accordance with the terms of each lease on a straight-line basis over the initial term of the lease. Because many of the leases provide for rental increases at specified intervals, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP") require us to record a receivable, and include in revenues on a straight-line basis, unbilled rent receivables that we will only receive if the tenant makes all rent payments required through the expiration of the initial term of the lease. When we acquire a property, the acquisition date is considered to be the commencement date for purposes of this calculation. For new leases after acquisition, the commencement date is considered to be the date the tenant takes control of the space. For lease modifications, the commencement date is considered to be the date the lease is executed. We defer the revenue related to lease payments received from tenants in advance of their due dates. 
  Cost recoveries from tenants are included in operating expense reimbursement in the period the related costs are incurred, as applicable.  
  Resident services and fee income primarily relates to rent from residents in our seniors housing   operating properties ("SHOP") held using a structure permitted by the REIT Investment Diversification and Empowerment Act of 2007 and to fees for ancillary services performed for residents in our SHOPs. Rental income from residents of our SHOP operating segment is recognized as earned. Residents pay monthly rent that covers occupancy of their unit and basic services, including utilities, meals and some housekeeping services. The terms of the rent are short term in nature, primarily month-to-month. Fees for ancillary services are recorded in the period in which the services are performed. 
  We defer the revenue related to lease payments received from tenants and residents in advance of their due dates. 
  We continually review receivables related to rent and unbilled rent receivables and determine collectability by taking into consideration the tenant's payment history, the financial condition of the tenant, business conditions in the industry in which the tenant operates and economic conditions in the area in which the property is located. In the event that the collectability of a receivable is in doubt, we record an increase in the allowance for uncollectible accounts on the consolidated balance sheets or record a direct write-off of the receivable in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. 
  Real Estate Investments 
  Investments in real estate are recorded at cost. Improvements and replacements are capitalized when they extend the useful life of the asset. Costs of repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. 
  We evaluate the inputs, processes and outputs of each asset acquired to determine if the transaction is a business combination or asset acquisition.  If an acquisition qualifies as a business combination, the related transaction costs are recorded as an expense in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.  If an acquisition qualifies as an asset acquisition, the related transaction costs are generally capitalized and subsequently amortized over the useful life of the acquired assets.  
  In business combinations, we allocate the purchase price of acquired properties to tangible and identifiable intangible assets or liabilities based on their respective fair values. Tangible assets may include land, land improvements, buildings, fixtures and tenant improvements. Intangible assets may include the value of in-place leases and above- and below-market leases. In addition, any assumed mortgages receivable or payable and any assumed or issued non-controlling interests are recorded at their estimated fair values.  
  We generally determine the value of construction in progress based upon the replacement cost. During the construction period, we capitalize interest, insurance and real estate taxes until the development has reached substantial completion. 
  
    35 

     Table of Contents  

The fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property with an in-place operating lease is determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant, and the  as-if-vacant  value is then allocated to the tangible assets based on the fair value of the tangible assets. The fair value of in-place leases is determined by considering estimates of carrying costs during the expected lease-up periods, current market conditions, as well as costs to execute similar leases. The fair value of above- or below-market leases is recorded based on the present value of the difference between the contractual amount to be paid pursuant to the in-place lease and our estimate of the fair market lease rate for the corresponding in-place lease, measured over the remaining term of the lease including any below-market fixed rate renewal options for below-market leases. 
  In making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price, we utilize a number of sources, including real estate valuations prepared by independent valuation firms. We also consider information and other factors including market conditions, the industry that the tenant operates in, characteristics of the real estate, i.e. location, size, demographics, value and comparative rental rates, tenant credit profile and the importance of the location of the real estate to the operations of the tenant s business. 
  In allocating the fair value to assumed mortgages, amounts are recorded to debt premiums or discounts based on the present value of the estimated cash flows, which is calculated to account for either above- or below-market interest rates.   
  In allocating the fair value to non-controlling interests, amounts are recorded based on the fair value of units issued at the date of acquisition, as determined by the terms of the applicable agreement. 
  Real estate investments that are intended to be sold are designated as "held for sale" on the consolidated balance sheets at the lesser of the carrying amount or fair value less estimated selling costs when they meet specific criteria to be presented as held for sale. Real estate investments are no longer depreciated when they are classified as held for sale. If the disposal, or intended disposal, of certain real estate investments represents a strategic shift that has had or will have a major effect on our operations and financial results, the operations of such real estate investments would be presented as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for all applicable periods. 
  Depreciation and Amortization 
  Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of up to 40 years for buildings, 15 years for land improvements, five years for fixtures and improvements, and the shorter of the useful life or the remaining lease term for tenant improvements and leasehold interests.  
  Construction in progress, including capitalized interest, insurance and real estate taxes, is not depreciated until the development has reached substantial completion. 
  Capitalized above-market lease values are amortized as a reduction of rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases. Capitalized below-market lease values are accreted as an increase to rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases and expected below-market renewal option periods. 
  Capitalized above-market ground lease values are accreted as a reduction of property operating expense over the remaining terms of the respective leases. Capitalized below-market ground lease values are amortized as an increase to property operating expense over the remaining terms of the respective leases and expected below-market renewal option periods. 
  The value of in-place leases, exclusive of the value of above-market and below-market in-place leases, is amortized to expense over the remaining periods of the respective leases. 
  The assumed mortgage premiums or discounts are amortized as an increase or reduction to interest expense over the remaining term of the respective mortgages.  
  Impairment of Long Lived Assets  
  If circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a property may not be recoverable, we review the asset for impairment. This review is based on an estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows, excluding interest charges, expected to result from the property s use and eventual disposition. These estimates consider factors such as expected future operating income, market and other applicable trends and residual value, as well as the effects of leasing demand, competition and other factors. If impairment exists due to the inability to recover the carrying value of a property, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the property for properties to be held and used. For properties held for sale, the impairment loss is the adjustment to fair value less estimated cost to dispose of the asset. These assessments have a direct impact on net income because recording an impairment loss results in an immediate negative adjustment to net income.

Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements 
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued revised guidance relating to revenue recognition. Under the revised guidance, an entity is required to recognize revenue when it transfers promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The revised guidance was to become effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption was not permitted under GAAP. The revised guidance allows entities to apply the full retrospective or modified retrospective transition method upon adoption. In July 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date of the revised guidance by one year to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, although entities will be allowed to early adopt the guidance as of the original effective date. We have not yet selected a transition method and are currently evaluating the impact of this new guidance. 
  In January 2015, the FASB issued updated guidance that eliminates from GAAP the concept of an event or transaction that is unusual in nature and occurs infrequently being treated as an extraordinary item. The revised guidance is effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. Any amendments may be applied either prospectively or retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. Early adoption was permitted provided that the guidance was applied from the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. We elected to adopt this new guidance as of September 30, 2015. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact to our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
  In February 2015, the FASB amended the accounting for consolidation of certain legal entities. The amendments modify the evaluation of whether certain legal entities are variable interest entities ("VIEs") or voting interest entities, eliminates the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership and affect the consolidation analysis of reporting entities that are involved with VIEs (particularly those that have fee arrangements and related party relationships). The revised guidance is effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption was permitted, including adoption in an interim period. We have elected to adopt this guidance effective January 1, 2016. We have evaluated the impact of the adoption of this new guidance on our consolidated financial statements and have determined that the OP is considered a VIE. However, we meet the disclosure exemption criteria as we are the primary beneficiary of the VIE and our partnership interest in a business and the assets of the OP can be used for purposes other than settling its obligations, such as paying distributions. As such, this standard did not have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements. 
  In April 2015, the FASB amended the presentation of debt issuance costs on the balance sheet. The amendment requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented on the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability. In August 2015, the FASB added that, for line of credit arrangements, the SEC staff would not object to an entity deferring and presenting debt issuance costs as an asset and subsequently amortizing the deferred debt issuance costs ratably over the term of the line, regardless of whether or not there are any outstanding borrowings. The revised guidance is effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption was permitted for financial statements that have not previously been issued. We have elected to adopt this guidance effective January 1, 2016. The adoption of this revised guidance resulted in the reclassification of   $2.0 million   and   $2.2 million   of deferred financing costs related to our mortgage note payable from deferred costs, net to mortgage note payable, net of deferred financing costs in our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2015. 
  In September 2015, the FASB issued an update that eliminates the requirement to adjust provisional amounts from a business combination and the related impact on earnings by restating prior period financial statements for measurement period adjustments. The new guidance requires that the cumulative impact of measurement period adjustments on current and prior periods, including the prior period impact on depreciation, amortization and other income statement items and their related tax effects, shall be recognized in the period the adjustment amount is determined. The cumulative adjustment would be reflected within the respective financial statement line items affected. The revised guidance is effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption was permitted. We elected to adopt this guidance as of September 30, 2015. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact to our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 
  In January 2016, the FASB issued an update that amends the recognition and measurement of financial instruments. The new guidance revises an entity s accounting related to equity investments and the presentation of certain fair value changes for financial liabilities measured at fair value. Among other things, it also amends the presentation and disclosure requirements associated with the fair value of financial instruments. The revised guidance is effective for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is not permitted for most of the amendments in the update. We are currently evaluating the impact of this new guidance.

In February 2016, the FASB issued an update that sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of leases for both lessees and lessors. The new standard requires lessees to apply a dual approach, classifying leases as either finance or operating leases based on the principle of whether or not the lease is effectively a financed purchase by the lessee. This classification will determine whether lease expense is recognized based on an effective interest method or on a straight line basis over the term of the lease, respectively. A lessee is also required to record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases with a term greater than 12 months regardless of their classification. Leases with a term of 12 months or less will be accounted for similar to existing guidance for operating leases today. The new standard requires lessors to account for leases using an approach that is substantially equivalent to existing guidance for sales-type leases, direct financing leases and operating leases. The revised guidance is effective on January 1, 2019. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this new guidance. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued guidance which requires an entity to determine whether the nature of its promise to provide goods or services to a customer is performed in a principal or agent capacity and to recognize revenue in a gross or net manner based on its principal/agent designation. This guidance is effective for public business entities for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this new guidance.  
  In March 2016, the FASB issued an update that changes the accounting for certain aspects of share-based compensation. Among other things, the revised guidance allows companies to make an entity-wide accounting policy election to either estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest or account for forfeitures when they occur. The revised guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. We have adopted the provisions of this guidance beginning January 1, 2016 and determined that there is no impact to our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Our policy is to account for forfeitures as they occur. 
  In August 2016, the FASB issued guidance on how certain transactions should be classified and presented in the statement of cash flows as either operating, investing or financing activities. Among other things, the update provides specific guidance on where to classify debt prepayment and extinguishment costs, payments for contingent consideration made after a business combination and distributions received from equity method investments. The revised guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this new guidance. 
  In October 2016, the FASB issued guidance where a reporting entity will need to evaluate if it should consolidate a VIE. The amendments change the evaluation of whether a reporting entity is the primary beneficiary of a VIE by changing how a single decision maker of a VIE treats indirect interests in the entity held through related parties that are under common control with the reporting entity. The revised guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this new guidance.

  The following table presents certain additional information about the properties we owned as of   September 30, 2016  : 

_______________ 
           (1) 
    Revenues for our triple-net leased healthcare facilities generally consist of fixed rental amounts (subject to annual contractual escalations) received from our tenants in accordance with the applicable lease terms and do not vary based on the underlying operating performance of the properties. As of   September 30, 2016  , properties leased to our seniors housing   triple net leased and post acute/skilled nursing tenants had operating occupancies of approximately 85.8% and 77.7%, respectively. While operating occupancy rates may affect the profitability of our tenants  operations, they do not have a direct impact on our revenues or financial results. Operating occupancy statistics for our seniors housing   triple net leased and post acute/skilled nursing facilities are compiled through reports from tenants and have not been independently validated by us. The terms of leases with tenants in our hospital facilities do not require reporting of operating occupancy statistics to us and, as such, no operating occupancy information for our hospital facilities is included herein.

Results of Operations 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we operated in three reportable business segments for management and internal financial reporting purposes: medical office buildings, triple-net leased healthcare facilities, and seniors housing   operating properties. In our MOB operating segment, we own, manage and lease, ourselves or through third party property managers, single and multi-tenant MOBs where tenants are required to pay their pro rata share of property operating expenses, which may be subject to expense exclusions and floors, in addition to base rent. In our triple-net leased healthcare facilities operating segment, we own, manage and lease seniors housing communities, hospitals, post acute care and skilled nursing facilities throughout the United States under long-term triple-net leases, which tenants are generally directly responsible for all operating costs of the respective properties. In our SHOP operating segment, we invest in seniors housing communities under a structure permitted by the REIT Investment Diversification Empowerment Act of 2007 ("RIDEA"). Under RIDEA, a REIT may lease qualified healthcare properties on an arm's length basis to a taxable REIT subsidiary ("TRS") if the property is operated on behalf of such subsidiary by an entity who qualifies as an eligible independent contractor. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had 11 eligible independent contractors operating   38   SHOP properties. All of our properties across all three business segments are located throughout the United States. 
  Net operating income ("NOI") is a non-GAAP financial measure used by us to evaluate the operating performance of our real estate portfolio. NOI is equal to total revenues, excluding contingent purchase price consideration, less property operating and maintenance expense. NOI excludes all other financial statement amounts included in net income (loss). We believe NOI provides useful and relevant information because it reflects only those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level and presents such items on an unlevered basis. See    Non-GAAP Financial Measures    included elsewhere in this   Quarterly   Report on Form   10-Q   for additional disclosures regarding NOI and a reconciliation to our net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders, as computed in accordance with GAAP.

Comparison of the Three Months Ended   September 30, 2016   to the Three Months Ended   September 30, 2015 
  On   July 1, 2015  , we owned 143 properties (our "Same Store" properties), including two vacant land parcels. We acquired 23 properties during the period from   July 1, 2015   through   September 30, 2016   (our "Acquisitions"), including one property under development. Information based on Same Store and Acquisitions allows us to evaluate the performance of our portfolio based on a consistent population of properties. Our results of operations for the three months ended   September 30, 2016   as compared to the three months ended   September 30, 2015   reflect significant increases in most categories primarily due to our Acquisitions. Net loss attributable to stockholders was   $8.7 million   and   $16.1 million   for the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively. The following table shows our results of operations for the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   and the period to period change by line item of the consolidated statement of operations:

  Rental income is primarily related to contractual rent received from tenants in our MOBs. Generally, operating expense reimbursements increase in proportion with the increase in property operating expenses in our MOB segment. Pursuant to many of our lease agreements in our MOBs, tenants are required to pay their pro rata share of property operating expenses, which may be subject to expense exclusions and floors, in addition to base rent. Property operating and maintenance relates to the costs associated with our properties, including real estate taxes, utilities, repairs, maintenance, bad debt expense and unaffiliated third party property management fees.

During the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016  , rental income increased at Same Store properties in our MOB segment as compared to the   three months   ended   September 30, 2015  , primarily due to the execution of new leases and net occupancy increases in several of our multi-tenant MOBs. 
  During the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016  , operating expense reimbursements and property operating and maintenance expense decreased at the Same Store properties in our MOB segment as compared to the   three months   ended   September 30, 2015  , primarily due to a tenant lease termination in May 2015 at The Hospital at Craig Ranch located in McKinney, Texas (the "Craig Ranch Termination").  
  During the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016  , rental income, operating expense reimbursements and property operating and maintenance expense at our MOB segment Acquisitions increased significantly as compared to the   three months   ended   September 30, 2015   primarily due to our acquisition of 11 MOBs from   July 1, 2015   through   September 30, 2016  .

   Segment Results   Triple Net Leased Healthcare Facilities 
  Rental income is primarily related to contractual rent received from tenants in our triple-net leased healthcare facilities. Operating expense reimbursements in our triple net leased healthcare facilities segment generally includes reimbursement for property operating expenses that we pay on behalf of tenants in this segment. Pursuant to many of our lease agreements in our triple net leased healthcare facilities, tenants are generally directly responsible for all operating costs of the respective properties in addition to base rent. Property operating and maintenance relates to the costs associated with our properties, including real estate taxes, utilities, repairs, maintenance and bad debt expense. All of such expenses, except for bad debt expense, are generally reimbursed by the tenants in this segment.

During the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016  , rental income decreased and operating expense reimbursements and property operating and maintenance expense increased at the Same Store properties in our triple net leased healthcare segment as compared to the   three months   ended   September 30, 2015  . The decrease in rental income is primarily due to tenant lease terminations in August 2015 at the Specialty Hospital portfolio located in Mesa and Sun City, Arizona (the "Specialty Hospital Terminations"), as well as amendments to leases with two tenants that occupy 15 of our triple net leased healthcare facilities which provided reductions in monthly rental amounts due (the "Rent Reduction Amendments"). The increase in operating expense reimbursement is primarily due to real estate taxes paid by us that will be reimbursed by a tenant in this segment. The increase in property operating and maintenance expense is primarily related to the write-off of cash and straight-line rent receivables from a tenant at six of our skilled nursing facilities whose leases were terminated during the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016   and an increase in bad debt reserve percentages to reflect our uncertainty of the collectability of rental payments from certain tenants within this segment.  
  During the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016  , rental income and property operating and maintenance expense at our triple net leased healthcare facilities segment Acquisitions increased as compared to the   three months   ended   September 30, 2015   primarily due to our acquisition of 5 triple net leased healthcare facilities from   July 1, 2015   through   September 30, 2016  . 
  The following table presents the revenue and property operating and maintenance expense and the period to period change within our triple net leased healthcare facilities segment for the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  :

  Revenues for our triple-net leased healthcare facilities generally consist of fixed rental amounts (subject to annual contractual escalations) received from our tenants in accordance with the applicable lease terms and do not vary based on the underlying operating performance of the properties.  
  Segment Results   Seniors Housing Operating Properties 
  Resident services and fee income is generated in connection with rent and services offered to residents in our SHOPs depending on the level of care required, as well as fees associated with other ancillary services. Property operating and maintenance relates to the costs associated with our properties, as described above, and professional fees, as well as costs relating to caring for the residents in our SHOPs, including food, labor and marketing expenses. 
  During the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016  , resident services and fee income and property operating and maintenance expense increased at the Same Store properties in our SHOP segment as compared to the   three months   ended   September 30, 2015  . These increases are primarily due to higher resident rental rates and increased costs to care for the residents of our SHOPs, partially offset by a decrease in average occupancy between periods. 
  During the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016  , rental income and property operating and maintenance expense increased at our SHOP segment Acquisitions as compared to the   three months   ended   September 30, 2015   primarily due to our acquisition of 6 SHOPs from   July 1, 2015   through   September 30, 2016  .

  Contingent Purchase Price Consideration 
  During the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we recognized   $(0.1) million   and approximately   $37,000  , respectively, which primarily related to contingent purchase price consideration in connection with holdback and other vacancy escrow arrangements associated with two acquisitions. During the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016  , the settlement of certain property operating expenses related to vacancy escrow agreements at one acquisition resulted in us making payments to the seller. Contingent purchase price consideration during the   three months   ended   September 30, 2015   related to releases from escrow under a vacancy escrow arrangement at one of our MOBs. Based on facts and circumstances that existed at the time of acquisition, we determined that it was not probable that we would recover certain amounts placed into escrow under vacancy escrow agreements. However, the vacant leasable space under the vacancy escrow agreements was still not occupied as of the agreed upon dates, which resulted in the return of escrowed funds to us and the recognition of contingent purchase price consideration.  
  Operating Fees to Related Parties 
  Operating fees to related parties increased   $0.9 million   to   $5.2 million   for the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016   from   $4.3 million   for the   three months   ended   September 30, 2015  . Our Advisor and Property Manager are paid for asset management and property management services for managing our properties on a day-to-day basis. The asset management fee is based on a percentage of the lesser of (a) cost of assets and (b) fair value of assets. Asset management fees increased $0.7 million to   $4.4 million   for the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016   from   $3.7 million   for the   three months   ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase in the asset management fee is due to an increase in the cost of assets for the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016  , which was primarily related to our Acquisitions and capital expenditures during the period from   July 1, 2015   through   September 30, 2016  .  
  We incurred   $0.8 million   in property management fees during the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016  , a $0.1 million increase from the   $0.7 million   in property management fees incurred during the   three months   ended   September 30, 2015  . Property management fees increase in direct correlation with gross revenues. 
  Acquisition and Transaction Related Expenses 
  Acquisition and transaction related expenses of   $1.0 million   for the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016   primarily related to costs associated with the Strategic Review. Acquisition and transaction related expenses of   $3.3 million   for the   three months   ended   September 30, 2015   related to our acquisition of six properties, including one property under construction, during the period. Acquisition and transaction related expenses generally increase in direct correlation with the number and contract purchase price of properties acquired during the period and the level of activity surrounding any contemplated transaction.

General and Administrative Expenses 
  General and administrative expenses increased   $0.5 million   to   $2.9 million   for the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016   from   $2.4 million   for the   three months   ended   September 30, 2015  , including   $1.2 million   incurred from related parties during each period. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily driven by the timing of our annual meeting of stockholders and related proxy solicitation services. In 2016, our annual meeting of stockholders was held during the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016  , while in 2015, our annual meeting of stockholders was held during the   three months   ended June 30, 2015, which caused related expenses to be recognized in different comparable periods.  Costs related to these annual meetings of stockholders and proxy solicitation services have been expensed during the period in which the annual meetings occurred. 
  Depreciation and Amortization Expenses  
  Depreciation and amortization expense decreased   $6.9 million   to   $27.3 million   for the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016   from   $34.2 million   for the   three months   ended   September 30, 2015  . Same Store depreciation and amortization decreased $13.0 million primarily due to the expiration of the estimated useful lives of in-place leases recorded at acquisition, partially offset by an increase of $6.2 million in depreciation and amortization related to our Acquisitions. The purchase price of acquired properties is allocated to tangible and identifiable intangible assets and depreciated or amortized over the estimated useful lives of the properties.  
  Interest Expense 
  Interest expense increased   $1.8 million   to   $4.9 million   for the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016   from   $3.1 million   for the   three months   ended   September 30, 2015  . Interest expense related to our mortgage notes payable increased   $0.3 million   as a result of a higher average outstanding mortgage balance of   $149.1 million   during the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016  , compared to the   $101.3 million   average balance during the   three months   ended   September 30, 2015  , as well as the associated increases in amortization of deferred financing costs, partially offset by increased amortization of mortgage premiums. 
  We entered into a   $50.0 million   credit facility (the "Credit Facility") in March 2014. In April 2014, June 2015 and July 2015, we entered into amendments which increased available borrowings to $200.0 million, $500.0 million and $565.0 million, respectively. Interest expense related to the Credit Facility increased   $1.5 million   primarily as a result of higher amortization of deferred financing costs and non-usage fees as a result of the amendments and increases to the Credit Facility as well as a higher average outstanding balance on the Credit Facility of   $469.0 million   during the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the   $160.0 million   average balance during the   three months   ended   September 30, 2015  . 
  We view a mix of secured and unsecured financing sources as an efficient and accretive means to acquire properties and manage working capital. Our interest expense in future periods will vary based on our level of future borrowings, the cost of borrowings and the opportunity to acquire real estate assets which meet our investment objectives.  
  Interest and Other Income 
  Interest and other income decreased   $0.1 million   to approximately   $2,000   for the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016   from   $0.1 million   for the   three months   ended   September 30, 2015  . Interest and other income includes income from our investment securities and interest income earned on cash and cash equivalents held during the period. During the year ended December 31, 2015 and the three months ended September 31, 2016, we sold all of our positions in preferred stock, common stock and real estate income funds and an investment in a senior note, which resulted in a decrease in dividend and interest income from our investment portfolio during the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016  . 
  Gain on Sale of Investment Property 
  Gain on sale of investment property for the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016   related to the sale of a real estate investment located in Santa Rosa, California for $17.5 million, which resulted in a gain of   $1.3 million   during the period. We did not sell any of our real estate investments during the   three months   ended   September 30, 2015   and therefore had no gain on sale of investment property for such period. 
  Gain on Sale of Investment Securities 
  Gain on sale of investments for the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016   of   $0.1 million   resulted from selling our investments in preferred stock with a cost basis of   $1.1 million  . Gain on sale of investments for the   three months   ended   September 30, 2015   of   $0.2 million   resulted from our selling of certain of our investments in preferred stock, common stock and real estate income funds with a cost basis of   $14.9 million  .

Income Tax Benefit (Expense) 
  Income tax expense of   $(0.3) million   during the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016  , related to income from our taxable REIT subsidiary ("TRS"). Such income was derived from our 38 SHOPs, the net income or loss of which are owned by our TRS. Income tax benefit of   $0.4 million   for the   three months   ended   September 30, 2015   primarily related to deferred tax assets generated by current period net operating losses associated with our TRS. These deferred tax assets are partially offset by other income tax expenses incurred during the same period. Income taxes generally relate to our SHOPs, which are leased by our TRS. 
  Net Loss Attributable to Non-Controlling Interests  
  Net loss attributable to non-controlling interests was approximately   $29,000   and   $0.1 million   for the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, which represents the portion or our net income or net loss that is related to OP Unit and non-controlling interest holders.

During the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , rental income decreased and operating expense reimbursements and property operating and maintenance expense increased at the Same Store properties in our triple net leased healthcare segment as compared to the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  . The decrease in rental income was primarily due to the sale of two properties from this segment during the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and the Rent Reduction Amendments. The increase in operating expense reimbursements is primarily due to higher property operating expenses at one of our properties where we are reimbursed for property operating expenses that we pay on behalf of the tenant, as well as late fee revenue that was assessed to tenants with aged receivables. The increase in property operating and maintenance expense is primarily related to the write-off of cash and straight-line rent receivables from a tenant at six of our skilled nursing facilities whose leases were terminated during the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and to an increase in bad debt reserve percentages to reflect our uncertainty of the collectability of rental payments from certain tenants within this segment.

The increase in rental income was primarily due to our acquisition of eight triple net leased healthcare facilities from   January 1, 2015   through   September 30, 2016  , with the increase being partially offset by decreases due to the Specialty Hospital Terminations. The decreases in property operating and maintenance expense and operating expense reimbursements was also due to the Specialty Hospital Terminations.

  During the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , we recognized   $0.1 million   and   $0.5 million  , respectively, which primarily related to contingent purchase price consideration in connection with holdback and other vacancy escrow arrangements associated with two acquisitions. Contingent purchase price consideration during the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   related to releases from a holdback escrow for unit renovations at one of our SHOPs, partially offset by the settlement of certain property operating expenses related to vacancy escrow agreements at one acquisition which resulted in us making payments to the seller.

We did not sell any real estate investments and therefore had no gains or impairments on sale of real estate investments during the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  . 
  Operating Fees to Related Parties 
  Operating fees to related parties increased   $7.8 million   to   $15.5 million   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   from   $7.7 million   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  . We pay our Advisor and Property Manager for asset management and property management services, respectively.  
  Prior to April 1, 2015, asset management fees were paid by us causing the OP to issue restricted performance based Class B Units to the Advisor. On May 12, 2015, we entered into an amendment to our advisory agreement which, among other things, provided that, effective April 1, 2015, the asset management fee is payable to the Advisor or its assignees in cash, in shares, or a combination of both, the form of payment to be determined in the sole discretion of the Advisor, and is expensed as incurred. During the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  , we granted 128,781 Class B Units at an issue price of $22.50 per unit in lieu of paying for the asset management services in cash. The asset management fee is based a percentage of the lesser of (a) cost of assets and (b) fair value of assets. Asset management fees increased $6.1 million to   $13.2 million   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   from   $7.1 million   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  . The increase in the asset management fee is due to the amendment to the advisory agreement as well as an increase in the cost of assets for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , which was primarily related to our Acquisitions and capital expenditures during the period from January 1, 2015 through   September 30, 2016  .

We incurred   $2.3 million   in property management fees during the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , a $1.6 million increase from the   $0.7 million   in property management fees incurred during the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  . Property management fees increase in direct correlation with gross revenues. The Property Manager elected to waive a portion of property management fees for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  . For the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  , we would have incurred additional property management fees of   $1.2 million   had these fees not been waived. 
  Acquisition and Transaction Related Expenses 
  Acquisition and transaction related expenses of   $3.1 million   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   primarily related to costs associated with the Strategic Review, costs associated with property acquisitions that will not be completed and costs associated with acquisitions consummated during the year ended December 31, 2015. Acquisition and transaction related expenses of   $8.5 million   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015   primarily related to our acquisition of 31 properties during the period. Acquisition and transaction related expenses generally increase in direct correlation with the number and contract purchase price of properties acquired during the period and the level of activity surrounding any contemplated transaction. 
  General and Administrative Expenses 
  General and administrative expenses increased   $1.7 million   to   $9.3 million   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   from   $7.6 million   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  , including   $3.5 million   incurred from related parties during each period. The increase was primarily driven by professional fees incurred to support our larger real estate portfolio.  
  Depreciation and Amortization Expenses  
  Depreciation and amortization expense decreased   $21.0 million   to   $76.2 million   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   from   $97.2 million   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  . Same Store depreciation and amortization decreased   $40.0 million   primarily due to the expiration of the estimated useful lives of in-place leases recorded at acquisition, partially offset by increases of   $18.8 million   in depreciation and amortization related to our Acquisitions and   $0.2 million   related to internally developed corporate software that was capitalized and put into service in April 2015.  
  Interest Expense 
  Interest expense increased   $8.0 million   to   $14.8 million   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   from   $6.8 million   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  . Interest expense related to our mortgage notes payable increased   $1.4 million   related to our higher average mortgage notes payable balance of   $152.7 million   during the   nine months   ended of   September 30, 2016  , compared to the   $90.0 million   average balance during the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  , as well as the associated increases in amortization of deferred financing costs and accretion of mortgage discounts, partially offset by increased amortization of mortgage premiums. 
  We entered into a $50.0 million Credit Facility in March 2014. In April 2014, June 2015 and July 2015 we entered into amendments which increased available borrowings to $200.0 million, $500.0 million and $565.0, million respectively. Interest expense related to the Credit Facility increased   $6.5 million   primarily as a result of higher amortization of deferred financing costs as a result of the amendments and increases to the Credit Facility, as well as higher interest payments due to an average outstanding balance on the Credit Facility of   $457.8 million   during the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   compared to the   $64.0 million   average balance during the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  , partially offset by lower unused fees.  
  We view a mix of secured and unsecured financing sources as an efficient and accretive means to acquire properties and manage working capital. Our interest expense in future periods will vary based on our level of future borrowings, the cost of borrowings and the opportunity to acquire real estate assets which meet our investment objectives.  
  Interest and Other Income 
  Interest and other income decreased   $0.6 million   to approximately   $45,000   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   from   $0.6 million   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015  . Interest and other income includes income from our investment securities and interest income earned on cash and cash equivalents held during the period. During the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015   and the three months ended September 30, 2016, we sold all of our positions in preferred stock, common stock, real estate income funds and our investment in a senior note, which resulted in a decrease in dividend and interest income from our investment portfolio during the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  . 
  Gain on Sale of Investment Property 
  Gain on sale of investment property for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   related to the sale of a real estate investment located in Santa Rosa, California for $17.5 million, which resulted in a gain of   $1.3 million   during the period. We did not sell any of our real estate investments during the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015   and therefore had no gain on sale of investment property for such period.

     Table of Contents  

Gain on Sale of Investment Securities 
  Gain on sale of investments for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   of   $0.1 million   resulted from selling our investments in preferred stock with a cost basis of   $1.1 million  . Gain on sale of investments for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2015   of   $0.4 million   resulted from our selling of certain of our investments in preferred stock, common stock and real estate income funds and our investment in a senior note with a cost basis of   $18.8 million  . 
  Income Tax Benefit  
  Income tax benefit of   $1.2 million   and   $0.4 million   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   September 30, 2015  , respectively, related to deferred tax assets generated by current period net operating losses associated with our TRS. These deferred tax assets are partially offset by other income tax expenses incurred during the same period. Income taxes generally relate to our SHOPs, which are leased by our TRS.  
  Net Loss Attributable to Non-Controlling Interests  
  Net loss attributable to non-controlling interests was approximately   $54,000   and   $0.2 million   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015  , respectively, which represents the portion of our net income or net loss that is related to OP Unit and non-controlling interest holders.  
   
  Cash Flows for the   Nine Months Ended     September 30, 2016 
  During the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , net cash   provided by   operating activities was   $63.9 million  . The level of cash flows provided by operating activities is affected by the number of properties owned, the performance of those properties, the timing of interest payments and the amount of borrowings outstanding during the period, as well as the receipt of scheduled rent payments and the level of operating expenses. Cash inflows related to a net loss adjusted for non-cash items of   $72.2 million   (net loss of   $13.3 million   adjusted for non-cash items including depreciation and amortization of tangible and identifiable intangible real estate assets, deferred financing costs and mortgage premiums and discounts, equity based compensation, bad debt expense, gain or loss on sale of real estate investments and gain on sale of investment securities of   $85.5 million  ), an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of   $1.9 million   primarily related to accrued professional fees, real estate taxes and property operating expenses for our MOBs and SHOPs, as well as accrued related party fees and reimbursements, an increase of   $1.4 million   in deferred rent, and a   $0.1 million   decrease in restricted cash related to tenant deposits, real estate tax and insurance escrows on mortgaged properties. These cash inflows were partially offset by a net increase in prepaid and other assets of   $5.1 million   due to rent, other receivables and prepaid real estate taxes and insurance and a net increase in unbilled receivables recorded in accordance with straight-line basis accounting of   $6.5 million  . 
  Net cash used in investing activities during the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   was   $0.2 million  . The cash used in investing activities included   $21.8 million   to fund the ongoing development of a skilled nursing facility in Jupiter, Florida as well as   $5.7 million   of capital expenditures. These cash outflows were partially offset by proceeds from the sale of real estate of   $26.1 million  , proceeds from the sale of investment securities of   $1.1 million   and proceeds from a deposit for a potential real estate sale of   $0.1 million  . 
  Net cash   used in   financing activities of   $37.8 million   during the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016   related to distributions to stockholders of   $55.5 million  , common stock repurchases of   $12.2 million  , mortgage principal repayments of   $15.1 million  , payments of deferred financing costs of   $1.0 million   and distributions to non-controlling interest holders of   $0.5 million  . These cash outflows were partially offset by proceeds from the Credit Facility of   $46.5 million  . 
  Cash Flows for the   Nine Months Ended     September 30, 2015 
  During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, net cash provided by operating activities was $56.4 million. The level of cash flows used in or provided by operating activities is affected by the volume of acquisition activity, the timing of interest payments and the amount of borrowings outstanding during the period, as well as the receipt of scheduled rent payments and the level of operating expenses. Cash flows provided by operating activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 included $8.5 million of acquisition and transaction costs. Cash inflows related to a net loss adjusted for non-cash items of $66.8 million (net loss of $34.9 million adjusted for non-cash items including depreciation and amortization of tangible and identifiable intangible real estate assets, deferred financing costs and mortgage premiums, equity based compensation, bad debt expense and gain on sale of investments of $101.7 million) and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $7.0 million primarily related to accrued professional fees, real estate taxes and property operating expenses for our MOBs and SHOPs, as well as accrued related party property management fees and reimbursements and interest expense. These cash inflows were partially offset by a net increase in prepaid and other assets of $8.1 million due to rent, other receivables, prepaid real estate taxes and insurance and utility deposits, a net increase in unbilled receivables recorded in accordance with straight-line basis accounting of $7.3 million, a $1.2 million increase in restricted cash related to tenant deposits, real estate tax and insurance escrows on mortgaged properties and $0.7 million in deferred rent.

Net cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 was $301.9 million. The cash used in investing activities primarily included $313.0 million to acquire 31 properties. Net cash used in investing activities also included $3.2 million in deposits for future potential real estate acquisitions, $5.0 million of capital expenditures and $0.1 million for the purchase of investment securities, partially offset by $19.3 million in proceeds from the sale of investment securities. 
  Net cash provided by financing activities of $110.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2015 related to proceeds from the Credit Facility of $185.0 million to fund acquisitions and contributions from non-controlling interest holders of $0.5 million. These cash inflows were partially offset by distributions to stockholders, net of proceeds received pursuant to the DRIP of $49.4 million, common stock repurchases of $5.9 million, payments of deferred financing costs of $12.4 million, mortgage payments of $6.0 million, offering costs paid of $0.6 million and distributions to non-controlling interest holders of $0.5 million. 
   
  Liquidity and Capital Resources  
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had   $50.4 million   of cash and cash equivalents. We closed our IPO on November 17, 2014, which resulted in net proceeds of   $2.2 billion  . 
  We acquired our first property and commenced real estate operations in May 2013. As of   September 30, 2016  , we owned   163   properties with real estate investments, at cost, of   $2.3 billion  . Our principal demands for cash will be for acquisition costs, including the purchase price of any properties, loans and securities we acquire, funding our ongoing development project, improvement costs, the payment of our operating and administrative expenses, debt service obligations and distributions to our stockholders. We generally intend to acquire assets with mortgage or other debt proceeds, such as proceeds from our Credit Facility.  
  We expect to fund our future short-term operating liquidity requirements through a combination of cash on hand, net cash provided by our current property operations and the operations of properties to be acquired in the future, and proceeds from secured mortgage financings, our Credit Facility and our credit facilities with KeyBank National Association (the  KeyBank Facility ) and Capital One Multifamily Finance, LLC (the  Capital One Facility , and, together with the KeyBank Facility, the  Fannie Credit Facilities ), which closed on October 31, 2016. 
  We expect to utilize proceeds from secured financings and our Credit Facility and Fannie Credit Facilities to complete future property acquisitions. Specifically, we may incur mortgage debt and pledge all or some of our properties as security for that debt to obtain funds to acquire additional properties. Once we have used all the availability under our Credit Facility and Fannie Credit Facilities to acquire properties, we expect that cash flow from our properties will be sufficient to fund operating expenses and the payment of our monthly distributions. Other potential future sources of capital include proceeds from secured and unsecured financings from banks or other lenders, proceeds from public and private offerings, proceeds from the sale of properties and undistributed funds from operations, if any. We may borrow if we need funds to satisfy the REIT tax qualifications requirement that we generally distribute annually to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (which does not equal net income, as calculated in accordance with GAAP, determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gain). We also may borrow if we otherwise deem it necessary or advisable to assure that we maintain our qualification as a REIT. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the balance outstanding under the Credit Facility was   $476.5 million  . Our unused borrowing capacity was   $41.5 million  , based on assets assigned to the Credit Facility as of   September 30, 2016  . Availability of borrowings is based on a pool of eligible unencumbered real estate assets. As of   September 30, 2016  , we had the ability to borrow up to   $565.0 million   on a revolving basis under the Credit Facility and the Credit Facility also contains a subfacility for letters of credit of up to   $25.0 million  . Additionally, the Credit Facility contains an "accordion" feature to allow the Company, under certain circumstances, to increase the aggregate borrowings under the Credit Facility to a maximum of   $750.0 million  . The Credit Facility matures on March 21, 2019. As of   September 30, 2016  , our secured debt leverage ratio (total secured debt divided by total assets) was approximately   28.0%   and we had total secured borrowings of   $620.9 million   and no unsecured borrowings. 
  On October 31, 2016, we, through wholly-owned subsidiaries of our OP, entered into the Fannie Credit Facilities that provide for initial aggregate borrowings of   $60.0 million  . We may request future advances under the Fannie Credit Facilities by borrowing against the value of the initial mortgaged properties or adding eligible properties to the collateral pool, subject to customary conditions, including satisfaction of minimum debt service coverage and maximum loan-to-value tests. The initial advances under the Fannie Credit Facilities will mature on November 1, 2026.

To the extent that we maintain borrowing capacity under our Credit Facility and Fannie Credit Facilities, such available amount will be included in calculating our liquid assets. Our Advisor will consider various factors in determining the amount of liquid assets we should maintain, including, but not limited to, our receipt of proceeds received from common stock issued under the DRIP, our cash flow from operations, available borrowing capacity under our Credit Facility and Fannie Credit Facilities, if any, our receipt of proceeds from any asset sale, and the use of cash to fund repurchases. The Board will review the amount and sources of liquid assets on a quarterly basis.  
  The Board has adopted a Share Repurchase Program (as amended, the "SRP") which enables our stockholders to sell their shares to us under limited circumstances. At the time a stockholder requests a repurchase, we may, subject to certain conditions, repurchase the shares presented for repurchase for cash. On January 26, 2016, the Board approved and amended the SRP (the "First SRP Amendment") to supersede and replace the existing SRP. Under the First SRP Amendment, repurchases of shares of our common stock, when requested, are at the sole discretion of the Board and generally will be made semiannually (each six-month period ending June 30 or December 31, a  fiscal semester ). On June 28, 2016, the Board of the Company further amended the SRP (the "Second SRP Amendment") to provide for one twelve-month repurchase period for calendar year 2016 (the  2016 Repurchase Period ) instead of two semi-annual periods ending June 30 and December 31. There are limits on the number of shares we may repurchase under this program during any fiscal semester and the 2016 Repurchase Period. Further, we are only authorized to repurchase shares in a given fiscal semester or the 2016 Repurchase Period up to the amount of proceeds received from our DRIP in that same period.  
  The following table reflects the number of shares repurchased cumulatively through   September 30, 2016  :

            (2) 
    Excludes   2.4 million   shares that have been requested for repurchase and are not yet fulfilled as of   September 30, 2016  . These shares, and all additional shares requested prior to December 31, 2016, will be considered for repurchase, to the extent the requests are not withdrawn by December 31, 2016. All requested shares will be subject to the annual limitations set forth in the SRP. The   6,660   shares above represent unaccrued repurchases for the year ended December 31, 2015 that were finalized in January 2016. 
      
  Non-GAAP Financial Measures    
  This section includes non-GAAP financial measures including Funds from Operations, Modified Funds from Operations and Net Operating Income. A description of these non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, which is net income, are provided below: 
   
  Funds from Operations and Modified Funds from Operations 
  The historical accounting convention used for real estate assets requires straight-line depreciation of buildings, improvements, and straight-line amortization of intangibles, which implies that the value of a real estate asset diminishes predictably over time. We believe that, because real estate values historically rise and fall with market conditions, including, but not limited to, inflation, interest rates, the business cycle, unemployment and consumer spending, presentations of operating results for a REIT using the historical accounting convention for depreciation and certain other items may be less informative. 
  Because of these factors, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT"), an industry trade group, has published a standardized measure of performance known as funds from operations ("FFO"), which is used in the REIT industry as a supplemental performance measure. We believe FFO, which excludes certain items such as real estate-related depreciation and amortization, is an appropriate supplemental measure of a REIT's operating performance. FFO is not equivalent to our net income or loss as determined under GAAP.  
  We define FFO, a non-GAAP measure, consistent with the standards set forth in the White Paper on FFO approved by the Board of Governors of NAREIT, as revised in February 2004 (the "White Paper"). The White Paper defines FFO as net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP, but excluding gains or losses from sales of property and real estate related impairments, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures, if any, are calculated to reflect FFO on the same basis. 
  
    54 

     Table of Contents  

We believe that the use of FFO provides a more complete understanding of our performance to investors and to management, and reflects the impact on our operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, general and administrative expenses, and interest costs, which may not be immediately apparent from net income. 
  Changes in the accounting and reporting promulgations under GAAP that were put into effect in 2009 subsequent to the establishment of NAREIT's definition of FFO, such as the change to expense as incurred rather than capitalize and depreciate acquisition fees and expenses incurred for business combinations, have prompted an increase in cash-settled expenses, specifically acquisition fees and expenses, as items that are expensed under GAAP across all industries. These changes had a particularly significant impact on publicly registered, non-listed REITs, which typically have a significant amount of acquisition activity in the early part of their existence, particularly during the period when they are raising capital through ongoing initial public offerings. 
  Because of these factors, the Investment Program Association ("IPA"), an industry trade group, has published a standardized measure of performance known as modified funds from operations ("MFFO"), which the IPA has recommended as a supplemental measure for publicly registered, non-listed REITs. MFFO is designed to be reflective of the ongoing operating performance of publicly registered, non-listed REITs by adjusting for those costs that are more reflective of acquisitions and investment activity, along with other items the IPA believes are not indicative of the ongoing operating performance of a publicly registered, non-listed REIT, such as straight-lining of rents as required by GAAP. We believe it is appropriate to use MFFO as a supplemental measure of operating performance because we believe that, when compared year-over-year, both before and after we have deployed all of our offering proceeds and are no longer incurring a significant amount of acquisition fees or other related costs, it reflects the impact on our operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, general and administrative expenses, and interest costs, which may not be immediately apparent from net income. MFFO is not equivalent to our net income or loss as determined under GAAP. 
  We define MFFO, a non-GAAP measure, consistent with the IPA's Guideline 2010-01, Supplemental Performance Measure for Publicly Registered, Non-Listed REITs: Modified Funds from Operations (the "Practice Guideline") issued by the IPA in November 2010. The Practice Guideline defines MFFO as FFO further adjusted for acquisition fees and expenses and other items. In calculating MFFO, we follow the Practice Guideline and exclude acquisition fees and expenses, amortization of above and below market and other intangible lease assets and liabilities, amounts relating to straight-line rent adjustments (in order to reflect such payments from a GAAP accrual basis to a cash basis of disclosing the lease and rental payments), contingent purchase price consideration, accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums on debt investments, mark-to-market adjustments included in net income, gains or losses included in net income from the extinguishment or sale of debt, hedges, foreign exchange, derivatives or securities holdings where trading of such holdings is not a fundamental attribute of the business plan, unrealized gains or losses resulting from consolidation from, or deconsolidation to, equity accounting, and adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures, with such adjustments calculated to reflect MFFO on the same basis. We also exclude other non-operating items in calculating MFFO, such as transaction-related fees and expenses (which include costs associated with the Strategic Review) and capitalized interest.  
  We believe that, because MFFO excludes costs that we consider more reflective of acquisition activities and other non-operating items, MFFO can provide, on a going-forward basis, an indication of the sustainability (that is, the capacity to continue to be maintained) of our operating performance once our portfolio is stabilized. We also believe that MFFO is a recognized measure of sustainable operating performance by the non-listed REIT industry and allows for an evaluation of our performance against other publicly registered, non-listed REITs. 
  Not all REITs, including publicly registered, non-listed REITs, calculate FFO and MFFO the same way. Accordingly, comparisons with other REITs, including publicly registered, non-listed REITs, may not be meaningful. Furthermore, FFO and MFFO are not indicative of cash flow available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) or income (loss) from continuing operations as determined under GAAP as an indication of our performance, as an alternative to cash flows from operations as an indication of our liquidity, or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs including our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. FFO and MFFO should be reviewed in conjunction with GAAP measurements as an indication of our performance. The methods utilized to evaluate the performance of a publicly registered, non-listed REIT under GAAP should be construed as more relevant measures of operational performance and considered more prominently than the non-GAAP measures, FFO and MFFO, and the adjustments to GAAP in calculating FFO and MFFO. 
  Neither the SEC, NAREIT, the IPA nor any other regulatory body or industry trade group has passed judgment on the acceptability of the adjustments that we use to calculate FFO or MFFO. In the future, NAREIT, the IPA or another industry trade group may publish updates to the White Paper or the Practice Guideline or the SEC or another regulatory body could standardize the allowable adjustments across the publicly registered, non-listed REIT industry and we would have to adjust our calculation and characterization of FFO or MFFO accordingly.

  Net Operating Income  
  NOI is a non-GAAP financial measure used by us to evaluate the operating performance of our real estate. NOI is equal to total revenues, excluding contingent purchase price consideration, less property operating and maintenance expense. NOI excludes all other items of expense and income included in the financial statements in calculating net income (loss). 
  We believe NOI provides useful and relevant information because it reflects only those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level and presents such items on an unlevered basis. We use NOI to assess and compare property level performance and to make decisions concerning the operation of the properties. Further, we believe NOI is useful to investors as a performance measure because, when compared across periods, NOI reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating expenses and acquisition activity on an unleveraged basis, providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income (loss). 
  NOI excludes certain components from net income (loss) in order to provide results that are more closely related to a property's results of operations. For example, interest expense is not necessarily linked to the operating performance of a real estate asset and is often incurred at the corporate level. In addition, depreciation and amortization, because of historical cost accounting and useful life estimates, may distort operating performance at the property level. NOI presented by us may not be comparable to NOI reported by other REITs that define NOI differently. We believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our operating results, NOI should be examined in conjunction with net income (loss) as presented in our consolidated financial statements. NOI should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) as an indication of our performance or to cash flows as a measure of our liquidity or ability to make distributions.

  Distributions 
  In April 2013, our directors authorized, and we declared, a distribution payable on a monthly basis to stockholders of record on a daily basis at a rate equal to   $0.0046575343   per day, which is equivalent to   $1.70   per annum, per share of common stock, which began in May 2013. In March 2016, the Board ratified the existing distribution amount equivalent to   $1.70   per annum, and, for calendar year 2016, affirmed a change to the daily distribution payable to stockholders of record each day during the applicable period to   $0.0046448087   per day per share of common stock to accurately reflect that 2016 is a leap year. Distributions are payable by the 5th day following each month end to stockholders of record at the close of business each day during the prior month.  
  
    60 

     Table of Contents  

The amount of distributions payable to our stockholders is determined by the Board and is dependent on a number of factors, including funds available for distribution, our financial condition, capital expenditure requirements, as applicable, requirements of Maryland law and annual distribution requirements needed to maintain our status as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). Distribution payments are dependent on the availability of funds. The Board may reduce the amount of distributions paid or suspend distribution payments at any time and therefore distribution payments are not assured. 
  During the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , distributions paid to common stockholders and OP Unit holders totaled   $112.0 million  , including   $56.0 million   which was reinvested through our DRIP.  
  The following table shows the sources for the payment of distributions to common stockholders, including distributions on unvested restricted stock and OP Units, but excluding distributions related to Class B Units as these distributions are recorded as an expense in our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss, for the periods indicated: 

For the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , cash flows   provided by   operations were   $63.9 million  . As shown in the table above, we funded distributions with cash flows provided by operations as well as proceeds received from common stock issued under our DRIP, the sale of investment securities, the sale of real estate investments and financings. To the extent we pay distributions in excess of cash flows provided by operations, our stockholders' investment may be adversely impacted. Since inception, our cumulative distributions have exceeded our cumulative FFO. Distributions paid from sources other than our cash flows from operations will result in us having fewer funds available for other needs such as property acquisitions and other real estate-related investments. 
  We may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations in 2016 to pay distributions at our current level and we may not generate sufficient cash flows from operations to pay future distributions. The amount of cash available for distributions is affected by many factors, such as rental income from acquired properties and our operating expense levels, as well as many other variables. Actual cash available for distributions may vary substantially from estimates. Since inception, our cumulative distributions have exceeded our cumulative FFO. We cannot give any assurance that future acquisitions of real properties, if any, will increase our cash available for distributions to stockholders. Our actual results may differ significantly from the assumptions used by the Board in establishing a distribution rate to stockholders. 
  
    61 

     Table of Contents  

If we do not generate sufficient cash flows from our operations, we expect to use a portion of our cash on hand and the proceeds from our DRIP to pay distributions. A decrease in the level of stockholder participation in our DRIP could have an adverse impact on our ability to meet these expectations. If these sources are insufficient, we may use other sources, such as from borrowings, the sale of additional securities, advances from our Advisor, and our Advisor's deferral, suspension or waiver of its fees and expense reimbursements, as to which it has no obligation, to fund distributions. 
  The following table compares cumulative distributions paid to cumulative net loss and cumulative cash flows provided by operations (in accordance with GAAP) for the period from October 15, 2012 (date of inception) through   September 30, 2016  : 

_____________________ 
            (2) 
    Net loss as defined by GAAP includes the non-cash impact of depreciation and amortization expense as well as costs incurred relating to acquisitions and related transactions. 
      
  Loan Obligations 
  The payment terms of our mortgage notes payable generally require principal and interest amounts payable monthly with all unpaid principal and interest due at maturity. The payment terms of our Credit Facility require interest only amounts payable monthly with all unpaid principal and interest due at maturity. Our loan agreements require us to comply with specific reporting covenants. As of   September 30, 2016  , we were in compliance with the debt covenants under our loan agreements. 
  Our Advisor may cause us, with approval from our independent directors, to seek to borrow short-term capital that, combined with secured mortgage financing, exceeds our targeted leverage ratio.

Contractual Obligations 
  The following table reflects contractual debt obligations under our mortgage notes payable and Credit Facility and minimum base rental cash payments due for leasehold interests over the next five years and thereafter as of   September 30, 2016  . The minimum base rental cash payments due for leasehold interests amounts exclude contingent rent payments, as applicable, that may be payable based on provisions related to increases in annual rent based on exceeding certain economic indexes, among other items. As of   September 30, 2016  , the outstanding mortgage notes payable and loans under the Credit Facility had weighted-average effective interest rates of   5.3%   and   2.0%  , respectively. 

_______________________________ 
           (1) 
    Lease rental payments due includes   $3.4 million   of imputed interest related to our capital lease obligations. 
              (2) 
    In August 2015, the Company entered into an asset purchase agreement and development agreement to acquire and subsequently fund the remaining construction of a skilled nursing facility in Jupiter, Florida for   $82.0 million  . 
      
  Election as a REIT    
  We elected and qualified to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Code, effective for our taxable year ended December 31, 2013. Commencing with such taxable year, we were organized and operated in a manner so that we qualify for taxation as a REIT under the Code. We intend to continue to operate in such a manner but no assurance can be given that we will operate in a manner so as to remain qualified for taxation as a REIT. In order to continue to qualify for taxation as a REIT, we must, among other things, distribute annually at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (which does not equal net income as calculated in accordance with GAAP) determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains, and must comply with a number of other organizational and operational requirements. If we continue to qualify for taxation as a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal corporate income tax on that portion of our REIT taxable income that we distribute to our stockholders. Even if we continue to qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to certain state and local taxes on our income and properties as well as federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed income.  
   
  Inflation 
  We may be adversely impacted by inflation on any leases that do not contain indexed escalation provisions. In addition, we may be required to pay costs for maintenance and operation of properties, which may adversely impact our results of operations due to potential increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation. 
   
  Related-Party Transactions and Agreements 
  Please see   Note 9       Related Party Transactions and Arrangements   of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 
   
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.

Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. 
  The market risk associated with financial instruments and derivative financial instruments is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices or interest rates. Our long-term debt, which consists of secured financings and our Credit Facility, bears interest at fixed rates and variable rates. Our interest rate risk management objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs. To achieve these objectives, from time to time, we may enter into interest rate hedge contracts such as swaps, collars, and treasury lock agreements in order to mitigate our interest rate risk with respect to various debt instruments. We will not hold or issue these derivative contracts for trading or speculative purposes. As of    September 30, 2016  , we did not have any derivative financial instruments. We do not have any foreign operations and thus we are not exposed to foreign currency fluctuations. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , our debt consisted of both fixed and variable-rate debt. We had fixed-rate secured mortgage financings with an aggregate carrying value of   $145.3 million   and a fair value of   $149.2 million  .  Changes in market interest rates on our fixed-rate debt impact the fair value of the mortgage notes, but it has no impact on interest due on the mortgage notes. For instance, if interest rates rise 100 basis points and our fixed rate debt balance remains constant, we expect the fair value of our obligation to decrease, the same way the price of a bond declines as interest rates rise. The sensitivity analysis related to our fixed rate debt assumes an immediate 100 basis point move in interest rates from their   September 30, 2016   levels, with all other variables held constant. A 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would result in a decrease in the fair value of our fixed-rate debt by   $6.1 million  . A 100 basis point decrease in market interest rates would result in an increase in the fair value of our fixed-rate debt by   $6.8 million  . 
  At   September 30, 2016  , our variable-rate Credit Facility had a carrying and fair value of   $476.5 million  . Interest rate volatility associated with this variable-rate Credit Facility affects interest expense incurred and cash flow. The sensitivity analysis related to all other variable-rate debt assumes an immediate 100 basis point move in interest rates from their   September 30, 2016   levels, with all other variables held constant. A 100 basis point increase or decrease in variable interest rates on our variable-rate Credit Facility would increase or decrease our interest expense by   $4.8 million  . 
  These amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rate changes on our borrowing costs, and assuming no other changes in our capital structure.  The information presented above includes only those exposures that existed as of   September 30, 2016   and does not consider exposures or positions arising after that date. The information represented herein has limited predictive value. Future actual realized gains or losses with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on cumulative exposures, hedging strategies employed and the magnitude of the fluctuations. 
   
  Item 4. Controls and Procedures. 
  Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures 
  In accordance with Rules 13a-15(b) and 15d-15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), we, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and Rule 15d-15(e) of the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and determined that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective. 
  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting    
  No change occurred in our internal controls over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during the   three months   ended   September 30, 2016   that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.

PART II   OTHER INFORMATION 
   
  Item 1. Legal Proceedings. 
  We are not a party to, and none of our properties are subject to, any material pending legal proceedings. 
   
  Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
  Our potential risks and uncertainties are presented in the section entitled "Item 1A. Risk Factors," disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  .  The following additional risk factors should be considered regarding our potential risks and uncertainties: 
  Distributions paid from sources other than our cash flows from operations result in us having fewer funds available for the acquisition of properties and other real estate-related investments and may dilute our stockholders' interests in us, which may adversely affect our ability to fund future distributions with cash flows from operations and may adversely affect our stockholders' overall return.  
  Our cash flows   provided by   operations were   $63.9 million   for the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  . During the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , we paid distributions of   $112.0 million  , of which   $63.9 million  , or   57.0%  , was funded from cash flows from operations,   $43.8 million  , or   39.1%  , was funded from proceeds received from our DRIP,   $2.6 million  , or   2.4%  , was funded from the sale of real estate and   $1.7 million  , or   1.5%  , was funded from the sale of investment securities. During the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , cash flow from operations included an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of   $1.9 million  , as reflected on the statement of cash flows. Accordingly, if these accounts payable and accrued expenses had been paid during the   nine months   ended   September 30, 2016  , there would have been   $1.9 million   less in cash flow from operations available to pay distributions.  
  We may not generate sufficient cash flows from operations to pay future distributions. Moreover, the Board may change our distribution policy, in its sole discretion, at any time. In accordance with our organizational documents and Maryland law, we may not make distributions that would: (1) cause us to be unable to pay our debts as they become due in the usual course of business; (2) cause our total assets to be less than the sum of our total liabilities plus senior liquidation preferences, if any; or (3) jeopardize our ability to continue to qualify as a REIT. 
  Funding distributions from borrowings could restrict the amount we can borrow for investments, which may affect our profitability. Funding distributions with the sale of assets may affect our ability to generate additional operating cash flows. Funding distributions from the sale of additional securities could dilute each stockholder's interest in us if we sell shares of our common stock or securities that are convertible or exercisable into shares of our common stock to third-party investors. Payment of distributions from the mentioned sources could restrict our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations, affect our profitability or affect the distributions payable to stockholders upon a liquidity event, any or all of which may have an adverse effect on an investment in our shares. 
  Our property portfolio has a high concentration of properties located in   seven   states. Our properties may be adversely affected by economic cycles and risks inherent to those states. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the following   seven   states represented 5% or more of our consolidated annualized rental income on a straight-line basis for the fiscal year ended   September 30, 2016  :

     Table of Contents  

Any adverse situation that disproportionately affects the states listed above may have a magnified adverse effect on our portfolio. Real estate markets are subject to economic downturns, as they have been in the past, and we cannot predict how economic conditions will impact this market in both the short and long term. Declines in the economy or a decline in the real estate market in these states could hurt our financial performance and the value of our properties. Factors that may negatively affect economic conditions in these states include: 
             
    business layoffs or downsizing; 
                
    industry slowdowns; 
                
    relocations of businesses; 
                
    changing demographics; 
                
    increased telecommuting and use of alternative work places; 
                
    infrastructure quality; 
                
    any oversupply of, or reduced demand for, real estate; 
                
    concessions or reduced rental rates under new leases for properties where tenants defaulted; 
                
    increased insurance premiums; 
                
    state budgets and payment to providers under Medicaid or other state healthcare programs; and 
                
    changes in reimbursement for healthcare services from commercial insurers. 
      
  Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities. 
  Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities 
  On July 28, 2016, we granted 5,388 shares of restricted stock that vest over a period of five years to our independent directors, pursuant to our employee and director incentive restricted share plan. No selling commissions or other consideration were paid in connection with such issuances, which were made without registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act") in reliance upon the exemption from registration in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act.

MASTER CREDIT FACILITY AGREEMENT  

  (SENIORS HOUSING)  

This MASTER CREDIT
FACILITY AGREEMENT (SENIORS HOUSING) (as amended, restated, replaced, supplemented, or otherwise modified from time to time, and
further defined in the Definitions Schedule, the   Master Agreement  ) is made as of October 31, 2016, by
and among (i) the entities identified as Borrower on the Summary of Master Terms, each a Delaware limited liability company,
and (ii)  KEYBANK NATIONAL ASSOCIATION , a national banking association, as Lender. 

RECITALS  : 

A.          Borrower
owns one (1) or more Multifamily Residential Properties as more particularly described in  Exhibit A  to this Master
Agreement. 

B.           Borrower
has requested that Lender make a loan in favor of Borrower, comprised of a $30,000,000 Variable Advance, and a $0 Fixed Advance.
Future Advances may be made by Lender to Borrower in accordance with the terms of this Master Agreement. 

C.           To
secure the obligations of Borrower under this Master Agreement and the other Loan Documents, Borrower shall create a Collateral
Pool in favor of Lender. The Collateral Pool shall be comprised of (i) the Multifamily Residential Properties listed on  Exhibit A 
and (ii) any other collateral pledged to Lender from time to time by Borrower pursuant to this Master Agreement or any other
Loan Documents. 

D.           Each
Note and Security Document shall be cross-defaulted ( i.e. , a default under any Note, Security Document or this Master Agreement
shall constitute a default under each other Note and Security Document and under this Master Agreement) and cross-collateralized
( i.e. , each Security Instrument shall secure all of Borrower s obligations under each Note, this Master Agreement,
and the other Loan Documents). It is the intent of the parties to this Master Agreement that, upon the occurrence and during the
continuance of an Event of Default, Lender may accelerate any Note without the obligation but with the right to accelerate any
other Note and that in the exercise of its rights and remedies under the Loan Documents, Lender may exercise and perfect any and
all of its rights and remedies in and under the Loan Documents with regard to any Mortgaged Property without the obligation but
with the right to exercise and perfect its rights and remedies with respect to any other Mortgaged Property. Subject to the limitations
set forth in the Security Instruments, any such exercise shall be without regard to the Allocable Facility Amount assigned to such
Mortgaged Property. Subject to the limitations set forth in the Security Instruments, Lender may recover an amount equal to the
full amount Outstanding in respect of any of the Notes in connection with such exercise and any such amount shall be applied to
the Indebtedness as determined by Lender pursuant to the terms of this Master Agreement, the Notes, and the other Loan Documents. 

E.           It
is the intent of the parties that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or the existence of any cash management system
maintained by Borrower, and/or Guarantor or Borrower Affiliates or the provision by Guarantor of the Guaranty, Lender is making
Advances to Borrower (not to Guarantor or Borrower Affiliates). Lender has underwritten the making of the Advances based on its
analysis of the value of the Collateral. In making the Advances, Lender is relying on each Borrower being and maintaining itself
as a Single Purpose entity whose sole asset is its Mortgaged Property and ancillary property related thereto. Lender acknowledges
that it views its credit risk as the performance and value of the Mortgaged Properties and it views the Guaranty as independent
supplemental support in the event that one of the exceptions to the non-recourse events occurs. 

F.           Subject
to the terms, conditions, and limitations of this Master Agreement, Lender has agreed to make the Advances. 

G.           It
is anticipated that Lender shall assign each Advance made hereunder to Fannie Mae; however Fannie Mae shall not assume (i) any
of the obligations of Lender, if any, under this Master Agreement to make Future Advances, or (ii) any of the obligations of Lender
which are servicing obligations delegated to Lender as servicer of the Advances. 

NOW, THEREFORE, in
consideration of Borrower and Lender entering into this Master Agreement and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt
and adequacy of which are hereby conclusively acknowledged, the parties hereby covenant, agree, represent, and warrant as follows: 

AGREEMENTS :  

ARTICLE 1 
DEFINITIONS; SUMMARY OF TERMS 

Section 1.01            Defined
Terms. 

Capitalized terms not
otherwise defined in the body of this Master Agreement shall have the meanings set forth in the Definitions Schedule attached to
this Master Agreement. 

Section 1.02            Schedules,

ARTICLE 2 
ADVANCES; COLLATERAL EVENTS 

Section 2.01             Variable
Advance and Fixed Advance. 

Subject to the terms,
conditions, and limitations of this Master Agreement: 

(a)          Variable
Advance. 

Lender agrees to make
Variable Advances to Borrower in accordance with the terms and provisions of this Master Agreement. Future Advances may be made
pursuant to Section 2.02(c)(2) (Future Advances). Pursuant to the terms of Section 2.10(a) (Conversion from Variable Note to Fixed
Note), Borrower may convert a Variable Note to a Fixed Note. 

(b)          Fixed
Advance. 

Lender agrees to make
Fixed Advances to Borrower in accordance with the terms and provisions of this Master Agreement. Future Advances may be made pursuant
to Section 2.02(c)(2) (Future Advances). 

Section 2.02            Advances. 

(a)          Request. 

Assuming Advances are
available to Borrower under this Master Agreement and this Section 2.02 (Advances), Borrower   shall request a Future Advance
by giving Lender a Future Advance Request. The Future Advance Request shall indicate whether the Request is for a Fixed Advance
or Variable Advance or more than one type of Advance. 

(b)          Limitations
on Executions. 

Notwithstanding anything
in this Master Agreement or any other Loan Document to the contrary, any Future Advance (whether a Variable Advance or a Fixed
Advance) and any Conversion of an Advance shall be subject to the precondition that Lender must confirm with Fannie Mae that Fannie
Mae is generally offering to purchase in the marketplace advances of the execution type requested by Borrower at the time of the
Request and at the time the rate for such Advance is locked. In the event Fannie Mae is not purchasing advances of the type requested
by Borrower, Lender agrees to offer, to the extent available from Fannie Mae, alternative advance executions based on the types
of executions Fannie Mae is generally offering to purchase in the marketplace at that time. Any alternative execution offered would
be subject to mutually agreeable documentation necessary to implement the terms and conditions of such alternative execution. 

(c)         Making
Advances. 

(1)          Initial
Advances. 

Assuming
conditions of Lender have been met prior to or as of the date of this Master Agreement, Lender shall make the Initial Advance(s)
to Borrower. 

(2)          Future
Advances. 

(A)         Subject
to Section 2.02(b) (Limitations on Executions) and satisfaction of the terms in the Future Advance Schedule, Borrower may request
a Future Advance. Lender is not committing in this Master Agreement to make a Future Advance and any Future Advance will be at
the option of Lender except for an Advance provided in the proviso of Section 2.02(c)(2)(B) (Future Advances) below, subject to
the requirements of such proviso and this Master Agreement. Once made, any Future Advance shall be subject to this Master Agreement
in all respects and shall be secured by the Security Instruments encumbering the Mortgaged Properties. 

(B)         Any
Future Advance shall be made in connection with the Addition of Additional Mortgaged Properties; provided, however, Borrower may
request that a Future Advance made pursuant to Section 2.02(c)(2)(A) (Future Advances) above be made without the Addition of Additional
Mortgaged Property based on decreases in the Aggregate Loan to Value Ratio and increases in the Aggregate Debt Service Coverage
Ratio (or based on the difference between (x) the Aggregate Loan to Value Ratio and Aggregate Debt Service Coverage Ratio and (y)
the Coverage and LTV Tests) as determined by Lender in accordance with the Future Advance Schedule and the Underwriting and Servicing
Requirements subject to the terms of this Section 2.02(c)(2) (Future Advances) and Section 2.02(b) (Limitations on Executions).
Such Future Advance under this paragraph (B) shall be made during the period ending on the Fifth Anniversary but not more than
once annually during the Term of this Master Agreement. 

(C)         All
Future Advances must satisfy the terms of the Future Advance Schedule and any addition of Additional Mortgaged Property shall satisfy
the terms of the Mortgaged Property Addition Schedule. 

(D)         [Intentionally
deleted.] 

(E)         [Intentionally
deleted.] 

(F)         Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Master Agreement, no Future Advance or Conversion shall be permitted unless immediately after
such Future Advance or Conversion the Advances then Outstanding will not exceed one hundred percent (100%) of the aggregate
fair market value of all real property securing such Advances (where fair market value is determined for these purposes based upon
a current Appraisal or some other commercially reasonable valuation method). 

(3)         Closing
of Future Advance. 

If the conditions
set forth in this Section 2.02 (Advances) and the Future Advance Schedule are satisfied (and, if applicable, all conditions set
forth on the Mortgaged Property Addition Schedule are satisfied), Lender shall make the requested Future Advance on an Effective
Date mutually agreed to by Lender and Borrower (or on such other date as Borrower and Lender may agree). 

Section 2.03           Advance
Terms and Payments on Advances. 

(a)          Debt
Service Payments. 

(1)         Short
Month Interest. 

If the date
the proceeds of an Advance are disbursed is any day other than the first day of the month, interest for the period beginning on
the disbursement date and ending on and including the last day of the month in which the disbursement occurs shall be payable by
Borrower on the date the Advance proceeds are disbursed. In the event that the disbursement date is not the same as the Effective
Date, then: 

(A)         the
disbursement date and the Effective Date must be in the same month, and 

(B)         the
Effective Date shall not be the first day of the month. 

(2)          Interest
Accrual and Computation; Amortization; Interest Rate Cap. 

(A)         Except
as provided in Section 2.03(a)(1) (Short Month Interest), interest shall be paid in arrears. Except as otherwise provided in this
Master Agreement, for Fixed Advances, interest shall accrue at the Interest Rate until fully paid; and for Variable Structured
ARM Advances, interest shall accrue at the Adjustable Rate until fully paid. If the Interest Accrual Method is  Actual/360, 
Borrower acknowledges and agrees that the amount allocated to interest for each month will vary depending on the actual number
of calendar days during such month.  

(B)         With
respect to any Variable Structured ARM Advances, the following provisions shall apply:  

(i)          The
Initial Adjustable Rate shall be effective until the first Rate Change Date. Thereafter, the Adjustable Rate shall change on each
Rate Change Date based on fluctuations in the Current Index. 

(ii)          Each
amortizing Monthly Debt Service Payment shall include a principal payment equal to the Fixed Monthly Principal Component.  

(iii)        Before
each Payment Change Date, Lender shall notify Borrower of any change in the Adjustable Rate and the amount of the next Monthly
Debt Service Payment. 

(iv)        If
Lender determines at any time that it has miscalculated the amount of a Monthly Debt Service Payment (whether because of a miscalculation
of the Adjustable Rate or otherwise), then Lender shall give notice to Borrower of the corrected amount of the Monthly Debt Service
Payment (and the corrected Adjustable Rate, if applicable) and (1) if the corrected amount of the Monthly Debt Service Payment
represents an increase, then Borrower shall, within thirty (30) calendar days thereafter, pay to Lender any sums that Borrower
would have otherwise been obligated to pay to Lender had the amount of the Monthly Debt Service Payment not been miscalculated,
or (2) if the corrected amount of the Monthly Debt Service Payment represents a decrease and Borrower is not otherwise in
default under any of the Loan Documents, then Borrower shall thereafter be paid the sums that Borrower would not have otherwise
been obligated to pay to Lender had the amount of the Monthly Debt Service Payment not been miscalculated. 

(v)         [Intentionally
Deleted] 

(vi)        If
required by Lender, to protect against fluctuations in interest rates during the Term of this Master Agreement, Borrower shall
enter into the Cap Security Agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the Cap Security Agreement, Borrower shall make arrangements for
a LIBOR-based interest rate cap in form and substance satisfactory to Lender with a counterparty satisfactory to Lender (  Interest
Rate Cap  ) to be in place and maintained at all times with respect to any Variable Advance which has been funded and
remains Outstanding. The seller of the Interest Rate Cap (seller and its transferees and assigns, the   Counterparty  )
shall be a financial institution meeting the minimum requirements for hedge counterparties acceptable to Lender. The Interest Rate
Cap shall have a minimum initial term of three (3) years. The minimum term for all replacement Interest Rate Caps shall be
the lesser of three (3) years or the remaining term of the Variable Advance, as further set forth in the Cap Security Agreement.
Borrower shall be required to make Monthly Deposits (as defined in the Cap Security Agreement) to be held in an Interest Rate Cap
Reserve Escrow Account (as defined in the Cap Security Agreement). As set forth in the Cap Security Agreement, Borrower agrees
to pledge its right, title, and interest in the Interest Rate Cap to Lender as additional collateral for the Indebtedness. 

Notwithstanding
the foregoing, Borrower may elect to obtain an interest rate swap in lieu of an Interest Rate Cap to satisfy the hedging requirements
set forth above. Such interest rate swap shall be with a counterparty approved by Lender and on such forms as are reasonably approved
by Lender. In connection with such interest rate swap, Borrower shall enter into a  Hedge Security Agreement  in the
form required by Fannie Mae.  

(C)         The
amortization and payment of interest (and principal, if applicable) for each Advance shall be determined at the Effective Date
of each Advance.  

(3)          Monthly
Debt Service Payments. 

Consecutive
monthly debt service installments (comprised of either interest only or principal and interest, depending on the Amortization Type),
each in the amount of the applicable Monthly Debt Service Payment for an Advance, shall be due and payable on the First Payment
Date, and on each Payment Date thereafter until the Maturity Date of such Advance, at which time all Indebtedness relating to such
Advance shall be due. Any regularly scheduled Monthly Debt Service Payment that is received by Lender before the applicable Payment
Date shall be deemed to have been received on such Payment Date solely for the purpose of calculating interest due. All payments
made by Borrower under this Master Agreement shall be made without set-off, counterclaim, or other defense. 

(4)          Payment
at Maturity. 

(A)         The
unpaid principal balance of an Advance, any Accrued Interest thereon, and all other Indebtedness relating to such Advance shall
be due and payable on the applicable Maturity Date for such Advance. 

(B)         Except
in connection with a complete repayment of all Advance(s), if Borrower pays any Advances at maturity of such Advance and requests
a Release of any Mortgaged Property, such Release shall be subject to the Release Price and release tests in the Mortgaged Property
Release Schedule. 

(5)         Maturity
Dates. 

(A)         The
Maturity Date of each Variable Advance shall be specified by Borrower for such Variable Advance, provided that such Maturity Date
shall be no earlier than the date that is the first day of the month following the date five (5) years after the Effective
Date of such Variable Advance and no later than the date that is the first day of the month following the date ten (10) years
after the Effective Date of such Variable Advance provided no Maturity Date shall exceed the date that is the first day of the
month following the date ten (10) years after the Initial Effective Date. 

(B)         The
Maturity Date of each Fixed Advance shall be specified by Borrower for such Fixed Advance, provided that such Maturity Date shall
be no earlier than the date that is the first day of the month following the date five (5) years after the Effective Date
for such Fixed Advance and no later than the date that is the first day of the month following the date ten (10) years after
the Effective Date of such Fixed Advance provided no Maturity Date shall exceed the date that is the first day of the month following
the date ten (10) years after the Initial Effective Date. 

(6)         Interest
Rate Type; Notes. 

(A)         The
obligation of Borrower to repay each Variable Advance shall be evidenced by one or more separate Variable Notes. Each Variable
Note shall be payable to the order of Lender and shall be made in the original principal amount of such Variable Advance. 

(B)         The
obligation of Borrower to repay each Fixed Advance shall be evidenced by one or more separate Fixed Notes. The Fixed Note shall
be payable to the order of Lender and shall be made in the original principal amount of such Fixed Advance. 

(b)         Capitalization
of Accrued but Unpaid Interest. 

Any accrued and unpaid
interest on an Advance remaining past due for thirty (30) days or more may, at Lender s election, be added to and become
part of the unpaid principal balance of such Advance. 

(c)          Late
Charges. 

(1)         If
any Monthly Debt Service Payment due hereunder is not received by Lender within ten (10) days after the applicable Payment
Date, or any amount payable under this Master Agreement (other than the payment due on the applicable Maturity Date for repayment
of an Advance in full) or any other Loan Document is not received by Lender within ten (10) days after the date such amount
is due, inclusive of the date on which such amount is due, Borrower shall pay to Lender, immediately without demand by Lender,
the Late Charge. 

(2)         The
Late Charge is payable in addition to, and not in lieu of, any interest payable at the Default Rate pursuant to Section 2.03(d)
(Default Rate). 

(3)         Borrower
acknowledges and agrees that: 

(A)         its
failure to make timely payments will cause Lender to incur additional expenses in servicing and processing the Advances; 

(B)         it
is extremely difficult and impractical to determine those additional expenses; 

(C)         Lender
is entitled to be compensated for such additional expenses; and 

(D)         the
Late Charge represents a fair and reasonable estimate, taking into account all circumstances existing on the date hereof, of the
additional expenses Lender will incur by reason of any such late payment. 

(d)         Default
Rate. 

(1)         Default
interest shall be paid as follows: 

(A)         If
any amount due in respect of an Advance (other than amounts due on the Maturity Date) remains past due for thirty (30) days
or more, interest on such unpaid amount(s) shall accrue from the date payment is due at the Default Rate and shall be payable upon
demand by Lender. 

(B)         If
any Indebtedness due is not paid in full on the applicable Maturity Date, then interest shall accrue at the Default Rate on all
such unpaid amounts from such Maturity Date until fully paid and shall be payable upon demand by Lender. 

Absent a
demand by Lender, any such amounts shall be payable by Borrower in the same manner as provided for the payment of Monthly Debt
Service Payments. To the extent permitted by Applicable Law, interest shall also accrue at the Default Rate on any judgment obtained
by Lender against Borrower in connection with the Advances. To the extent Borrower or any other Person is vested with a right of
redemption, interest shall continue to accrue at the Default Rate during any redemption period until such time as the Mortgaged
Property has been redeemed. 

(2)         Borrower
acknowledges and agrees that: 

(A)         its
failure to make timely payments will cause Lender to incur additional expenses in servicing and processing the Advances; and 

(B)         in
connection with any failure to timely pay all amounts due in respect of an Advance on the applicable Maturity Date, or during the
time that any amount due in respect of an Advance is delinquent for more than thirty (30) days: 

(i)          Lender s
risk of nonpayment of the Advance will be materially increased; 

(ii)         Lender s
ability to meet its other obligations and to take advantage of other investment opportunities will be adversely impacted; 

(iii)        Lender
will incur additional costs and expenses arising from its loss of the use of the amounts due; 

(iv)        it
is extremely difficult and impractical to determine such additional costs and expenses; 

(v)         Lender
is entitled to be compensated for such additional risks, costs, and expenses; and 

(vi)        the
increase from the Interest Rate to the Default Rate represents a fair and reasonable estimate of the additional risks, costs, and
expenses Lender will incur by reason of Borrower s delinquent payment and the additional compensation Lender is entitled
to receive for the increased risks of nonpayment associated with a delinquency on the Advance (taking into account all circumstances
existing on the applicable Effective Date). 

(e)          Address
for Payments. 

All payments due pursuant
to the Loan Documents shall be payable at Lender s Payment Address, or such other place and in such manner as may be designated
from time to time by written notice to Borrower by Lender. 

(f)          Application
of Payments. 

Subject to the terms
of Section (d) (Application of Release Price) of the Mortgaged Property Release Schedule, if at any time Lender receives, from
Borrower or otherwise, any payment in respect of the Indebtedness that is less than all amounts due and payable at such time, then
Lender may apply such payment to amounts then due and payable in any manner and in any order determined by Lender or hold in suspense
and not apply such amount at Lender s election. Neither Lender s acceptance of a payment that is less than all amounts
then due and payable, nor Lender s application of, or suspension of the application of, such payment, shall constitute or
be deemed to constitute either a waiver of the unpaid amounts or an accord and satisfaction. Notwithstanding the application of
any such amount to the Indebtedness, Borrower s obligations under this Master Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall
remain unchanged. 

Section 2.04            Prepayment;
Prepayment Lockout; Prepayment Premium. 

(a)          Subject
to the terms and conditions of the applicable Prepayment Premium Schedule and the requirements relating to application of the Release
Price set forth in the Mortgaged Property Release Schedule, Notes are prepayable in whole or in part, provided that Borrower shall
not make a voluntary full or partial prepayment of a Note during any Prepayment Lockout Period, if any. Except as expressly provided
in this Master Agreement (including as provided in the Prepayment Premium Schedule applicable to such Note), a Prepayment Premium
calculated in accordance with the Prepayment Premium Schedule applicable to such Note shall be payable in connection with any prepayment
of such Note. 

(b)          If
a Prepayment Lockout Period applies to the applicable Note, and during such Prepayment Lockout Period Lender accelerates the unpaid
principal balance of the Note or otherwise applies collateral held by Lender to the repayment of any portion of the unpaid principal
balance of the Note, the Prepayment Premium shall be due and payable and equal to the amount obtained by multiplying the percentage
indicated (if at all) in the Prepayment Premium Schedule for such Note by the amount of principal being prepaid at the time of
such acceleration or application. 

(c)          In
connection with any such voluntary prepayment, Borrower acknowledges and agrees that interest shall always be calculated and paid
through the last day of the month in which the prepayment occurs (even if the Permitted Prepayment Date for such month is not the
last day of such month, or if Lender approves prepayment on an Intended Prepayment Date that is not a Permitted Prepayment Date).
Borrower further acknowledges that Lender is not required to accept a voluntary prepayment of a Note on any day other than a Permitted
Prepayment Date. However, if Lender does approve an Intended Prepayment Date that is not a Permitted Prepayment Date and accepts
a prepayment on such Intended Prepayment Date, such prepayment shall be deemed to be received on the immediately following Permitted
Prepayment Date. If Borrower fails to prepay the applicable Note (or such portion of the Note as is intended to be prepaid) on
the Intended Prepayment Date for any reason (including on any Intended Prepayment Date that is approved by Lender) and such failure
either continues for five (5) Business Days, or into the following month, Lender shall have the right to recalculate the payoff
amount. If Borrower prepays a Note either in the following month or more than five (5) Business Days after the Intended Prepayment
Date that was approved by Lender, Lender shall also have the right to recalculate the payoff amount based upon the amount of such
payment and the date such payment was received by Lender. Borrower shall immediately pay to Lender any additional amounts required
by any such recalculation. 

(d)          After
receipt of a partial prepayment, Lender shall re-calculate the Monthly Debt Service Payment based upon the remaining unpaid principal
balance of the applicable Note for each subsequent monthly debt service installment due under such Note. For amortizing Advances,
the subsequent Monthly Debt Service Payments shall be calculated by amortizing the remaining unpaid principal balance of the applicable
Note over the Remaining Amortization Period utilizing the Fixed Rate and the Interest Accrual Method set forth in the applicable
Schedule of Advance Terms. Lender shall notify Borrower of the new required Monthly Debt Service Payment following receipt of a
partial prepayment and Borrower shall execute any amendment requested by Lender to evidence such new required monthly installment(s). 

Section 2.05            Acceleration
of Advances. 

Upon acceleration of
any Advance in accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents, Borrower shall pay to Lender: 

(a)          the
entire unpaid principal balance of the Advances; 

(b)          all
Accrued Interest (calculated through the last day of the month in which the acceleration occurs); 

(c)          the
Prepayment Premium, if any; and 

(d)          all
other Indebtedness. 

Section 2.06            Application
of Collateral. 

Any application by
Lender of any collateral or other security to the repayment of all or any portion of the unpaid principal balance of the Advances
prior to the Maturity Date in accordance with the Loan Documents shall be deemed to be a prepayment by Borrower. Any such prepayment
shall require the payment to Lender by Borrower of the Prepayment Premium calculated on the amount being prepaid in accordance
with this Master Agreement and applied in accordance with Section (d) (Application of Release Price) of the Mortgaged Property
Release Schedule. 

Section 2.07             Casualty
and Condemnation. 

Notwithstanding any
provision of this Master Agreement to the contrary, no Prepayment Premium shall be payable with respect to any prepayment occurring
as a result of the application of any insurance proceeds or amounts received in connection with a Condemnation Action in accordance
with this Master Agreement. 

Section 2.08            No
Effect on Payment Obligations. 

Unless otherwise expressly
provided in this Master Agreement, any prepayment required by any Loan Document of less than the entire unpaid principal balance
of the Advance(s) shall not extend or postpone the due date of any subsequent Monthly Debt Service Payments, Monthly Replacement
Reserve Deposit, or other payment. 

Section 2.09            Loss
Resulting from Prepayment. 

In any circumstance
in which a Prepayment Premium is due under this Master Agreement, Borrower acknowledges that: 

(a)          any
prepayment of the unpaid principal balance of any Advance, whether voluntary or involuntary, or following the occurrence of an
Event of Default by Borrower, will result in Lender s incurring loss, including reinvestment loss, additional risk, expense,
and frustration or impairment of Lender s ability to meet its commitments to third parties; 

(b)          it
is extremely difficult and impractical to ascertain the extent of such losses, risks and damages; 

(c)          the
formula for calculating the Prepayment Premium represents a reasonable estimate of the losses, risks, and damages Lender will incur
as a result of a prepayment; and 

(d)          the
provisions regarding the Prepayment Premium contained in this Master Agreement are a material part of the consideration for this
Master Agreement, and that the terms of this Master Agreement are in other respects more favorable to Borrower as a result of Borrower s
voluntary agreement to such prepayment provisions. 

Section 2.10            Collateral
Events 

(a)          Conversion
from Variable Note to Fixed Note. 

Subject to and in accordance
with the terms and conditions of the Conversion Schedule, Borrower shall have the right, from time to time during the Conversion
Availability Period, to convert all or any portion of a Variable Note to a Fixed Note. 

(b)         Right
to Obtain Releases of Mortgaged Property. 

Subject to and in accordance
with the terms and conditions of the Mortgaged Property Release Schedule, Borrower shall have the right from time to time to obtain
a release of one or more Mortgaged Properties (a   Release  ) from the Collateral Pool. 

(c)          Right
to Add Additional Mortgaged Properties as Collateral. 

Subject to and in accordance
with the terms and conditions of the Mortgaged Property Addition Schedule, Borrower shall have the right, from time to time to
add one or more Additional Mortgaged Properties (an   Addition  ) to the Collateral Pool. 

(d)          Right
to Substitutions. 

Subject to and in accordance
with the terms and conditions of the Mortgaged Property Release Schedule and the Mortgaged Property Addition Schedule, Borrower
shall have the right to obtain the release of one or more Mortgaged Properties by replacing such Mortgaged Property with one (1)
or more Additional Mortgaged Properties that meet the requirements of this Master Agreement thereby effecting a   Substitution  
of Collateral. 

(e)          Limitation
on Collateral Events. 

Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Master Agreement, no Collateral Event (other than a Conversion) shall be permitted unless immediately after
such Collateral Event the Advances then Outstanding will not exceed one hundred percent (100%) of the aggregate fair market
value of all real property securing such Advances (where fair market value is determined for these purposes based upon a current
Appraisal or some other commercially reasonable valuation method as determined by Lender). 

Section 2.11            Termination
of Master Agreement. 

Subject to the terms
and conditions set forth below, Borrower shall have the right to terminate this Master Agreement and receive a Release of all of
the Collateral. 

(a)          Request. 

To terminate this Master
Agreement, Borrower shall deliver a Termination Request to Lender, which request Borrower shall have the right to rescind at any
time prior to the Effective Date of the Termination. 

(b)          Conditions
Precedent. 

The right of Borrower
to terminate this Master Agreement and to receive a Release of all of the Collateral from the Collateral Pool and Lender s
obligation to execute and deliver the Termination Documents on the Effective Date are subject to the following conditions precedent: 

(1)         receipt
by Lender of the fully executed Termination Request; 

(2)         payment
by Borrower in full of each Note Outstanding on the Effective Date, including any associated Prepayment Premiums or other amounts
due under each Note and all of the other amounts owing by Borrower to Lender under this Master Agreement and the Other Loan Documents
(it being agreed that no Release Fee shall be payable in connection with such a termination); and 

(3)         payment
by Borrower of Lender s and Fannie Mae s reasonable third party out-of-pocket fees and expenses payable in accordance
with this Master Agreement, including Lender s and Fannie Mae s legal fees and expenses. 

(c)          Closing. 

If all conditions precedent
contained in this Section 2.11 (Termination of Master Agreement) are satisfied, this Master Agreement shall terminate, and Lender
shall cause all of the Collateral to be Released on an Effective Date mutually selected by Borrower and Lender, within thirty (30)
Business Days after all of the conditions with respect to such Termination Request have been satisfied (or on such other date as
Borrower and Lender may agree), and all applicable parties shall execute and deliver, all at the sole cost and expense of Borrower,
the Termination Documents. 

ARTICLE 3 
PERSONAL LIABILITY 

Section 3.01            Non-Recourse
Liability; Exceptions. 

Except as otherwise
provided in this Article 3 (Personal Liability) or in any other Loan Document, none of Borrower, or any director, officer, manager,
member, partner, shareholder, trustee, trust beneficiary, or employee of Borrower, shall have personal liability under this Master
Agreement or any other Loan Document for the repayment of the Indebtedness or for the performance of any other obligations of Borrower
under the Loan Documents, and Lender s only recourse for the satisfaction of such Indebtedness and the performance of such
obligations shall be Lender s exercise of its rights and remedies with respect to the Mortgaged Properties and any other
Collateral held by Lender as security for the Indebtedness. This limitation on Borrower s liability shall not limit or impair
Lender s enforcement of its rights against Guarantor under any Loan Document.

Liability of Borrower 

(a)          Personal

(8)         failure
to cause the renewal, continuation, extension, or maintenance of all Licenses or, if any Licenses are to be transferred to a transferee
approved by Lender, failure to cause such Licenses to be transferred or reissued within the period of time required under Applicable
Law and to provide to Lender written notice of such transfer including copies of the newly issued Licenses; 

(9)         revocation

forth in Section 4.02(d) (Borrower Status   Covenants   Single Purpose Status), then, if such breach can be cured,
Borrower shall have thirty (30) days from the earlier of (A) the date of delivery of the annual Officer s Certificate
set forth in Section 8.02(b)(7) (Items to Furnish to Lender) indicating such breach, (B) the date Lender notices Borrower of such
breach, or (C) the date Borrower discovers such breach, to cure such breach, provided that if such breach can be cured but cannot
reasonably be cured within such thirty (30) day period and Borrower shall have commenced to cure such breach within such thirty (30)
day period and thereafter diligently and expeditiously proceeds to cure the same, such thirty (30) day period shall be extended
for so long as it shall require Borrower in the exercise of due diligence to cure such breach, it being agreed that no such extension
shall be for a period in excess of sixty (60) days for any individual breach. 

Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Borrower shall not have personal liability under clauses (1), (3) or (5) above to the extent that Borrower lacks the legal right
to direct the disbursement of the applicable funds due to an involuntary Bankruptcy Event with respect to Borrower that occurs
without the consent, collusion, or active participation of Affiliated Property Operator, Guarantor, Key Principal or any Borrower
Affiliate. 

(b)          Full
Personal Liability (Full Recourse). 

Borrower shall be personally
liable to Lender for the repayment of all of the Indebtedness, and the Advances shall be fully recourse to Borrower, upon the occurrence
of any of the following: 

(1)         failure
to comply with each of the Single Purpose requirements of: 

(A)         Section
4.02(d)(1), (2), (5) and (6) (Borrower Status   Covenants   Single Purpose Status) of this Master Agreement; and 

(B)         Section
4.02(d)(3), (4) and (7)-(15)  (Borrower Status   Covenants   Single Purpose
Status)  of this Master Agreement and a court of competent jurisdiction holds or determines that such failure or combination
of failures is the basis, in whole or in part, for the substantive consolidation of the assets and liabilities of Borrower or
any general partner or sole member of Borrower with the assets and liabilities of a debtor pursuant to Title 11 of the Bankruptcy
Code;  

(2)         a
Transfer (other than a conveyance of a Mortgaged Property at a Foreclosure Event pursuant to the Security Instrument and this Master
Agreement) that is not permitted under this Master Agreement or any other Loan Document; 

(3)         the
occurrence of any Bankruptcy Event with respect to Borrower, Key Principal, Guarantor, or Affiliated Property Operator (other than
an acknowledgement in writing as described in clause (b) of the definition of  Bankruptcy Event ); provided, however,
in the event of an involuntary Bankruptcy Event with respect to Borrower, Key Principal, Guarantor, or Affiliated Property Operator,
Borrower shall only be personally liable if such involuntary Bankruptcy Event occurs with the consent, collusion or active participation
of Borrower, Affiliated Property Operator, Guarantor, Key Principal, or any Borrower Affiliate; 

(4)         fraud,
written material misrepresentation, or material omission by Borrower, Affiliated Property Operator, Guarantor, Key Principal, or
any officer, director, partner, manager, member, shareholder, or trustee of Borrower, Affiliated Property Operator, Guarantor,
or Key Principal   (not including shareholders of HTI who do not otherwise Control or have a direct Ownership Interest in
Borrower, Affiliated Property Operator, Guarantor, or Key Principal) in connection with any application for or creation of the
Indebtedness; or 

(5)         fraud,
written intentional material misrepresentation or intentional material omission by Borrower, Affiliated Property Operator, Guarantor,
Key Principal, or any officer, director, partner, manager, member, shareholder, or trustee of Borrower, Affiliated Property Operator,
Guarantor, or Key Principal (not including shareholders of HTI who do not otherwise Control or have a direct Ownership Interest
in Borrower, Affiliated Property Operator, Guarantor, or Key Principal) in connection with on-going financial or other reporting
required by the Loan Documents, or any request for action or consent by Lender. 

Section 3.03            Personal
Liability for Indemnity Obligations. 

Borrower shall be personally
and fully liable to Lender for Borrower s indemnity obligations under Section 13.01(e) (Replacement Reserves and Repairs
  Indemnification) of this Master Agreement, the Environmental Indemnity Agreement and any other express indemnity obligations
provided by Borrower under any Loan Document. Borrower s liability for such indemnity obligations shall not be limited by
the amount of the Indebtedness, the repayment of the Indebtedness, or otherwise, provided that Borrower s liability for such
indemnities shall not include any loss caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Lender as determined by a court
of competent jurisdiction pursuant to a final non-appealable court order. 

Section 3.04            Lender s
Right to Forego Rights Against Mortgaged Property. 

To the extent that
Borrower has personal liability under this Master Agreement or any other Loan Document, Lender may exercise its rights against
Borrower personally to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law without regard to whether Lender has exercised any rights
against any Mortgaged Property or any other security, or pursued any rights against Guarantor, or pursued any other rights available
to Lender under this Master Agreement, any other Loan Document, or Applicable Law. For purposes of this Section 3.04 (Lender s
Right to Forego Rights Against Mortgaged Property) only, the term  Mortgaged Property  shall not include any funds
that have been applied by Borrower or Property Operator as required or permitted by this Master Agreement prior to the occurrence
of an Event of Default, or that Borrower was unable to apply as required or permitted by this Master Agreement because of a Bankruptcy
Event with respect to Borrower. To the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, in any action to enforce Borrower s personal
liability under this Article 3 (Personal Liability), Borrower waives any right to set off the value of a Mortgaged Property against
such personal liability. 

Section 3.05            Borrower
Agency Provisions. 

(a)          Each
Borrower shall irrevocably designate Borrower Agent to be its agent and in such capacity to receive on behalf of Borrower all proceeds,
receive all notices on behalf of Borrower under this Master Agreement, make all requests under this Master Agreement, and execute,
deliver, and receive all instruments, certificates, requests, documents, amendments, writings, and further assurances now or hereafter
required hereunder, on behalf of such Borrower, and hereby authorizes Lender to pay over all proceeds hereunder in accordance with
the request of Borrower Agent. Each Borrower hereby acknowledges that all notices required to be delivered by Lender to any Borrower
shall be delivered to Borrower Agent and thereby shall be deemed to have been received by such Borrower. 

(b)          The
handling of this Master Agreement as a co-borrowing facility with a Borrower Agent in the manner set forth in this Master Agreement
is solely as an accommodation to each of Borrower and Guarantor and is at their mutual request. Lender shall not incur liability
to Borrower or Guarantor as a result thereof. To induce Lender to do so and in consideration thereof, each Borrower hereby indemnifies
Lender and holds Lender harmless from and against any and all liabilities, expenses, losses, damages, and claims of damage or injury
asserted against Lender by any Person arising from or incurred by reason of Borrower Agent handling of the financing arrangements
of Borrower as provided herein, reliance by Lender on any written request or instruction from Borrower Agent or any other action
taken by Lender with respect to this Section 3.05 (Borrower Agency Provisions) except due to willful misconduct or gross negligence
of the indemnified party as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to a final, non-appealable court order. 

Section 3.06         Joint
and Several Obligation; Cross-Guaranty. 

Notwithstanding anything
contained in this Master Agreement or the other Loan Documents to the contrary (but subject to the provisions of Section 3.01 (Non-Recourse
Liability; Exceptions), Section 3.02(a) (Personal Liability Based on Lender s Loss (Partial Recourse)) and Section 3.02(b)
(Full Personal Liability (Full Recourse)), the last sentence of this Section 3.06 (Joint and Several Obligation; Cross-Guaranty)
and the provisions of Section 3.13 (Maximum Liability of Each Borrower), each Borrower shall have joint and several liability for
the Indebtedness. Notwithstanding the intent of all of the parties to this Master Agreement that the Indebtedness of each Borrower
under this Master Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall be joint and several obligations of each Borrower, each Borrower,
on a joint and several basis, hereby irrevocably guarantees on a non-recourse basis, subject to the exceptions to non-recourse
provisions of Section 3.01 (Non-Recourse Liability; Exceptions), Section 3.02(a) (Personal Liability Based on Lender s Loss
(Partial Recourse)) and Section 3.02(b) (Full Personal Liability (Full Recourse)), to Lender and its successors and assigns, the
full and prompt payment (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) and performance of, all Indebtedness owed or
hereafter owing to Lender by each other Borrower. Each Borrower agrees that its non-recourse guaranty obligation hereunder is an
unconditional guaranty of payment and performance and not merely a guaranty of collection. The Indebtedness of each Borrower under
this Master Agreement shall not be subject to any counterclaim, set-off, recoupment, deduction, cross-claim, or defense based upon
any claim any Borrower may have against Lender or any other Borrower. 

Section 3.07            Waivers
With Respect to Other Borrower Secured Obligation. 

To the extent that
a Security Instrument or any other Loan Document executed by one Borrower secures an Obligation of another Borrower (the   Other
Borrower Secured Obligation  ), or to the extent that a Borrower has guaranteed the debt of another Borrower pursuant
to Article 3 (Personal Liability), Borrower who executed such Loan Document or guaranteed such debt (the   Waiving Borrower  )
hereby agrees to the extent permitted by law, to the provisions of this Section 3.07 (Waivers with Respect to Other Borrower Secured
Obligation). To the extent that any Mortgaged Properties are located in California, and to the extent permitted by law, the references
to the California statutes below shall apply to this Master Agreement and any California Security Instrument securing or encumbering
a Mortgaged Property located in California; otherwise the California statutes referenced below shall have no effect on this Master
Agreement or any other Loan Document. All references in Article 3 (Personal Liability) to California law are only applicable if
any Mortgaged Property is located in California. To the maximum extent permitted by Applicable Law: 

(a)          The
Waiving Borrower hereby waives any right it may now or hereafter have to require the beneficiary, assignee, or other secured party
under such Loan Document, as a condition to the exercise of any remedy or other right against it thereunder or under any other
Loan Document executed by the Waiving Borrower in connection with the Other Borrower Secured Obligation: (1) to proceed against
any other Borrower or any other Person, or against any other collateral assigned to Lender by any Borrower or any other Person;
(2) to pursue any other right or remedy in Lender s power; (3) to give notice of the time, place, or terms of any public
or private sale of real or personal property collateral assigned to Lender by any other Borrower or any other Person, or otherwise
to comply with Section 9615 of the California Commercial Code (as modified or recodified from time to time) with respect to
any such personal property collateral located in the State of California; or (4) to make or give (except as otherwise expressly
provided in the Security Documents) any presentment, demand, protest, notice of dishonor, notice of protest, or other demand or
notice of any kind in connection with the Other Borrower Secured Obligation or any collateral for the Other Borrower Secured Obligation. 

(b)          The
Waiving Borrower hereby waives any defense it may now or hereafter have that relates to: (1) any disability or other defense
of any other Borrower or any other Person; (2) the cessation, from any cause other than full performance, of the Other Borrower
Secured Obligation; (3) the application of the proceeds of the Other Borrower Secured Obligation, by any other Borrower or any
other Person, for purposes other than the purposes represented to the Waiving Borrower by any other Borrower or any other Person,
or otherwise intended or understood by the Waiving Borrower or any other Borrower; (4) any act or omission by Lender which directly
or indirectly results in or contributes to the release of any other Borrower or any other Person or any collateral for any Other
Borrower Secured Obligation; (5) the unenforceability or invalidity of any Security Document or Loan Document (other than the Security
Instrument executed by the Waiving Borrower that secures the Other Borrower Secured Obligation) or guaranty with respect to any
Other Borrower Secured Obligation, or the lack of perfection or continuing perfection or lack of priority of any Lien (other than
the Lien of the Security Instrument executed by the Waiving Borrower that secures the Other Borrower Secured Obligation) which
secures any Other Borrower Secured Obligation; (6) any failure of Lender to marshal assets in favor of the Waiving Borrower or
any other Person; (7) any modification of any Other Borrower Secured Obligation, including any renewal, extension, acceleration,
or increase in interest rate; (8) any and all rights and defenses arising out of an election of remedies by Lender, even though
that election of remedies, such as a nonjudicial foreclosure with respect to security for a guaranteed obligation, has destroyed
the Waiving Borrower s rights of subrogation and reimbursement against the principal by the operation of Section 580d
of the California Code of Civil Procedure or otherwise; (9) any law which provides that the obligation of a surety or guarantor
must neither be larger in amount nor in other respects more burdensome than that of the principal or which reduces a surety s
or guarantor s obligation in proportion to the principal obligation; (10) any failure of Lender to file or enforce a claim
in any bankruptcy or other proceeding with respect to any Person; (11) the election by Lender, in any bankruptcy proceeding of
any Person, of the application or non-application of Section 1111(b)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code; (12) any extension of credit
or the grant of any lien under Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code; (13) any use of cash collateral under Section 363
of the Bankruptcy Code; or (14) any agreement or stipulation with respect to the provision of adequate protection in any bankruptcy
proceeding of any Person. The Waiving Borrower further waives any and all rights and defenses that it may have because the Other
Borrower Secured Obligation is secured by real property; this means, among other things, that: (A) Lender may collect from the
Waiving Borrower without first foreclosing on any real or personal property collateral pledged by any other Borrower; (B) if Lender
forecloses on any real property collateral pledged by any other Borrower, then (i) the amount of the Other Borrower Secured Obligation
may be reduced only by the price for which that collateral is sold at the foreclosure sale, even if the collateral is worth more
than the sale price, and (ii) Lender may foreclose on the real property encumbered by the Security Instrument executed by the Waiving
Borrower and securing the Other Borrower Secured Obligation, or otherwise collect from the Waiving Borrower, even if Lender, by
foreclosing on the real property collateral of any one or more of the other Borrowers, has destroyed any right the Waiving Borrower
may have to collect from such other Borrowers. Subject to the last sentence of Section 3.06 (Joint and Several Obligation; Cross-Guaranty),
the foregoing sentence is an unconditional and irrevocable waiver of any rights and defenses the Waiving Borrower may have because
the Other Borrower Secured Obligation is secured by real property. These rights and defenses being waived by the Waiving Borrower
include, but are not limited to, any rights or defenses based upon Section 580a, 580b, 580d, or 726 of the California Code of Civil
Procedure. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing or any other provision hereof, the Waiving Borrower further expressly
waives, except as provided in Section 3.07(g) (Waivers with Respect to Other Borrower Secured Obligation) below, to the extent
permitted by law any and all rights and defenses that might otherwise be available to it under California Civil Code Sections 2787
to 2855, inclusive, 2899 and 3433, or under California Code of Civil Procedure Sections 580a, 580b, 580d, and 726, or any of such
sections; 

(c)          The
Waiving Borrower hereby waives any and all benefits and defenses under California Civil Code Section 2810 and agrees that by doing
so the Security Instrument executed by the Waiving Borrower and securing the Other Borrower Secured Obligation shall be and remain
in full force and effect even if one or more of the other Borrowers had no liability at the time of incurring the Other Borrower
Secured Obligation, or thereafter ceases to be liable. The Waiving Borrower hereby waives any and all benefits and defenses under
California Civil Code Section 2809 and agrees that by doing so the Waiving Borrower s liability may be larger in amount and
more burdensome than that of any one or more of the other Borrowers. The Waiving Borrower hereby waives the benefit of all principles
or provisions of law that are or might be in conflict with the terms of any of its waivers, and agrees that the Waiving Borrower s
waivers shall not be affected by any circumstances that might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge of a surety or
a guarantor. The Waiving Borrower hereby waives the benefits of any right of discharge and all other rights and defenses under
any and all statutes or other laws relating to guarantors or sureties, to the fullest extent permitted by law, diligence in collecting
the Other Borrower Secured Obligation, presentment, demand for payment, protest, all notices with respect to the Other Borrower
Secured Obligation that may be required by statute, rule of law, or otherwise to preserve Lender s rights against the Waiving
Borrower hereunder, including notice of acceptance, notice of any amendment of the Loan Documents evidencing the Other Borrower
Secured Obligation, notice of the occurrence of any default or Event of Default, notice of intent to accelerate, notice of acceleration,
notice of dishonor, notice of foreclosure, notice of protest, notice of the incurring by the other Borrower of any obligation or
indebtedness and all rights to require Lender to (1) proceed against the other Borrower, (2) proceed against any general partner
of the other Borrower, (3) proceed against or exhaust any collateral held by Lender to secure the Other Borrower Secured Obligation,
or (4) if the other Borrower is a partnership, pursue any other remedy it may have against the other Borrower, or any general partner
of the other Borrower, including any and all benefits under California Civil Code Sections 2845, 2849, and 2850; 

(d)          The
Waiving Borrower understands that the exercise by Lender of certain rights and remedies contained in a Security Instrument executed
by any other Borrower (such as a nonjudicial foreclosure sale) may affect or eliminate the Waiving Borrower s right of subrogation
against such other Borrower and that the Waiving Borrower may therefore incur a partially or totally nonreimburseable liability.
Nevertheless, the Waiving Borrower hereby authorizes and empowers Lender to exercise, in its sole and absolute discretion, any
right or remedy, or any combination thereof, that may then be available, since it is the intent and purpose of the Waiving Borrower
that its waivers shall be absolute, independent and unconditional under any and all circumstances; 

(e)          In
accordance with Section 2856 of the California Civil Code, the Waiving Borrower also waives any right or defense based upon
an election of remedies by Lender, even though such election (e.g., nonjudicial foreclosure with respect to any collateral held
by Lender to secure repayment of the Other Borrower Secured Obligation) destroys or otherwise impairs the subrogation rights of
the Waiving Borrower to any right to proceed against one or more of the other Borrowers for reimbursement by operation of Section 580d
of the California Code of Civil Procedure or otherwise; 

(f)          Subject
to the last sentence of Section 3.06 (Joint and Several Obligation; Cross-Guaranty), in accordance with Section 2856 of the
California Civil Code, the Waiving Borrower waives any and all other rights and defenses available to the Waiving Borrower by reason
of Sections 2787 through 2855, inclusive, of the California Civil Code, including any and all rights or defenses the Waiving
Borrower may have by reason of protection afforded to one or more of the other Borrowers with respect to the applicable Other Borrower
Secured Obligation pursuant to the antideficiency or other laws of the State of California limiting or discharging such Other Borrower
Secured Obligation, including Sections 580a, 580b, 580d, and 726 of the California Code of Civil Procedure; 

(g)          In
accordance with Section 2856 of the California Civil Code and pursuant to any other Applicable Law, the Waiving Borrower agrees
to withhold the exercise of any and all subrogation, contribution, and reimbursement rights against all other Borrowers, against
any other Person, and against any collateral or security for the Other Borrower Secured Obligation, including any such rights pursuant
to Sections 2847 and 2848 of the California Civil Code, until the Other Borrower Secured Obligation has been indefeasibly
paid and satisfied in full, all obligations owed to Lender under the Loan Documents have been fully performed, and Lender has released,
transferred or disposed of all of its right, title, and interest in such collateral or security; 

(h)          Each
Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that, notwithstanding Section 3.07(g) (Waivers with Respect to Other Borrower
Secured Obligation) hereof, in the event, and to the extent, that its agreement and waiver set forth in Section 3.07(g) (Waivers
with Respect to Other Borrower Secured Obligation) is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be void or voidable for any
reason and such Borrower has any subrogation or other rights against any other Borrower, any such claims, direct or indirect, that
such Borrower may have by subrogation rights or other form of reimbursement, contribution, or indemnity, against any other Borrower
or to any security or any such Borrower, shall be, and such rights, claims, and indebtedness are hereby, deferred, postponed, and
fully subordinated in time and right of payment to the prior payment, performance, and satisfaction in full of the Indebtedness.
Until payment and performance in full with interest (including post-petition interest in any case under any chapter of the Bankruptcy
Code) of the Indebtedness, each Borrower agrees not to accept any payment or satisfaction of any kind of Indebtedness of any other
Borrower in respect of any such subrogation rights arising by virtue of payments made pursuant to this Article 3 (Personal Liability),
and hereby assigns such rights or indebtedness to Lender, including (1) the right to file proofs of claim and to vote thereon in
connection with any case under any chapter of the Bankruptcy Code and (2) the right to vote on any plan of reorganization. In the
event that any payment on account of any such subrogation rights shall be received by any Borrower in violation of the foregoing,
such payment shall be held in trust for the benefit of Lender, and any amount so collected must be turned over to Lender for, at
Lender s option, application to the Indebtedness; and 

(i)          At
any time without notice to the Waiving Borrower, and without affecting or prejudicing the right of Lender to proceed against the
Collateral described in any Loan Document executed by the Waiving Borrower and securing the Other Borrower Secured Obligation,
(1) the time for payment of the principal of or interest on, or the performance of, the Other Borrower Secured Obligation may be
extended or the Other Borrower Secured Obligation may be renewed in whole or in part; (2) the time for any other Borrower s
performance of or compliance with any covenant or agreement contained in the Loan Documents evidencing the Other Borrower Secured
Obligation, whether presently existing or hereinafter entered into, may be extended or such performance or compliance may be waived;
(3) the maturity of the Other Borrower Secured Obligation may be accelerated as provided in the related Note or any other related
Loan Document; (4) the related Note or any other related Loan Document may be modified or amended by Lender and the applicable
other Borrower in any respect, including an increase in the principal amount; and (5) any security for the Other Borrower Secured
Obligation may be modified, exchanged, surrendered or otherwise dealt with or additional security may be pledged or mortgaged for
the Other Borrower Secured Obligation. 

(j)          It
is agreed among each Borrower and Lender that all of the foregoing waivers are of the essence of the transaction contemplated by
this Master Agreement and the Loan Documents and that but for the provisions of this Article 3 (Personal Liability) and such waivers
Lender would decline to enter into this Master Agreement. 

Section 3.08            No
Impairment. 

Each Borrower agrees
that the provisions of this Article 3 (Personal Liability) are for the benefit of Lender and its successors and assigns, and nothing
herein contained shall impair, as between any other Borrower and Lender, the obligations of such other Borrower under the Loan
Documents. 

Section 3.09            Election
of Remedies. 

(a)          Lender,
in its discretion, may (1) bring suit against any one or more Borrowers, jointly and severally, without any requirement that Lender
first proceed against any other Borrower or any other Person; (2) compromise or settle with any one or more Borrowers, or any other
Person, for such consideration as Lender may deem proper; (3) release one or more Borrowers, or any other Person, from liability;
and (4) otherwise deal with any Borrower and any other Person, or any one or more of them, in any manner, or resort to any of the
Collateral at any time held by it for performance of the Indebtedness or any other source or means of obtaining payment of the
Indebtedness, and no such action shall impair the rights of Lender to collect from any Borrower any amount guaranteed by any Borrower
under this Article 3 (Personal Liability). 

(b)          If,
in the exercise of any of its rights and remedies, Lender shall forfeit any of its rights or remedies, including its rights to
enter a deficiency judgment against any Borrower or any other Person, whether because of any Applicable Law pertaining to  election
of remedies  or the like, each Borrower hereby consents to the fullest extent permitted by law to such action by Lender and
waives any claim based upon such action, even if such action by Lender shall result in a full or partial loss of any rights of
subrogation that each Borrower might otherwise have had but for such action by Lender. Any election of remedies that results in
the denial or impairment of the right of Lender to seek a deficiency judgment against any Borrower shall not impair any other Borrower s
obligation to pay the full amount of the Indebtedness. In the event Lender shall bid at any foreclosure or trustee s sale
or at any private sale permitted by law or any of the Loan Documents, Lender may bid all or less than the amount of the Indebtedness
and the amount of such bid need not be paid by Lender but shall be credited against the Indebtedness. The amount of the successful
bid at any such sale, whether Lender or any other party is the successful bidder, shall be conclusively deemed to be the fair market
value of the Collateral and the difference between such bid amount and the remaining balance of the Indebtedness shall be conclusively
deemed to be the amount of the Indebtedness guaranteed by each Borrower under this Article 3 (Personal Liability), notwithstanding
that any present or future law or court decision or ruling may have the effect of reducing the amount of any deficiency claim to
which Lender might otherwise be entitled but for such bidding at any such sale. 

Section 3.10            Subordination
of Other Obligations. 

(a)          Each
Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that all amounts payable from time to time to such Borrower by any other
Borrower pursuant to any agreement, whether secured or unsecured, whether of principal, interest, or otherwise, other than the
amounts referred to in this Article 3 (Personal Liability) (collectively, the   Subordinated Obligations  ), shall
be and such rights, claims, and indebtedness are, hereby deferred, postponed, and fully subordinated in time and right of payment
to the prior payment, performance, and satisfaction in full of the Indebtedness; provided, however, that payments may be received
by any Borrower in accordance with, and only in accordance with, the provisions of Section 3.10 (Subordination of Other Obligations)
hereof. 

(b)          Until
the Indebtedness has been finally paid in full or fully performed and all the Loan Documents have been terminated, each Borrower
irrevocably and unconditionally agrees it will not ask, demand, sue for, take, or receive, directly or indirectly, by set-off,
redemption, purchase, or in any other manner whatsoever, any payment with respect to, or any security or guaranty for, the whole
or any part of the Subordinated Obligations, and in issuing documents, instruments, or agreements of any kind evidencing the Subordinated
Obligations, each Borrower hereby agrees that it will not receive any payment of any kind on account of the Subordinated Obligations,
so long as any of the Indebtedness is outstanding or any of the terms and conditions of any of the Loan Documents are in effect;
provided, however, that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if no Potential Event of Default or Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing under any of the Loan Documents, then payments may be received by such Borrower in respect
of the Subordinated Obligations in accordance with the stated terms thereof. Except as aforesaid, each Borrower agrees not to accept
any payment or satisfaction of any kind of indebtedness of any other Borrower in respect of the Subordinated Obligations and hereby
assigns such rights or indebtedness to Fannie Mae, including the right to file proofs of claim and to vote thereon in connection
with any case under any chapter of the Bankruptcy Code, including the right to vote on any plan of reorganization. In the event
that any payment on account of Subordinated Obligations shall be received by any Borrower in violation of the foregoing, such payment
shall be held in trust for the benefit of Lender, and any amount so collected shall be turned over to Lender upon demand. 

Section 3.11            Insolvency
and Liability of Other Borrower. 

So long as any of the
Indebtedness is Outstanding, if a petition under any chapter of the Bankruptcy Code is filed by or against any Borrower (the   Subject
Borrower  ), each other Borrower (each, an   Other Borrower  ) agrees to file all claims against the
Subject Borrower in any bankruptcy or other proceeding in which the filing of claims is required by law in connection with indebtedness
owed by the Subject Borrower and to assign to Lender all rights thereunder up to the amount of such indebtedness. In all such cases,
the Person or Persons authorized to pay such claims shall pay to Lender the full amount thereof and Lender agrees to pay such Other
Borrower any amounts received in excess of the amount necessary to pay the Indebtedness. Each Other Borrower hereby assigns to
Lender all of such Other Borrower s rights to all such payments to which such Other Borrower would otherwise be entitled
but not to exceed the full amount of the Indebtedness. In the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing, any such payment shall
be received by any Other Borrower before the Indebtedness shall have been finally paid in full, such payment shall be held in trust
for the benefit of and shall be paid over to Lender upon demand. Furthermore, notwithstanding the foregoing, the liability of each
Borrower hereunder shall in no way be affected by:

Section 3.12            Preferences,
Fraudulent Conveyances, Etc.

declared fraudulent, set aside, or determined to be void or voidable as a preference, fraudulent conveyance, impermissible setoff,
or a diversion of trust funds under the Insolvency Laws or for any similar reason, including any judgment, order, or decree of
any court or administrative body having jurisdiction over any Borrower or any of its property, or upon or as a result of the appointment
of a receiver, intervenor, custodian, or conservator of, or trustee or similar officer for, any Borrower or any substantial part
of its property, or otherwise, or any statement or compromise of any claim effected by Lender with any Borrower or any other claimant
(a   Rescinded Payment  ), then each Other Borrower s liability to Lender shall continue in full force and
effect, or each Other Borrower s liability to Lender shall be reinstated and renewed, as the case may be, with the same effect
and to the same extent as if the Rescinded Payment had not been received by Lender, notwithstanding the cancellation or termination
of any of the Loan Documents, and regardless of whether Lender contested the order requiring the return of such payment. In addition,
each Other Borrower shall pay, or reimburse Lender for, all expenses (including all reasonable attorneys  fees, court costs,
and related disbursements) incurred by Lender in the defense of any claim that a payment received by Lender in respect of all or
any part of the Indebtedness must be refunded. The provisions of this Section 3.12 (Preferences, Fraudulent Conveyances, Etc.)

Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents or any Security Instruments granted by any Borrower are determined to exceed the reasonably
equivalent value received by such Borrower in exchange for such obligations or grant of such Security Instruments under any Fraudulent
Transfer Law (as hereinafter defined), then the liability of such Borrower shall be limited to a maximum aggregate amount equal
to the largest amount that would not render its obligations under this Master Agreement or all the other Loan Documents subject
to avoidance as a fraudulent transfer or conveyance under Section 548 of Title 11 of the United States Code or any applicable
provisions of comparable state law (collectively, the   Fraudulent Transfer Laws  ), in each case after giving
effect to all other liabilities of such Borrower, contingent or otherwise, that are relevant under the Fraudulent Transfer Laws
(specifically excluding, however, any liabilities of such Borrower in respect of Indebtedness to any other Borrower or any other
Person that is an affiliate of the other Borrower to the extent that such Indebtedness would be discharged in an amount equal to
the amount paid by such Borrower in respect of the Indebtedness) and after giving effect (as assets) to the value (as determined
under the applicable provisions of the Fraudulent Transfer Laws) of any rights to subrogation, reimbursement, indemnification,
or contribution of such Borrower pursuant to Applicable Law or pursuant to the terms of any agreement including the Contribution
Agreement.

In connection with
a Collateral Event, and at any time and from time to time that Lender has a reasonable basis to believe that an additional lien
may encumber any Mortgaged Property or in order to protect Lender s interest in the Collateral, Lender may obtain, at Borrower s
cost, an endorsement to the Title Policy for each Mortgaged Property, amending the effective date of such Title Policy to the date
of the title search performed in connection with the endorsement. 

Section 5.03            Administrative
Matters Regarding Advances. 

(a)          Determination
of Allocable Facility Amount and Valuations. 

(1)         Initial
Determinations. 

On the Initial
Effective Date, Lender shall determine (A) the Allocable Facility Amount and Valuation for each Initial Mortgaged Property, and
(B) the Aggregate Debt Service Coverage Ratio and the Aggregate Loan to Value Ratio. Changes in Allocable Facility Amount, Valuations,
the Aggregate Debt Service Coverage Ratio, and the Aggregate Loan to Value Ratio shall be made pursuant to Section 5.03(a)(2) (Subsequent
Monitoring Determinations). 

(2)         Subsequent
Monitoring Determinations. 

(A)         Once
each Calendar Quarter, within twenty (20) Business Days after Borrower has delivered to Lender the reports required in Section
8.02 (Books and Records; Financial Reporting   Covenants), Lender shall determine the Aggregate Debt Service Coverage Ratio,
and the Aggregate Loan to Value Ratio set forth in the Loan Documents. After the First Anniversary if, in Lender s reasonable
judgment, changed market or property conditions warrant, Lender shall redetermine Allocable Facility Amounts and Valuations. After
the First Anniversary, Lender shall also redetermine Allocable Facility Amounts and Valuations upon receipt of a Request for a
Collateral Event and immediately upon closing such Collateral Event to take account of such Collateral Event, and upon any other
event that invalidates the outstanding determination. 

(B)         Lender
shall promptly disclose its determinations to Borrower. Until redetermined, the outstanding Allocable Facility Amounts and Valuations
shall remain in effect. Upon receipt by Borrower of any such new determinations by Lender, Borrower shall promptly acknowledge
such receipt. 

Notwithstanding
anything in this Master Agreement to the contrary, no change in Allocable Facility Amounts, Valuations, the Aggregate Loan to Value
Ratio, or the Aggregate Debt Service Coverage Ratio shall (i) result in a Potential Event of Default or Event of Default, (ii)
require the prepayment of any Advance in whole or in part, or (iii) require the addition of Collateral to the Collateral Pool.

be displaced or permitted to terminate their Leases or to abate the payment of all or any portion of their rent; or 

(3)         such
Alteration will be completed in more than twelve (12) months from the date of commencement or in the last year of the Term

For purposes hereof,
Alterations shall not be deemed to include cosmetic, non-structural changes including new carpeting and painting, which do not
require a building permit and shall not require the consent of Lender. In addition, Borrower must obtain Lender s prior written
consent to construct Alterations with respect to any Mortgaged Property costing in excess of, with respect to any Mortgaged Property,
the number of units in such Mortgaged Property multiplied by $5,000, but in any event, costs in excess of $250,000, Borrower must

all such Licenses in good standing and full force and effect. Borrower will, or shall cause Property Operator, if applicable, to
provide Lender written notice within five (5) days of Borrower s or Property Operator s receipt of any notice
or order of a violation which could be reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Borrower, Property Operator, or
the Mortgaged Property, its operations, or its compliance with licensing and regulatory requirements. 

(2)         If
any License requirement is imposed upon the Mortgaged Property after the date the Mortgaged Property is added to the Collateral
Pool, Borrower shall obtain, or shall cause the Property Operator, if applicable, to obtain, all Licenses and shall maintain, or
shall cause the Property Operator, if applicable, to maintain, such Licenses in full force and effect. Borrower acknowledges and
agrees that all such Licenses are subject to the terms of this Master Agreement and the Loan Documents. 

(3)         Without
the prior written consent of Lender, Borrower shall not, and shall require Property Operator, if applicable, not to amend, modify,
transfer, or otherwise change the Licenses. 

(4)         Borrower
shall promptly inform Lender in writing or shall cause Property Operator to promptly inform Lender in writing, if such party has
actual knowledge of, and shall deliver to Lender copies of, (A) any written communications, complaints, orders, judgments, and
other documents relating to the commencement of any litigation, rulemaking, or disciplinary proceeding or the promulgation of any
proposed or final rule which would have, or may reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect on the Mortgaged Property,
or the Licenses, and (B) notice from any Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over Borrower or any Property Operator that
(i) Borrower or Property Operator is being placed under regulatory supervision, (ii) any License related to the conduct of Borrower s
or Property Operator s, if applicable, business or the Mortgaged Property is to be suspended or revoked, or (iii) Borrower
or Property Operator is to cease and desist any practice, procedure, or policy employed by Borrower or Property Operator in the
conduct of its business, and such cessation would have, or may reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect on the
Mortgaged Property, or the Licenses.

Provider Agreement. 

(1)         If
neither Borrower nor any Property Operator is a Medicaid Participant as of the Effective Date, Borrower shall notify Lender in
writing thirty (30) days prior to Borrower s or any Property Operator s (with respect to the Mortgaged Property)
submission of its request to enter into a Medicaid Provider Agreement, and will provide Lender with copies of all correspondence
and documentation received from the Governmental Authority or the Managed Care Organization concerning its submission.

(A)         Borrower
and such Property Operator shall execute the form of Medicaid reserve agreement and Depositary Agreement as Lender may require;

and Property Operator shall maintain their respective compliance with the provider standards, including all conditions for participation,
as required by the Managed Care Organization or the Governmental Authority, as applicable;

Care Organization, as applicable, under a Medicaid Provider Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Borrower or any Property
Operator is a Medicaid Participant with respect to the Mortgaged Property, and if by reason of Applicable Law or regulation more
than twenty percent (20%) of effective gross income is derived from funds paid to such Borrower or Property Operator by a
Governmental Authority or a Managed Care Organization, Borrower and Property Operator shall take in a diligent and expeditious
manner all reasonable steps necessary to comply with the preceding sentence to the extent permissible by Applicable Law or regulation;

five (5) days after Borrower s or any Property Operator s receipt thereof, Borrower shall give Lender written

(i)          either
Borrower or any Property Operator is in default under the terms of the Medicaid Provider Agreement; 

(ii)         the
applicable Governmental Authority or Managed Care Organization intends to amend, modify, or terminate the Medicaid Provider Agreement; 

(iii)        Borrower
or Property Operator has ceased to meet the provider standards required by the applicable Governmental Authority or Managed Care
Organization; 

(iv)        Borrower
or Property Operator has received notice from any Governmental Authority or Managed Care Organization that the rates for services
provided under the then-current Medicaid Provider Agreement will be adjusted; or 

(v)         either
Borrower or any Property Operator has been excluded from participation in any Governmental Health Care Program with respect to
the Mortgaged Property or any other property. 

(i)          Facility
Operating Agreement. 

(1)         The
provisions of this Section 6.02(i)(1) (Facility Operating Agreement) apply to all Facility Operating Agreements other than a Seniors
Housing Facility Lease and to all Property Operators other than a Property Operator under a Seniors Housing Facility Lease. Borrower
shall comply with and shall enforce the obligations of each Property Operator under each Facility Operating Agreement. Without
the prior written consent of Lender (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), Borrower shall not: 

(A)         modify,
amend, supplement, or restate any Facility Operating Agreement in a material way, including any modification that amends the fees
or duration of any Facility Operating Agreement; 

(B)         waive
a default under any Facility Operating Agreement to the extent such default could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on the Mortgaged Property or otherwise result in an Event of Default hereunder; 

(C)         waive
any of Borrower s rights or fail to diligently pursue Borrower s remedies under the Facility Operating Agreement to
the extent such waiver or failure could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Mortgaged Property or otherwise
result in an Event of Default hereunder; 

(D)         add
or release a property to or from any Facility Operating Agreement (other than in connection with a Release or Addition of a Mortgaged
Property to the Collateral Pool which shall be governed by this Master Agreement); or 

(E)         violate
the provisions of Section 11.02(c) (Facility Operating Agreement). 

(2)         Within
five (5) days of Borrower s receipt or delivery (or any Property Operator s receipt), Borrower shall provide Lender
written notice of any notice or information received by Borrower or any Property Operator that indicates either Borrower or any
Property Operator is (A) in default under the terms of any Facility Operating Agreement, (B) amending, modifying, or terminating
any Facility Operating Agreement, or (C) otherwise discontinuing its operation and management of the Mortgaged Property. 

(3)         After
Borrower receives notice (or otherwise has actual knowledge) of an Event of Default under the Loan Documents, it will not make
any payment of fees under or pursuant to the Facility Operating Agreement without Lender s prior written consent. 

(4)         Borrower
shall cause each Property Operator, where applicable, to comply with the terms, conditions, provisions, requirements, and affirmative
and negative covenants of this Master Agreement relating to the use and operation of the Mortgaged Property, including all terms,
conditions, provisions, requirements, and affirmative and negative covenants set forth in this Master Agreement applicable to the
organization, existence, and good standing of Property Operator necessary for the use and operation of the Mortgaged Property. 

(j)          Change
in Property Operator. 

Each Property Operator
and each Facility Operating Agreement must be approved in writing in advance by Lender. Borrower shall not remove or permit or
suffer the removal of any Property Operator without the prior written consent of Lender and unless and until Lender has approved
in writing a replacement Property Operator. Each Facility Operating Agreement or other similar agreement between Borrower and a
new Property Operator must be approved in writing in advance by Lender, and Borrower and the new Property Operator must execute
and deliver to Lender a SASA in form required by Lender, subject to the provisions of Section 6.03(a) (Property Management). Borrower
shall notify Lender in writing of any name change of an Affiliated Property Operator or any change in an Affiliated Property Operator s
place of incorporation or organization. Borrower agrees that Lender shall have the right to remove any Property Operator at any
time if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, subject to the provisions of the SASA. 

(k)          Contracts. 

Borrower may in the
future enter into Contracts for the provision of additional goods or services at or otherwise in connection with the operation,
use, or management of the Mortgaged Property. Borrower absolutely and unconditionally pledges, grants a security interest in, and
assigns to Lender all of Borrower s right, title, and interest in, to, and under the Contracts, including Borrower s
right, power, and authority to modify the terms of, extend, or terminate any such Contract. Until Lender gives notice to Borrower
of Lender s exercise of its rights under this Master Agreement during the continuance of an Event of Default, Borrower shall
have all right, power, and authority granted to Borrower under any Contract (except as otherwise limited by this subsection or
any other provision of this Master Agreement), including the right, power, and authority to modify the terms of any Contract or
extend or terminate any Contract. If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, and at the option of Lender, the permission
given to Borrower pursuant to the preceding sentence to exercise all right, power, and authority under Contracts shall terminate.
Upon Lender s delivery of notice to Borrower of an Event of Default, Lender shall immediately have all right, power, and
authority granted to Borrower under any Contract, including the right, power, and authority to modify the terms of, extend, or
terminate any such Contract. Borrower shall fully perform all of its obligations under the Contracts, and Borrower agrees not to
assign, sell, pledge, transfer, mortgage, or otherwise encumber its interests in any of the Contracts without the prior written
approval of Lender. Each Contract entered into by Borrower subsequent to the date hereof (other than cable television contracts),
the average annual consideration of which, directly or indirectly, is at least $50,000, shall provide: (A) that it shall be terminable
for cause, and (B) that it shall be terminable, at Lender s option, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default. 

(l)          All
Representations and Covenants Deemed Borrower Responsibility. 

(1)         Any
act, action, term, condition, provision, requirement, or covenant required to be performed, or prohibited from being performed,
by Borrower under the Loan Documents including with respect to (A) the use, management or operation of the Mortgaged Property,
including any licensing, repair, reporting, or insurance requirements, and (B) the organization, existence, good standing or other
entity-level requirements, shall be interpreted as requiring Borrower either to perform such act or action directly or to cause
Property Operator, a property manager or other appropriate agent to perform such act or action. Any right or privilege assigned
or delegated by Borrower or Property Operator to any other Person shall be construed as being accompanied by each relevant obligation
or restriction set forth in the Loan Documents or any Facility Operating Agreement, as applicable. 

(2)         In
each instance that Borrower makes, or in the future renews or is deemed to renew, a representation, warranty, or covenant in this
Master Agreement or the other Loan Documents regarding the condition, knowledge, acts, or omissions of Property Operator or any
Property Operator Business Information, or the condition of the Mortgaged Property, Borrower does and shall do so with full knowledge,
after due inquiry (including the due inquiry of and by Guarantor), of such information. Any reporting or compliance delay caused
by Property Operator or Guarantor shall not excuse Borrower s timely performance of the terms of this Master Agreement or
the other Loan Documents. Borrower acknowledges and agrees that Borrower s reliance upon incorrect or incomplete information
received from Property Operator or Guarantor and the reporting of the same to Lender, whether or not Borrower had actual knowledge
that such information was incorrect or incomplete and whether or not Borrower is otherwise in violation of the terms of this Master
Agreement, shall not be (and none of Borrower, Property Operator, Guarantor, nor Key Principal shall assert) a defense to Lender s
determination that an Event of Default has occurred or that Borrower (or Guarantor) has incurred personal liability as set forth
in Article 3 (Personal Liability) of this Master Agreement. 

Section 6.03             Administration
Matters Regarding the Property. 

(a)          Property
Management. 

From and after the
Effective Date, each Property Operator and each Facility Operating Agreement must be approved by Lender. In the event that the
Facility Operating Agreement expires or is terminated (without limiting any obligation of Borrower to obtain Lender s consent
to any termination or modification of the Facility Operating Agreement in accordance with the terms and provisions of the Loan
Documents), Borrower shall promptly enter into a replacement facility operating agreement consented to in writing by Lender with
a Property Operator that is approved in advance by Lender in writing. If Lender waives in writing the requirement that Borrower
enter into a written contract for the operation or management of a Mortgaged Property, and Borrower later elects to enter into
a written contract or change the operation or management of such Mortgaged Property, such new Property Operator and any Facility
Operating Agreement must be approved by Lender. As a condition to any approval of a Property Operator by Lender pursuant to this
Section 6.03(a) (Property Management), Borrower and such new Property Operator shall enter into a SASA. Any consent or approval
by Lender under this Section 6.03(a) (Property Management) shall not be unreasonably withheld. 

(b)          Subordination
of Fees by Property Operator. 

All fees due to an
Affiliated Property Operator in connection with the operation and management of the Mortgaged Property shall be subordinated in
right to the prior payment in full of the Indebtedness. All fees due to a non-Affiliated Property Operator in connection with the
operation and management of the Mortgaged Property shall be subordinated in right of payment to the prior payment in full of monthly
debt service and funding of escrows and reserves as required under the Loan Documents, and the payment of all operating expenses
and capital expenditures incurred in connection with the operation and management of the Mortgaged Property. 

(c)          Property
Condition Assessment. 

If, in connection with
any inspection of any Mortgaged Property, Lender determines that the condition of such Mortgaged Property has deteriorated (ordinary
wear and tear excepted) since the Effective Date that such Mortgaged Property was added to the Collateral Pool, Lender may obtain,
at Borrower s expense, a property condition assessment of each Mortgaged Property. Lender s right to obtain a property
condition assessment pursuant to this Section 6.03(c) (Property Condition Assessment) shall be in addition to any other rights
available to Lender under this Master Agreement in connection with any such deterioration. Any such inspection or property condition
assessment may result in Lender requiring Additional Lender Repairs or Additional Lender Replacements as further described in Section
13.02(a)(10)(B) (Additional Lender Replacements and Additional Lender Repairs). 

ARTICLE 7 
LEASES AND RENTS 

Section 7.01            Representations
and Warranties. 

The representations
and warranties made by Borrower to Lender in this Section 7.01 (Leases and Rents   Representations and Warranties) are made
as of each Effective Date and are true and correct except as disclosed on the Exceptions to Representations and Warranties Schedule. 

(a)          Prior
Assignment of Rents. 

Borrower has not executed
any: 

(1)         prior
assignment of Rents (other than an assignment of Rents securing prior indebtedness that has been paid off and discharged or will
be paid off and discharged with the proceeds of the Initial Advance or a Future Advance); or 

(2)         instrument
which would prevent Lender from exercising its rights under this Master Agreement, the Security Instrument, or the SASA. 

(b)          Prepaid
Rents. 

Borrower has not accepted,
and does not expect to receive prepayment of, any Rents for more than one (1) month for the Seniors Housing Facility Lease or more
than two (2) months under any other Lease prior to the due dates of such Rents (provided that up to twelve (12) months 
prepaid Rents for up to five percent (5%) of the units at any Mortgaged Property shall be permitted). 

(c)          Seniors
Housing Facility Lease. 

(1)         The
Seniors Housing Facility Lease is in full force and effect and there is neither a default thereunder nor any condition that, with
the passage of time or the giving of notice, or both, would constitute a default thereunder. No right or claim of rescission, offset,
abatement, diminution, defense, or counterclaim has been asserted with respect to the Seniors Housing Facility Lease, and there
is no existing condition that, with the passage of time or giving of notice, or both, would result in a right or claim of rescission,
offset, abatement, diminution, defense, or counterclaim under the terms and provisions of the Seniors Housing Facility Lease. Borrower
has performed and discharged all of the obligations on the part of Borrower to be performed and discharged pursuant to the terms
set forth in the Seniors Housing Facility Lease. 

(2)         The
Seniors Housing Facility Lease has not been modified, amended or supplemented by either party thereto. The Property Operator has
not been released, in whole or in part, from any of its obligations under the Seniors Housing Facility Lease. There has been no
prior sale, transfer, assignment, hypothecation, or pledge of the Seniors Housing Facility Lease (other than in connection with
the Loan Documents) that is outstanding. 

(3)         The
Seniors Housing Facility Lease has an original term ending on or after the date ninety (90) days after the Maturity Date.
Absent Lender s direction, the Property Operator cannot terminate the Seniors Housing Facility Lease for any reason prior
to the payment in full of the Indebtedness. 

(4)         There
is no free rent, partial rent or rebate of rent required to be given by Borrower to Property Operator under the Seniors Housing
Facility Lease. The Seniors Housing Facility Lease does not permit Property Operator to accept, and Property Operator has not accepted,
prepayment of Rents more than two (2) months in advance (and Borrower has not accepted prepayment of Rents more than one (1)
month in advance with respect to the Seniors Housing Facility Lease). Each payment due under the Seniors Housing Facility Lease
is sufficient to pay the Debt Service Amounts (including Monthly Debt Service Payments, Taxes, Impositions, and any Replacement
Reserve Deposits) in full on or prior to the due date thereof (without giving effect to any applicable grace periods) currently
and throughout the term of this Master Agreement. Payments due under the Seniors Housing Facility Lease are payable without notice
or demand, and without setoff, recoupment, abatement, or reduction. 

(5)         Property
Operator has no right or option pursuant to the Seniors Housing Facility Lease or otherwise to purchase all or any part of the
Mortgaged Property, the leased premises or the building of which the leased premises are a part. 

(6)         The
Seniors Housing Facility Lease contains customary and enforceable provisions that render the rights and remedies of Borrower adequate
for the enforcement and satisfaction of the Borrower s rights thereunder. 

(7)         Borrower
represents and warrants that it is the express intent of Borrower and Property Operator that the Seniors Housing Facility Lease
constitute a lease under applicable real property laws and laws governing bankruptcy, insolvency, and creditors  rights generally,
and that the sole interest of Property Operator in the Mortgaged Property is as a tenant under the Seniors Housing Facility Lease.
The Seniors Housing Facility Lease is not intended to be deemed a guaranty. 

Section 7.02            Covenants. 

(a)          Leases. 

Borrower shall: 

(1)         comply

(2)         during
the continuance of an Event of Default, surrender possession of the applicable Mortgaged Property, including all Leases and all
security deposits and prepaid Rents, immediately upon appointment of a receiver or Lender s entry upon and taking of possession
and control of such Mortgaged Property, as applicable; 

(3)         require
that all Residential Leases have initial lease terms of not less than six (6) months and not more than twenty-four (24)
months (however, if customary in the applicable market for properties comparable to the applicable Mortgaged Property or required
by Applicable Law, Residential Leases with terms of less than six (6) months (but in no case less than one (1) month)
may be permitted without Lender s prior written consent so long as Borrower promptly notifies Lender of such requirement);
and 

(4)         promptly

Housing Facility Lease pursuant to Section 6.02(j) (Change in Property Operator) and the SASA), and, upon Lender s written

or 

(B)         modify
the terms of, extend, or terminate any Material Commercial Lease (including any Material Commercial Lease in existence on the Effective
Date) without the prior written consent of Lender, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. 

(2)         With
respect to any non-Material Commercial Lease, Borrower shall not:

into any non-Material Commercial Lease that materially alters the use and type of operation of the premises subject to the Lease
in effect as of the Effective Date or reduces the number or size of residential units at a Mortgaged Property; or 

(B)         modify
the terms of any non-Material Commercial Lease (including any non-Material Commercial Lease in existence on the Effective Date)
in any way that materially alters the use and type of operation of the premises subject to such non-Material Commercial Lease in
effect as of the Effective Date, reduces the number or size of residential units at a Mortgaged Property, or results in such non-Material
Commercial   Lease being deemed a Material Commercial Lease. 

(3)         With
respect to any Material Commercial Lease or non-Material Commercial Lease, Borrower shall cause the applicable tenant to provide
within ten (10) Business Days after a request by Borrower, a certificate of estoppel,  or if not provided by tenant within
such ten (10) Business Day period, Borrower shall provide  such certificate of estoppel, certifying: 

(A)         that
such Material Commercial Lease or non-Material Commercial Lease is unmodified and in full force and effect (or if there have been
modifications, that such Material Commercial Lease or non-Material Commercial Lease is in full force and effect as modified and
stating the modifications); 

(B)         the
term of the Lease including any extensions thereto; 

(C)         the
dates to which the Rent and any other charges hereunder have been paid by tenant; 

(D)         the
amount of any security deposit delivered to Borrower as landlord; 

(E)         whether
or not Borrower is in default (or whether any event or condition exists which, with the passage of time, would constitute an event
of default) under such Lease; 

(F)         the
address to which notices to tenant should be sent; and 

(G)         any
other information as may be reasonably required by Lender. 

(c)          Payment

to Lender upon demand all Rents after an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing; 

(2)         cooperate
with Lender s efforts in connection with the assignment of Rents set forth in the Security Instrument and the SASA; and 

(3)         not
accept prepayment of Rent for more than one (1) month for the Seniors Housing Facility Lease or more than two (2) months
under any other Lease (whether a Residential Lease or a non-Residential Lease) (provided that up to twelve (12) months 
prepaid Rents for up to five percent (5%) of the units at any Mortgaged Property shall be permitted). 

(d)          Assignment
of Rents.

in the Security Instrument, the SASA, or in any other Loan Document; nor 

(2)         interfere
with Lender s collection of such Rents during the continuance of an Event of Default. 

(e)          Further
Assignments of Leases and Rents. 

Borrower shall execute
and deliver any further assignments of Leases and Rents as Lender may reasonably require, and shall require Property Operator to
execute and deliver any corresponding assignments in support thereof. 

(f)          Options
to Purchase by Tenants. 

No Lease (whether a
Residential Lease or a non-Residential Lease) shall contain an option to purchase, right of first refusal to purchase or right
of first offer to purchase, except as set forth in the SASA, except as required by Applicable Law. 

(g)          Special
Covenants Regarding Seniors Housing Facility Lease. 

(1)         Seniors
Housing Facility Lease. 

(A)          Borrower 
shall:  

(i)          at
all times fully perform, observe, and comply with all terms, covenants, and conditions of the Seniors Housing Facility Lease to
be performed, observed, or complied with by Borrower as lessor under the Seniors Housing Facility Lease and do all things necessary
to preserve and to keep unimpaired its rights thereunder; 

(ii)         deliver

by Lender; 

(v)         enforce
the terms, covenants and conditions contained in the Seniors Housing Facility Lease; and 

(vi)        provide
Property Operator with written notice of any changes to Monthly Debt Service Payments, Imposition Deposits, Monthly Replacement
Reserve Deposits, or any other amounts due under the Loan Documents. 

(B)         Borrower
shall not without Lender s consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld: 

(i)          modify,
amend, supplement, or restate the Seniors Housing Facility Lease in a material way, including any modification that amends the
fees or duration of the Seniors Housing Facility Lease; 

(ii)         waive
a default under the Seniors Housing Facility Lease to the extent such default could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on the Mortgaged Property or otherwise result in an Event of Default hereunder; 

(iii)        waive
any of Borrower s rights or fail to diligently pursue Borrower s remedies under the Seniors Housing Facility Lease
to the extent such waiver or failure could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Mortgaged Property or

the provisions of Section 11.02(b)(3) (Name Change or Entity Conversion). 

If, pursuant to the Seniors Housing
Facility Lease, Property Operator requests (1) the consent of Borrower (in its capacity as lessor under the Seniors Housing Facility
Lease) or Borrower s designee to any matter as to which, pursuant to the Seniors Housing Facility Lease, Borrower has discretion
as to whether or not to grant its consent, (2) a waiver of any covenant or obligation of Property Operator under the Seniors Housing
Facility Lease, or (3) a modification of the terms of the Seniors Housing Facility Lease (any of the foregoing, a   Seniors
Housing Facility Lease Request  ), subject to the provisions of (B)(i), (ii) and (iii) above, Borrower shall give Lender
prompt written notice of such Seniors Housing Facility Lease Request (together with such supporting information as may reasonably
be required to consider such Seniors Housing Facility Lease Request, and such other information as Lender may reasonably request).
Subject to the provisions of (B)(i), (ii) and (iii) above, Borrower shall not approve or consent to any Seniors Housing Facility
Lease Request unless Lender has approved and consented in writing to such Seniors Housing Facility Lease Request, which approval
and consent by Lender shall not be unreasonably withheld. 

(C)         The
Seniors Housing Facility Lease shall: 

(i)          pursuant
to the SASA, be subject and subordinate in all respects to the liens, terms, covenants and conditions of the Security Instrument
and the other Loan Documents, and to all renewals, modifications, consolidations, replacements and extensions thereof, and to all
advances which may hereafter be made pursuant to the Note, this Master Agreement, the Security Instrument and the other Loan Documents
(including all sums advanced for the purposes of (1) protecting or further securing the lien of the Security Instrument, curing
defaults by Borrower under the Loan Documents, or for any other purposes expressly permitted by this Master Agreement, the Security
Instrument or the other Loan Documents, or (2) constructing, renovating, repairing, furnishing, fixturing, or equipping the Mortgaged
Property); and 

(ii)         provide
that, or Lender shall have received an Operator Estoppel Certificate that provides that, in the event it shall be determined that
the Seniors Housing Facility Lease is not a lease under applicable real property laws or under laws governing bankruptcy, insolvency,
and creditors  rights generally, and that the interest of Property Operator in the Mortgaged Property is other than that
of tenant under the Seniors Housing Facility Lease, then the Property Operator s interest in the Mortgaged Property, however
characterized, shall continue to be subject and subordinate to the lien, terms, and conditions of the Security Instrument, and
Borrower s fee interest in the Mortgaged Property, on all the same terms and conditions as contained in the Seniors Housing
Facility Lease as of the date the Mortgaged Property was added to the Collateral Pool. 

(D)         The
Seniors Housing Facility Lease shall provide that Borrower shall continue to have complete access as long as the Mortgaged Property
is part of the Collateral Pool to the organizational (only with respect to Affiliated Property Operators), financial, and operational
information and documentation of Property Operator in every respect as it relates to this Master Agreement, the Mortgaged Property,
and the Seniors Housing Facility Lease (collectively, the   Property Operator Business Information  ). Borrower
shall continue to be fully informed regarding the Property Operator Business Information to the same extent as if Borrower were
the day-to-day operator of the Mortgaged Property and the business activities thereon.

Housing Facility Lease Estoppel. 

With respect
to any Seniors Housing Facility Lease, Borrower shall cause Property Operator to provide as of the date the Mortgaged Property
is added to the Collateral Pool (and, after the date the Mortgaged Property is added to the Collateral Pool, within ten (10)
Business Days after a request by Borrower), an Operator Estoppel Certificate,  or if not provided by Property Operator within
such ten (10) Business Day period, Borrower shall provide  a certificate of estoppel (and the Seniors Housing Facility
Lease shall so empower Borrower as Property Operator s attorney-in-fact) substantially in the form of the Operator Estoppel
Certificate. 

Section 7.03           Administration
Regarding Leases and Rents. 

(a)          Material
Commercial Lease Requirements. 

Each Material Commercial
Lease, including any renewal or extension of any Material Commercial Lease in existence as of the Effective Date, shall provide,
directly or pursuant to a subordination, non-disturbance and attornment agreement approved by Lender, that: 

(1)         the
tenant shall, upon written notice from Lender after the occurrence of an Event of Default, pay all Rents payable under such Lease
to Lender; 

(2)         such
Lease and all rights of the tenant thereunder are expressly subordinate to the lien of the Security Instrument; 

(3)         the
tenant shall attorn to Lender and any purchaser at a Foreclosure Event (such attornment to be self-executing and effective upon
acquisition of title to the Mortgaged Property by any purchaser at a Foreclosure Event or by Lender in any manner); 

(4)         the
tenant agrees to execute such further evidences of attornment as Lender or any purchaser at a Foreclosure Event may from time to
time request; and 

(5)         such
Lease shall not terminate as a result of a Foreclosure Event unless Lender or any other purchaser at such Foreclosure Event affirmatively
elects to terminate such Lease pursuant to the terms of the subordination, non-disturbance and attornment agreement if such tenant
is then in default under its Lease beyond any applicable cure period. 

(b)          Residential

order to produce or audit any statements, schedules, and reports of Borrower, Guarantor, Property Operator (in connection with

(2)         the

(1)         cause
all insurance policies (including any policies not otherwise required by Lender) which can be endorsed with standard non-contributing,

(2)         promptly
deliver to Lender a copy of all renewal and other notices received by Borrower with respect to the policies and all receipts for

that Lender s insurance requirements may change from time to time. All insurance policies and renewals of insurance policies
required by this Master Agreement shall be: 

(1)         in
the form and with the terms required by Lender;

BORROWER ACKNOWLEDGES
THAT ANY FAILURE OF BORROWER TO COMPLY WITH THE REQUIREMENTS SET FORTH IN  Section 
9.02(a) (Insurance Requirements) OR  Section  9.02(b)(3) (Delivery of Policies, Renewals,
Notices, and Proceeds) ABOVE SHALL PERMIT LENDER TO PURCHASE THE APPLICABLE INSURANCE AT BORROWER S COST. SUCH INSURANCE
MAY, BUT NEED NOT, PROTECT BORROWER S INTERESTS. THE COVERAGE THAT LENDER PURCHASES MAY NOT PAY ANY CLAIM THAT BORROWER MAKES
OR ANY CLAIM THAT IS MADE AGAINST BORROWER IN CONNECTION WITH ANY  Mortgaged Property. IF
LENDER PURCHASES INSURANCE FOR ANY Mortgaged Property AS PERMITTED HEREUNDER , BORROWER WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE COSTS
OF THAT INSURANCE, INCLUDING INTEREST AT THE DEFAULT RATE AND ANY OTHER CHARGES LENDER MAY IMPOSE IN CONNECTION WITH THE PLACEMENT
OF THE INSURANCE UNTIL THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE CANCELLATION OR THE EXPIRATION OF THE INSURANCE. THE COSTS OF THE INSURANCE SHALL
BE ADDED TO BORROWER S TOTAL OUTSTANDING BALANCE OR OBLIGATION AND SHALL CONSTITUTE ADDITIONAL INDEBTEDNESS. THE COSTS OF
THE INSURANCE MAY BE MORE THAN THE COST OF INSURANCE BORROWER MAY BE ABLE TO OBTAIN ON ITS OWN. BORROWER MAY LATER CANCEL ANY INSURANCE
PURCHASED BY LENDER, BUT ONLY AFTER PROVIDING EVIDENCE THAT BORROWER HAS OBTAINED INSURANCE AS REQUIRED BY THIS MASTER AGREEMENT
AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS. 

(b)          Application
of Proceeds on Event of Loss. 

(1)         Upon
an event of loss, Lender may, at Lender s option: 

(A)         hold
such proceeds to be applied to reimburse Borrower for the cost of Restoration (in accordance with Lender s then-current policies
relating to the restoration of casualty damage on similar multifamily residential properties); or 

(B)         apply
such proceeds to the payment of the Indebtedness, whether or not then due; provided, however, Lender shall not apply insurance
proceeds to the payment of the Indebtedness and shall require Restoration pursuant to Section 9.03(b)(1)(A) (Application of Proceeds
on Event of Loss) if all of the following conditions are met: 

(i)          no
Potential Event of Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing; 

(ii)         Lender
determines that the combination of insurance proceeds and amounts provided by Borrower will be sufficient funds to complete the
Restoration; 

(iii)        Lender
determines that after completion of the Restoration (1) the Net Operating Income from the applicable Mortgaged Property will be
sufficient to support the Debt Service Coverage Ratio set forth in the definition of Individual Property Coverage and LTV Tests
(on a pro forma basis), and (2) the Loan to Value Ratio of such Mortgaged Property will be no greater than the Loan to Value Ratio
immediately prior to the event of loss, but in no event greater than ninety percent (90%); 

(iv)        Lender
determines that the Restoration will be completed before the earlier of (1) one year before the latest Maturity Date   of
any Advance Outstanding, or (2) one year after the date of the loss or casualty; and 

(v)         Borrower
provides Lender, upon written request, evidence of the availability during and after the Restoration of the insurance required
to be maintained pursuant to this Master Agreement. 

After the completion of Restoration
in accordance with the above requirements, as determined by Lender, the balance, if any, of such proceeds shall be returned to
Borrower. 

(2)         Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if any loss is estimated to be in an amount equal to or less than $250,000, Lender shall not exercise its rights
and remedies as power-of-attorney herein and shall allow Borrower to make proof of loss, to adjust and compromise any claims under
policies of property damage insurance, to appear in and prosecute any action arising from such policies of property damage insurance,
and to collect and receive the proceeds of property damage insurance; provided that each of the following conditions shall be satisfied: 

(A)         Borrower
shall immediately notify Lender of the casualty giving rise to the claim; 

(B)         no
Potential Event of Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing; 

(C)         the
Restoration will be completed before the earlier of (i) one year before the Termination Date, or (ii) one year after the date of
the loss or casualty; 

(D)         Lender
determines that the combination of insurance proceeds and amounts provided by Borrower will be sufficient funds to complete the
Restoration; 

(E)         all
proceeds of property damage insurance shall be issued in the form of joint checks to Borrower and Lender; 

(F)         all
proceeds of property damage insurance shall be applied to the Restoration; 

(G)         Borrower
shall deliver to Lender evidence satisfactory to Lender of completion of the Restoration and obtainment of all lien releases; 

(H)         Borrower
shall have complied to Lender s satisfaction with the foregoing requirements on any prior claims subject to this provision,
if any; and 

(I)         Lender
shall have the right to inspect the applicable Mortgaged Property (subject to the rights of tenants under the Leases, other than
the Seniors Housing Facility Lease). 

(3)         If
Lender elects to apply insurance proceeds to the Indebtedness in accordance with the terms of this Master Agreement, Borrower shall
not be obligated to restore or repair the applicable Mortgaged Property. Rather, Borrower shall restrict access to the damaged
portion of such Mortgaged Property and, at its expense and regardless of whether such costs are covered by insurance, clean up
any debris resulting from the casualty event, and, if required or otherwise permitted by Lender, demolish or raze any remaining
part of the damaged Mortgaged Property to the extent necessary to keep and maintain the Mortgaged Property in a safe, habitable
and marketable condition. Nothing in this Section 9.03(b) (Application of Proceeds on Event of Loss) shall affect any of Lender s

or under any Loan Document, including any failure to timely pay Monthly Debt Service Payments or maintain the insurance coverage(s)
required by this Master Agreement.

any insurance proceeds to the Indebtedness shall not extend or postpone the Maturity Date, or the due date or the full payment
of any Monthly Debt Service Payment, Monthly Replacement Reserve Deposit, or any other installments referred to in this Master
Agreement or in any other Loan Document. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Lender applies insurance proceeds to the Indebtedness
in connection with a casualty of less than an entire Mortgaged Property, then Lender shall permit an adjustment to the Monthly
Debt Service Payments that become due and owing thereafter, based on the Underwriting and Servicing Requirements.

applicable to such Mortgaged Property and in and to the proceeds resulting from any damage to such Mortgaged Property prior to

Section 12.01         Representations
and Warranties. 

The representations and
warranties made by Borrower to Lender in this Section 12.01 (Impositions   Representations and Warranties) are made as of
each Effective Date and are true and correct except as disclosed on the Exceptions to Representations and Warranties Schedule. 

(a)            Payment
of Taxes, Assessments, and Other Charges. 

Borrower has: 

(1)         paid
(or with the approval of Lender, established an escrow fund sufficient to pay when due and payable) all amounts and charges relating
to the Mortgaged Properties that have become due and payable before any fine, penalty interest, lien, or costs may be added thereto,
including Impositions, leasehold payments, and ground rents; 

(2)         paid
all Taxes for the Mortgaged Properties that have become due before any fine, penalty interest, lien, or costs may be added thereto
pursuant to any notice of assessment received by Borrower and any and all taxes that have become due against Borrower before any
fine, penalty interest, lien, or costs may be added thereto; 

(3)         no
knowledge of any basis for any additional assessments; 

(4)           no
knowledge of any presently pending special assessments against all or any part of the Mortgaged Properties, or any presently pending
special assessments against Borrower; and 

(5)           not
received any written notice of any contemplated special assessment against any Mortgaged Property, or any contemplated special
assessment against Borrower. 

Section 12.02         Covenants. 

(a)          Imposition
Deposits, Taxes, and Other Charges. 

Borrower shall: 

(1)         deposit
the Imposition Deposits with Lender on each Payment Date (or on another day designated in writing by Lender) in amount sufficient,
in Lender s reasonable discretion, to enable Lender to pay each Imposition before the last date upon which such payment may
be made without any penalty or interest charge being added, plus an amount equal to no more than one-sixth (1/6) (or the amount
permitted by Applicable Law) of the Impositions for the trailing twelve (12) months (calculated based on the aggregate annual
Imposition costs divided by twelve (12) and multiplied by two (2)); 

(2)         deposit
with Lender, within ten (10) Business Days after written notice from Lender (subject to Applicable Law), such additional amounts
estimated by Lender to be reasonably necessary to cure any deficiency in the amount of the Imposition Deposits held for payment
of a specific Imposition; 

(3)         except
as set forth in Section 12.03(c) (Payment of Impositions; Sufficiency of Imposition Deposits) below, pay all Impositions, leasehold
payments, ground rents, and Taxes when due and before any fine, penalty interest, lien, or costs may be added thereto; 

(4)         promptly
deliver to Lender a copy of all notices of, and invoices for, Impositions, and, if Borrower pays any Imposition directly, Borrower
shall promptly furnish to Lender receipts evidencing such payments; and 

(5)         promptly
deliver to Lender a copy of all notices of any special assessments and contemplated special assessments against any Mortgaged Property
or Borrower. 

Section 12.03         Administration
Matters Regarding Impositions. 

(a)          Maintenance
of Records by Lender. 

Lender shall maintain records
of the monthly and aggregate Imposition Deposits held by Lender for the purpose of paying Taxes, insurance premiums, and each other
obligation of Borrower for which Imposition Deposits are required. 

(b)          Imposition
Accounts. 

All Imposition Deposits
shall be held in an institution (which may be Lender, if Lender is such an institution) whose deposits or accounts are insured
or guaranteed by a federal agency and which accounts meet the standards for custodial accounts as required by Lender from time
to time. Lender shall not be obligated to open additional accounts, or deposit Imposition Deposits in additional institutions,
when the amount of the Imposition Deposits exceeds the maximum amount of the federal deposit insurance or guaranty. No interest,
earnings, or profits on the Imposition Deposits shall be paid to Borrower unless Applicable Law so requires. Imposition Deposits
shall not be trust funds, nor shall they operate to reduce the Indebtedness, unless applied by Lender for that purpose in accordance
with this Master Agreement. For the purposes of  9-104(a)(3) of the UCC, Lender is the owner of the Imposition Deposits and
shall be deemed a  customer  with sole control of the account holding the Imposition Deposits. 

(c)          Payment
of Impositions; Sufficiency of Imposition Deposits. 

Lender may pay an Imposition
according to any bill, statement, or estimate from the appropriate public office or insurance company without inquiring into the
accuracy of the bill, statement, or estimate or into the validity of the Imposition. Imposition Deposits shall be required to be
used by Lender timely to pay Taxes, insurance premiums and any other individual   Imposition only if: 

(1)         no
Event of Default exists; 

(2)         Borrower
has timely delivered to Lender all applicable bills or premium notices that it has received; and 

(3)         sufficient
Imposition Deposits are held by Lender for such Imposition at the time such Imposition becomes due and payable. 

Lender shall have no liability
to Borrower or any other Person for failing to pay any Imposition if any of the conditions are not satisfied. If at any time the
amount of the Imposition Deposits held for payment of a specific Imposition exceeds the amount reasonably deemed necessary by Lender
to be held in connection with such Imposition, the excess may be credited against future installments of Imposition Deposits for
such Imposition. 

(d)          Imposition
Deposits Upon Event of Default. 

If an Event of Default
has occurred and is continuing, Lender may apply any Imposition Deposits, in such amount and in such order as Lender determines,
to pay any Impositions or as a credit against the Indebtedness. 

(e)          Contesting
Impositions. 

Other than insurance premiums,
Borrower may contest, at its expense, by appropriate legal proceedings, the amount or validity of any Imposition if: 

(1)         Borrower
notifies Lender of the commencement or expected commencement of such proceedings; 

(2)         Lender
determines that the applicable Mortgaged Property is not in danger of being sold or forfeited; 

(3)         Borrower
deposits with Lender (or the applicable Governmental Authority if required by Applicable Law) reserves sufficient to pay the contested
Imposition, if required by Lender (or the applicable Governmental Authority); 

(4)         Borrower
furnishes whatever additional security is required in the proceedings or is reasonably requested in writing by Lender; and 

(5)         Borrower
commences, and at all times thereafter diligently prosecutes, such contest in good faith until a final determination is made by
the applicable Governmental Authority. 

(f)          Release
to Borrower. 

Upon payment in full of
all sums secured by the Security Instrument and this Master Agreement and release by Lender of the lien of the Security Instrument,
Lender shall disburse to Borrower the balance of any Imposition Deposits then on deposit with Lender. 

ARTICLE 13

(c)           Payment
for Replacements and Repairs. 

Borrower shall: 

(1)         pay
all invoices for the Replacements and Repairs, regardless of whether funds on deposit in the Replacement Reserve Account or the

Account or the Repairs Escrow Account, as applicable (unless Lender has agreed to issue joint checks in connection with a particular
Replacement or Repair); 

(2)         pay
all applicable fees and charges of any Governmental Authority on account of the Replacements and Repairs, as applicable; and 

(3)         provide

such other period or by such other date set forth in the Required Repair Schedule and any Borrower Requested Repairs and Additional
Lender Repairs (by the date specified by Lender for any such Borrower Requested Repairs or Additional Lender Repairs)), subject
to Force Majeure. 

(d)           Assignment
of Contracts for Replacements and Repairs. 

Borrower shall collaterally
assign to Lender as additional security any contract or subcontract for Replacements or Repairs, upon Lender s written request,
on a form of assignment approved by Lender. 

(e)           Indemnification. 

If Lender elects to exercise
its rights under Section 14.03 (Additional Lender Rights; Forbearance) due to Borrower s failure to timely commence or complete
any Replacements or Repairs, Borrower shall indemnify and hold Lender harmless for, from and against any and all actions, suits,
claims, demands, liabilities, losses, damages, obligations, and costs or expenses, including litigation costs and reasonable attorneys 
fees, arising from or in any way connected with the performance by Lender of the Replacements or Repairs or investment of the Reserve/Escrow
Account Funds; provided that Borrower shall have no indemnity obligation if such actions, suits, claims, demands, liabilities,
losses, damages, obligations, and costs or expenses, including litigation costs and reasonable attorneys  fees, arise as
a result of the willful misconduct or gross negligence of Lender, Lender s agents, employees, or representatives as determined
by a court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to a final non-appealable court order. 

(f)           Amendments
to Loan Documents. 

Subject to Section 5.02
(Advances   Covenants) Borrower shall execute and deliver to Lender, upon written request, an amendment to this Master Agreement,
the Security Instrument, any other Loan Document deemed necessary or desirable to perfect Lender s lien upon any portion
of each Mortgaged Property for which Reserve/Escrow Account Funds were expended. 

(g)           Administrative
Fees and Expenses. 

Borrower shall pay to Lender: 

(1)         by
the date specified in the applicable invoice, the Repairs Escrow Account Administrative Fee and the Replacement Reserve Account
Administration Fee for Lender s services in administering the Repairs Escrow Account and Replacement Reserve Account and
investing the funds on deposit in the Repairs Escrow Account and the Replacement Reserve Account, respectively; 

(2)         upon
demand, a reasonable inspection fee, not exceeding the Maximum Inspection Fee, for each inspection of a Mortgaged Property by Lender
in connection with a Repair or Replacement, plus all other reasonable costs and out-of-pocket expenses relating to such inspections;
and 

(3)         upon
demand, all reasonable fees charged by any engineer, architect, inspector or other person inspecting a Mortgaged Property on behalf
of Lender for each inspection of such Mortgaged Property in connection with a Repair or Replacement, plus all other reasonable
costs and out-of-pocket expenses relating to such inspections. 

Section 13.02         Administration
Matters Regarding Reserves. 

(a)          Accounts,
Deposits, and Disbursements. 

(2)           Custodial
Accounts. 

(A)         The
Replacement Reserve Account shall be an interest-bearing account that meets the standards for custodial accounts as required by
Lender from time to time. Lender shall not be responsible for any losses resulting from the investment of the Replacement Reserve
Deposits or for obtaining any specific level or percentage of earnings on such investment. All interest, if any, earned on the
Replacement Reserve Deposits shall be added to and become part of the Replacement Reserve Account;  provided ,  however ,
if Applicable Law requires, and so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing under any of the Loan Documents,
Lender shall pay to Borrower the interest earned on the Replacement Reserve Account not less frequently than the Replacement Reserve
Account Interest Disbursement Frequency. In no event shall Lender be obligated to disburse funds from the Reserve/Escrow Account
if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing. 

(B)         Lender
shall not be obligated to deposit the Repairs Escrow Deposits   into an interest-bearing account. 

(3)           Disbursements
by Lender Only. 

Only Lender or
a designated representative of Lender may make disbursements from the Replacement Reserve Account and the Repairs Escrow Account.
Except as provided in Section 13.02(a)(8) (Conditions to Disbursement), disbursements shall only be made upon Borrower request
and after satisfaction of all conditions for disbursement. 

(4)           Adjustment
to Deposits. 

(A)         Mortgaged
Properties in Collateral Pool over Ten (10) Years. 

If any Mortgaged
Property is part of the Collateral Pool for ten (10) years or more, a property condition assessment shall be ordered by Lender
for such Mortgaged Property at the expense of Borrower (which expense may be paid out of the Replacement Reserve Account if excess
funds are available). The property condition assessment shall be performed no earlier than the sixth (6th) month and no later
than the ninth (9th) month of the tenth (10th) year after such Mortgaged Property was added to the Collateral Pool (and
of the twentieth (20th) year if applicable). After review of the property condition assessment, the amount of the Monthly
Replacement Reserve Deposit may be adjusted by Lender for the remaining Facility Year by written notice to Borrower so that the
Monthly Replacement Reserve Deposits are sufficient to fund the Replacements as and when required and/or the amount to be held
in the Repairs Escrow Account may be adjusted by Lender so that the Repairs Escrow Deposit is sufficient to fund the Repairs as
and when required. 

(B)         Transfers. 

In connection
with any Transfer of any Mortgaged Property, in connection with an assumption, any Transfer of the Facility Operating Agreement,
or any Transfer of Ownership Interest(s) in a Borrower Entity or Affiliated Property Operator that requires Lender s consent,
Lender may review the amounts on deposit, if any, in the Replacement Reserve Account or the Repairs Escrow Account, the amount
of the Monthly Replacement Reserve Deposit for the applicable Mortgaged Property(ies) and the likely repairs and replacements required
by such Mortgaged Property(ies), and the related contingencies which may arise during the remaining Term of this Master Agreement.
Based upon that review, Lender may require an additional deposit to the Replacement Reserve Account or the Repairs Escrow Account,
or an increase in the amount of the Monthly Replacement Reserve Deposit as a condition to Lender s consent to such Transfer. 

(5)           Insufficient
Funds. 

Lender may, upon
thirty (30) days  prior written notice to Borrower, require an additional deposit(s) to the Replacement Reserve Account
or Repairs Escrow Account, or an increase in the amount of the Monthly Replacement Reserve Deposit, if Lender reasonably determines
that the amounts on deposit in either the Replacement Reserve Account or the Repairs Escrow Account are not sufficient to cover
the costs for Required Repairs or Required Replacements or, pursuant to the terms of Section 13.02(a)(10) (Replacements and Repairs
Other than Required Replacements or Required Repairs), not sufficient to cover the costs for Borrower Requested Repairs, Additional
Lender Repairs, Borrower Requested Replacements, or Additional Lender Replacements. Borrower s agreement to complete the
Replacements or Repairs as required by this Master Agreement shall not be affected by the insufficiency of any balance in the Replacement
Reserve Account or the Repairs Escrow Account, as applicable. 

(6)           Disbursements
for Replacements and Repairs. 

(A)         Disbursement
requests may only be made after completion of the applicable Replacements unless the applicable contract requires progress payments
and only to reimburse the applicable Borrower for the actual approved costs of the Replacements. Lender shall not disburse from
the Replacement Reserve Account the costs of routine maintenance to any Mortgaged Property or for costs which are to be reimbursed
from the Repairs Escrow Account or any similar account. Disbursement from the Replacement Reserve Account shall not be made more
frequently than the Maximum Replacement Reserve Disbursement Interval for such Mortgaged Property. Other than in connection with
a final request for disbursement, disbursements from the Replacement Reserve Account shall not be less than the Minimum Replacement
Reserve Disbursement Amount for such Mortgaged Property. 

(B)         Disbursement
requests may only be made after completion of the applicable Repairs and only to reimburse the applicable Borrower for the actual
cost of the Repairs, up to the Maximum Repair Cost for such Mortgaged Property. Lender shall not disburse any amounts which would
cause the funds remaining in the Repairs Escrow Account after any disbursement (other than with respect to the final disbursement)
to be less than the Maximum Repair Cost of the then-current estimated cost of completing all remaining Repairs. Lender shall not
disburse from the Repairs Escrow Account the costs of routine maintenance to any Mortgaged Property or for costs which are to be
reimbursed from the Replacement Reserve Account or any similar account. Disbursement from the Repairs Escrow Account shall not
be made more frequently than the Maximum Repair Disbursement Interval. Other than in connection with a final request for disbursement,
disbursements from the Repairs Escrow Account shall not be less than the Minimum Repairs Disbursement Amount for such Mortgaged
Property. 

(7)           Disbursement
Requests. 

Each request
by Borrower for disbursement from the Replacement Reserve Account or the Repairs Escrow Account must be in writing, must specify
the Replacement or Repair for which reimbursement is requested (provided that for any Borrower Requested Replacements, Borrower
Requested Repairs, Additional Lender Replacements and Additional Lender Repairs, Lender shall have approved the use of the Reserve/Escrow
Account Funds for such replacements or repairs pursuant to the terms of Section 13.02(a)(10) (Replacements and Repairs Other than
Required Replacements or Required Repairs)), and must: 

(A)         if
applicable, specify the quantity and price of the items or materials purchased, grouped by type or category; 

(B)         if
applicable, specify the cost of all contracted labor or other services involved in the Replacement or Repair for which such request
for disbursement is made;

Lender may, upon
Borrower s written request, issue joint checks, payable to Borrower and the applicable supplier, materialman, mechanic, contractor,

(iv)        all
conditions for disbursement from the Replacement Reserve Account or Repairs Escrow Account, as applicable, have been satisfied. 

Nothing in this
Master Agreement shall limit Lender s right to require an additional deposit to the Replacement Reserve Account or an increase
to the Monthly Replacement Reserve Deposit in connection with any such Borrower Requested Replacements, or an additional deposit
to the Repairs Escrow Account for any such Borrower Requested Repairs. 

(B)           Additional
Lender Replacements and Additional Lender Repairs.

to time, upon written notice to Borrower, that Borrower make Additional Lender Replacements or Additional Lender Repairs. Lender

In the event
any Replacement or Repair exceeds the approved cost set forth on the Required Replacement Schedule for Replacements, or the Maximum
Repair Cost for Repairs, Borrower may submit a disbursement request to reimburse Borrower for such excess cost. The disbursement

of Contracts; Assignment of Claims. 

Lender retains the right
to approve all contracts or work orders with materialmen, mechanics, suppliers, subcontractors, contractors, or other parties providing
labor or materials in connection with the Replacements or Repairs. Notwithstanding Borrower s assignment in the Security
Instrument (or Property Operator s assignment pursuant to the SASA) of its rights and claims against all Persons supplying
labor or materials in connection with the Replacement or Repairs, Lender will not pursue any such right or claim unless an Event
of Default has occurred and is continuing or as otherwise provided in Section 14.03(c) (Appointment of Lender as Attorney-In-Fact). 

(c)           Delays
and Workmanship. 

If any work for any Replacement
or Repair has not timely commenced, has not been timely performed in a workmanlike manner, or has not been timely completed in
a workmanlike manner, in each case subject to Force Majeure, Lender may, without notice to Borrower: 

(1)         withhold
disbursements from the Replacement Reserve Account or Repairs Escrow Account for such unsatisfactory Replacement or Repair, as
applicable; 

(2)         proceed
under existing contracts or contract with third parties to make or complete such Replacement or Repair; 

(3)         apply
the funds in the Replacement Reserve Account or Repairs Escrow Account toward the labor and materials necessary to make or complete
such Replacement or Repair, as applicable; or

any and all other remedies available to Lender under this Master Agreement or any other Loan Document, including any remedies otherwise
available upon an Event of Default pursuant to the terms of Section 14.02 (Remedies). 

To facilitate
Lender s completion or making of such Replacements or Repairs, Lender shall have the right to enter onto each Mortgaged Property
and perform any and all work and labor necessary to make or complete the Replacements or Repairs and employ watchmen to protect
such Mortgaged Property from damage. All funds so expended by Lender in excess of the funds available in the Replacement Reserve
Account or Repair Reserve Account, as applicable, shall be deemed to have been advanced to Borrower, shall be part of the Indebtedness
and shall be secured by the Security Instrument and this Master Agreement. 

(d)           Appointment
of Lender as Attorney-In-Fact. 

Borrower hereby
authorizes and appoints Lender as attorney-in-fact pursuant to Section 14.03(c) (Appointment of Lender as Attorney-In-Fact). 

(e)           No
Lender Obligation. 

Nothing in this
Master Agreement shall: 

(1)         make
Lender responsible for making or completing the Replacements or Repairs; 

(2)           require
Lender to expend funds, whether from the Replacement Reserve Account, the Repairs Escrow Account or otherwise, to make or complete
any Replacement or Repair; 

(3)           obligate
Lender to proceed with the Replacements or Repairs; or 

(4)           obligate
Lender to demand from Borrower additional sums to make or complete any Replacement or Repair. 

(f)           No
Lender Warranty. 

Lender s
approval of any plans for any Replacement or Repair, release of funds from the Replacement Reserve Account or Repairs Escrow Account,
inspection of any Mortgaged Property by Lender or its agents, representatives, or designees, or other acknowledgment of completion
of any Replacement or Repair in a manner satisfactory to Lender shall not be deemed an acknowledgment or warranty to any Person
that the Replacement or Repair has been completed in accordance with applicable building, zoning or other codes, ordinances, statutes,
laws, regulations or requirements of any Governmental Authority, such responsibility being at all times exclusively that of Borrower.

The following shall constitute

of such failure to perform or default in performance, provided, however, such period may be extended for up to an additional
sixty (60) days if Borrower, in the discretion of Lender, is diligently pursuing a cure of such; provided, further, however,
no such written notice, grace period or extension shall apply if, in Lender s discretion, immediate exercise by Lender of
a right or remedy under this Master Agreement or any Loan Document is required to avoid harm to Lender or impairment of the Indebtedness,
the Mortgaged Property or any other security given to secure the Indebtedness: 

(1)           any
failure by Borrower to perform any of its obligations under this Master Agreement or any Loan Document (other than those specified
in Section 14.01(a) (Automatic Events of Default) or Section 14.01(b) (Events of Default Subject to a Specified Cure Period)) as
and when required; and 

(2)           any
loss by Borrower or any Property Operator of any License (other than the License needed to maintain the Operating Licensing Designation
for any Mortgaged Property, which is covered by Section 14.01(a)(17) (Automatic Events of Default)). 

Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, if an Event of Default shall occur hereunder or under any other Loan Document
because a representation, warranty, affirmative covenant, negative covenant, or other provision hereunder or thereunder shall be
breached or violated that in Lender s sole and exclusive judgment is with respect to a particular Mortgaged Property (other
than any misappropriation of funds collected in respect thereof) (each, a   Property-Specific Event of Default  ),
such Event of Default shall be deemed cured if Borrower shall satisfy all of the conditions set forth in Section 2.10(b) (Right
to Obtain Releases of Mortgaged Property) of this Master Agreement relating to the Release of such Mortgaged Property from the
Collateral Pool within thirty (30) days of Borrower acquiring knowledge of such Event of Default (the   Release Cure
Period  ). During the Release Cure Period, Lender agrees that it shall not have the right to exercise the remedy set forth
in Section 14.02 (Remedies) of this Master Agreement; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not impair Lender s right
to exercise the remedies available to Lender under any of the other Loan Documents (other than foreclosure rights with respect
to the applicable Mortgaged Property subject to the Release) or at law or in equity or under Section 14.03(b) (No Waiver of Rights
or Remedies) during such Release Cure Period. If Lender shall elect to exercise any such remedies during such period, and if Borrower
releases such Mortgaged Property pursuant to the provisions of the Mortgaged Property Release Schedule as described in the preceding
sentence and at the time of such release no other Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, Lender shall cease exercising
such remedies with respect to the applicable Property-Specific Event of Default and discontinue any proceedings it may have initiated
in connection therewith, and the parties shall be restored to their former positions and rights hereunder; provided, however, that
if Borrower shall fail to satisfy all of the conditions set forth in the Mortgaged Property Release Schedule relating to the release
of such Mortgaged Property from the Collateral Pool during the Release Cure Period, Lender may thereafter exercise any and all
remedies available to Lender under Article 14 (Defaults/Remedies) of this Master Agreement, including, without limitation, the
remedies set forth in Section 14.02 (Remedies). 

Section 14.02         Remedies. 

(a)            Acceleration;
Foreclosure. 

(1)         If
an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the entire unpaid principal balance of the Advances Outstanding, any Accrued
Interest, interest accruing at the Default Rate, the Prepayment Premium (if applicable), and all other Indebtedness, at the option
of Lender, shall immediately become due and payable, without any prior written notice to Borrower, unless Applicable Law requires
otherwise (and in such case, after any required written notice has been given). Lender may exercise this option to accelerate regardless
of any prior forbearance. In addition, Lender shall have all rights and remedies afforded to Lender hereunder and under the other
Loan Documents, including, foreclosure on and/or the power of sale of any or all of the Mortgaged Properties, as provided in the
Security Instrument, and any rights and remedies available to Lender at law or in equity (subject to Borrower s statutory
rights of reinstatement, if any). Any proceeds of a Foreclosure Event may be held and applied by Lender as additional collateral
for the Indebtedness pursuant to this Master Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the occurrence of any Bankruptcy Event of
Borrower shall automatically accelerate the Indebtedness, which Indebtedness shall be immediately due and payable without written
notice or further action by Lender. 

(2)         Lender
may Accelerate any Note without the obligation, but the right to accelerate any other Note (if more than one). In the exercise
of its rights and remedies under the Loan Documents, Lender may, except as provided in this Master Agreement, exercise and perfect
any and all of its rights in and under the Loan Documents with regard to any Mortgaged Property without the obligation (but with
the right) to exercise and perfect its rights and remedies with respect to any other Mortgaged Property. Any such exercise shall
be without regard to the Allocable Facility Amount assigned to such Mortgaged Property. Lender may recover an amount equal to the
full amount Outstanding in respect of any of the Notes in connection with such exercise. Any such amount shall be applied to the
Obligations as determined by Lender. 

(b)            Loss
of Right to Disbursements from Collateral Accounts. 

If an Event of Default
has occurred and is continuing, Borrower shall immediately lose all of its rights to receive disbursements from the Reserve/Escrow
Accounts and any Collateral Accounts. During the continuance of any such Event of Default, Lender may use the Reserve/Escrow Account
Funds and any Collateral Account Funds (or any portion thereof) for any purpose, including: 

(1)         repayment
of the Indebtedness, including principal prepayments and the Prepayment Premium applicable to such full or partial prepayment,
as applicable (however, such application of funds shall not cure or be deemed to cure any Event of Default); 

(2)         reimbursement
of Lender for all losses and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) suffered or incurred by Lender as a result of such Event
of Default; 

(3)         completion
of the Replacement or Repair or for any other replacement or repair to a Mortgaged Property; and 

(4)         payment
of any amount expended in exercising (and the exercise of) all rights and remedies available to Lender at law or in equity or under
this Master Agreement or under any of the other Loan Documents. 

Nothing in this Master
Agreement shall obligate Lender to apply all or any portion of the Reserve/Escrow Account Funds or Collateral Account Funds on
account of any Event of Default by Borrower or to repayment of the Indebtedness or in any specific order of priority. 

(c)           Remedies
Cumulative. 

Each right and remedy provided
in this Master Agreement is distinct from all other rights or remedies under this Master Agreement or any other Loan Document or
afforded by Applicable Law, and each shall be cumulative and may be exercised concurrently, independently or successively, in any
order. Lender shall not be required to demonstrate any actual impairment of its security or any increased risk of additional default
by Borrower in order to exercise any of its remedies with respect to an Event of Default. 

(d)           Operations
upon Event of Default; Lockbox Account. 

(1)           If
an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing: 

(A)         Borrower
shall or shall cause each Property Operator to, at the option of Lender, continue to provide all necessary services required under
each Facility Operating Agreement or applicable licensing or regulatory requirements to operate and manage the Mortgaged Property
as a Seniors Housing Facility and shall fully cooperate with Lender and any receiver as may be appointed by a court, in performing
these services and agrees to arrange for an orderly transition to a replacement property operator or provider of the necessary
services, and to execute promptly all applications, assignments, consents, and documents requested by Lender to facilitate such
transition; and 

(B)         Lender
may cause the removal of Borrower or any Property Operator (as applicable) from any Mortgaged Property operations. Until such time
as Lender has located a replacement property operator, Borrower or the acting Property Operator shall, to the extent permitted
under Applicable Laws, continue to provide all required services to maintain the Mortgaged Property in full compliance with all
License and regulatory requirements in accordance with the SASA. Borrower acknowledges that its failure to perform or to cause
the performance of this service shall constitute a form of waste of the Mortgaged Property, causing irreparable harm to Lender
and the Mortgaged Property, and shall constitute sufficient cause for the appointment of a receiver. 

(2)           In
addition to the remedies set forth herein and elsewhere in the Loan Documents, upon an Event of Default, Lender shall be entitled
to mandate the use of a lockbox bank account or other depositary account, to be maintained under the control and supervision of
Lender, for all income of the Mortgaged Property, including Rents, service charges, insurance payments, and Third Party Payments. 

Section 14.03         Additional
Lender Rights; Forbearance. 

(a)           No
Effect Upon Obligations. 

Lender may, but shall not
be obligated to, agree with Borrower, from time to time, and without giving notice to, or obtaining the consent of, or having any
effect upon the obligations of any Property Operator, Guarantor, Key Principal, or other third party obligor, to take any of the
following actions: 

(1)           the
time for payment of the principal of or interest on the Indebtedness may be extended, or the Indebtedness may be renewed in whole
or in part; 

(2)           the
rate of interest on or period of amortization of the Advances or the amount of the Monthly Debt Service Payments payable under
the Loan Documents may be modified; 

(3)           the
time for Borrower s performance of or compliance with any covenant or agreement contained in any Loan Document, whether presently
existing or hereinafter entered into, may be extended or such performance or compliance may be waived; 

(4)           any
or all payments due under this Master Agreement or any other Loan Document may be reduced; 

(5)           any
Loan Document may be modified or amended by Lender and Borrower in any respect, including an increase in the principal amount of
the Advances; 

(6)           any
amounts under this Master Agreement or any other Loan Document may be released; 

(7)           any
security for the Indebtedness may be modified, exchanged, released, surrendered, or otherwise dealt with, or additional security
may be pledged or mortgaged for the Indebtedness; 

(8)           the
payment of the Indebtedness or any security for the Indebtedness, or both, may be subordinated to the right to payment or the security,
or both, of any other present or future creditor of Borrower; or 

(9)           any
other terms of the Loan Documents may be modified. 

(b)           No
Waiver of Rights or Remedies. 

Any waiver of an Event
of Default or forbearance by Lender in exercising any right or remedy under this Master Agreement or any other Loan Document or
otherwise afforded by Applicable Law, shall not be a waiver of any other Event of Default or preclude the exercise or failure to
exercise of any other right or remedy. The acceptance by Lender of payment of all or any part of the Indebtedness after the due
date of such payment, or in an amount which is less than the required payment, shall not be a waiver of Lender s right to
require prompt payment when due of all other payments on account of the Indebtedness or to exercise any remedies for any failure
to make prompt payment. Enforcement by Lender of any security for the Indebtedness shall not constitute an election by Lender of
remedies so as to preclude the exercise or failure to exercise of any other right available to Lender. Lender s receipt of
any insurance proceeds or amounts in connection with a Condemnation Action shall not operate to cure or waive any Event of Default. 

(c)           Appointment
of Lender as Attorney-In-Fact. 

Borrower hereby irrevocably
makes, constitutes, and appoints Lender (and any officer of Lender or any Person designated by Lender for that purpose) as Borrower s
true and lawful proxy and attorney-in-fact (and agent-in-fact) in Borrower s name, place, and stead, with full power of substitution,
to: 

(1)           use
any of the funds in the Replacement Reserve Account or Repairs Escrow Account for the purpose of making or completing the Replacements
or Repairs; 

(2)           make
such additions, changes, and corrections to the Replacements or Repairs as shall be necessary or desirable to complete the Replacements
or Repairs; 

(3)           employ
such contractors, subcontractors, agents, architects, and inspectors as shall be required for such purposes; 

(4)           pay,
settle, or compromise all bills and claims for materials and work performed in connection with the Replacements or Repairs, or
as may be necessary or desirable for the completion of the Replacements or Repairs, or for clearance of title; 

(5)           adjust
and compromise any claims under any and all policies of insurance required pursuant to this Master Agreement and any other Loan
Document, subject only to Borrower s rights under this Master Agreement; 

(6)           appear
in and prosecute any action arising from any insurance policies; 

(7)           collect
and receive the proceeds of insurance, and to deduct from such proceeds Lender s expenses incurred in the collection of such
proceeds; 

(8)           commence,
appear in, and prosecute, in Lender s or Borrower s name, any Condemnation Action; 

(9)           settle
or compromise any claim in connection with any Condemnation Action; 

(10)          execute
all applications and certificates in the name of Borrower which may be required by any of the contract documents; 

(11)         prosecute
and defend all actions or proceedings in connection with any Mortgaged Property or the rehabilitation and repair of any Mortgaged
Property; 

(12)         take
such actions as are permitted in this Master Agreement and any other Loan Documents; 

(13)         execute
such financing statements and other documents and to do such other acts as Lender may require to perfect and preserve Lender s
security interest in, and to enforce such interests in, the collateral; and 

(14)         carry
out any remedy provided for in this Master Agreement and any other Loan Documents, including endorsing Borrower s name to
checks, drafts, instruments, and other items of payment and proceeds of the collateral, executing change of address forms with
the postmaster of the United States Post Office serving the address of Borrower, changing the address of Borrower to that of Lender,
opening all envelopes addressed to Borrower, and applying any payments contained therein to the Indebtedness. 

Borrower hereby acknowledges
that the constitution and appointment of such proxy and attorney-in-fact are coupled with an interest and are irrevocable and shall
not be affected by the disability or incompetence of Borrower. Borrower specifically acknowledges and agrees that this power of
attorney granted to Lender may be assigned by Lender to Lender s successors or assigns as holder of the Note (and the other
Loan Documents). The foregoing powers conferred on Lender under this Section 14.03(c) (Appointment of Lender as Attorney-In-Fact)
shall not impose any duty upon Lender to exercise any such powers and shall not require Lender to incur any expense or take any
action. Borrower hereby ratifies and confirms all that such attorney-in-fact may do or cause to be done by virtue of any provision
of this Master Agreement and any other Loan Documents. 

Notwithstanding the foregoing
provisions, Lender shall not exercise its rights as set forth in this Section 14.03(c) (Appointment of Lender as Attorney-In-Fact)
unless: (A) an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing or (B) Lender determines, in its discretion, that exigent circumstances
exist or that such exercise is necessary or prudent in order to protect and preserve the Mortgaged Property, or Lender s
lien priority and security interest in the Mortgaged Property. 

(d)           Borrower
Waivers. 

If more than one Person signs this Master Agreement
as Borrower, each Borrower, with respect to any other Borrower, hereby agrees that Lender, in its discretion, may: 

(1)           bring
suit against Borrower, or any one or more of Borrower, jointly and severally, or against any one or more of them; 

(2)           compromise
or settle with any one or more of the persons constituting Borrower, for such consideration as Lender may deem proper; 

(3)           release
one or more of the persons constituting Borrower, from liability; or 

(4)           otherwise
deal with Borrower, or any one or more of them, in any manner, and no such action shall impair the rights of Lender to collect
from any Borrower the full amount of the Indebtedness. 

Section 14.04         Waiver
of Marshaling. 

Notwithstanding the existence
of any other security interests in the Mortgaged Properties held by Lender or by any other party, Lender shall have the right to
determine the order in which any or all of the Mortgaged Properties (or any part thereof) shall be subjected to the remedies provided
in this Master Agreement, any other Loan Document or Applicable Law. Lender shall have the right to determine the order in which
all or any part of the Indebtedness is satisfied from the proceeds realized upon the exercise of such remedies. Borrower and any
party who now or in the future acquires a security interest in any Mortgaged Property and who has actual or constructive notice
of this Master Agreement waives any and all right to require the marshaling of assets or to require that any of the Mortgaged Properties
be sold in the inverse order of alienation or that any of the Mortgaged Properties be sold in parcels or as an entirety in connection
with the exercise of any of the remedies permitted by Applicable Law or provided in this Master Agreement or any other Loan Documents. 

Lender shall account for
any moneys received by Lender in respect of any foreclosure on or disposition of collateral hereunder and under the other Loan
Documents provided that Lender shall not have any duty as to any collateral, and Lender shall be accountable only for amounts that
it actually receives as a result of the exercise of such powers. NONE OF LENDER OR ITS AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES,
AGENTS, OR REPRESENTATIVES SHALL BE RESPONSIBLE TO BORROWER (a) FOR ANY ACT OR FAILURE TO ACT UNDER ANY POWER OF ATTORNEY OR OTHERWISE,
EXCEPT IN RESPECT OF DAMAGES ATTRIBUTABLE SOLELY TO THEIR OWN GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT AS FINALLY DETERMINED PURSUANT
TO A FINAL, NON-APPEALABLE COURT ORDER BY A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION, NOR (b) FOR ANY PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL
DAMAGES. 

Section 14.05         Severed
Loan Documents. 

Lender shall have the right
from time to time to sever the Note and the other Loan Documents into one or more separate notes, mortgages, and other security
documents (the   Severed Loan Documents  ) in such denominations as Lender shall determine in its discretion for
purposes of evidencing and enforcing its rights and remedies provided hereunder, provided that: 

(a)           the
amount of Advances Outstanding immediately after the effective date of such modification equals the amount of Advances Outstanding
immediately prior to such modification; 

(b)           the
weighted average of the interest rates for Advances Outstanding immediately after the effective date of such modification equals
the weighted average of the interest rates for Advances Outstanding immediately prior to such modification; 

(c)           each
future principal payment shall be ratably allocated to each Advance based on the Outstanding principal balance of such Advance
at the time of such modification and each future amortization payment shall be ratably paid in accordance with such allocation
at all times; 

(d)           there
shall be no other change to the economic and/or other material terms, rights and obligations of Borrower or Guarantor under the
Loan Documents; and 

(e)           the
Collateral and the revenue therefrom shall continue to secure, and be available to be applied against, the total Advances Outstanding. 

Borrower shall execute
and deliver to Lender from time to time, promptly after the request of Lender, a severance agreement and such other documents as
Lender shall reasonably request in order to effect the severance described above, all in form and substance reasonably satisfactory
to Lender. Borrower hereby absolutely and irrevocably appoints Lender as its true and lawful attorney, coupled with an interest,
in its name and stead to make and execute all documents necessary or desirable to effect the aforesaid severance, Borrower ratifying
all that its said attorney shall do by virtue thereof;  provided ,  however  ,  Lender shall not make or execute
any such documents under such power until ten (10) Business Days after notice has been given to Borrower by Lender of Lender s
intent to exercise its rights under such power. Borrower shall be obligated to pay any costs or expenses incurred in connection
with the preparation, execution, recording, or filing of the Severed Loan Documents, and the Severed Loan Documents shall not contain
any representations, warranties, or covenants not contained in the Loan Documents and any such representations and warranties contained
in the Severed Loan Documents will be given by Borrower only as of the date last given. 

ARTICLE 15 
MISCELLANEOUS 

Section 15.01         Choice
of Law; Consent to Jurisdiction. 

Notwithstanding anything
in the Notes, the Security Documents, or any of the other Loan Documents to the contrary, each of the terms and provisions, and
rights and obligations of Borrower under this Master Agreement and the Notes and the other Loan Documents, shall be governed by,
interpreted, construed, and enforced pursuant to and in accordance with the laws of the District of Columbia (excluding the law
applicable to conflicts or choice of law) except to the extent of procedural and substantive matters relating only to the creation,
perfection, and foreclosure of liens and security interests, and enforcement of the rights and remedies, against the Mortgaged
Properties, which matters shall be governed by the laws of the jurisdiction in which a Mortgaged Property is located, the perfection,
the effect of perfection and non-perfection and foreclosure of security interests on personal property, which matters shall be
governed by the laws of the jurisdiction determined by the choice of law provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code in effect for
the jurisdiction in which any Borrower is organized. Borrower agrees that any controversy arising under or in relation to the Notes,
the Security Documents (other than the Security Instruments), or any other Loan Document shall be, except as otherwise provided
herein, litigated in the District of Columbia. The local and federal courts and authorities with jurisdiction in the District of
Columbia shall, except as otherwise provided herein, have jurisdiction over all controversies which may arise under or in relation
to the Loan Documents, including those controversies relating to the execution, jurisdiction, breach, enforcement, or compliance
with the Notes, the Security Documents (other than the Security Instruments), or any other issue arising under, relating to, or
in connection with any of the Loan Documents. Borrower irrevocably consents to service, jurisdiction, and venue of such courts
for any litigation arising from the Notes, the Security Documents, or any of the other Loan Documents, and waives any other venue
to which it might be entitled by virtue of domicile, habitual residence, or otherwise. Nothing contained herein, however, shall
prevent Lender from bringing any suit, action, or proceeding or exercising any rights against Borrower and against the collateral
in any other jurisdiction. Initiating such suit, action, or proceeding or taking such action in any other jurisdiction shall in
no event constitute a waiver of the agreement contained herein that the laws of the District of Columbia shall govern the rights
and obligations of Borrower and Lender as provided herein or the submission herein by Borrower to personal jurisdiction within
the District of Columbia. 

Section 15.02         Waiver
of Jury Trial. 

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED
BY APPLICABLE LAW, EACH OF BORROWER AND LENDER (a) COVENANTS AND AGREES NOT TO ELECT A TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY ISSUE
ARISING OUT OF THIS MASTER AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT, OR THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PARTIES AS BORROWER AND LENDER,
THAT IS TRIABLE OF RIGHT BY A JURY AND (b) WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO SUCH ISSUE TO THE EXTENT THAT
ANY SUCH RIGHT EXISTS NOW OR IN THE FUTURE. THIS WAIVER OF RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IS SEPARATELY GIVEN BY EACH PARTY, KNOWINGLY
AND VOLUNTARILY WITH THE BENEFIT OF COMPETENT LEGAL COUNSEL 

Section 15.03         Notice.

forth herein or in any other Loan Document, all notices under this Master Agreement and any other Loan Document shall be: 

(1)           in
writing and shall be:

in person;

the recipient refuses or rejects delivery, the date on which the notice is so refused or rejected, as conclusively established
by the records of the United States Postal Service or such express courier service. 

(b)           Change
of Address. 

Any party to this Master
Agreement may change the address to which notices intended for it are to be directed by means of notice given to the other parties
identified on the Summary of Master Terms in accordance with this Section 15.03 (Notice).

in writing, the receipt of any notice upon request by the other party. 

(e)           Property
Operator Notices. 

Borrower acknowledges and
agrees that Borrower solely shall be responsible for (1) causing Property Operator to comply with any notice received by Borrower
from Lender, and (2) promptly providing Lender with copies of notices received by Borrower from Property Operator. Borrower s
compliance with or failure to act as an intermediary as described in this Section 15.03(e) (Property Operator Notices) shall not
relieve Borrower from its obligations under this Master Agreement, nor shall it constitute a defense or excuse for nonperformance
by Borrower, Property Operator, or any Guarantor, as applicable. Lender shall have no obligation to provide any notice to Property
Operator unless and until Lender has taken ownership or control of the Mortgaged Property, or in connection with Lender s
exercise of the power of attorney granted herein, and then only as required by the Loan Documents or the Facility Operating Agreement. 

Section 15.04         Successors
and Assigns Bound; Sale of Advances. 

(a)           Binding
Agreement. 

This Master Agreement shall
bind, and the rights granted by this Master Agreement shall inure to, the successors and assigns of Lender and the permitted successors
and assigns of Borrower. However, a Transfer not permitted by this Master Agreement shall be an Event of Default and shall be void
ab initio. 

(b)           Sale
of Advances; Change of Servicer. 

Nothing in this Master
Agreement shall limit Lender s (including its successors and assigns) right to sell or transfer the Advances or any interest
in the Advances. The Advances or a partial interest in the Advances (together with this Master Agreement and the other Loan Documents)
may be sold one or more times without prior written notice to Borrower. A sale may result in a change of the Loan Servicer. 

Section 15.05         Counterparts. 

This Master Agreement may
be executed in any number of counterparts with the same effect as if the parties hereto had signed the same document and all such
counterparts shall be construed together and shall constitute one instrument.

(a)           Solely
Creditor and Debtor. 

The relationship between
Lender and Borrower shall be solely that of creditor and debtor, respectively, and nothing contained in this Master Agreement shall
create any other relationship between Lender and Borrower, nor between Lender and Property Operator. Nothing contained in this
Master Agreement shall constitute Lender as a joint venturer, partner, or agent of Borrower or Property Operator, or render Lender
liable for any debts, obligations, acts, omissions, representations, or contracts of Borrower or Property Operator. 

(b)           No
Third Party Beneficiaries. 

No creditor of any party
to this Master Agreement and no other Person shall be a third party beneficiary of this Master Agreement or any other Loan Document
or any account created or contemplated under this Master Agreement or any other Loan Document. Nothing contained in this Master
Agreement shall be deemed or construed to create an obligation on the part of Lender to any third party nor shall any third party
have a right to enforce against Lender any right that Borrower may have under this Master Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing: 

(1)           any
Servicing Arrangement between Lender and any Loan Servicer shall constitute a contractual obligation of such Loan Servicer that
is independent of the obligation of Borrower for the payment of the Indebtedness; 

(2)           Borrower
shall not be a third party beneficiary of any Servicing Arrangement; and 

(3)           no
payment by the Loan Servicer under any Servicing Arrangement will reduce the amount of the Indebtedness. 

Section 15.08         Severability;
Entire Agreement; Amendments. 

The invalidity or unenforceability
of any provision of this Master Agreement or any other Loan Document shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other
provision of this Master Agreement or of any other Loan Document, all of which shall remain in full force and effect, including
the Guaranty. This Master Agreement contains the complete and entire agreement among the parties as to the matters covered, rights
granted and the obligations assumed in this Master Agreement. This Master Agreement may not be amended or modified except by written
agreement signed by the parties hereto.

captions and headings of the sections of this Master Agreement and the Loan Documents are for convenience only and shall be disregarded
in construing this Master Agreement and the Loan Documents. 

(b)          Any
reference in this Master Agreement to an  Exhibit  or  Schedule  or a  Section  or an  Article

Master Agreement or to a Section or Article of this Master Agreement. 

(c)          Any
reference in this Master Agreement to a statute or regulation shall be construed as referring to that statute or regulation as
amended from time to time.

of the singular in this Master Agreement includes the plural and use of the plural includes the singular. 

(e)          As
used in this Master Agreement, the term  including  means  including, but not limited to  or  including,
without limitation,  and is for example only and not a limitation. 

(f)          Whenever
Borrower s knowledge is implicated in this Master Agreement or the phrase  to Borrower s knowledge  or
a similar phrase is used in this Master Agreement, Borrower s knowledge or such phrase(s) shall be interpreted to mean to
the best of Borrower s knowledge after reasonable and diligent inquiry and investigation. 

(g)          Unless
otherwise provided in this Master Agreement, if Lender s approval, designation, determination, selection, estimate, action,
or decision is required, permitted, or contemplated hereunder, such approval, designation, determination, selection, estimate,
action, or decision shall be made in Lender s sole and absolute discretion. 

(h)          All
references in this Master Agreement to a separate instrument or agreement shall include such instrument or agreement as the same
may be amended or supplemented from time to time pursuant to the applicable provisions thereof. 

(i)           Lender
may  shall mean at Lender s discretion, but shall not be an obligation. 

(j)          Any
references in this Master Agreement to a Senior Housing Facility shall refer to the Mortgaged Property identified on the Summary
of Master Terms including the Seniors Housing Facility Licensing Designation. 

(k)          Each
reference to  tenant  or  tenants  in the Loan Documents shall be interpreted to mean  subtenant 
or  subtenants  where the context so indicates.

Servicing. 

All actions regarding the
servicing of the Advances, including the collection of payments, the giving and receipt of notice, inspections of the Mortgaged
Properties, inspections of books and records, and the granting of consents and approvals, may be taken by the Loan Servicer unless
Borrower receives notice to the contrary. If Borrower receives conflicting notices regarding the identity of the Loan Servicer
or any other subject, any such notice from Lender shall govern. The Loan Servicer may change from time to time (whether related
or unrelated to a sale of the Advances). If there is a change of the Loan Servicer, Borrower will be given notice of the change. 

Section 15.11         Disclosure
of Information. 

Subject to Applicable Laws,
Lender may furnish information regarding Borrower, Property Operator, Key Principal or Guarantor or the Mortgaged Properties to
third parties with an existing or prospective interest in the servicing, enforcement, evaluation, performance, purchase, or securitization
of the Advances, including trustees, master servicers, special servicers, rating agencies, and organizations maintaining databases
on the underwriting and performance of multifamily mortgage loans. Borrower irrevocably waives any and all rights it may have under
Applicable Law to prohibit such disclosure, including any right of privacy. 

Section 15.12         Waiver;
Conflict. 

No specific waiver of any
of the terms of this Master Agreement shall be considered as a general waiver. If any provision of this Master Agreement is in
conflict with any provision of any other Loan Document, the provision contained in this Master Agreement shall control. 

Section 15.13         [Intentionally
Deleted.] 

Section 15.14         No
Reliance. 

Borrower acknowledges, represents, and warrants
that: 

(a)           it
understands the nature and structure of the transactions contemplated by this Master Agreement and the other Loan Documents; 

(b)           it
is familiar with the provisions of all of the documents and instruments relating to such transactions; 

(c)           it
understands the risks inherent in such transactions, including the risk of loss of all or any part of any Mortgaged Property; 

(d)           it
has had the opportunity to consult counsel; and 

(e)           it
has not relied on Lender for any guidance or expertise in analyzing the financial or other consequences of the transactions contemplated
by this Master Agreement or any other Loan Document or otherwise relied on Lender in any manner in connection with interpreting,
entering into, or otherwise in connection with this Master Agreement, any other Loan Document, or any of the matters contemplated
hereby or thereby. 

Section 15.15         Subrogation. 

If, and to the extent that,
the proceeds of any Advance are used to pay, satisfy, or discharge any obligation of Borrower or Property Operator for the payment
of money that is secured by a pre-existing mortgage, deed of trust, or other lien encumbering any Mortgaged Property, such proceeds
shall be deemed to have been advanced by Lender at Borrower s request, and Lender shall be subrogated automatically, and
without further action on its part, to the rights, including lien priority, of the owner or holder of the obligation secured by
such prior lien, whether or not such prior lien is released. 

Section 15.16         Counting
of Days. 

Except where otherwise
specifically provided, any reference in this Master Agreement to a period of  days  means calendar days, not Business
Days. If the date on which Borrower is required to perform an obligation under this Master Agreement is not a Business Day, Borrower
shall be required to perform such obligation by the Business Day immediately preceding such date;  provided ,  however ,
in respect of (x) any deliverables required under ARTICLE 8 of this Master Agreement, (y) any Payment Date, or (z) if the Maturity
Date is other than a Business Day, Borrower shall be obligated to make such deliverable or payment by the Business Day immediately
following such date. 

Section 15.17         Revival
and Reinstatement of Indebtedness. 

If the payment of all or
any part of the Indebtedness by Borrower, Property Operator, Guarantor, or any other Person, or the transfer to Lender of any collateral
or other property should for any reason subsequently be declared to be void or voidable under any state or federal law relating

(b)           Underwriting.

the provisions of (A) and (B) above, then the Release Price shall be applied: 

(i)          first
against any Variable Advances Outstanding so long as the prepayment is permitted under the Variable Note (and any Prepayment Premium
due and owing is paid), until any Variable Advance is no longer Outstanding (provided that, in the event there are multiple Variable
Advances Outstanding, Lender shall determine the order of application of the Release Price taking into account factors including
the unpaid principal balances of the Variable Notes, and which Variable Note Outstanding has the lowest prepayment costs or highest
interest rate); 

(ii)         then
against any Fixed Advances Outstanding, so long as prepayment is permitted under the applicable Fixed Note (and any Prepayment
Premium due and owing is paid) (provided that, in the event there are multiple Fixed Advances Outstanding, Lender shall determine
the order of application of the Release Price taking into account factors including the unpaid principal balances of the Fixed
Notes, and which Fixed Note Outstanding has the lowest prepayment costs or the highest interest rate). 

The Note to be prepaid or partially
prepaid as determined pursuant to this Section (d) (Application of Release Price), shall be referred to as the   Selected
Advance  . 

(2)         In
connection with a Substitution, Borrower may substitute a Mortgaged Property that has an estimated Allocable Facility Amount that
is less than the Allocable Facility Amount of the Release Mortgaged Property so long as Borrower pays the Release Price associated
with the difference between such Allocable Facility Amounts. 

(e)            Conditions
Precedent.  

The Release of a Mortgaged
Property from the Collateral Pool is subject to the satisfaction of the following conditions precedent on or before the Effective
Date:

Selected Advance must be prepayable as of the Effective Date of the Release of such Mortgaged Property; 

(2)         receipt
by Lender of the fully executed Release Request; 

(3)         immediately
after giving effect to the requested Release, the provisions of Section (b) (Underwriting) of this Mortgaged Property Release Schedule

(4)         receipt
by Lender of the Release Price and all amounts owing under Section (c) (Release Price) of this Mortgaged Property Release Schedule,

Deposit) to the extent necessary under Section (g)(1) (The Substitution Deposit) of this Mortgaged Property Release Schedule; 

(5)         receipt
by Lender of the Release Fee, or in connection with a Substitution, receipt by Lender of the Substitution Fee (it being agreed

(6)         receipt
by Lender of all legal fees and expenses in connection with a Release Request; 

(7)         receipt
by Lender of one (1) or more executed, original counterparts of all Release Documents, dated as of the Effective Date, each
of which shall be in full force and effect, in form and substance satisfactory to Lender in all respects; 

(8)         if
required by Lender, amendments to this Master Agreement, the Notes and the Security Instruments, reflecting the release of the
Release Mortgaged Property from the Collateral Pool and, as to any Security Instrument or Note so amended or if Lender reasonably
determines that such endorsement is necessary to maintain the priority of the Lien created in favor of Lender with respect to the
Outstanding Indebtedness or to maintain the validity of any Title Policy, the receipt by Lender of an endorsement to each Title
Policy insuring the Security Instruments, amending the effective date of each Title Policy to the Effective Date and showing no
additional exceptions to coverage other than the exceptions shown on the initial Effective Date for such Mortgaged Property, Permitted
Encumbrances and other exceptions approved by Lender; 

(9)         satisfaction
of all applicable General Conditions; 

(10)        if
the Release Mortgaged Property is one phase of a project, and one or more other phases of the project are Mortgaged Properties
which will remain in the Collateral Pool (   Remaining Mortgaged
Properties   ), the Remaining Mortgaged Properties must be able to be operated separately from the Release Mortgaged
Property and any other phases of the project which are not Mortgaged Properties, taking into account any cross use agreements or
easements, access, utilities, marketability, community services, ownership and operation of the Remaining Mortgaged Properties
and any other relevant factors pursuant to the Underwriting and Servicing Requirements. Borrower shall deliver to Lender evidence
satisfactory to Lender that this condition precedent is satisfied prior to the closing of the transaction that is the subject of
the Request. Borrower acknowledges that none of the Initial Mortgaged Properties are part of a phase of a project; 

(11)        after

in an amount equal to one hundred twenty-five percent (125%)   of the Initial Valuation of such Mortgaged Properties
(which amount shall take into account the title insurance coverage provided by any  tie-in  endorsements); and 

(13)        receipt
by Lender on the Effective Date of a Confirmation of Obligations and a Confirmation of Guaranty. 

(f)            Closing.

Date mutually selected by Lender and Borrower, and occurring within thirty (30) days after Lender s receipt of the Release
Request (or on such other date as Borrower and Lender may agree), by executing and delivering, and causing all applicable parties
to execute and deliver, all at the sole cost and expense of Borrower, the Release Documents. If approved by Lender, Borrower may
prepare the Release Documents and submit them to Lender for its review. 

(g)            Staggered
Substitution Specific Terms.  

The following provisions
are applicable to Staggered Substitutions only: 

(1)           The
Substitution Deposit. 

If a Substitution
is a Staggered Substitution, on or before the Effective Date of the Release of the Release Mortgaged Property, Borrower shall deposit
with Lender the   Substitution Deposit   described below in the form of cash in a non-interest bearing account
held by Lender as additional Collateral. In lieu of (or in addition to) depositing cash for the Substitution Deposit, Borrower
may post a Letter of Credit as additional Collateral issued by a financial institution reasonably acceptable to Lender in accordance
with the Letter of Credit Schedule, with a face amount available to be drawn equal to the Substitution Deposit (less any amount
deposited in cash) as additional Collateral. 

(2)           Substitution
Deposit Amount. 

(A)         The
  Substitution Deposit   for each proposed Staggered Substitution shall be an amount equal to the sum of: 

(i)          the
Release Price relating to the Release Mortgaged Property; plus 

(ii)         any
and all Prepayment Premiums, as applicable, for the Selected Advance determined in accordance with the conditions set forth in
Section (d) (Application of Release Price) of this Mortgaged Property Release Schedule, as the Advance(s) that shall be prepaid
if the Substitution fails to take place. The Prepayment Premium shall be calculated as of the end of the month in which the Property
Delivery Deadline occurs, as if the Selected Advance were to be prepaid in such month; plus 

(iii)        estimated
costs, expenses and fees of Lender and Fannie Mae pertaining to the Substitution (such costs, fees and expenses, the   Substitution
Cost Deposit  ); 

(iv)        without
duplication to any other amounts included in the definition of Substitution Deposit, in the event that (1) at the time of the Release
no Note is prepayable (i.e. all Notes are subject to a lockout period) or (2) the Release Price is in excess of all Notes that
are open to prepayment, all scheduled principal and interest due and owing through the end of the lockout period with respect to
such Selected Advance. 

The amount of
the required Substitution Deposit shall be recalculated by Lender in the event the Property Delivery Deadline is extended pursuant
to Section (e) (Closing) of the Mortgaged Property Addition Schedule, and in the event a Substitution is partially satisfied by
the Addition of an Additional Mortgaged Property, as further set forth in Section (f)(2)) (Substitution Deposit Disbursement and
Recalculation) of the Mortgaged Property Addition Schedule. 

(B)         The
Substitution Cost Deposit shall be used by Lender to cover all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by Lender and
Fannie Mae, including any out-of-pocket legal fees and expenses incurred by Fannie Mae and Lender in connection with such Substitution
whether such Substitution actually closes (the   Substitution Costs  ). 

(3)           Continued
Obligations; Restriction on Borrowings. 

(A)         Borrower
shall continue to be obligated to make any regularly scheduled payments of principal and interest due under all Notes Outstanding
during the Staggered Substitution period. Until the completion of the Staggered Substitution, no Future Advances will be permitted
unless and until the provisions of Section (f)(1) (Failure to Close Substitution) of the Mortgaged Property Addition Schedule are
satisfied. 

(B)         In
connection with a Staggered Substitution, until the Addition of the Additional Mortgaged Property to the Collateral Pool and closing
of the Substitution occurs, no Future Advances or other Requests will be permitted, provided that a Termination Request shall be
permitted subject to satisfaction of the conditions in Section 2.11 (Termination of Master Agreement), and a Conversion pursuant
to a Conversion Request shall be permitted subject to satisfaction of the conditions in the Conversion Schedule; provided further,
however, with respect to any Conversion, the Substitution Deposit shall be recalculated based on the provisions in Section (g)
(Staggered Substitution Specific Terms) of this Mortgaged Property Release Schedule and Borrower shall deposit with Lender as additional
Collateral all increases, if any, in such Substitution Deposit within five (5) days after receipt of notice of the same). 

(C)         Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Master Agreement, no Staggered Substitution shall be permitted unless immediately after the Release
of the Release Mortgaged Property the requirements in Section 2.10(e) (Limitation on Collateral Events) are satisfied. 

(h)           Release
of Borrower, Guarantor, and Property Operator.  

Upon the Release of a Mortgaged
Property, Borrower that is the owner of such Release Mortgaged Property (assuming Borrower owns no other Mortgaged Property in
the Collateral Pool), Guarantor, and Property Operator shall be released automatically of all obligations solely related to the
Release Mortgaged Property as set forth in this Master Agreement and the other Loan Documents, except for any provisions of this
Master Agreement and the other Loan Documents that are expressly stated to survive any release or termination or for any liabilities
or obligations of such Borrower, Guarantor, or Property Operator which arose prior to the Effective Date of such Release.

the provisions of Section 2.10(e) (Limitation on Collateral Events) shall be satisfied. 

(2)           Lender
shall evaluate the proposed Additional Mortgaged Property in accordance with the Underwriting and Servicing Requirements. Lender
shall determine the Loan to Value Ratio of the proposed Additional Mortgaged Property and the Aggregate Loan to Value Ratio applicable

Borrower.  

On the Effective Date of
the Addition of an Additional Mortgaged Property, the owner of such Additional Mortgaged Property, if such owner is an Additional
Borrower, shall become a party to the Contribution Agreement in a manner satisfactory to Lender. Any Additional Borrower shall
join into this Master Agreement and other Loan Documents and shall execute and deliver to Lender an amendment adding such Additional

by Lender of all Property-Related Documents; 

(5)           receipt

(6)           receipt
by Lender of a licensing opinion in form and substance satisfactory to Lender in all respects. 

(e)           Closing.  

(1)           Additions.  

Other than in
connection with a Substitution, if the proposed Additional Mortgaged Property meets the conditions set forth in this Mortgaged
Property Addition Schedule, and Borrower timely elects to add the proposed Additional Mortgaged Property to a Collateral Pool,
the proposed Additional Mortgaged Property shall be added to the Collateral Pool on an Effective Date mutually selected by Lender
and Borrower, occurring within thirty (30) Business Days after all of the conditions for an Addition have been satisfied (or
on such other date as Borrower and Lender may agree). 

(2)           Substitutions.  

In connection
with a Substitution, if the Additional Mortgaged Property satisfies the conditions set forth herein and Borrower timely elects
to proceed with the Substitution, the proposed Additional Mortgaged Property shall be added in replacement of the Mortgaged Property
being released on an Effective Date selected by Lender and occurring: 

(A)         if
the Substitution of the proposed Additional Mortgaged Property is to occur simultaneously with the release of the Release Mortgaged
Property, within sixty (60) days after Lender s receipt of Borrower s Release Request indicating there is to be
a Substitution (or on such other date to which Borrower and Lender may agree); or 

(B)         if
the Substitution is a Staggered Substitution, within ninety (90) days after the release of such Release Mortgaged Property
(provided such date shall be extended an additional ninety (90) days if Borrower provides reasonable evidence of Borrower s
diligent efforts in finding a suitable proposed Additional Mortgaged Property) (the   Property Delivery Deadline  )
in accordance with the terms of the Mortgaged Property Release Schedule and this Mortgaged Property Addition Schedule. 

(f)            Staggered
Substitutions.  

(1)           Failure
to Close Substitution. 

If the Substitution
of the proposed Additional Mortgaged Property does not occur by the Property Delivery Deadline, then such Borrower shall have irrevocably
waived its right to substitute such Release Mortgaged Property with the proposed Additional Mortgaged Property, and the release
of the Release Mortgaged Property shall be deemed to be a Release pursuant to the terms of the Mortgaged Property Release Schedule
and shall trigger payment pursuant to the terms of the Mortgaged Property Release Schedule, plus the Release Fee. 

(2)           Substitution
Deposit Disbursement and Recalculation. 

(A)         On
or prior to the Effective Date of the Substitution, Lender shall notify Borrower of the actual amount of the Substitution Costs
incurred by Lender and Fannie Mae in connection with the Substitution and Borrower shall, on or before the Effective Date of the
Substitution, pay to Lender the remainder of such Substitution Costs (if the actual amount of the Substitution Costs exceed the
Substitution Cost Deposit (as defined in Section (g) (Staggered Substitution Specific Terms) of the Mortgaged Property Release
Schedule) and the other amounts previously deposited with Lender by Borrower) or Lender shall promptly refund to Borrower any Substitution
Cost Deposit deposited with Lender by Borrower in excess of the Substitution Costs (if the actual amount of the Substitution Costs
is less than the Substitution Cost Deposit deposited with Lender by Borrower). 

(B)         At
closing of the Substitution, Lender shall disburse or return the Substitution Deposit (as defined in Section (g) (Staggered Substitution
Specific Terms) of the Mortgaged Property Release Schedule), as applicable (less any portion of the Substitution Cost Deposit used
by Lender to cover all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by Lender and Fannie Mae, including any out-of-pocket
legal fees and expenses incurred by Fannie Mae and Lender in connection with such Substitution), directly to Borrower at such time
as the conditions precedent for the Substitution have been satisfied, which must occur no later than the Property Delivery Deadline. 

(C)         If,
pursuant to Section (b) (Underwriting) of this Mortgaged Property Addition Schedule, Borrower substitutes a Mortgaged Property
that has an estimated Allocable Facility Amount that is less than the Allocable Facility Amount of the Release Mortgaged Property
and Borrower notifies Lender that no further property will be substituted or Borrower fails to timely identify an additional replacement
Mortgaged Property, then Lender shall disburse to Borrower that portion of the Substitution Deposit (less any portion of the Substitution
Cost Deposit used by Lender to cover all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by Lender and Fannie Mae, including
any out-of-pocket legal fees and expenses incurred by Fannie Mae and Lender in connection with such Substitution) equal to the
Allocable Facility Amount of such substitute Mortgaged Property and apply the remainder of the Substitution Deposit pursuant to
Section (d) (Application of Release Price) of the Mortgaged Property Release Schedule. 

(D)         Notwithstanding
the foregoing, in the event that (i) the Property Delivery Deadline is extended pursuant to Section (e)(2)(B) (Closing) of this
Mortgaged Property Addition Schedule or (ii) Borrower adds an Additional Mortgaged Property to the Collateral Pool prior to the
Property Delivery Deadline but the addition of such Additional Mortgaged Property has not in and of itself satisfied the requirements
of this Mortgaged Property Addition Schedule, Lender shall recalculate the Substitution Deposit. Any reduction, if any, in the
Substitution Deposit shall be returned to Borrower, or in the case of a Letter of Credit, such Letter of Credit shall be reduced
by such reduction in the Substitution Deposit. Any increase, if any, in the Substitution Deposit shall be paid by Borrower to Lender
within three (3) Business Days of notice from Lender.

A.           Borrower
owns one (1) or more Multifamily Residential Properties as more particularly described in  Exhibit A  to this Master
Agreement. 

B.           Borrower
has requested that Lender make a loan in favor of Borrower, comprised of a $30,000,000 Variable Advance, and a $0 Fixed Advance.
Future Advances may be made by Lender to Borrower in accordance with the terms of this Master Agreement. 

C.           To
secure the obligations of Borrower under this Master Agreement and the other Loan Documents, Borrower shall create a Collateral
Pool in favor of Lender. The Collateral Pool shall be comprised of (i) the Multifamily Residential Properties listed on  Exhibit A 
and (ii) any other collateral pledged to Lender from time to time by Borrower pursuant to this Master Agreement or any other
Loan Documents. 

D.           Each
Note and Security Document shall be cross-defaulted ( i.e. , a default under any Note, Security Document or this Master Agreement
shall constitute a default under each other Note and Security Document and under this Master Agreement) and cross-collateralized
( i.e. , each Security Instrument shall secure all of Borrower s obligations under each Note, this Master Agreement,
and the other Loan Documents). It is the intent of the parties to this Master Agreement that, upon the occurrence and during the
continuance of an Event of Default, Lender may accelerate any Note without the obligation but with the right to accelerate any
other Note and that in the exercise of its rights and remedies under the Loan Documents, Lender may exercise and perfect any and
all of its rights and remedies in and under the Loan Documents with regard to any Mortgaged Property without the obligation but
with the right to exercise and perfect its rights and remedies with respect to any other Mortgaged Property. Subject to the limitations
set forth in the Security Instruments, any such exercise shall be without regard to the Allocable Facility Amount assigned to such
Mortgaged Property. Subject to the limitations set forth in the Security Instruments, Lender may recover an amount equal to the
full amount Outstanding in respect of any of the Notes in connection with such exercise and any such amount shall be applied to
the Indebtedness as determined by Lender pursuant to the terms of this Master Agreement, the Notes, and the other Loan Documents. 

E.           It
is the intent of the parties that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or the existence of any cash management system
maintained by Borrower, and/or Guarantor or Borrower Affiliates or the provision by Guarantor of the Guaranty, Lender is making
Advances to Borrower (not to Guarantor or Borrower Affiliates). Lender has underwritten the making of the Advances based on its
analysis of the value of the Collateral. In making the Advances, Lender is relying on each Borrower being and maintaining itself
as a Single Purpose entity whose sole asset is its Mortgaged Property and ancillary property related thereto. Lender acknowledges
that it views its credit risk as the performance and value of the Mortgaged Properties and it views the Guaranty as independent
supplemental support in the event that one of the exceptions to the non-recourse events occurs. 

F.           Subject
to the terms, conditions, and limitations of this Master Agreement, Lender has agreed to make the Advances. 

G.           It
is anticipated that Lender shall assign each Advance made hereunder to Fannie Mae; however Fannie Mae shall not assume (i) any
of the obligations of Lender, if any, under this Master Agreement to make Future Advances, or (ii) any of the obligations of Lender
which are servicing obligations delegated to Lender as servicer of the Advances. 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration
of Borrower and Lender entering into this Master Agreement and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and adequacy
of which are hereby conclusively acknowledged, the parties hereby covenant, agree, represent, and warrant as follows:

ARTICLE 2 

 ADVANCES; COLLATERAL
EVENTS 

Section 2.01         Variable
Advance and Fixed Advance. 

Subject to the terms, conditions,
and limitations of this Master Agreement: 

(a)          Variable
Advance. 

Lender agrees to make Variable
Advances to Borrower in accordance with the terms and provisions of this Master Agreement. Future Advances may be made pursuant
to Section 2.02(c)(2) (Future Advances). Pursuant to the terms of Section 2.10(a) (Conversion from Variable Note to Fixed Note),
Borrower may convert a Variable Note to a Fixed Note. 

(b)          Fixed
Advance. 

Lender agrees to make Fixed
Advances to Borrower in accordance with the terms and provisions of this Master Agreement. Future Advances may be made pursuant
to Section 2.02(c)(2) (Future Advances). 

Section 2.02         Advances. 

(a)          Request. 

Assuming Advances are available
to Borrower under this Master Agreement and this Section 2.02 (Advances), Borrower   shall request a Future Advance by giving
Lender a Future Advance Request. The Future Advance Request shall indicate whether the Request is for a Fixed Advance or Variable
Advance or more than one type of Advance. 

(b)          Limitations
on Executions. 

Notwithstanding anything
in this Master Agreement or any other Loan Document to the contrary, any Future Advance (whether a Variable Advance or a Fixed
Advance) and any Conversion of an Advance shall be subject to the precondition that Lender must confirm with Fannie Mae that Fannie
Mae is generally offering to purchase in the marketplace advances of the execution type requested by Borrower at the time of the
Request and at the time the rate for such Advance is locked. In the event Fannie Mae is not purchasing advances of the type requested
by Borrower, Lender agrees to offer, to the extent available from Fannie Mae, alternative advance executions based on the types
of executions Fannie Mae is generally offering to purchase in the marketplace at that time. Any alternative execution offered would
be subject to mutually agreeable documentation necessary to implement the terms and conditions of such alternative execution. 

(c)          Making
Advances. 

(1)         Initial
Advances. 

Assuming conditions
of Lender have been met prior to or as of the date of this Master Agreement, Lender shall make the Initial Advance(s) to Borrower. 

(2)         Future
Advances. 

(A)         Subject
to Section 2.02(b) (Limitations on Executions) and satisfaction of the terms in the Future Advance Schedule, Borrower may request
a Future Advance. Lender is not committing in this Master Agreement to make a Future Advance and any Future Advance will be at
the option of Lender except for an Advance provided in the proviso of Section 2.02(c)(2)(B) (Future Advances) below, subject to
the requirements of such proviso and this Master Agreement. Once made, any Future Advance shall be subject to this Master Agreement
in all respects and shall be secured by the Security Instruments encumbering the Mortgaged Properties. 

(B)         Any
Future Advance shall be made in connection with the Addition of Additional Mortgaged Properties; provided, however, Borrower may
request that a Future Advance made pursuant to Section 2.02(c)(2)(A) (Future Advances) above be made without the Addition of Additional
Mortgaged Property based on decreases in the Aggregate Loan to Value Ratio and increases in the Aggregate Debt Service Coverage
Ratio (or based on the difference between (x) the Aggregate Loan to Value Ratio and Aggregate Debt Service Coverage Ratio and (y)
the Coverage and LTV Tests) as determined by Lender in accordance with the Future Advance Schedule and the Underwriting and Servicing
Requirements subject to the terms of this Section 2.02(c)(2) (Future Advances) and Section 2.02(b) (Limitations on Executions).
Such Future Advance under this paragraph (B) shall be made during the period ending on the Fifth Anniversary but not more than
once annually during the Term of this Master Agreement. 

(C)         All
Future Advances must satisfy the terms of the Future Advance Schedule and any addition of Additional Mortgaged Property shall satisfy
the terms of the Mortgaged Property Addition Schedule. 

(D)         [Intentionally
deleted.] 

(E)         [Intentionally
deleted.] 

(F)         Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Master Agreement, no Future Advance or Conversion shall be permitted unless immediately after
such Future Advance or Conversion the Advances then Outstanding will not exceed one hundred percent (100%) of the aggregate
fair market value of all real property securing such Advances (where fair market value is determined for these purposes based upon
a current Appraisal or some other commercially reasonable valuation method). 

(3)         Closing
of Future Advance. 

If the conditions
set forth in this Section 2.02 (Advances) and the Future Advance Schedule are satisfied (and, if applicable, all conditions set
forth on the Mortgaged Property Addition Schedule are satisfied), Lender shall make the requested Future Advance on an Effective
Date mutually agreed to by Lender and Borrower (or on such other date as Borrower and Lender may agree). 

Section 2.03         Advance
Terms and Payments on Advances. 

(a)          Debt
Service Payments. 

(1)         Short
Month Interest. 

If the date the
proceeds of an Advance are disbursed is any day other than the first day of the month, interest for the period beginning on the
disbursement date and ending on and including the last day of the month in which the disbursement occurs shall be payable by Borrower
on the date the Advance proceeds are disbursed. In the event that the disbursement date is not the same as the Effective Date,
then: 

(A)         the
disbursement date and the Effective Date must be in the same month, and 

(B)         the
Effective Date shall not be the first day of the month. 

(2)         Interest
Accrual and Computation; Amortization; Interest Rate Cap. 

(A)         Except
as provided in Section 2.03(a)(1) (Short Month Interest), interest shall be paid in arrears. Except as otherwise provided in this
Master Agreement, for Fixed Advances, interest shall accrue at the Interest Rate until fully paid; and for Variable Structured
ARM Advances, interest shall accrue at the Adjustable Rate until fully paid. If the Interest Accrual Method is  Actual/360, 
Borrower acknowledges and agrees that the amount allocated to interest for each month will vary depending on the actual number
of calendar days during such month.  

(B)         With
respect to any Variable Structured ARM Advances, the following provisions shall apply:  

(i)          The
Initial Adjustable Rate shall be effective until the first Rate Change Date. Thereafter, the Adjustable Rate shall change on each
Rate Change Date based on fluctuations in the Current Index. 

(ii)         Each
amortizing Monthly Debt Service Payment shall include a principal payment equal to the Fixed Monthly Principal Component. 

(iii)        Before
each Payment Change Date, Lender shall notify Borrower of any change in the Adjustable Rate and the amount of the next Monthly
Debt Service Payment. 

(iv)        If
Lender determines at any time that it has miscalculated the amount of a Monthly Debt Service Payment (whether because of a miscalculation
of the Adjustable Rate or otherwise), then Lender shall give notice to Borrower of the corrected amount of the Monthly Debt Service
Payment (and the corrected Adjustable Rate, if applicable) and (1) if the corrected amount of the Monthly Debt Service Payment
represents an increase, then Borrower shall, within thirty (30) calendar days thereafter, pay to Lender any sums that Borrower
would have otherwise been obligated to pay to Lender had the amount of the Monthly Debt Service Payment not been miscalculated,
or (2) if the corrected amount of the Monthly Debt Service Payment represents a decrease and Borrower is not otherwise in
default under any of the Loan Documents, then Borrower shall thereafter be paid the sums that Borrower would not have otherwise
been obligated to pay to Lender had the amount of the Monthly Debt Service Payment not been miscalculated. 

(v)         [Intentionally
Deleted] 

(vi)        If
required by Lender, to protect against fluctuations in interest rates during the Term of this Master Agreement, Borrower shall
enter into the Cap Security Agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the Cap Security Agreement, Borrower shall make arrangements for
a LIBOR-based interest rate cap in form and substance satisfactory to Lender with a counterparty satisfactory to Lender (  Interest
Rate Cap  ) to be in place and maintained at all times with respect to any Variable Advance which has been funded and
remains Outstanding. The seller of the Interest Rate Cap (seller and its transferees and assigns, the   Counterparty  )
shall be a financial institution meeting the minimum requirements for hedge counterparties acceptable to Lender. The Interest Rate
Cap shall have a minimum initial term of three (3) years. The minimum term for all replacement Interest Rate Caps shall be
the lesser of three (3) years or the remaining term of the Variable Advance, as further set forth in the Cap Security Agreement.
Borrower shall be required to make Monthly Deposits (as defined in the Cap Security Agreement) to be held in an Interest Rate Cap
Reserve Escrow Account (as defined in the Cap Security Agreement). As set forth in the Cap Security Agreement, Borrower agrees
to pledge its right, title, and interest in the Interest Rate Cap to Lender as additional collateral for the Indebtedness. 

Notwithstanding
the foregoing, Borrower may elect to obtain an interest rate swap in lieu of an Interest Rate Cap to satisfy the hedging requirements
set forth above. Such interest rate swap shall be with a counterparty approved by Lender and on such forms as are reasonably approved
by Lender. In connection with such interest rate swap, Borrower shall enter into a  Hedge Security Agreement  in the
form required by Fannie Mae.  

(C)         The
amortization and payment of interest (and principal, if applicable) for each Advance shall be determined at the Effective Date
of each Advance.  

(3)         Monthly
Debt Service Payments. 

Consecutive monthly
debt service installments (comprised of either interest only or principal and interest, depending on the Amortization Type), each
in the amount of the applicable Monthly Debt Service Payment for an Advance, shall be due and payable on the First Payment Date,
and on each Payment Date thereafter until the Maturity Date of such Advance, at which time all Indebtedness relating to such Advance
shall be due. Any regularly scheduled Monthly Debt Service Payment that is received by Lender before the applicable Payment Date
shall be deemed to have been received on such Payment Date solely for the purpose of calculating interest due. All payments made
by Borrower under this Master Agreement shall be made without set-off, counterclaim, or other defense. 

(4)         Payment
at Maturity. 

(A)         The
unpaid principal balance of an Advance, any Accrued Interest thereon, and all other Indebtedness relating to such Advance shall
be due and payable on the applicable Maturity Date for such Advance. 

(B)         Except
in connection with a complete repayment of all Advance(s), if Borrower pays any Advances at maturity of such Advance and requests
a Release of any Mortgaged Property, such Release shall be subject to the Release Price and release tests in the Mortgaged Property
Release Schedule. 

(5)         Maturity
Dates. 

(A)         The
Maturity Date of each Variable Advance shall be specified by Borrower for such Variable Advance, provided that such Maturity Date
shall be no earlier than the date that is the first day of the month following the date five (5) years after the Effective
Date of such Variable Advance and no later than the date that is the first day of the month following the date ten (10) years
after the Effective Date of such Variable Advance provided no Maturity Date shall exceed the date that is the first day of the
month following the date fifteen (15) years after the Initial Effective Date. 

(B)         The
Maturity Date of each Fixed Advance shall be specified by Borrower for such Fixed Advance, provided that such Maturity Date shall
be no earlier than the date that is the first day of the month following the date five (5) years after the Effective Date
for such Fixed Advance and no later than the date that is the first day of the month following the date twelve (12) years
after the Effective Date of such Fixed Advance provided no Maturity Date shall exceed the date that is the first day of the month
following the date fifteen (15) years after the Initial Effective Date. 

(6)         Interest
Rate Type; Notes. 

(A)         The
obligation of Borrower to repay each Variable Advance shall be evidenced by one or more separate Variable Notes. Each Variable
Note shall be payable to the order of Lender and shall be made in the original principal amount of such Variable Advance. 

(B)         The
obligation of Borrower to repay each Fixed Advance shall be evidenced by one or more separate Fixed Notes. The Fixed Note shall
be payable to the order of Lender and shall be made in the original principal amount of such Fixed Advance. 

(b)          Capitalization
of Accrued but Unpaid Interest. 

Any accrued and unpaid
interest on an Advance remaining past due for thirty (30) days or more may, at Lender s election, be added to and become
part of the unpaid principal balance of such Advance. 

(c)          Late
Charges. 

(1)         If
any Monthly Debt Service Payment due hereunder is not received by Lender within ten (10) days after the applicable Payment
Date, or any amount payable under this Master Agreement (other than the payment due on the applicable Maturity Date for repayment
of an Advance in full) or any other Loan Document is not received by Lender within ten (10) days after the date such amount
is due, inclusive of the date on which such amount is due, Borrower shall pay to Lender, immediately without demand by Lender,
the Late Charge. 

(2)         The
Late Charge is payable in addition to, and not in lieu of, any interest payable at the Default Rate pursuant to Section 2.03(d)
(Default Rate). 

(3)         Borrower
acknowledges and agrees that: 

(A)         its
failure to make timely payments will cause Lender to incur additional expenses in servicing and processing the Advances; 

(B)         it
is extremely difficult and impractical to determine those additional expenses; 

(C)         Lender
is entitled to be compensated for such additional expenses; and 

(D)         the
Late Charge represents a fair and reasonable estimate, taking into account all circumstances existing on the date hereof, of the
additional expenses Lender will incur by reason of any such late payment. 

(d)          Default
Rate. 

(1)         Default
interest shall be paid as follows: 

(A)         If
any amount due in respect of an Advance (other than amounts due on the Maturity Date) remains past due for thirty (30) days
or more, interest on such unpaid amount(s) shall accrue from the date payment is due at the Default Rate and shall be payable upon
demand by Lender. 

(B)         If
any Indebtedness due is not paid in full on the applicable Maturity Date, then interest shall accrue at the Default Rate on all
such unpaid amounts from such Maturity Date until fully paid and shall be payable upon demand by Lender. 

Absent a demand
by Lender, any such amounts shall be payable by Borrower in the same manner as provided for the payment of Monthly Debt Service
Payments. To the extent permitted by Applicable Law, interest shall also accrue at the Default Rate on any judgment obtained by
Lender against Borrower in connection with the Advances. To the extent Borrower or any other Person is vested with a right of redemption,
interest shall continue to accrue at the Default Rate during any redemption period until such time as the Mortgaged Property has
been redeemed. 

(2)         Borrower
acknowledges and agrees that: 

(A)         its
failure to make timely payments will cause Lender to incur additional expenses in servicing and processing the Advances; and 

(B)         in
connection with any failure to timely pay all amounts due in respect of an Advance on the applicable Maturity Date, or during the
time that any amount due in respect of an Advance is delinquent for more than thirty (30) days: 

(i)          Lender s
risk of nonpayment of the Advance will be materially increased; 

(ii)         Lender s
ability to meet its other obligations and to take advantage of other investment opportunities will be adversely impacted; 

(iii)        Lender
will incur additional costs and expenses arising from its loss of the use of the amounts due; 

(iv)        it
is extremely difficult and impractical to determine such additional costs and expenses; 

(v)         Lender
is entitled to be compensated for such additional risks, costs, and expenses; and 

(vi)        the
increase from the Interest Rate to the Default Rate represents a fair and reasonable estimate of the additional risks, costs, and
expenses Lender will incur by reason of Borrower s delinquent payment and the additional compensation Lender is entitled
to receive for the increased risks of nonpayment associated with a delinquency on the Advance (taking into account all circumstances
existing on the applicable Effective Date). 

(e)          Address
for Payments. 

All payments due pursuant
to the Loan Documents shall be payable at Lender s Payment Address, or such other place and in such manner as may be designated
from time to time by written notice to Borrower by Lender. 

(f)          Application
of Payments. 

Subject to the terms of
Section (d) (Application of Release Price) of the Mortgaged Property Release Schedule, if at any time Lender receives, from Borrower
or otherwise, any payment in respect of the Indebtedness that is less than all amounts due and payable at such time, then Lender
may apply such payment to amounts then due and payable in any manner and in any order determined by Lender or hold in suspense
and not apply such amount at Lender s election. Neither Lender s acceptance of a payment that is less than all amounts
then due and payable, nor Lender s application of, or suspension of the application of, such payment, shall constitute or
be deemed to constitute either a waiver of the unpaid amounts or an accord and satisfaction. Notwithstanding the application of
any such amount to the Indebtedness, Borrower s obligations under this Master Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall
remain unchanged. 

Section 2.04         Prepayment;
Prepayment Lockout; Prepayment Premium. 

(a)          Subject
to the terms and conditions of the applicable Prepayment Premium Schedule and the requirements relating to application of the Release
Price set forth in the Mortgaged Property Release Schedule, Notes are prepayable in whole or in part, provided that Borrower shall
not make a voluntary full or partial prepayment of a Note during any Prepayment Lockout Period, if any. Except as expressly provided
in this Master Agreement (including as provided in the Prepayment Premium Schedule applicable to such Note), a Prepayment Premium
calculated in accordance with the Prepayment Premium Schedule applicable to such Note shall be payable in connection with any prepayment
of such Note. 

(b)          If
a Prepayment Lockout Period applies to the applicable Note, and during such Prepayment Lockout Period Lender accelerates the unpaid
principal balance of the Note or otherwise applies collateral held by Lender to the repayment of any portion of the unpaid principal
balance of the Note, the Prepayment Premium shall be due and payable and equal to the amount obtained by multiplying the percentage
indicated (if at all) in the Prepayment Premium Schedule for such Note by the amount of principal being prepaid at the time of
such acceleration or application. 

(c)          In
connection with any such voluntary prepayment, Borrower acknowledges and agrees that interest shall always be calculated and paid
through the last day of the month in which the prepayment occurs (even if the Permitted Prepayment Date for such month is not the
last day of such month, or if Lender approves prepayment on an Intended Prepayment Date that is not a Permitted Prepayment Date).
Borrower further acknowledges that Lender is not required to accept a voluntary prepayment of a Note on any day other than a Permitted
Prepayment Date. However, if Lender does approve an Intended Prepayment Date that is not a Permitted Prepayment Date and accepts
a prepayment on such Intended Prepayment Date, such prepayment shall be deemed to be received on the immediately following Permitted
Prepayment Date. If Borrower fails to prepay the applicable Note (or such portion of the Note as is intended to be prepaid) on
the Intended Prepayment Date for any reason (including on any Intended Prepayment Date that is approved by Lender) and such failure
either continues for five (5) Business Days, or into the following month, Lender shall have the right to recalculate the payoff
amount. If Borrower prepays a Note either in the following month or more than five (5) Business Days after the Intended Prepayment
Date that was approved by Lender, Lender shall also have the right to recalculate the payoff amount based upon the amount of such
payment and the date such payment was received by Lender. Borrower shall immediately pay to Lender any additional amounts required
by any such recalculation. 

(d)          After
receipt of a partial prepayment, Lender shall re-calculate the Monthly Debt Service Payment based upon the remaining unpaid principal
balance of the applicable Note for each subsequent monthly debt service installment due under such Note. For amortizing Advances,
the subsequent Monthly Debt Service Payments shall be calculated by amortizing the remaining unpaid principal balance of the applicable
Note over the Remaining Amortization Period utilizing the Fixed Rate and the Interest Accrual Method set forth in the applicable
Schedule of Advance Terms. Lender shall notify Borrower of the new required Monthly Debt Service Payment following receipt of a
partial prepayment and Borrower shall execute any amendment requested by Lender to evidence such new required monthly installment(s). 

Section 2.05         Acceleration
of Advances. 

Upon acceleration of any
Advance in accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents, Borrower shall pay to Lender: 

(a)          the
entire unpaid principal balance of the Advances; 

(b)          all
Accrued Interest (calculated through the last day of the month in which the acceleration occurs); 

(c)          the
Prepayment Premium, if any; and 

(d)          all
other Indebtedness. 

Section 2.06         Application
of Collateral. 

Any application by Lender
of any collateral or other security to the repayment of all or any portion of the unpaid principal balance of the Advances prior
to the Maturity Date in accordance with the Loan Documents shall be deemed to be a prepayment by Borrower. Any such prepayment
shall require the payment to Lender by Borrower of the Prepayment Premium calculated on the amount being prepaid in accordance
with this Master Agreement and applied in accordance with Section (d) (Application of Release Price) of the Mortgaged Property
Release Schedule. 

Section 2.07         Casualty
and Condemnation. 

Notwithstanding any provision
of this Master Agreement to the contrary, no Prepayment Premium shall be payable with respect to any prepayment occurring as a
result of the application of any insurance proceeds or amounts received in connection with a Condemnation Action in accordance
with this Master Agreement. 

Section 2.08         No
Effect on Payment Obligations. 

Unless otherwise expressly
provided in this Master Agreement, any prepayment required by any Loan Document of less than the entire unpaid principal balance
of the Advance(s) shall not extend or postpone the due date of any subsequent Monthly Debt Service Payments, Monthly Replacement
Reserve Deposit, or other payment. 

Section 2.09         Loss
Resulting from Prepayment. 

In any circumstance in
which a Prepayment Premium is due under this Master Agreement, Borrower acknowledges that: 

(a)          any
prepayment of the unpaid principal balance of any Advance, whether voluntary or involuntary, or following the occurrence of an
Event of Default by Borrower, will result in Lender s incurring loss, including reinvestment loss, additional risk, expense,
and frustration or impairment of Lender s ability to meet its commitments to third parties; 

(b)          it
is extremely difficult and impractical to ascertain the extent of such losses, risks and damages; 

(c)          the
formula for calculating the Prepayment Premium represents a reasonable estimate of the losses, risks, and damages Lender will incur
as a result of a prepayment; and 

(d)          the
provisions regarding the Prepayment Premium contained in this Master Agreement are a material part of the consideration for this
Master Agreement, and that the terms of this Master Agreement are in other respects more favorable to Borrower as a result of Borrower s
voluntary agreement to such prepayment provisions. 

Section 2.10         Collateral
Events 

(a)          Conversion
from Variable Note to Fixed Note. 

Subject to and in accordance
with the terms and conditions of the Conversion Schedule, Borrower shall have the right, from time to time during the Conversion
Availability Period, to convert all or any portion of a Variable Note to a Fixed Note. 

(b)          Right
to Obtain Releases of Mortgaged Property.

Appraisal or some other commercially reasonable valuation method as determined by Lender).

in Borrower, Affiliated Property Operator, Guarantor, or Key Principal) in connection with on-going financial or other reporting
required by the Loan Documents, or any request for action or consent by Lender; 

(8)         failure
to cause the renewal, continuation, extension, or maintenance of all Licenses or, if any Licenses are to be transferred to a transferee
approved by Lender, failure to cause such Licenses to be transferred or reissued within the period of time required under Applicable
Law and to provide to Lender written notice of such transfer including copies of the newly issued Licenses;  

(9)         revocation

reasonably be cured within such thirty (30) day period and Borrower shall have commenced to cure such breach within such thirty (30)
day period and thereafter diligently and expeditiously proceeds to cure the same, such thirty (30) day period shall be extended
for so long as it shall require Borrower in the exercise of due diligence to cure such breach, it being agreed that no such extension
shall be for a period in excess of sixty (60) days for any individual breach. 

Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Borrower shall not have personal liability under clauses (1), (3) or (5) above to the extent that Borrower lacks the legal right
to direct the disbursement of the applicable funds due to an involuntary Bankruptcy Event with respect to Borrower that occurs
without the consent, collusion, or active participation of Affiliated Property Operator, Guarantor, Key Principal or any Borrower
Affiliate. 

(b)          Full
Personal Liability (Full Recourse). 

Borrower shall be personally
liable to Lender for the repayment of all of the Indebtedness, and the Advances shall be fully recourse to Borrower, upon the occurrence
of any of the following: 

(1)         failure
to comply with each of the Single Purpose requirements of: 

(A)         Section
4.02(d)(1), (2), (5) and (6) (Borrower Status   Covenants   Single Purpose Status) of this Master Agreement; and 

(B)         Section
4.02(d)(3), (4) and (7)-(15) (Borrower Status   Covenants   Single Purpose Status) of this Master Agreement and a court
of competent jurisdiction holds or determines that such failure or combination of failures is the basis, in whole or in part, for
the substantive consolidation of the assets and liabilities of Borrower or any general partner or sole member of Borrower with
the assets and liabilities of a debtor pursuant to Title 11 of the Bankruptcy Code; 

(2)         a
Transfer (other than a conveyance of a Mortgaged Property at a Foreclosure Event pursuant to the Security Instrument and this Master
Agreement) that is not permitted under this Master Agreement or any other Loan Document; 

(3)         the
occurrence of any Bankruptcy Event with respect to Borrower, Key Principal, Guarantor, or Affiliated Property Operator (other than
an acknowledgement in writing as described in clause (b) of the definition of  Bankruptcy Event ); provided, however,
in the event of an involuntary Bankruptcy Event with respect to Borrower, Key Principal, Guarantor, or Affiliated Property Operator,
Borrower shall only be personally liable if such involuntary Bankruptcy Event occurs with the consent, collusion or active participation
of Borrower, Affiliated Property Operator, Guarantor, Key Principal, or any Borrower Affiliate; 

(4)         fraud,
written material misrepresentation, or material omission by Borrower, Affiliated Property Operator, Guarantor, Key Principal, or
any officer, director, partner, manager, member, shareholder, or trustee of Borrower, Affiliated Property Operator, Guarantor,
or Key Principal   (not including shareholders of HTI who do not otherwise Control or have a direct Ownership Interest in
Borrower, Affiliated Property Operator, Guarantor, or Key Principal) in connection with any application for or creation of the
Indebtedness; or 

(5)         fraud,

Key Principal, or any officer, director, partner, manager, member, shareholder, or trustee of Borrower, Affiliated Property Operator,
Guarantor, or Key Principal (not including shareholders of HTI who do not otherwise Control or have a direct Ownership Interest
in Borrower, Affiliated Property Operator, Guarantor, or Key Principal) in connection with on-going financial or other reporting
required by the Loan Documents, or any request for action or consent by Lender. 

Section 3.03         Personal
Liability for Indemnity Obligations. 

Borrower shall be personally
and fully liable to Lender for Borrower s indemnity obligations under Section 13.01(e) (Replacement Reserves and Repairs
  Indemnification) of this Master Agreement, the Environmental Indemnity Agreement and any other express indemnity obligations
provided by Borrower under any Loan Document. Borrower s liability for such indemnity obligations shall not be limited by
the amount of the Indebtedness, the repayment of the Indebtedness, or otherwise, provided that Borrower s liability for such
indemnities shall not include any loss caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of Lender as determined by a court
of competent jurisdiction pursuant to a final non-appealable court order. 

Section 3.04         Lender s
Right to Forego Rights Against Mortgaged Property. 

To the extent that Borrower
has personal liability under this Master Agreement or any other Loan Document, Lender may exercise its rights against Borrower
personally to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law without regard to whether Lender has exercised any rights against
any Mortgaged Property or any other security, or pursued any rights against Guarantor, or pursued any other rights available to
Lender under this Master Agreement, any other Loan Document, or Applicable Law. For purposes of this Section 3.04 (Lender s
Right to Forego Rights Against Mortgaged Property) only, the term  Mortgaged Property  shall not include any funds
that have been applied by Borrower or Property Operator as required or permitted by this Master Agreement prior to the occurrence
of an Event of Default, or that Borrower was unable to apply as required or permitted by this Master Agreement because of a Bankruptcy
Event with respect to Borrower. To the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, in any action to enforce Borrower s personal
liability under this Article 3 (Personal Liability), Borrower waives any right to set off the value of a Mortgaged Property against
such personal liability. 

Section 3.05         Borrower
Agency Provisions. 

(a)          Each
Borrower shall irrevocably designate Borrower Agent to be its agent and in such capacity to receive on behalf of Borrower all proceeds,
receive all notices on behalf of Borrower under this Master Agreement, make all requests under this Master Agreement, and execute,
deliver, and receive all instruments, certificates, requests, documents, amendments, writings, and further assurances now or hereafter
required hereunder, on behalf of such Borrower, and hereby authorizes Lender to pay over all proceeds hereunder in accordance with
the request of Borrower Agent. Each Borrower hereby acknowledges that all notices required to be delivered by Lender to any Borrower
shall be delivered to Borrower Agent and thereby shall be deemed to have been received by such Borrower. 

(b)          The
handling of this Master Agreement as a co-borrowing facility with a Borrower Agent in the manner set forth in this Master Agreement
is solely as an accommodation to each of Borrower and Guarantor and is at their mutual request. Lender shall not incur liability
to Borrower or Guarantor as a result thereof. To induce Lender to do so and in consideration thereof, each Borrower hereby indemnifies
Lender and holds Lender harmless from and against any and all liabilities, expenses, losses, damages, and claims of damage or injury
asserted against Lender by any Person arising from or incurred by reason of Borrower Agent handling of the financing arrangements
of Borrower as provided herein, reliance by Lender on any written request or instruction from Borrower Agent or any other action
taken by Lender with respect to this Section 3.05 (Borrower Agency Provisions) except due to willful misconduct or gross negligence
of the indemnified party as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to a final, non-appealable court order. 

Section 3.06         Joint
and Several Obligation; Cross-Guaranty. 

Notwithstanding anything
contained in this Master Agreement or the other Loan Documents to the contrary (but subject to the provisions of Section 3.01 (Non-Recourse
Liability; Exceptions), Section 3.02(a) (Personal Liability Based on Lender s Loss (Partial Recourse)) and Section 3.02(b)
(Full Personal Liability (Full Recourse)), the last sentence of this Section 3.06 (Joint and Several Obligation; Cross-Guaranty)
and the provisions of Section 3.13 (Maximum Liability of Each Borrower), each Borrower shall have joint and several liability for
the Indebtedness. Notwithstanding the intent of all of the parties to this Master Agreement that the Indebtedness of each Borrower
under this Master Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall be joint and several obligations of each Borrower, each Borrower,
on a joint and several basis, hereby irrevocably guarantees on a non-recourse basis, subject to the exceptions to non-recourse
provisions of Section 3.01 (Non-Recourse Liability; Exceptions), Section 3.02(a) (Personal Liability Based on Lender s Loss
(Partial Recourse)) and Section 3.02(b) (Full Personal Liability (Full Recourse)), to Lender and its successors and assigns, the
full and prompt payment (whether at stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) and performance of, all Indebtedness owed or
hereafter owing to Lender by each other Borrower. Each Borrower agrees that its non-recourse guaranty obligation hereunder is an
unconditional guaranty of payment and performance and not merely a guaranty of collection. The Indebtedness of each Borrower under
this Master Agreement shall not be subject to any counterclaim, set-off, recoupment, deduction, cross-claim, or defense based upon
any claim any Borrower may have against Lender or any other Borrower. 

Section 3.07         Waivers
With Respect to Other Borrower Secured Obligation. 

To the extent that a Security
Instrument or any other Loan Document executed by one Borrower secures an Obligation of another Borrower (the   Other Borrower
Secured Obligation  ), or to the extent that a Borrower has guaranteed the debt of another Borrower pursuant to Article
3 (Personal Liability), Borrower who executed such Loan Document or guaranteed such debt (the   Waiving Borrower  )
hereby agrees to the extent permitted by law, to the provisions of this Section 3.07 (Waivers with Respect to Other Borrower Secured
Obligation). To the extent that any Mortgaged Properties are located in California, and to the extent permitted by law, the references
to the California statutes below shall apply to this Master Agreement and any California Security Instrument securing or encumbering
a Mortgaged Property located in California; otherwise the California statutes referenced below shall have no effect on this Master
Agreement or any other Loan Document. All references in Article 3 (Personal Liability) to California law are only applicable if
any Mortgaged Property is located in California. To the maximum extent permitted by Applicable Law: 

(a)          The
Waiving Borrower hereby waives any right it may now or hereafter have to require the beneficiary, assignee, or other secured party
under such Loan Document, as a condition to the exercise of any remedy or other right against it thereunder or under any other
Loan Document executed by the Waiving Borrower in connection with the Other Borrower Secured Obligation: (1) to proceed against
any other Borrower or any other Person, or against any other collateral assigned to Lender by any Borrower or any other Person;
(2) to pursue any other right or remedy in Lender s power; (3) to give notice of the time, place, or terms of any public
or private sale of real or personal property collateral assigned to Lender by any other Borrower or any other Person, or otherwise
to comply with Section 9615 of the California Commercial Code (as modified or recodified from time to time) with respect to
any such personal property collateral located in the State of California; or (4) to make or give (except as otherwise expressly
provided in the Security Documents) any presentment, demand, protest, notice of dishonor, notice of protest, or other demand or
notice of any kind in connection with the Other Borrower Secured Obligation or any collateral for the Other Borrower Secured Obligation. 

(b)          The
Waiving Borrower hereby waives any defense it may now or hereafter have that relates to: (1) any disability or other defense
of any other Borrower or any other Person; (2) the cessation, from any cause other than full performance, of the Other Borrower
Secured Obligation; (3) the application of the proceeds of the Other Borrower Secured Obligation, by any other Borrower or any
other Person, for purposes other than the purposes represented to the Waiving Borrower by any other Borrower or any other Person,
or otherwise intended or understood by the Waiving Borrower or any other Borrower; (4) any act or omission by Lender which directly
or indirectly results in or contributes to the release of any other Borrower or any other Person or any collateral for any Other
Borrower Secured Obligation; (5) the unenforceability or invalidity of any Security Document or Loan Document (other than the Security
Instrument executed by the Waiving Borrower that secures the Other Borrower Secured Obligation) or guaranty with respect to any
Other Borrower Secured Obligation, or the lack of perfection or continuing perfection or lack of priority of any Lien (other than
the Lien of the Security Instrument executed by the Waiving Borrower that secures the Other Borrower Secured Obligation) which
secures any Other Borrower Secured Obligation; (6) any failure of Lender to marshal assets in favor of the Waiving Borrower or
any other Person; (7) any modification of any Other Borrower Secured Obligation, including any renewal, extension, acceleration,
or increase in interest rate; (8) any and all rights and defenses arising out of an election of remedies by Lender, even though
that election of remedies, such as a nonjudicial foreclosure with respect to security for a guaranteed obligation, has destroyed
the Waiving Borrower s rights of subrogation and reimbursement against the principal by the operation of Section 580d
of the California Code of Civil Procedure or otherwise; (9) any law which provides that the obligation of a surety or guarantor
must neither be larger in amount nor in other respects more burdensome than that of the principal or which reduces a surety s
or guarantor s obligation in proportion to the principal obligation; (10) any failure of Lender to file or enforce a claim
in any bankruptcy or other proceeding with respect to any Person; (11) the election by Lender, in any bankruptcy proceeding of
any Person, of the application or non-application of Section 1111(b)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code; (12) any extension of credit
or the grant of any lien under Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code; (13) any use of cash collateral under Section 363
of the Bankruptcy Code; or (14) any agreement or stipulation with respect to the provision of adequate protection in any bankruptcy
proceeding of any Person. The Waiving Borrower further waives any and all rights and defenses that it may have because the Other
Borrower Secured Obligation is secured by real property; this means, among other things, that: (A) Lender may collect from the
Waiving Borrower without first foreclosing on any real or personal property collateral pledged by any other Borrower; (B) if Lender
forecloses on any real property collateral pledged by any other Borrower, then (i) the amount of the Other Borrower Secured Obligation
may be reduced only by the price for which that collateral is sold at the foreclosure sale, even if the collateral is worth more
than the sale price, and (ii) Lender may foreclose on the real property encumbered by the Security Instrument executed by the Waiving
Borrower and securing the Other Borrower Secured Obligation, or otherwise collect from the Waiving Borrower, even if Lender, by
foreclosing on the real property collateral of any one or more of the other Borrowers, has destroyed any right the Waiving Borrower
may have to collect from such other Borrowers. Subject to the last sentence of Section 3.06 (Joint and Several Obligation; Cross-Guaranty),
the foregoing sentence is an unconditional and irrevocable waiver of any rights and defenses the Waiving Borrower may have because
the Other Borrower Secured Obligation is secured by real property. These rights and defenses being waived by the Waiving Borrower
include, but are not limited to, any rights or defenses based upon Section 580a, 580b, 580d, or 726 of the California Code of Civil
Procedure. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing or any other provision hereof, the Waiving Borrower further expressly
waives, except as provided in Section 3.07(g) (Waivers with Respect to Other Borrower Secured Obligation) below, to the extent
permitted by law any and all rights and defenses that might otherwise be available to it under California Civil Code Sections 2787
to 2855, inclusive, 2899 and 3433, or under California Code of Civil Procedure Sections 580a, 580b, 580d, and 726, or any of such
sections; 

(c)          The
Waiving Borrower hereby waives any and all benefits and defenses under California Civil Code Section 2810 and agrees that by doing
so the Security Instrument executed by the Waiving Borrower and securing the Other Borrower Secured Obligation shall be and remain
in full force and effect even if one or more of the other Borrowers had no liability at the time of incurring the Other Borrower
Secured Obligation, or thereafter ceases to be liable. The Waiving Borrower hereby waives any and all benefits and defenses under
California Civil Code Section 2809 and agrees that by doing so the Waiving Borrower s liability may be larger in amount and
more burdensome than that of any one or more of the other Borrowers. The Waiving Borrower hereby waives the benefit of all principles
or provisions of law that are or might be in conflict with the terms of any of its waivers, and agrees that the Waiving Borrower s
waivers shall not be affected by any circumstances that might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge of a surety or
a guarantor. The Waiving Borrower hereby waives the benefits of any right of discharge and all other rights and defenses under
any and all statutes or other laws relating to guarantors or sureties, to the fullest extent permitted by law, diligence in collecting
the Other Borrower Secured Obligation, presentment, demand for payment, protest, all notices with respect to the Other Borrower
Secured Obligation that may be required by statute, rule of law, or otherwise to preserve Lender s rights against the Waiving
Borrower hereunder, including notice of acceptance, notice of any amendment of the Loan Documents evidencing the Other Borrower
Secured Obligation, notice of the occurrence of any default or Event of Default, notice of intent to accelerate, notice of acceleration,
notice of dishonor, notice of foreclosure, notice of protest, notice of the incurring by the other Borrower of any obligation or
indebtedness and all rights to require Lender to (1) proceed against the other Borrower, (2) proceed against any general partner
of the other Borrower, (3) proceed against or exhaust any collateral held by Lender to secure the Other Borrower Secured Obligation,
or (4) if the other Borrower is a partnership, pursue any other remedy it may have against the other Borrower, or any general partner
of the other Borrower, including any and all benefits under California Civil Code Sections 2845, 2849, and 2850; 

(d)          The
Waiving Borrower understands that the exercise by Lender of certain rights and remedies contained in a Security Instrument executed
by any other Borrower (such as a nonjudicial foreclosure sale) may affect or eliminate the Waiving Borrower s right of subrogation
against such other Borrower and that the Waiving Borrower may therefore incur a partially or totally nonreimburseable liability.
Nevertheless, the Waiving Borrower hereby authorizes and empowers Lender to exercise, in its sole and absolute discretion, any
right or remedy, or any combination thereof, that may then be available, since it is the intent and purpose of the Waiving Borrower
that its waivers shall be absolute, independent and unconditional under any and all circumstances; 

(e)          In
accordance with Section 2856 of the California Civil Code, the Waiving Borrower also waives any right or defense based upon
an election of remedies by Lender, even though such election (e.g., nonjudicial foreclosure with respect to any collateral held
by Lender to secure repayment of the Other Borrower Secured Obligation) destroys or otherwise impairs the subrogation rights of
the Waiving Borrower to any right to proceed against one or more of the other Borrowers for reimbursement by operation of Section 580d
of the California Code of Civil Procedure or otherwise; 

(f)          Subject
to the last sentence of Section 3.06 (Joint and Several Obligation; Cross-Guaranty), in accordance with Section 2856 of the
California Civil Code, the Waiving Borrower waives any and all other rights and defenses available to the Waiving Borrower by reason
of Sections 2787 through 2855, inclusive, of the California Civil Code, including any and all rights or defenses the Waiving
Borrower may have by reason of protection afforded to one or more of the other Borrowers with respect to the applicable Other Borrower
Secured Obligation pursuant to the antideficiency or other laws of the State of California limiting or discharging such Other Borrower
Secured Obligation, including Sections 580a, 580b, 580d, and 726 of the California Code of Civil Procedure; 

(g)          In
accordance with Section 2856 of the California Civil Code and pursuant to any other Applicable Law, the Waiving Borrower agrees
to withhold the exercise of any and all subrogation, contribution, and reimbursement rights against all other Borrowers, against
any other Person, and against any collateral or security for the Other Borrower Secured Obligation, including any such rights pursuant
to Sections 2847 and 2848 of the California Civil Code, until the Other Borrower Secured Obligation has been indefeasibly
paid and satisfied in full, all obligations owed to Lender under the Loan Documents have been fully performed, and Lender has released,
transferred or disposed of all of its right, title, and interest in such collateral or security; 

(h)          Each
Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that, notwithstanding Section 3.07(g) (Waivers with Respect to Other Borrower
Secured Obligation) hereof, in the event, and to the extent, that its agreement and waiver set forth in Section 3.07(g) (Waivers
with Respect to Other Borrower Secured Obligation) is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be void or voidable for any
reason and such Borrower has any subrogation or other rights against any other Borrower, any such claims, direct or indirect, that
such Borrower may have by subrogation rights or other form of reimbursement, contribution, or indemnity, against any other Borrower
or to any security or any such Borrower, shall be, and such rights, claims, and indebtedness are hereby, deferred, postponed, and
fully subordinated in time and right of payment to the prior payment, performance, and satisfaction in full of the Indebtedness.
Until payment and performance in full with interest (including post-petition interest in any case under any chapter of the Bankruptcy
Code) of the Indebtedness, each Borrower agrees not to accept any payment or satisfaction of any kind of Indebtedness of any other
Borrower in respect of any such subrogation rights arising by virtue of payments made pursuant to this Article 3 (Personal Liability),
and hereby assigns such rights or indebtedness to Lender, including (1) the right to file proofs of claim and to vote thereon in
connection with any case under any chapter of the Bankruptcy Code and (2) the right to vote on any plan of reorganization. In the
event that any payment on account of any such subrogation rights shall be received by any Borrower in violation of the foregoing,
such payment shall be held in trust for the benefit of Lender, and any amount so collected must be turned over to Lender for, at
Lender s option, application to the Indebtedness; and 

(i)          At
any time without notice to the Waiving Borrower, and without affecting or prejudicing the right of Lender to proceed against the
Collateral described in any Loan Document executed by the Waiving Borrower and securing the Other Borrower Secured Obligation,
(1) the time for payment of the principal of or interest on, or the performance of, the Other Borrower Secured Obligation may be
extended or the Other Borrower Secured Obligation may be renewed in whole or in part; (2) the time for any other Borrower s
performance of or compliance with any covenant or agreement contained in the Loan Documents evidencing the Other Borrower Secured
Obligation, whether presently existing or hereinafter entered into, may be extended or such performance or compliance may be waived;
(3) the maturity of the Other Borrower Secured Obligation may be accelerated as provided in the related Note or any other related
Loan Document; (4) the related Note or any other related Loan Document may be modified or amended by Lender and the applicable
other Borrower in any respect, including an increase in the principal amount; and (5) any security for the Other Borrower Secured
Obligation may be modified, exchanged, surrendered or otherwise dealt with or additional security may be pledged or mortgaged for
the Other Borrower Secured Obligation. 

(j)          It
is agreed among each Borrower and Lender that all of the foregoing waivers are of the essence of the transaction contemplated by
this Master Agreement and the Loan Documents and that but for the provisions of this Article 3 (Personal Liability) and such waivers
Lender would decline to enter into this Master Agreement. 

Section 3.08         No
Impairment. 

Each Borrower agrees that
the provisions of this Article 3 (Personal Liability) are for the benefit of Lender and its successors and assigns, and nothing
herein contained shall impair, as between any other Borrower and Lender, the obligations of such other Borrower under the Loan
Documents. 

Section 3.09         Election
of Remedies. 

(a)          Lender,
in its discretion, may (1) bring suit against any one or more Borrowers, jointly and severally, without any requirement that Lender
first proceed against any other Borrower or any other Person; (2) compromise or settle with any one or more Borrowers, or any other
Person, for such consideration as Lender may deem proper; (3) release one or more Borrowers, or any other Person, from liability;
and (4) otherwise deal with any Borrower and any other Person, or any one or more of them, in any manner, or resort to any of the
Collateral at any time held by it for performance of the Indebtedness or any other source or means of obtaining payment of the
Indebtedness, and no such action shall impair the rights of Lender to collect from any Borrower any amount guaranteed by any Borrower
under this Article 3 (Personal Liability). 

(b)          If,
in the exercise of any of its rights and remedies, Lender shall forfeit any of its rights or remedies, including its rights to
enter a deficiency judgment against any Borrower or any other Person, whether because of any Applicable Law pertaining to  election
of remedies  or the like, each Borrower hereby consents to the fullest extent permitted by law to such action by Lender and
waives any claim based upon such action, even if such action by Lender shall result in a full or partial loss of any rights of
subrogation that each Borrower might otherwise have had but for such action by Lender. Any election of remedies that results in
the denial or impairment of the right of Lender to seek a deficiency judgment against any Borrower shall not impair any other Borrower s
obligation to pay the full amount of the Indebtedness. In the event Lender shall bid at any foreclosure or trustee s sale
or at any private sale permitted by law or any of the Loan Documents, Lender may bid all or less than the amount of the Indebtedness
and the amount of such bid need not be paid by Lender but shall be credited against the Indebtedness. The amount of the successful
bid at any such sale, whether Lender or any other party is the successful bidder, shall be conclusively deemed to be the fair market
value of the Collateral and the difference between such bid amount and the remaining balance of the Indebtedness shall be conclusively
deemed to be the amount of the Indebtedness guaranteed by each Borrower under this Article 3 (Personal Liability), notwithstanding
that any present or future law or court decision or ruling may have the effect of reducing the amount of any deficiency claim to
which Lender might otherwise be entitled but for such bidding at any such sale. 

Section 3.10         Subordination
of Other Obligations. 

(a)          Each
Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that all amounts payable from time to time to such Borrower by any other
Borrower pursuant to any agreement, whether secured or unsecured, whether of principal, interest, or otherwise, other than the
amounts referred to in this Article 3 (Personal Liability) (collectively, the   Subordinated Obligations  ), shall
be and such rights, claims, and indebtedness are, hereby deferred, postponed, and fully subordinated in time and right of payment
to the prior payment, performance, and satisfaction in full of the Indebtedness; provided, however, that payments may be received
by any Borrower in accordance with, and only in accordance with, the provisions of Section 3.10 (Subordination of Other Obligations)
hereof. 

(b)          Until
the Indebtedness has been finally paid in full or fully performed and all the Loan Documents have been terminated, each Borrower
irrevocably and unconditionally agrees it will not ask, demand, sue for, take, or receive, directly or indirectly, by set-off,
redemption, purchase, or in any other manner whatsoever, any payment with respect to, or any security or guaranty for, the whole
or any part of the Subordinated Obligations, and in issuing documents, instruments, or agreements of any kind evidencing the Subordinated
Obligations, each Borrower hereby agrees that it will not receive any payment of any kind on account of the Subordinated Obligations,
so long as any of the Indebtedness is outstanding or any of the terms and conditions of any of the Loan Documents are in effect;
provided, however, that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if no Potential Event of Default or Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing under any of the Loan Documents, then payments may be received by such Borrower in respect
of the Subordinated Obligations in accordance with the stated terms thereof. Except as aforesaid, each Borrower agrees not to accept
any payment or satisfaction of any kind of indebtedness of any other Borrower in respect of the Subordinated Obligations and hereby
assigns such rights or indebtedness to Fannie Mae, including the right to file proofs of claim and to vote thereon in connection
with any case under any chapter of the Bankruptcy Code, including the right to vote on any plan of reorganization. In the event
that any payment on account of Subordinated Obligations shall be received by any Borrower in violation of the foregoing, such payment
shall be held in trust for the benefit of Lender, and any amount so collected shall be turned over to Lender upon demand. 

Section 3.11         Insolvency
and Liability of Other Borrower. 

So long as any of the Indebtedness
is Outstanding, if a petition under any chapter of the Bankruptcy Code is filed by or against any Borrower (the   Subject
Borrower  ), each other Borrower (each, an   Other Borrower  ) agrees to file all claims against the
Subject Borrower in any bankruptcy or other proceeding in which the filing of claims is required by law in connection with indebtedness
owed by the Subject Borrower and to assign to Lender all rights thereunder up to the amount of such indebtedness. In all such cases,
the Person or Persons authorized to pay such claims shall pay to Lender the full amount thereof and Lender agrees to pay such Other
Borrower any amounts received in excess of the amount necessary to pay the Indebtedness. Each Other Borrower hereby assigns to
Lender all of such Other Borrower s rights to all such payments to which such Other Borrower would otherwise be entitled
but not to exceed the full amount of the Indebtedness. In the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing, any such payment shall
be received by any Other Borrower before the Indebtedness shall have been finally paid in full, such payment shall be held in trust
for the benefit of and shall be paid over to Lender upon demand. Furthermore, notwithstanding the foregoing, the liability of each
Borrower hereunder shall in no way be affected by: 

(a)          the
release or discharge of any Other Borrower in any creditors  receivership, bankruptcy, or other proceedings; or 

(b)          the
impairment, limitation, or modification of the liability of any Other Borrower or the estate of any Other Borrower in bankruptcy
resulting from the operation of any present or future provisions of any chapter of the Bankruptcy Code or other statute or from
the decision in any court. 

Section 3.12         Preferences,
Fraudulent Conveyances, Etc. 

If Lender is required to
refund, or voluntarily refunds, any payment received from any Borrower because such payment is or may be avoided, invalidated,
declared fraudulent, set aside, or determined to be void or voidable as a preference, fraudulent conveyance, impermissible setoff,
or a diversion of trust funds under the Insolvency Laws or for any similar reason, including any judgment, order, or decree of
any court or administrative body having jurisdiction over any Borrower or any of its property, or upon or as a result of the appointment
of a receiver, intervenor, custodian, or conservator of, or trustee or similar officer for, any Borrower or any substantial part
of its property, or otherwise, or any statement or compromise of any claim effected by Lender with any Borrower or any other claimant
(a   Rescinded Payment  ), then each Other Borrower s liability to Lender shall continue in full force and
effect, or each Other Borrower s liability to Lender shall be reinstated and renewed, as the case may be, with the same effect
and to the same extent as if the Rescinded Payment had not been received by Lender, notwithstanding the cancellation or termination
of any of the Loan Documents, and regardless of whether Lender contested the order requiring the return of such payment. In addition,
each Other Borrower shall pay, or reimburse Lender for, all expenses (including all reasonable attorneys  fees, court costs,
and related disbursements) incurred by Lender in the defense of any claim that a payment received by Lender in respect of all or
any part of the Indebtedness must be refunded. The provisions of this Section 3.12 (Preferences, Fraudulent Conveyances, Etc.)
shall survive the termination of the Loan Documents and any satisfaction and discharge of any Borrower by virtue of any payment,
court order, or any federal or state law. 

Section 3.13         Maximum
Liability of Each Borrower. 

Notwithstanding anything
contained in this Master Agreement or any other Loan Document to the contrary, if the obligations of any Borrower under this Master
Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents or any Security Instruments granted by any Borrower are determined to exceed the reasonably
equivalent value received by such Borrower in exchange for such obligations or grant of such Security Instruments under any Fraudulent
Transfer Law (as hereinafter defined), then the liability of such Borrower shall be limited to a maximum aggregate amount equal
to the largest amount that would not render its obligations under this Master Agreement or all the other Loan Documents subject
to avoidance as a fraudulent transfer or conveyance under Section 548 of Title 11 of the United States Code or any applicable
provisions of comparable state law (collectively, the   Fraudulent Transfer Laws  ), in each case after giving
effect to all other liabilities of such Borrower, contingent or otherwise, that are relevant under the Fraudulent Transfer Laws
(specifically excluding, however, any liabilities of such Borrower in respect of Indebtedness to any other Borrower or any other
Person that is an affiliate of the other Borrower to the extent that such Indebtedness would be discharged in an amount equal to
the amount paid by such Borrower in respect of the Indebtedness) and after giving effect (as assets) to the value (as determined
under the applicable provisions of the Fraudulent Transfer Laws) of any rights to subrogation, reimbursement, indemnification,
or contribution of such Borrower pursuant to Applicable Law or pursuant to the terms of any agreement including the Contribution
Agreement. 

Section 3.14         Liability
Cumulative. 

The liability of each Borrower
under this Article 3 (Personal Liability) is in addition to and shall be cumulative with all liabilities of such Borrower to Lender
under this Master Agreement and all the other Loan Documents to which such Borrower is a party or in respect of any Indebtedness
of any other Borrower.

all times maintain records sufficient to demonstrate compliance with the provisions of this Section 6.02(e) (Compliance with Laws); 

(5)         promptly
after Borrower s or Property Operator s receipt or notification thereof, provide Lender copies of any building code
or zoning violation from any Governmental Authority with respect to any Mortgaged Property; and 

(6)         cooperate
fully with Lender with respect to any proceedings before any court, board, or other Governmental Authority which may in any way
affect the rights of Lender hereunder or any rights obtained by Lender under any of the other Loan Documents and, in connection
therewith, permit Lender, at its election, to participate in any such proceedings. 

(f)          Alterations
to any Mortgaged Property. 

No alteration, improvement,
demolition, removal, or construction (collectively,   Alterations  ) shall be made to any Mortgaged Property without
the prior written consent of Lender if: 

(1)         such
Alteration could reasonably be expected to adversely affect the value of such Mortgaged Property or its operation as a Multifamily
Residential Property in substantially the same manner in which it is being operated on the date such property became Collateral; 

(2)         the
construction of such Alteration could reasonably be expected to result in interference to the occupancy of tenants of such Mortgaged
Property such that tenants in occupancy with respect to five percent (5%)   or more of the tenants under the Leases would
be displaced or permitted to terminate their Leases or to abate the payment of all or any portion of their rent; or 

(3)         such
Alteration will be completed in more than twelve (12) months from the date of commencement or in the last year of the Term
of this Master Agreement. 

For purposes hereof, Alterations
shall not be deemed to include cosmetic, non-structural changes including new carpeting and painting, which do not require a building
permit and shall not require the consent of Lender. In addition, Borrower must obtain Lender s prior written consent to construct
Alterations with respect to any Mortgaged Property costing in excess of, with respect to any Mortgaged Property, the number of
units in such Mortgaged Property multiplied by $5,000, but in any event, costs in excess of $250,000, Borrower must give prior
written notice to Lender of its intent to construct Alterations at any time with respect to any Mortgaged Property costing in excess
of $100,000; provided, however, that the preceding requirements shall not be applicable to Alterations made, conducted, or undertaken
by Borrower as part of Borrower s routine maintenance and repair of the Mortgaged Properties as required by the Loan Documents
(including any Repair or Replacement). 

(g)          Licensing. 

(1)         Borrower
(A) shall maintain and operate, or shall cause Property Operator, if applicable, to maintain and operate, the Mortgaged Property
as a Seniors Housing Facility, (B) shall maintain, or shall cause Property Operator, if applicable, to maintain, in good standing
all Licenses, (C) shall renew or extend, or shall cause Property Operator, if applicable, to renew and extend, all such required
Licenses, and (D) shall not fail, nor allow the failure by Property Operator, if applicable, to take any action necessary to keep
all such Licenses in good standing and full force and effect. Borrower will, or shall cause Property Operator, if applicable, to
provide Lender written notice within five (5) days of Borrower s or Property Operator s receipt of any notice
or order of a violation which could be reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Borrower, Property Operator, or
the Mortgaged Property, its operations, or its compliance with licensing and regulatory requirements. 

(2)         If
any License requirement is imposed upon the Mortgaged Property after the date the Mortgaged Property is added to the Collateral
Pool, Borrower shall obtain, or shall cause the Property Operator, if applicable, to obtain, all Licenses and shall maintain, or
shall cause the Property Operator, if applicable, to maintain, such Licenses in full force and effect. Borrower acknowledges and
agrees that all such Licenses are subject to the terms of this Master Agreement and the Loan Documents. 

(3)         Without
the prior written consent of Lender, Borrower shall not, and shall require Property Operator, if applicable, not to amend, modify,
transfer, or otherwise change the Licenses. 

(4)         Borrower
shall promptly inform Lender in writing or shall cause Property Operator to promptly inform Lender in writing, if such party has
actual knowledge of, and shall deliver to Lender copies of, (A) any written communications, complaints, orders, judgments, and
other documents relating to the commencement of any litigation, rulemaking, or disciplinary proceeding or the promulgation of any
proposed or final rule which would have, or may reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect on the Mortgaged Property,
or the Licenses, and (B) notice from any Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over Borrower or any Property Operator that
(i) Borrower or Property Operator is being placed under regulatory supervision, (ii) any License related to the conduct of Borrower s
or Property Operator s, if applicable, business or the Mortgaged Property is to be suspended or revoked, or (iii) Borrower
or Property Operator is to cease and desist any practice, procedure, or policy employed by Borrower or Property Operator in the
conduct of its business, and such cessation would have, or may reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect on the
Mortgaged Property, or the Licenses. 

(h)          Medicaid
Provider Agreement. 

(1)         If
neither Borrower nor any Property Operator is a Medicaid Participant as of the Effective Date, Borrower shall notify Lender in
writing thirty (30) days prior to Borrower s or any Property Operator s (with respect to the Mortgaged Property)
submission of its request to enter into a Medicaid Provider Agreement, and will provide Lender with copies of all correspondence
and documentation received from the Governmental Authority or the Managed Care Organization concerning its submission. 

(2)         The
following provisions apply if a Medicaid Provider Agreement is in place as of the date the Mortgaged Property is added to the Collateral
Pool or entered into at any time the Mortgaged Property is subject to this Master Agreement. 

(A)         Borrower
and such Property Operator shall execute the form of Medicaid reserve agreement and Depositary Agreement as Lender may require; 

(B)         Borrower
and Property Operator shall comply with the terms and conditions of the Medicaid Provider Agreement and shall enforce the obligations
of each Managed Care Organization or Governmental Authority under the applicable Medicaid Provider Agreement; 

(C)         Borrower
and Property Operator shall maintain their respective compliance with the provider standards, including all conditions for participation,
as required by the Managed Care Organization or the Governmental Authority, as applicable; 

(D)         Borrower
or Property Operator, as applicable, shall not permit or allow more than twenty percent (20%) of the Mortgaged Property s
effective gross income to be derived from funds paid to Borrower or Property Operator by a Governmental Authority or a Managed
Care Organization, as applicable, under a Medicaid Provider Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Borrower or any Property
Operator is a Medicaid Participant with respect to the Mortgaged Property, and if by reason of Applicable Law or regulation more
than twenty percent (20%) of effective gross income is derived from funds paid to such Borrower or Property Operator by a
Governmental Authority or a Managed Care Organization, Borrower and Property Operator shall take in a diligent and expeditious
manner all reasonable steps necessary to comply with the preceding sentence to the extent permissible by Applicable Law or regulation; 

(E)         without
the prior written consent of Lender, Borrower and Property Operator shall not: 

(i)          amend
or otherwise modify the then-current Medicaid Provider Agreement; 

(ii)         terminate
the then-current Medicaid Provider Agreement; 

(iii)        waive
a default under the then-current Medicaid Provider Agreement; or 

(iv)        enter
into a new Medicaid Provider Agreement or renew or replace an existing Medicaid Provider Agreement; and 

(F)         within
five (5) days after Borrower s or any Property Operator s receipt thereof, Borrower shall give Lender written
notice of any notice or information received by Borrower or any Property Operator that indicates that: 

(i)          either
Borrower or any Property Operator is in default under the terms of the Medicaid Provider Agreement; 

(ii)         the
applicable Governmental Authority or Managed Care Organization intends to amend, modify, or terminate the Medicaid Provider Agreement; 

(iii)        Borrower
or Property Operator has ceased to meet the provider standards required by the applicable Governmental Authority or Managed Care
Organization; 

(iv)        Borrower
or Property Operator has received notice from any Governmental Authority or Managed Care Organization that the rates for services
provided under the then-current Medicaid Provider Agreement will be adjusted; or 

(v)         either
Borrower or any Property Operator has been excluded from participation in any Governmental Health Care Program with respect to
the Mortgaged Property or any other property. 

(i)          Facility
Operating Agreement. 

(1)         The
provisions of this Section 6.02(i)(1) (Facility Operating Agreement) apply to all Facility Operating Agreements other than a Seniors
Housing Facility Lease and to all Property Operators other than a Property Operator under a Seniors Housing Facility Lease. Borrower
shall comply with and shall enforce the obligations of each Property Operator under each Facility Operating Agreement. Without
the prior written consent of Lender (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), Borrower shall not: 

(A)         modify,
amend, supplement, or restate any Facility Operating Agreement in a material way, including any modification that amends the fees
or duration of any Facility Operating Agreement; 

(B)         waive
a default under any Facility Operating Agreement to the extent such default could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on the Mortgaged Property or otherwise result in an Event of Default hereunder; 

(C)         waive
any of Borrower s rights or fail to diligently pursue Borrower s remedies under the Facility Operating Agreement to
the extent such waiver or failure could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Mortgaged Property or otherwise
result in an Event of Default hereunder; 

(D)         add
or release a property to or from any Facility Operating Agreement (other than in connection with a Release or Addition of a Mortgaged
Property to the Collateral Pool which shall be governed by this Master Agreement); or 

(E)         violate
the provisions of Section 11.02(c) (Facility Operating Agreement). 

(2)         Within
five (5) days of Borrower s receipt or delivery (or any Property Operator s receipt), Borrower shall provide Lender
written notice of any notice or information received by Borrower or any Property Operator that indicates either Borrower or any
Property Operator is (A) in default under the terms of any Facility Operating Agreement, (B) amending, modifying, or terminating
any Facility Operating Agreement, or (C) otherwise discontinuing its operation and management of the Mortgaged Property. 

(3)         After
Borrower receives notice (or otherwise has actual knowledge) of an Event of Default under the Loan Documents, it will not make
any payment of fees under or pursuant to the Facility Operating Agreement without Lender s prior written consent. 

(4)         Borrower
shall cause each Property Operator, where applicable, to comply with the terms, conditions, provisions, requirements, and affirmative
and negative covenants of this Master Agreement relating to the use and operation of the Mortgaged Property, including all terms,
conditions, provisions, requirements, and affirmative and negative covenants set forth in this Master Agreement applicable to the
organization, existence, and good standing of Property Operator necessary for the use and operation of the Mortgaged Property. 

(j)          Change
in Property Operator. 

Each Property Operator
and each Facility Operating Agreement must be approved in writing in advance by Lender. Borrower shall not remove or permit or
suffer the removal of any Property Operator without the prior written consent of Lender and unless and until Lender has approved
in writing a replacement Property Operator. Each Facility Operating Agreement or other similar agreement between Borrower and a
new Property Operator must be approved in writing in advance by Lender, and Borrower and the new Property Operator must execute
and deliver to Lender a SASA in form required by Lender, subject to the provisions of Section 6.03(a) (Property Management). Borrower
shall notify Lender in writing of any name change of an Affiliated Property Operator or any change in an Affiliated Property Operator s
place of incorporation or organization. Borrower agrees that Lender shall have the right to remove any Property Operator at any
time if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, subject to the provisions of the SASA. 

(k)          Contracts. 

Borrower may in the future
enter into Contracts for the provision of additional goods or services at or otherwise in connection with the operation, use, or
management of the Mortgaged Property. Borrower absolutely and unconditionally pledges, grants a security interest in, and assigns
to Lender all of Borrower s right, title, and interest in, to, and under the Contracts, including Borrower s right,
power, and authority to modify the terms of, extend, or terminate any such Contract. Until Lender gives notice to Borrower of Lender s
exercise of its rights under this Master Agreement during the continuance of an Event of Default, Borrower shall have all right,
power, and authority granted to Borrower under any Contract (except as otherwise limited by this subsection or any other provision
of this Master Agreement), including the right, power, and authority to modify the terms of any Contract or extend or terminate
any Contract. If an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, and at the option of Lender, the permission given to Borrower
pursuant to the preceding sentence to exercise all right, power, and authority under Contracts shall terminate. Upon Lender s
delivery of notice to Borrower of an Event of Default, Lender shall immediately have all right, power, and authority granted to
Borrower under any Contract, including the right, power, and authority to modify the terms of, extend, or terminate any such Contract.
Borrower shall fully perform all of its obligations under the Contracts, and Borrower agrees not to assign, sell, pledge, transfer,
mortgage, or otherwise encumber its interests in any of the Contracts without the prior written approval of Lender. Each Contract
entered into by Borrower subsequent to the date hereof (other than cable television contracts), the average annual consideration
of which, directly or indirectly, is at least $50,000, shall provide: (A) that it shall be terminable for cause, and (B) that it
shall be terminable, at Lender s option, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default. 

(l)          All
Representations and Covenants Deemed Borrower Responsibility. 

(1)         Any
act, action, term, condition, provision, requirement, or covenant required to be performed, or prohibited from being performed,
by Borrower under the Loan Documents including with respect to (A) the use, management or operation of the Mortgaged Property,
including any licensing, repair, reporting, or insurance requirements, and (B) the organization, existence, good standing or other
entity-level requirements, shall be interpreted as requiring Borrower either to perform such act or action directly or to cause
Property Operator, a property manager or other appropriate agent to perform such act or action. Any right or privilege assigned
or delegated by Borrower or Property Operator to any other Person shall be construed as being accompanied by each relevant obligation
or restriction set forth in the Loan Documents or any Facility Operating Agreement, as applicable. 

(2)         In
each instance that Borrower makes, or in the future renews or is deemed to renew, a representation, warranty, or covenant in this
Master Agreement or the other Loan Documents regarding the condition, knowledge, acts, or omissions of Property Operator or any
Property Operator Business Information, or the condition of the Mortgaged Property, Borrower does and shall do so with full knowledge,
after due inquiry (including the due inquiry of and by Guarantor), of such information. Any reporting or compliance delay caused
by Property Operator or Guarantor shall not excuse Borrower s timely performance of the terms of this Master Agreement or
the other Loan Documents. Borrower acknowledges and agrees that Borrower s reliance upon incorrect or incomplete information
received from Property Operator or Guarantor and the reporting of the same to Lender, whether or not Borrower had actual knowledge
that such information was incorrect or incomplete and whether or not Borrower is otherwise in violation of the terms of this Master
Agreement, shall not be (and none of Borrower, Property Operator, Guarantor, nor Key Principal shall assert) a defense to Lender s
determination that an Event of Default has occurred or that Borrower (or Guarantor) has incurred personal liability as set forth
in Article 3 (Personal Liability) of this Master Agreement. 

Section 6.03         Administration
Matters Regarding the Property. 

(a)          Property
Management. 

From and after the Effective
Date, each Property Operator and each Facility Operating Agreement must be approved by Lender. In the event that the Facility Operating
Agreement expires or is terminated (without limiting any obligation of Borrower to obtain Lender s consent to any termination
or modification of the Facility Operating Agreement in accordance with the terms and provisions of the Loan Documents), Borrower
shall promptly enter into a replacement facility operating agreement consented to in writing by Lender with a Property Operator
that is approved in advance by Lender in writing. If Lender waives in writing the requirement that Borrower enter into a written
contract for the operation or management of a Mortgaged Property, and Borrower later elects to enter into a written contract or
change the operation or management of such Mortgaged Property, such new Property Operator and any Facility Operating Agreement
must be approved by Lender. As a condition to any approval of a Property Operator by Lender pursuant to this Section 6.03(a) (Property
Management), Borrower and such new Property Operator shall enter into a SASA. Any consent or approval by Lender under this Section
6.03(a) (Property Management) shall not be unreasonably withheld. 

(b)          Subordination
of Fees by Property Operator. 

All fees due to an Affiliated
Property Operator in connection with the operation and management of the Mortgaged Property shall be subordinated in right to the
prior payment in full of the Indebtedness. All fees due to a non-Affiliated Property Operator in connection with the operation
and management of the Mortgaged Property shall be subordinated in right of payment to the prior payment in full of monthly debt
service and funding of escrows and reserves as required under the Loan Documents, and the payment of all operating expenses and
capital expenditures incurred in connection with the operation and management of the Mortgaged Property. 

(c)          Property
Condition Assessment. 

If, in connection with
any inspection of any Mortgaged Property, Lender determines that the condition of such Mortgaged Property has deteriorated (ordinary
wear and tear excepted) since the Effective Date that such Mortgaged Property was added to the Collateral Pool, Lender may obtain,
at Borrower s expense, a property condition assessment of each Mortgaged Property. Lender s right to obtain a property
condition assessment pursuant to this Section 6.03(c) (Property Condition Assessment) shall be in addition to any other rights
available to Lender under this Master Agreement in connection with any such deterioration. Any such inspection or property condition
assessment may result in Lender requiring Additional Lender Repairs or Additional Lender Replacements as further described in Section
13.02(a)(10)(B) (Additional Lender Replacements and Additional Lender Repairs). 

ARTICLE 7 

 LEASES AND RENTS 

Section 7.01         Representations
and Warranties. 

The representations and
warranties made by Borrower to Lender in this Section 7.01 (Leases and Rents   Representations and Warranties) are made as
of each Effective Date and are true and correct except as disclosed on the Exceptions to Representations and Warranties Schedule. 

(a)          Prior
Assignment of Rents. 

Borrower has not executed
any: 

(1)         prior
assignment of Rents (other than an assignment of Rents securing prior indebtedness that has been paid off and discharged or will
be paid off and discharged with the proceeds of the Initial Advance or a Future Advance); or 

(2)         instrument
which would prevent Lender from exercising its rights under this Master Agreement, the Security Instrument, or the SASA. 

(b)          Prepaid
Rents. 

Borrower has not accepted,
and does not expect to receive prepayment of, any Rents for more than one (1) month for the Seniors Housing Facility Lease or more
than two (2) months under any other Lease prior to the due dates of such Rents (provided that up to twelve (12) months 
prepaid Rents for up to five percent (5%) of the units at any Mortgaged Property shall be permitted). 

(c)          Seniors
Housing Facility Lease. 

(1)         The
Seniors Housing Facility Lease is in full force and effect and there is neither a default thereunder nor any condition that, with
the passage of time or the giving of notice, or both, would constitute a default thereunder. No right or claim of rescission, offset,
abatement, diminution, defense, or counterclaim has been asserted with respect to the Seniors Housing Facility Lease, and there
is no existing condition that, with the passage of time or giving of notice, or both, would result in a right or claim of rescission,
offset, abatement, diminution, defense, or counterclaim under the terms and provisions of the Seniors Housing Facility Lease. Borrower
has performed and discharged all of the obligations on the part of Borrower to be performed and discharged pursuant to the terms
set forth in the Seniors Housing Facility Lease. 

(2)         The
Seniors Housing Facility Lease has not been modified, amended or supplemented by either party thereto. The Property Operator has
not been released, in whole or in part, from any of its obligations under the Seniors Housing Facility Lease. There has been no
prior sale, transfer, assignment, hypothecation, or pledge of the Seniors Housing Facility Lease (other than in connection with
the Loan Documents) that is outstanding. 

(3)         The
Seniors Housing Facility Lease has an original term ending on or after the date ninety (90) days after the Maturity Date.
Absent Lender s direction, the Property Operator cannot terminate the Seniors Housing Facility Lease for any reason prior
to the payment in full of the Indebtedness. 

(4)         There
is no free rent, partial rent or rebate of rent required to be given by Borrower to Property Operator under the Seniors Housing
Facility Lease. The Seniors Housing Facility Lease does not permit Property Operator to accept, and Property Operator has not accepted,
prepayment of Rents more than two (2) months in advance (and Borrower has not accepted prepayment of Rents more than one (1)
month in advance with respect to the Seniors Housing Facility Lease). Each payment due under the Seniors Housing Facility Lease
is sufficient to pay the Debt Service Amounts (including Monthly Debt Service Payments, Taxes, Impositions, and any Replacement
Reserve Deposits) in full on or prior to the due date thereof (without giving effect to any applicable grace periods) currently
and throughout the term of this Master Agreement. Payments due under the Seniors Housing Facility Lease are payable without notice
or demand, and without setoff, recoupment, abatement, or reduction. 

(5)         Property
Operator has no right or option pursuant to the Seniors Housing Facility Lease or otherwise to purchase all or any part of the
Mortgaged Property, the leased premises or the building of which the leased premises are a part. 

(6)         The
Seniors Housing Facility Lease contains customary and enforceable provisions that render the rights and remedies of Borrower adequate
for the enforcement and satisfaction of the Borrower s rights thereunder. 

(7)         Borrower
represents and warrants that it is the express intent of Borrower and Property Operator that the Seniors Housing Facility Lease
constitute a lease under applicable real property laws and laws governing bankruptcy, insolvency, and creditors  rights generally,
and that the sole interest of Property Operator in the Mortgaged Property is as a tenant under the Seniors Housing Facility Lease.
The Seniors Housing Facility Lease is not intended to be deemed a guaranty. 

Section 7.02         Covenants. 

(a)          Leases. 

Borrower shall: 

(1)         comply
with and observe all landlord obligations under all Leases, including landlord s obligations pertaining to the maintenance
and disposition of tenant security deposits or any other refundable fees including entrance fees or community fees; 

(2)         during
the continuance of an Event of Default, surrender possession of the applicable Mortgaged Property, including all Leases and all
security deposits and prepaid Rents, immediately upon appointment of a receiver or Lender s entry upon and taking of possession
and control of such Mortgaged Property, as applicable; 

(3)         require
that all Residential Leases have initial lease terms of not less than six (6) months and not more than twenty-four (24)
months (however, if customary in the applicable market for properties comparable to the applicable Mortgaged Property or required
by Applicable Law, Residential Leases with terms of less than six (6) months (but in no case less than one (1) month)
may be permitted without Lender s prior written consent so long as Borrower promptly notifies Lender of such requirement);
and 

(4)         promptly
provide Lender a copy of any non-Residential Lease at the time such Lease is executed (subject to Lender s consent rights
for Material Commercial Leases in Section 7.02(b) (Commercial Leases) and subject to Lender s consent rights for the Seniors
Housing Facility Lease pursuant to Section 6.02(j) (Change in Property Operator) and the SASA), and, upon Lender s written
request, promptly provide Lender a copy of any Residential Lease then in effect.

Leases. 

(1)         With
respect to Material Commercial Leases, Borrower shall not:

into any Material Commercial Lease except with the prior written consent of Lender, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld;
or 

(B)         modify
the terms of, extend, or terminate any Material Commercial Lease (including any Material Commercial Lease in existence on the Effective
Date) without the prior written consent of Lender, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. 

(2)         With
respect to any non-Material Commercial Lease, Borrower shall not: 

(A)         enter
into any non-Material Commercial Lease that materially alters the use and type of operation of the premises subject to the Lease
in effect as of the Effective Date or reduces the number or size of residential units at a Mortgaged Property; or 

(B)         modify
the terms of any non-Material Commercial Lease (including any non-Material Commercial Lease in existence on the Effective Date)
in any way that materially alters the use and type of operation of the premises subject to such non-Material Commercial Lease in
effect as of the Effective Date, reduces the number or size of residential units at a Mortgaged Property, or results in such non-Material
Commercial   Lease being deemed a Material Commercial Lease. 

(3)         With
respect to any Material Commercial Lease or non-Material Commercial Lease, Borrower shall cause the applicable tenant to provide
within ten (10) Business Days after a request by Borrower, a certificate of estoppel, or if not provided by tenant within
such ten (10) Business Day period, Borrower shall provide such certificate of estoppel, certifying: 

(A)         that
such Material Commercial Lease or non-Material Commercial Lease is unmodified and in full force and effect (or if there have been
modifications, that such Material Commercial Lease or non-Material Commercial Lease is in full force and effect as modified and
stating the modifications); 

(B)         the
term of the Lease including any extensions thereto; 

(C)         the
dates to which the Rent and any other charges hereunder have been paid by tenant; 

(D)         the
amount of any security deposit delivered to Borrower as landlord; 

(E)         whether
or not Borrower is in default (or whether any event or condition exists which, with the passage of time, would constitute an event
of default) under such Lease; 

(F)         the
address to which notices to tenant should be sent; and 

(G)         any
other information as may be reasonably required by Lender. 

(c)          Payment
of Rents. 

Borrower shall: 

(1)         pay
to Lender upon demand all Rents after an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing; 

(2)         cooperate
with Lender s efforts in connection with the assignment of Rents set forth in the Security Instrument and the SASA; and 

(3)         not
accept prepayment of Rent for more than one (1) month for the Seniors Housing Facility Lease or more than two (2) months
under any other Lease (whether a Residential Lease or a non-Residential Lease) (provided that up to twelve (12) months 
prepaid Rents for up to five percent (5%) of the units at any Mortgaged Property shall be permitted). 

(d)          Assignment
of Rents. 

Borrower shall not: 

(1)         perform
any acts nor execute any instrument that would prevent Lender from exercising its rights under the assignment of Rents granted
in the Security Instrument, the SASA, or in any other Loan Document; nor 

(2)         interfere
with Lender s collection of such Rents during the continuance of an Event of Default. 

(e)          Further
Assignments of Leases and Rents. 

Borrower shall execute
and deliver any further assignments of Leases and Rents as Lender may reasonably require, and shall require Property Operator to
execute and deliver any corresponding assignments in support thereof. 

(f)          Options
to Purchase by Tenants. 

No Lease (whether a Residential
Lease or a non-Residential Lease) shall contain an option to purchase, right of first refusal to purchase or right of first offer

(3)         deliver
evidence, in form and content acceptable to Lender, that each Insurance Policy under this Article 9 (Insurance) has been renewed

Section 9.03         Administration
Matters Regarding Insurance. 

(a)          Lender s
Ongoing Insurance Requirements. 

Borrower acknowledges that
Lender s insurance requirements may change from time to time. All insurance policies and renewals of insurance policies required
by this Master Agreement shall be: 

(1)         in
the form and with the terms required by Lender; 

(2)         in
such amounts, with such maximum deductibles and for such periods required by Lender; and 

(3)         issued
by insurance companies satisfactory to Lender. 

BORROWER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT
ANY FAILURE OF BORROWER TO COMPLY WITH THE REQUIREMENTS SET FORTH IN  Section  9.02(a)
(Insurance Requirements) OR  Section  9.02(b)(3) (Delivery of Policies, Renewals,
Notices, and Proceeds) ABOVE SHALL PERMIT LENDER TO PURCHASE THE APPLICABLE INSURANCE AT BORROWER S COST. SUCH INSURANCE
MAY, BUT NEED NOT, PROTECT BORROWER S INTERESTS. THE COVERAGE THAT LENDER PURCHASES MAY NOT PAY ANY CLAIM THAT BORROWER MAKES
OR ANY CLAIM THAT IS MADE AGAINST BORROWER IN CONNECTION WITH ANY  Mortgaged Property. IF
LENDER PURCHASES INSURANCE FOR ANY Mortgaged Property AS PERMITTED HEREUNDER , BORROWER WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE COSTS
OF THAT INSURANCE, INCLUDING INTEREST AT THE DEFAULT RATE AND ANY OTHER CHARGES LENDER MAY IMPOSE IN CONNECTION WITH THE PLACEMENT
OF THE INSURANCE UNTIL THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE CANCELLATION OR THE EXPIRATION OF THE INSURANCE. THE COSTS OF THE INSURANCE SHALL
BE ADDED TO BORROWER S TOTAL OUTSTANDING BALANCE OR OBLIGATION AND SHALL CONSTITUTE ADDITIONAL INDEBTEDNESS. THE COSTS OF
THE INSURANCE MAY BE MORE THAN THE COST OF INSURANCE BORROWER MAY BE ABLE TO OBTAIN ON ITS OWN. BORROWER MAY LATER CANCEL ANY INSURANCE
PURCHASED BY LENDER, BUT ONLY AFTER PROVIDING EVIDENCE THAT BORROWER HAS OBTAINED INSURANCE AS REQUIRED BY THIS MASTER AGREEMENT
AND THE OTHER LOAN DOCUMENTS. 

(b)          Application
of Proceeds on Event of Loss. 

(1)         Upon
an event of loss, Lender may, at Lender s option: 

(A)         hold
such proceeds to be applied to reimburse Borrower for the cost of Restoration (in accordance with Lender s then-current policies
relating to the restoration of casualty damage on similar multifamily residential properties); or 

(B)         apply
such proceeds to the payment of the Indebtedness, whether or not then due; provided, however, Lender shall not apply insurance
proceeds to the payment of the Indebtedness and shall require Restoration pursuant to Section 9.03(b)(1)(A) (Application of Proceeds
on Event of Loss) if all of the following conditions are met: 

(i)          no
Potential Event of Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing; 

(ii)         Lender
determines that the combination of insurance proceeds and amounts provided by Borrower will be sufficient funds to complete the
Restoration; 

(iii)        Lender
determines that after completion of the Restoration (1) the Net Operating Income from the applicable Mortgaged Property will be
sufficient to support the Debt Service Coverage Ratio set forth in the definition of Individual Property Coverage and LTV Tests
(on a pro forma basis), and (2) the Loan to Value Ratio of such Mortgaged Property will be no greater than the Loan to Value Ratio
immediately prior to the event of loss, but in no event greater than ninety percent (90%); 

(iv)        Lender
determines that the Restoration will be completed before the earlier of (1) one year before the latest Maturity Date   of
any Advance Outstanding, or (2) one year after the date of the loss or casualty; and 

(v)         Borrower
provides Lender, upon written request, evidence of the availability during and after the Restoration of the insurance required
to be maintained pursuant to this Master Agreement. 

After the completion of Restoration
in accordance with the above requirements, as determined by Lender, the balance, if any, of such proceeds shall be returned to
Borrower. 

(2)         Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if any loss is estimated to be in an amount equal to or less than $250,000, Lender shall not exercise its rights
and remedies as power-of-attorney herein and shall allow Borrower to make proof of loss, to adjust and compromise any claims under
policies of property damage insurance, to appear in and prosecute any action arising from such policies of property damage insurance,
and to collect and receive the proceeds of property damage insurance; provided that each of the following conditions shall be satisfied: 

(A)         Borrower
shall immediately notify Lender of the casualty giving rise to the claim; 

(B)         no
Potential Event of Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing; 

(C)         the
Restoration will be completed before the earlier of (i) one year before the Termination Date, or (ii) one year after the date of
the loss or casualty; 

(D)         Lender
determines that the combination of insurance proceeds and amounts provided by Borrower will be sufficient funds to complete the
Restoration; 

(E)         all
proceeds of property damage insurance shall be issued in the form of joint checks to Borrower and Lender; 

(F)         all
proceeds of property damage insurance shall be applied to the Restoration; 

(G)         Borrower
shall deliver to Lender evidence satisfactory to Lender of completion of the Restoration and obtainment of all lien releases; 

(H)         Borrower
shall have complied to Lender s satisfaction with the foregoing requirements on any prior claims subject to this provision,
if any; and 

(I)         Lender
shall have the right to inspect the applicable Mortgaged Property (subject to the rights of tenants under the Leases, other than
the Seniors Housing Facility Lease). 

(3)         If
Lender elects to apply insurance proceeds to the Indebtedness in accordance with the terms of this Master Agreement, Borrower shall
not be obligated to restore or repair the applicable Mortgaged Property. Rather, Borrower shall restrict access to the damaged
portion of such Mortgaged Property and, at its expense and regardless of whether such costs are covered by insurance, clean up
any debris resulting from the casualty event, and, if required or otherwise permitted by Lender, demolish or raze any remaining
part of the damaged Mortgaged Property to the extent necessary to keep and maintain the Mortgaged Property in a safe, habitable
and marketable condition. Nothing in this Section 9.03(b) (Application of Proceeds on Event of Loss) shall affect any of Lender s
remedial rights against Borrower in connection with a breach by Borrower of any of its obligations under this Master Agreement
or under any Loan Document, including any failure to timely pay Monthly Debt Service Payments or maintain the insurance coverage(s)
required by this Master Agreement. 

(c)          Payment
Obligations Unaffected. 

The application of any
insurance proceeds to the Indebtedness shall not extend or postpone the Maturity Date, or the due date or the full payment of any
Monthly Debt Service Payment, Monthly Replacement Reserve Deposit, or any other installments referred to in this Master Agreement
or in any other Loan Document. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Lender applies insurance proceeds to the Indebtedness in connection
with a casualty of less than an entire Mortgaged Property, then Lender shall permit an adjustment to the Monthly Debt Service Payments
that become due and owing thereafter, based on the Underwriting and Servicing Requirements. 

(d)          Foreclosure
Sale. 

If a Mortgaged Property
is transferred pursuant to a Foreclosure Event or Lender otherwise acquires title to a Mortgaged Property, Borrower acknowledges
that Lender shall automatically succeed to all rights of Borrower in and to any insurance policies and unearned insurance premiums
applicable to such Mortgaged Property and in and to the proceeds resulting from any damage to such Mortgaged Property prior to
such Foreclosure Event or such acquisition. 

(e)          Appointment
of Lender as Attorney-In-Fact. 

Borrower hereby authorizes
and appoints Lender as attorney-in-fact pursuant to Section 14.03(c) (Appointment of Lender as Attorney-In-Fact).

of Mortgaged Property. 

If a Condemnation Action
results in or from damage to any Mortgaged Property and Lender elects to apply the proceeds or awards from such Condemnation Action
to the Indebtedness in accordance with the terms of this Master Agreement, Borrower shall not be obligated to restore or repair

to timely pay Monthly Debt Service Payments or maintain the insurance coverage(s) required by this Master Agreement.

or a Publicly-Held Trust, a Transfer of any ownership interests in such Publicly-Held Corporation or Publicly-Held Trust shall
not be prohibited under this Master Agreement as long as (1) such Transfer does not result in a conversion of such Publicly-Held

Policy (or obtain a new Title Policy if a  date down  endorsement is not available in the Property Jurisdiction), evidencing

Property, and (iv) Lender will file any required UCC-3 financing statement and make any other filing deemed necessary to maintain
the priority of its Liens on the Mortgaged Property; 

(E)         no
later than ten (10) days subsequent to such name change or entity conversion, Borrower shall provide Lender (i) the documentation
filed with the appropriate office in such Borrower s state of formation evidencing such name change or entity conversion,

the name change or entity conversion or have been properly transferred to Borrower following such name change or entity conversion. 

(4)         No
Delaware Statutory Trust or Series LLC Conversion.

the occurrence and continuance of an Event of Default.

Other Indebtedness. 

Other than the Advances,
neither Borrower nor any Affiliated Property Operator shall incur or be obligated at any time with respect to any loan or other

and warranties made by Borrower to Lender in this Section 12.01 (Impositions   Representations and Warranties) are made as

knowledge of any basis for any additional assessments; 

(4)         no
knowledge of any presently pending special assessments against all or any part of the Mortgaged Properties, or any presently pending
special assessments against Borrower; and 

(5)         not
received any written notice of any contemplated special assessment against any Mortgaged Property, or any contemplated special
assessment against Borrower. 

Section 12.02         Covenants. 

(a)          Imposition
Deposits, Taxes, and Other Charges. 

Borrower shall: 

(1)         deposit
the Imposition Deposits with Lender on each Payment Date (or on another day designated in writing by Lender) in amount sufficient,
in Lender s reasonable discretion, to enable Lender to pay each Imposition before the last date upon which such payment may
be made without any penalty or interest charge being added, plus an amount equal to no more than one-sixth (1/6) (or the amount
permitted by Applicable Law) of the Impositions for the trailing twelve (12) months (calculated based on the aggregate annual
Imposition costs divided by twelve (12) and multiplied by two (2)); 

(2)         deposit
with Lender, within ten (10) Business Days after written notice from Lender (subject to Applicable Law), such additional amounts
estimated by Lender to be reasonably necessary to cure any deficiency in the amount of the Imposition Deposits held for payment
of a specific Imposition; 

(3)         except
as set forth in Section 12.03(c) (Payment of Impositions; Sufficiency of Imposition Deposits) below, pay all Impositions, leasehold
payments, ground rents, and Taxes when due and before any fine, penalty interest, lien, or costs may be added thereto;

shall promptly furnish to Lender receipts evidencing such payments; and 

(5)         promptly
deliver to Lender a copy of all notices of any special assessments and contemplated special assessments against any Mortgaged Property
or Borrower. 

Section 12.03         Administration
Matters Regarding Impositions. 

(a)          Maintenance
of Records by Lender. 

Lender shall maintain
records of the monthly and aggregate Imposition Deposits held by Lender for the purpose of paying Taxes, insurance premiums, and
each other obligation of Borrower for which Imposition Deposits are required. 

(b)          Imposition
Accounts. 

All Imposition Deposits
shall be held in an institution (which may be Lender, if Lender is such an institution) whose deposits or accounts are insured
or guaranteed by a federal agency and which accounts meet the standards for custodial accounts as required by Lender from time
to time. Lender shall not be obligated to open additional accounts, or deposit Imposition Deposits in additional institutions,
when the amount of the Imposition Deposits exceeds the maximum amount of the federal deposit insurance or guaranty. No interest,
earnings, or profits on the Imposition Deposits shall be paid to Borrower unless Applicable Law so requires. Imposition Deposits
shall not be trust funds, nor shall they operate to reduce the Indebtedness, unless applied by Lender for that purpose in accordance
with this Master Agreement. For the purposes of  9-104(a)(3) of the UCC, Lender is the owner of the Imposition Deposits and
shall be deemed a  customer  with sole control of the account holding the Imposition Deposits. 

(c)          Payment
of Impositions; Sufficiency of Imposition Deposits. 

Lender may pay an Imposition
according to any bill, statement, or estimate from the appropriate public office or insurance company without inquiring into the
accuracy of the bill, statement, or estimate or into the validity of the Imposition. Imposition Deposits shall be required to be
used by Lender timely to pay Taxes, insurance premiums and any other individual   Imposition only if: 

(1)         no
Event of Default exists; 

(2)         Borrower
has timely delivered to Lender all applicable bills or premium notices that it has received; and 

(3)         sufficient
Imposition Deposits are held by Lender for such Imposition at the time such Imposition becomes due and payable. 

Lender shall have no
liability to Borrower or any other Person for failing to pay any Imposition if any of the conditions are not satisfied. If at any
time the amount of the Imposition Deposits held for payment of a specific Imposition exceeds the amount reasonably deemed necessary
by Lender to be held in connection with such Imposition, the excess may be credited against future installments of Imposition Deposits
for such Imposition. 

(d)          Imposition
Deposits Upon Event of Default. 

If an Event of Default
has occurred and is continuing, Lender may apply any Imposition Deposits, in such amount and in such order as Lender determines,
to pay any Impositions or as a credit against the Indebtedness. 

(e)          Contesting
Impositions. 

Other than insurance
premiums, Borrower may contest, at its expense, by appropriate legal proceedings, the amount or validity of any Imposition if: 

(1)         Borrower
notifies Lender of the commencement or expected commencement of such proceedings; 

(2)         Lender
determines that the applicable Mortgaged Property is not in danger of being sold or forfeited; 

(3)         Borrower
deposits with Lender (or the applicable Governmental Authority if required by Applicable Law) reserves sufficient to pay the contested
Imposition, if required by Lender (or the applicable Governmental Authority); 

(4)         Borrower
furnishes whatever additional security is required in the proceedings or is reasonably requested in writing by Lender; and 

(5)         Borrower
commences, and at all times thereafter diligently prosecutes, such contest in good faith until a final determination is made by
the applicable Governmental Authority. 

(f)          Release
to Borrower. 

Upon payment in full
of all sums secured by the Security Instrument and this Master Agreement and release by Lender of the lien of the Security Instrument,
Lender shall disburse to Borrower the balance of any Imposition Deposits then on deposit with Lender.

assign to Lender as additional security any contract or subcontract for Replacements or Repairs, upon Lender s written request,
on a form of assignment approved by Lender. 

(e)          Indemnification. 

If Lender elects to
exercise its rights under Section 14.03 (Additional Lender Rights; Forbearance) due to Borrower s failure to timely commence
or complete any Replacements or Repairs, Borrower shall indemnify and hold Lender harmless for, from and against any and all actions,
suits, claims, demands, liabilities, losses, damages, obligations, and costs or expenses, including litigation costs and reasonable
attorneys  fees, arising from or in any way connected with the performance by Lender of the Replacements or Repairs or investment
of the Reserve/Escrow Account Funds; provided that Borrower shall have no indemnity obligation if such actions, suits, claims,
demands, liabilities, losses, damages, obligations, and costs or expenses, including litigation costs and reasonable attorneys 
fees, arise as a result of the willful misconduct or gross negligence of Lender, Lender s agents, employees, or representatives
as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to a final non-appealable court order. 

(f)          Amendments
to Loan Documents. 

Subject to Section

Section 13.02         Administration
Matters Regarding Reserves. 

(a)          Accounts,
Deposits, and Disbursements. 

(2)         Custodial
Accounts. 

(A)         The
Replacement Reserve Account shall be an interest-bearing account that meets the standards for custodial accounts as required by
Lender from time to time. Lender shall not be responsible for any losses resulting from the investment of the Replacement Reserve
Deposits or for obtaining any specific level or percentage of earnings on such investment. All interest, if any, earned on the
Replacement Reserve Deposits shall be added to and become part of the Replacement Reserve Account;  provided ,  however ,
if Applicable Law requires, and so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing under any of the Loan Documents,
Lender shall pay to Borrower the interest earned on the Replacement Reserve Account not less frequently than the Replacement Reserve
Account Interest Disbursement Frequency. In no event shall Lender be obligated to disburse funds from the Reserve/Escrow Account
if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing. 

(B)         Lender
shall not be obligated to deposit the Repairs Escrow Deposits   into an interest-bearing account. 

(3)         Disbursements
by Lender Only. 

Only Lender
or a designated representative of Lender may make disbursements from the Replacement Reserve Account and the Repairs Escrow Account.
Except as provided in Section 13.02(a)(8) (Conditions to Disbursement), disbursements shall only be made upon Borrower request
and after satisfaction of all conditions for disbursement. 

(4)         Adjustment
to Deposits. 

(A)         Mortgaged
Properties in Collateral Pool over Ten (10) Years. 

If any Mortgaged
Property is part of the Collateral Pool for ten (10) years or more, a property condition assessment shall be ordered by Lender
for such Mortgaged Property at the expense of Borrower (which expense may be paid out of the Replacement Reserve Account if excess
funds are available). The property condition assessment shall be performed no earlier than the sixth (6th) month and no later
than the ninth (9th) month of the tenth (10th) year after such Mortgaged Property was added to the Collateral Pool (and
of the twentieth (20th) year if applicable). After review of the property condition assessment, the amount of the Monthly
Replacement Reserve Deposit may be adjusted by Lender for the remaining Facility Year by written notice to Borrower so that the
Monthly Replacement Reserve Deposits are sufficient to fund the Replacements as and when required and/or the amount to be held
in the Repairs Escrow Account may be adjusted by Lender so that the Repairs Escrow Deposit is sufficient to fund the Repairs as
and when required. 

(B)         Transfers. 

In connection
with any Transfer of any Mortgaged Property, in connection with an assumption, any Transfer of the Facility Operating Agreement,
or any Transfer of Ownership Interest(s) in a Borrower Entity or Affiliated Property Operator that requires Lender s consent,
Lender may review the amounts on deposit, if any, in the Replacement Reserve Account or the Repairs Escrow Account, the amount
of the Monthly Replacement Reserve Deposit for the applicable Mortgaged Property(ies) and the likely repairs and replacements required
by such Mortgaged Property(ies), and the related contingencies which may arise during the remaining Term of this Master Agreement.
Based upon that review, Lender may require an additional deposit to the Replacement Reserve Account or the Repairs Escrow Account,
or an increase in the amount of the Monthly Replacement Reserve Deposit as a condition to Lender s consent to such Transfer. 

(5)         Insufficient
Funds. 

Lender may,
upon thirty (30) days  prior written notice to Borrower, require an additional deposit(s) to the Replacement Reserve
Account or Repairs Escrow Account, or an increase in the amount of the Monthly Replacement Reserve Deposit, if Lender reasonably
determines that the amounts on deposit in either the Replacement Reserve Account or the Repairs Escrow Account are not sufficient
to cover the costs for Required Repairs or Required Replacements or, pursuant to the terms of Section 13.02(a)(10) (Replacements
and Repairs Other than Required Replacements or Required Repairs), not sufficient to cover the costs for Borrower Requested Repairs,
Additional Lender Repairs, Borrower Requested Replacements, or Additional Lender Replacements. Borrower s agreement to complete
the Replacements or Repairs as required by this Master Agreement shall not be affected by the insufficiency of any balance in the
Replacement Reserve Account or the Repairs Escrow Account, as applicable. 

(6)         Disbursements
for Replacements and Repairs. 

(A)         Disbursement
requests may only be made after completion of the applicable Replacements unless the applicable contract requires progress payments
and only to reimburse the applicable Borrower for the actual approved costs of the Replacements. Lender shall not disburse from
the Replacement Reserve Account the costs of routine maintenance to any Mortgaged Property or for costs which are to be reimbursed
from the Repairs Escrow Account or any similar account. Disbursement from the Replacement Reserve Account shall not be made more
frequently than the Maximum Replacement Reserve Disbursement Interval for such Mortgaged Property. Other than in connection with
a final request for disbursement, disbursements from the Replacement Reserve Account shall not be less than the Minimum Replacement
Reserve Disbursement Amount for such Mortgaged Property. 

(B)         Disbursement
requests may only be made after completion of the applicable Repairs and only to reimburse the applicable Borrower for the actual
cost of the Repairs, up to the Maximum Repair Cost for such Mortgaged Property. Lender shall not disburse any amounts which would
cause the funds remaining in the Repairs Escrow Account after any disbursement (other than with respect to the final disbursement)
to be less than the Maximum Repair Cost of the then-current estimated cost of completing all remaining Repairs. Lender shall not
disburse from the Repairs Escrow Account the costs of routine maintenance to any Mortgaged Property or for costs which are to be
reimbursed from the Replacement Reserve Account or any similar account. Disbursement from the Repairs Escrow Account shall not
be made more frequently than the Maximum Repair Disbursement Interval. Other than in connection with a final request for disbursement,
disbursements from the Repairs Escrow Account shall not be less than the Minimum Repairs Disbursement Amount for such Mortgaged
Property. 

(7)         Disbursement
Requests. 

Each request
by Borrower for disbursement from the Replacement Reserve Account or the Repairs Escrow Account must be in writing, must specify
the Replacement or Repair for which reimbursement is requested (provided that for any Borrower Requested Replacements, Borrower
Requested Repairs, Additional Lender Replacements and Additional Lender Repairs, Lender shall have approved the use of the Reserve/Escrow

a certification by Borrower and, if applicable (and if reasonably requested by Lender), from Property Operator that the Repair
or Replacement, or applicable portion thereof,   has been completed lien free and in a good and workmanlike manner, in accordance
with any plans and specifications previously approved by Lender (if applicable) and in compliance with all Applicable Law, and
otherwise in accordance with the provisions of this Master Agreement. 

(8)         Conditions

Lender may
require any or all of the following at the expense of Borrower as a condition to disbursement of funds from the Replacement Reserve

in the payment for any such work or materials; and 

(D)         an
acknowledgement of payment, waiver of claims, and release of lien for work performed and materials supplied from each contractor,
subcontractor or materialman in accordance with the requirements of Applicable Law and covering all work performed and materials
supplied (including equipment and fixtures) for the applicable Mortgaged Property by that contractor, subcontractor, or materialman
through the date covered by the disbursement request (or, in the event that payment to such contractor, subcontractor, or materialman

all remaining Required Replacements or Required Repairs (at the Maximum Repair Cost), as applicable, and any other Borrower Requested
Replacements, Borrower Requested Repairs, Additional Lender Replacements, or Additional Lender Repairs that have been previously
approved by Lender; 

(F)         each
supplier, materialman, mechanic, contractor, subcontractor, or other similar party receiving payments shall have provided, if requested
in writing by Lender, a waiver of liens with respect to amounts which have been previously paid to them; and 

(G)         all
other conditions for disbursement have been satisfied.

deposit to the Repairs Escrow Account for any such Borrower Requested Repairs. 

(B)         Additional
Lender Replacements and Additional Lender Repairs. 

Lender may
require, as set forth in Section 6.02(b) (Property Maintenance), Section 6.03(c) (Property Condition Assessment), or otherwise

(c)          Delays
and Workmanship. 

If any work for any

Lender s completion or making of such Replacements or Repairs, Lender shall have the right to enter onto each Mortgaged Property
and perform any and all work and labor necessary to make or complete the Replacements or Repairs and employ watchmen to protect
such Mortgaged Property from damage. All funds so expended by Lender in excess of the funds available in the Replacement Reserve

of any Replacement or Repair in a manner satisfactory to Lender shall not be deemed an acknowledgment or warranty to any Person
that the Replacement or Repair has been completed in accordance with applicable building, zoning or other codes, ordinances, statutes,

in Section 14.01(a) (Automatic Events of Default) or Section 14.01(b) (Events of Default Subject to a Specified Cure Period)) as
and when required; and 

(2)         any
loss by Borrower or any Property Operator of any License (other than the License needed to maintain the Operating Licensing Designation
for any Mortgaged Property, which is covered by Section 14.01(a)(17) (Automatic Events of Default)). 

Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, if an Event of Default shall occur hereunder or under any other Loan Document
because a representation, warranty, affirmative covenant, negative covenant, or other provision hereunder or thereunder shall be
breached or violated that in Lender s sole and exclusive judgment is with respect to a particular Mortgaged Property (other
than any misappropriation of funds collected in respect thereof) (each, a   Property-Specific Event of Default  ),
such Event of Default shall be deemed cured if Borrower shall satisfy all of the conditions set forth in Section 2.10(b) (Right
to Obtain Releases of Mortgaged Property) of this Master Agreement relating to the Release of such Mortgaged Property from the
Collateral Pool within thirty (30) days of Borrower acquiring knowledge of such Event of Default (the   Release Cure
Period  ). During the Release Cure Period, Lender agrees that it shall not have the right to exercise the remedy set forth
in Section 14.02 (Remedies) of this Master Agreement; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not impair Lender s right
to exercise the remedies available to Lender under any of the other Loan Documents (other than foreclosure rights with respect
to the applicable Mortgaged Property subject to the Release) or at law or in equity or under Section 14.03(b) (No Waiver of Rights
or Remedies) during such Release Cure Period. If Lender shall elect to exercise any such remedies during such period, and if Borrower
releases such Mortgaged Property pursuant to the provisions of the Mortgaged Property Release Schedule as described in the preceding
sentence and at the time of such release no other Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, Lender shall cease exercising
such remedies with respect to the applicable Property-Specific Event of Default and discontinue any proceedings it may have initiated
in connection therewith, and the parties shall be restored to their former positions and rights hereunder; provided, however, that
if Borrower shall fail to satisfy all of the conditions set forth in the Mortgaged Property Release Schedule relating to the release
of such Mortgaged Property from the Collateral Pool during the Release Cure Period, Lender may thereafter exercise any and all
remedies available to Lender under Article 14 (Defaults/Remedies) of this Master Agreement, including, without limitation, the
remedies set forth in Section 14.02 (Remedies). 

Section 14.02         Remedies. 

(a)          Acceleration;
Foreclosure. 

(1)         If
an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the entire unpaid principal balance of the Advances Outstanding, any Accrued
Interest, interest accruing at the Default Rate, the Prepayment Premium (if applicable), and all other Indebtedness, at the option
of Lender, shall immediately become due and payable, without any prior written notice to Borrower, unless Applicable Law requires
otherwise (and in such case, after any required written notice has been given). Lender may exercise this option to accelerate regardless
of any prior forbearance. In addition, Lender shall have all rights and remedies afforded to Lender hereunder and under the other
Loan Documents, including, foreclosure on and/or the power of sale of any or all of the Mortgaged Properties, as provided in the
Security Instrument, and any rights and remedies available to Lender at law or in equity (subject to Borrower s statutory
rights of reinstatement, if any). Any proceeds of a Foreclosure Event may be held and applied by Lender as additional collateral
for the Indebtedness pursuant to this Master Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the occurrence of any Bankruptcy Event of
Borrower shall automatically accelerate the Indebtedness, which Indebtedness shall be immediately due and payable without written
notice or further action by Lender. 

(2)         Lender
may Accelerate any Note without the obligation, but the right to accelerate any other Note (if more than one). In the exercise
of its rights and remedies under the Loan Documents, Lender may, except as provided in this Master Agreement, exercise and perfect
any and all of its rights in and under the Loan Documents with regard to any Mortgaged Property without the obligation (but with
the right) to exercise and perfect its rights and remedies with respect to any other Mortgaged Property. Any such exercise shall
be without regard to the Allocable Facility Amount assigned to such Mortgaged Property. Lender may recover an amount equal to the
full amount Outstanding in respect of any of the Notes in connection with such exercise. Any such amount shall be applied to the
Obligations as determined by Lender. 

(b)          Loss
of Right to Disbursements from Collateral Accounts. 

If an Event of Default
has occurred and is continuing, Borrower shall immediately lose all of its rights to receive disbursements from the Reserve/Escrow
Accounts and any Collateral Accounts. During the continuance of any such Event of Default, Lender may use the Reserve/Escrow Account
Funds and any Collateral Account Funds (or any portion thereof) for any purpose, including: 

(1)         repayment
of the Indebtedness, including principal prepayments and the Prepayment Premium applicable to such full or partial prepayment,
as applicable (however, such application of funds shall not cure or be deemed to cure any Event of Default); 

(2)         reimbursement
of Lender for all losses and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) suffered or incurred by Lender as a result of such Event
of Default; 

(3)         completion
of the Replacement or Repair or for any other replacement or repair to a Mortgaged Property; and 

(4)         payment
of any amount expended in exercising (and the exercise of) all rights and remedies available to Lender at law or in equity or under
this Master Agreement or under any of the other Loan Documents. 

Nothing in this Master
Agreement shall obligate Lender to apply all or any portion of the Reserve/Escrow Account Funds or Collateral Account Funds on
account of any Event of Default by Borrower or to repayment of the Indebtedness or in any specific order of priority. 

(c)          Remedies
Cumulative. 

Each right and remedy
provided in this Master Agreement is distinct from all other rights or remedies under this Master Agreement or any other Loan Document
or afforded by Applicable Law, and each shall be cumulative and may be exercised concurrently, independently or successively, in
any order. Lender shall not be required to demonstrate any actual impairment of its security or any increased risk of additional
default by Borrower in order to exercise any of its remedies with respect to an Event of Default. 

(d)          Operations
upon Event of Default; Lockbox Account. 

(1)         If
an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing: 

(A)         Borrower
shall or shall cause each Property Operator to, at the option of Lender, continue to provide all necessary services required under
each Facility Operating Agreement or applicable licensing or regulatory requirements to operate and manage the Mortgaged Property
as a Seniors Housing Facility and shall fully cooperate with Lender and any receiver as may be appointed by a court, in performing
these services and agrees to arrange for an orderly transition to a replacement property operator or provider of the necessary
services, and to execute promptly all applications, assignments, consents, and documents requested by Lender to facilitate such
transition; and 

(B)         Lender
may cause the removal of Borrower or any Property Operator (as applicable) from any Mortgaged Property operations. Until such time
as Lender has located a replacement property operator, Borrower or the acting Property Operator shall, to the extent permitted
under Applicable Laws, continue to provide all required services to maintain the Mortgaged Property in full compliance with all
License and regulatory requirements in accordance with the SASA. Borrower acknowledges that its failure to perform or to cause
the performance of this service shall constitute a form of waste of the Mortgaged Property, causing irreparable harm to Lender
and the Mortgaged Property, and shall constitute sufficient cause for the appointment of a receiver. 

(2)         In
addition to the remedies set forth herein and elsewhere in the Loan Documents, upon an Event of Default, Lender shall be entitled
to mandate the use of a lockbox bank account or other depositary account, to be maintained under the control and supervision of
Lender, for all income of the Mortgaged Property, including Rents, service charges, insurance payments, and Third Party Payments. 

Section 14.03         Additional
Lender Rights; Forbearance. 

(a)          No
Effect Upon Obligations. 

Lender may, but shall
not be obligated to, agree with Borrower, from time to time, and without giving notice to, or obtaining the consent of, or having
any effect upon the obligations of any Property Operator, Guarantor, Key Principal, or other third party obligor, to take any of
the following actions: 

(1)         the
time for payment of the principal of or interest on the Indebtedness may be extended, or the Indebtedness may be renewed in whole
or in part; 

(2)         the
rate of interest on or period of amortization of the Advances or the amount of the Monthly Debt Service Payments payable under
the Loan Documents may be modified; 

(3)         the
time for Borrower s performance of or compliance with any covenant or agreement contained in any Loan Document, whether presently
existing or hereinafter entered into, may be extended or such performance or compliance may be waived; 

(4)         any
or all payments due under this Master Agreement or any other Loan Document may be reduced; 

(5)         any
Loan Document may be modified or amended by Lender and Borrower in any respect, including an increase in the principal amount of
the Advances; 

(6)         any
amounts under this Master Agreement or any other Loan Document may be released; 

(7)         any
security for the Indebtedness may be modified, exchanged, released, surrendered, or otherwise dealt with, or additional security
may be pledged or mortgaged for the Indebtedness; 

(8)         the
payment of the Indebtedness or any security for the Indebtedness, or both, may be subordinated to the right to payment or the security,
or both, of any other present or future creditor of Borrower; or 

(9)         any
other terms of the Loan Documents may be modified. 

(b)          No
Waiver of Rights or Remedies. 

Any waiver of an Event
of Default or forbearance by Lender in exercising any right or remedy under this Master Agreement or any other Loan Document or
otherwise afforded by Applicable Law, shall not be a waiver of any other Event of Default or preclude the exercise or failure to
exercise of any other right or remedy. The acceptance by Lender of payment of all or any part of the Indebtedness after the due
date of such payment, or in an amount which is less than the required payment, shall not be a waiver of Lender s right to
require prompt payment when due of all other payments on account of the Indebtedness or to exercise any remedies for any failure
to make prompt payment. Enforcement by Lender of any security for the Indebtedness shall not constitute an election by Lender of
remedies so as to preclude the exercise or failure to exercise of any other right available to Lender. Lender s receipt of
any insurance proceeds or amounts in connection with a Condemnation Action shall not operate to cure or waive any Event of Default. 

(c)          Appointment
of Lender as Attorney-In-Fact. 

Borrower hereby irrevocably
makes, constitutes, and appoints Lender (and any officer of Lender or any Person designated by Lender for that purpose) as Borrower s
true and lawful proxy and attorney-in-fact (and agent-in-fact) in Borrower s name, place, and stead, with full power of substitution,
to: 

(1)         use
any of the funds in the Replacement Reserve Account or Repairs Escrow Account for the purpose of making or completing the Replacements
or Repairs; 

(2)         make
such additions, changes, and corrections to the Replacements or Repairs as shall be necessary or desirable to complete the Replacements
or Repairs; 

(3)         employ
such contractors, subcontractors, agents, architects, and inspectors as shall be required for such purposes; 

(4)         pay,
settle, or compromise all bills and claims for materials and work performed in connection with the Replacements or Repairs, or
as may be necessary or desirable for the completion of the Replacements or Repairs, or for clearance of title; 

(5)         adjust
and compromise any claims under any and all policies of insurance required pursuant to this Master Agreement and any other Loan
Document, subject only to Borrower s rights under this Master Agreement; 

(6)         appear
in and prosecute any action arising from any insurance policies; 

(7)         collect
and receive the proceeds of insurance, and to deduct from such proceeds Lender s expenses incurred in the collection of such
proceeds; 

(8)         commence,
appear in, and prosecute, in Lender s or Borrower s name, any Condemnation Action; 

(9)         settle
or compromise any claim in connection with any Condemnation Action; 

(10)        execute
all applications and certificates in the name of Borrower which may be required by any of the contract documents; 

(11)        prosecute
and defend all actions or proceedings in connection with any Mortgaged Property or the rehabilitation and repair of any Mortgaged
Property; 

(12)        take
such actions as are permitted in this Master Agreement and any other Loan Documents; 

(13)        execute
such financing statements and other documents and to do such other acts as Lender may require to perfect and preserve Lender s
security interest in, and to enforce such interests in, the collateral; and 

(14)        carry
out any remedy provided for in this Master Agreement and any other Loan Documents, including endorsing Borrower s name to
checks, drafts, instruments, and other items of payment and proceeds of the collateral, executing change of address forms with
the postmaster of the United States Post Office serving the address of Borrower, changing the address of Borrower to that of Lender,
opening all envelopes addressed to Borrower, and applying any payments contained therein to the Indebtedness. 

Borrower hereby acknowledges
that the constitution and appointment of such proxy and attorney-in-fact are coupled with an interest and are irrevocable and shall
not be affected by the disability or incompetence of Borrower. Borrower specifically acknowledges and agrees that this power of
attorney granted to Lender may be assigned by Lender to Lender s successors or assigns as holder of the Note (and the other
Loan Documents). The foregoing powers conferred on Lender under this Section 14.03(c) (Appointment of Lender as Attorney-In-Fact)
shall not impose any duty upon Lender to exercise any such powers and shall not require Lender to incur any expense or take any
action. Borrower hereby ratifies and confirms all that such attorney-in-fact may do or cause to be done by virtue of any provision
of this Master Agreement and any other Loan Documents. 

Notwithstanding the
foregoing provisions, Lender shall not exercise its rights as set forth in this Section 14.03(c) (Appointment of Lender as Attorney-In-Fact)
unless: (A) an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing or (B) Lender determines, in its discretion, that exigent circumstances
exist or that such exercise is necessary or prudent in order to protect and preserve the Mortgaged Property, or Lender s
lien priority and security interest in the Mortgaged Property. 

(d)          Borrower
Waivers. 

If more than one Person signs this Master
Agreement as Borrower, each Borrower, with respect to any other Borrower, hereby agrees that Lender, in its discretion, may: 

(1)         bring
suit against Borrower, or any one or more of Borrower, jointly and severally, or against any one or more of them; 

(2)         compromise
or settle with any one or more of the persons constituting Borrower, for such consideration as Lender may deem proper; 

(3)         release
one or more of the persons constituting Borrower, from liability; or 

(4)         otherwise
deal with Borrower, or any one or more of them, in any manner, and no such action shall impair the rights of Lender to collect
from any Borrower the full amount of the Indebtedness. 

Section 14.04         Waiver
of Marshaling. 

Notwithstanding the
existence of any other security interests in the Mortgaged Properties held by Lender or by any other party, Lender shall have the
right to determine the order in which any or all of the Mortgaged Properties (or any part thereof) shall be subjected to the remedies
provided in this Master Agreement, any other Loan Document or Applicable Law. Lender shall have the right to determine the order
in which all or any part of the Indebtedness is satisfied from the proceeds realized upon the exercise of such remedies. Borrower
and any party who now or in the future acquires a security interest in any Mortgaged Property and who has actual or constructive
notice of this Master Agreement waives any and all right to require the marshaling of assets or to require that any of the Mortgaged
Properties be sold in the inverse order of alienation or that any of the Mortgaged Properties be sold in parcels or as an entirety
in connection with the exercise of any of the remedies permitted by Applicable Law or provided in this Master Agreement or any
other Loan Documents. 

Lender shall account
for any moneys received by Lender in respect of any foreclosure on or disposition of collateral hereunder and under the other Loan
Documents provided that Lender shall not have any duty as to any collateral, and Lender shall be accountable only for amounts that
it actually receives as a result of the exercise of such powers. NONE OF LENDER OR ITS AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES,
AGENTS, OR REPRESENTATIVES SHALL BE RESPONSIBLE TO BORROWER (a) FOR ANY ACT OR FAILURE TO ACT UNDER ANY POWER OF ATTORNEY OR OTHERWISE,
EXCEPT IN RESPECT OF DAMAGES ATTRIBUTABLE SOLELY TO THEIR OWN GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT AS FINALLY DETERMINED PURSUANT
TO A FINAL, NON-APPEALABLE COURT ORDER BY A COURT OF COMPETENT JURISDICTION, NOR (b) FOR ANY PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL
DAMAGES. 

Section 14.05         Severed
Loan Documents. 

Lender shall have the
right from time to time to sever the Note and the other Loan Documents into one or more separate notes, mortgages, and other security
documents (the   Severed Loan Documents  ) in such denominations as Lender shall determine in its discretion for
purposes of evidencing and enforcing its rights and remedies provided hereunder, provided that: 

(a)          the
amount of Advances Outstanding immediately after the effective date of such modification equals the amount of Advances Outstanding
immediately prior to such modification; 

(b)          the
weighted average of the interest rates for Advances Outstanding immediately after the effective date of such modification equals
the weighted average of the interest rates for Advances Outstanding immediately prior to such modification; 

(c)          each
future principal payment shall be ratably allocated to each Advance based on the Outstanding principal balance of such Advance
at the time of such modification and each future amortization payment shall be ratably paid in accordance with such allocation
at all times; 

(d)          there
shall be no other change to the economic and/or other material terms, rights and obligations of Borrower or Guarantor under the
Loan Documents; and 

(e)          the
Collateral and the revenue therefrom shall continue to secure, and be available to be applied against, the total Advances Outstanding. 

Borrower shall execute
and deliver to Lender from time to time, promptly after the request of Lender, a severance agreement and such other documents
as Lender shall reasonably request in order to effect the severance described above, all in form and substance reasonably satisfactory
to Lender. Borrower hereby absolutely and irrevocably appoints Lender as its true and lawful attorney, coupled with an interest,
in its name and stead to make and execute all documents necessary or desirable to effect the aforesaid severance, Borrower ratifying
all that its said attorney shall do by virtue thereof;   provided  ,   however ,  Lender shall not make or
execute any such documents under such power until ten (10) Business Days after notice has been given to Borrower by Lender
of Lender s intent to exercise its rights under such power. Borrower shall be obligated to pay any costs or expenses incurred
in connection with the preparation, execution, recording, or filing of the Severed Loan Documents, and the Severed Loan Documents
shall not contain any representations, warranties, or covenants not contained in the Loan Documents and any such representations
and warranties contained in the Severed Loan Documents will be given by Borrower only as of the date last given.  

ARTICLE 15 
MISCELLANEOUS 

Section 15.01         Choice
of Law; Consent to Jurisdiction. 

Notwithstanding anything
in the Notes, the Security Documents, or any of the other Loan Documents to the contrary, each of the terms and provisions, and
rights and obligations of Borrower under this Master Agreement and the Notes and the other Loan Documents, shall be governed by,
interpreted, construed, and enforced pursuant to and in accordance with the laws of the District of Columbia (excluding the law
applicable to conflicts or choice of law) except to the extent of procedural and substantive matters relating only to the creation,
perfection, and foreclosure of liens and security interests, and enforcement of the rights and remedies, against the Mortgaged
Properties, which matters shall be governed by the laws of the jurisdiction in which a Mortgaged Property is located, the perfection,
the effect of perfection and non-perfection and foreclosure of security interests on personal property, which matters shall be
governed by the laws of the jurisdiction determined by the choice of law provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code in effect for
the jurisdiction in which any Borrower is organized. Borrower agrees that any controversy arising under or in relation to the Notes,
the Security Documents (other than the Security Instruments), or any other Loan Document shall be, except as otherwise provided
herein, litigated in the District of Columbia. The local and federal courts and authorities with jurisdiction in the District of
Columbia shall, except as otherwise provided herein, have jurisdiction over all controversies which may arise under or in relation
to the Loan Documents, including those controversies relating to the execution, jurisdiction, breach, enforcement, or compliance
with the Notes, the Security Documents (other than the Security Instruments), or any other issue arising under, relating to, or
in connection with any of the Loan Documents. Borrower irrevocably consents to service, jurisdiction, and venue of such courts
for any litigation arising from the Notes, the Security Documents, or any of the other Loan Documents, and waives any other venue
to which it might be entitled by virtue of domicile, habitual residence, or otherwise. Nothing contained herein, however, shall
prevent Lender from bringing any suit, action, or proceeding or exercising any rights against Borrower and against the collateral
in any other jurisdiction. Initiating such suit, action, or proceeding or taking such action in any other jurisdiction shall in
no event constitute a waiver of the agreement contained herein that the laws of the District of Columbia shall govern the rights
and obligations of Borrower and Lender as provided herein or the submission herein by Borrower to personal jurisdiction within
the District of Columbia. 

Section 15.02         Waiver
of Jury Trial. 

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT
PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, EACH OF BORROWER AND LENDER (a) COVENANTS AND AGREES NOT TO ELECT A TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT
TO ANY ISSUE ARISING OUT OF THIS MASTER AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT, OR THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PARTIES AS BORROWER
AND LENDER, THAT IS TRIABLE OF RIGHT BY A JURY AND (b) WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO SUCH ISSUE TO THE
EXTENT THAT ANY SUCH RIGHT EXISTS NOW OR IN THE FUTURE. THIS WAIVER OF RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IS SEPARATELY GIVEN BY EACH PARTY,
KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY WITH THE BENEFIT OF COMPETENT LEGAL COUNSEL 

Section 15.03         Notice. 

(a)          Process
of Serving Notice. 

Except as otherwise
set forth herein or in any other Loan Document, all notices under this Master Agreement and any other Loan Document shall be: 

(1)         in
writing and shall be: 

(A)         delivered,
in person; 

(B)         mailed,
postage prepaid, either by registered or certified delivery, return receipt requested; 

(C)         sent

(A)         the
date when the notice is received by the addressee; or 

(B)         if
the recipient refuses or rejects delivery, the date on which the notice is so refused or rejected, as conclusively established
by the records of the United States Postal Service or such express courier service. 

(b)          Change
of Address. 

Any party to this Master
Agreement may change the address to which notices intended for it are to be directed by means of notice given to the other parties
identified on the Summary of Master Terms in accordance with this Section 15.03 (Notice). 

(c)          Default
Method of Notice. 

Any required notice
under this Master Agreement or any other Loan Document which does not specify how notices are to be given shall be given in accordance
with this Section 15.03 (Notice). 

(d)          Receipt
of Notices. 

Neither Borrower nor
Lender shall refuse or reject delivery of any notice given in accordance with this Master Agreement. Each party is required to
acknowledge, in writing, the receipt of any notice upon request by the other party. 

(e)          Property
Operator Notices. 

Borrower acknowledges
and agrees that Borrower solely shall be responsible for (1) causing Property Operator to comply with any notice received by Borrower
from Lender, and (2) promptly providing Lender with copies of notices received by Borrower from Property Operator. Borrower s
compliance with or failure to act as an intermediary as described in this Section 15.03(e) (Property Operator Notices) shall not
relieve Borrower from its obligations under this Master Agreement, nor shall it constitute a defense or excuse for nonperformance
by Borrower, Property Operator, or any Guarantor, as applicable. Lender shall have no obligation to provide any notice to Property
Operator unless and until Lender has taken ownership or control of the Mortgaged Property, or in connection with Lender s
exercise of the power of attorney granted herein, and then only as required by the Loan Documents or the Facility Operating Agreement. 

Section 15.04         Successors
and Assigns Bound; Sale of Advances. 

(a)          Binding
Agreement. 

This Master Agreement
shall bind, and the rights granted by this Master Agreement shall inure to, the successors and assigns of Lender and the permitted
successors and assigns of Borrower. However, a Transfer not permitted by this Master Agreement shall be an Event of Default and
shall be void ab initio. 

(b)          Sale
of Advances; Change of Servicer. 

Nothing in this Master
Agreement shall limit Lender s (including its successors and assigns) right to sell or transfer the Advances or any interest
in the Advances. The Advances or a partial interest in the Advances (together with this Master Agreement and the other Loan Documents)
may be sold one or more times without prior written notice to Borrower. A sale may result in a change of the Loan Servicer. 

Section 15.05         Counterparts. 

This Master Agreement
may be executed in any number of counterparts with the same effect as if the parties hereto had signed the same document and all
such counterparts shall be construed together and shall constitute one instrument. 

Section 15.06         Intentionally
Deleted. 

Section 15.07         Relationship
of Parties; No Third Party Beneficiary. 

(a)          Solely
Creditor and Debtor. 

The relationship between
Lender and Borrower shall be solely that of creditor and debtor, respectively, and nothing contained in this Master Agreement shall
create any other relationship between Lender and Borrower, nor between Lender and Property Operator. Nothing contained in this
Master Agreement shall constitute Lender as a joint venturer, partner, or agent of Borrower or Property Operator, or render Lender
liable for any debts, obligations, acts, omissions, representations, or contracts of Borrower or Property Operator. 

(b)          No
Third Party Beneficiaries.

party to this Master Agreement and no other Person shall be a third party beneficiary of this Master Agreement or any other Loan
Document or any account created or contemplated under this Master Agreement or any other Loan Document. Nothing contained in this
Master Agreement shall be deemed or construed to create an obligation on the part of Lender to any third party nor shall any third
party have a right to enforce against Lender any right that Borrower may have under this Master Agreement. Without limiting the
foregoing: 

(1)         any
Servicing Arrangement between Lender and any Loan Servicer shall constitute a contractual obligation of such Loan Servicer that
is independent of the obligation of Borrower for the payment of the Indebtedness; 

(2)         Borrower
shall not be a third party beneficiary of any Servicing Arrangement; and 

(3)         no
payment by the Loan Servicer under any Servicing Arrangement will reduce the amount of the Indebtedness. 

Section 15.08         Severability;
Entire Agreement; Amendments. 

The invalidity or unenforceability

Aggregate Debt Service Coverage Ratio will not be reduced and the Aggregate Loan to Value Ratio will not be increased as a result
of such Release. 

(c)          Release
Price  

(1)         The
 Release Price  for each Release Mortgaged Property means the greater of 

(A)         one
hundred percent (100%) of the Allocable Facility Amount for the Release Mortgaged Property; and 

(B)         one
hundred percent (100%) of the amount, if any, of Advances Outstanding that are required to be repaid by Borrower to Lender
in connection with the proposed Release of the Release Mortgaged Property from the Collateral Pool so that, immediately after the
Release, the provisions of Section (b) (Underwriting) of this Mortgaged Property Release Schedule shall be satisfied. 

(2)         In
addition to the Release Price, Borrower shall pay to Lender all associated Prepayment Premiums and other amounts due under the
Notes evidencing the Advances being repaid. In connection with a Staggered Substitution, Borrower shall post a Substitution Deposit
(which shall include the Release Price) pursuant to the terms of this Mortgaged Property Release Schedule. 

(d)          Application
of Release Price.  

(1)         The
Release Price for the Release Mortgaged Property shall be applied in reduction of the principal amounts of the Advances Outstanding
in the order selected by Borrower, provided that (A) any amount of the Note that Borrower elects to prepay must be prepaid in full
or, if the Release Price is not sufficient to do so, the Note shall be the only Note partially prepaid; (B) prepayment is permitted
under such Note; (C) any Prepayment Premium due and owing is paid; and (D) interest is paid through the end of the month. If Borrower
does not give Lender direction with respect to the application of the Release Price or if the selected Note does not comply with
the provisions of (A) and (B) above, then the Release Price shall be applied: 

(i)          first
against any Variable Advances Outstanding so long as the prepayment is permitted under the Variable Note (and any Prepayment Premium
due and owing is paid), until any Variable Advance is no longer Outstanding (provided that, in the event there are multiple Variable
Advances Outstanding, Lender shall determine the order of application of the Release Price taking into account factors including
the unpaid principal balances of the Variable Notes, and which Variable Note Outstanding has the lowest prepayment costs or highest
interest rate); 

(ii)         then
against any Fixed Advances Outstanding, so long as prepayment is permitted under the applicable Fixed Note (and any Prepayment
Premium due and owing is paid) (provided that, in the event there are multiple Fixed Advances Outstanding, Lender shall determine
the order of application of the Release Price taking into account factors including the unpaid principal balances of the Fixed
Notes, and which Fixed Note Outstanding has the lowest prepayment costs or the highest interest rate). 

The Note to be prepaid or partially
prepaid as determined pursuant to this Section (d) (Application of Release Price), shall be referred to as the   Selected
Advance  . 

(2)         In
connection with a Substitution, Borrower may substitute a Mortgaged Property that has an estimated Allocable Facility Amount that
is less than the Allocable Facility Amount of the Release Mortgaged Property so long as Borrower pays the Release Price associated
with the difference between such Allocable Facility Amounts. 

(e)          Conditions
Precedent.  

The Release of a Mortgaged
Property from the Collateral Pool is subject to the satisfaction of the following conditions precedent on or before the Effective
Date: 

(1)         the
Selected Advance must be prepayable as of the Effective Date of the Release of such Mortgaged Property; 

(2)         receipt
by Lender of the fully executed Release Request; 

(3)         immediately
after giving effect to the requested Release, the provisions of Section (b) (Underwriting) of this Mortgaged Property Release Schedule
are satisfied; 

(4)         receipt
by Lender of the Release Price and all amounts owing under Section (c) (Release Price) of this Mortgaged Property Release Schedule,
or, in connection with a Staggered Substitution, receipt by Lender of the Substitution Deposit (inclusive of the Substitution Cost
Deposit) to the extent necessary under Section (g)(1) (The Substitution Deposit) of this Mortgaged Property Release Schedule; 

(5)         receipt
by Lender of the Release Fee, or in connection with a Substitution, receipt by Lender of the Substitution Fee (it being agreed
that no Release Fee is payable in connection with a Substitution or Staggered Substitution unless the Addition fails to close); 

(6)         receipt
by Lender of all legal fees and expenses in connection with a Release Request; 

(7)         receipt
by Lender of one (1) or more executed, original counterparts of all Release Documents, dated as of the Effective Date, each
of which shall be in full force and effect, in form and substance satisfactory to Lender in all respects; 

(8)         if
required by Lender, amendments to this Master Agreement, the Notes and the Security Instruments, reflecting the release of the
Release Mortgaged Property from the Collateral Pool and, as to any Security Instrument or Note so amended or if Lender reasonably
determines that such endorsement is necessary to maintain the priority of the Lien created in favor of Lender with respect to the
Outstanding Indebtedness or to maintain the validity of any Title Policy, the receipt by Lender of an endorsement to each Title
Policy insuring the Security Instruments, amending the effective date of each Title Policy to the Effective Date and showing no
additional exceptions to coverage other than the exceptions shown on the initial Effective Date for such Mortgaged Property, Permitted
Encumbrances and other exceptions approved by Lender; 

(9)         satisfaction
of all applicable General Conditions; 

(10)        if
the Release Mortgaged Property is one phase of a project, and one or more other phases of the project are Mortgaged Properties
which will remain in the Collateral Pool (   Remaining Mortgaged
Properties   ), the Remaining Mortgaged Properties must be able to be operated separately from the Release Mortgaged
Property and any other phases of the project which are not Mortgaged Properties, taking into account any cross use agreements or
easements, access, utilities, marketability, community services, ownership and operation of the Remaining Mortgaged Properties
and any other relevant factors pursuant to the Underwriting and Servicing Requirements. Borrower shall deliver to Lender evidence
satisfactory to Lender that this condition precedent is satisfied prior to the closing of the transaction that is the subject of
the Request. Borrower acknowledges that none of the Initial Mortgaged Properties are part of a phase of a project; 

(11)        after
the Release no Borrower, nor any remaining managing member, sole member or general partner of Borrower, owns the Release Mortgaged
Property or any portion thereof; 

(12)        receipt
by Lender of endorsements to the tie-in endorsements of the Title Policies, if deemed necessary by Lender, to reflect the Release.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no Release of any Mortgaged Property in the Collateral Pool shall be made unless
Borrower has provided title insurance to Lender in respect of each of the remaining Mortgaged Properties in the Collateral Pool
in an amount equal to one hundred twenty-five percent (125%)   of the Initial Valuation of such Mortgaged Properties
(which amount shall take into account the title insurance coverage provided by any  tie-in  endorsements); and 

(13)        receipt
by Lender on the Effective Date of a Confirmation of Obligations and a Confirmation of Guaranty. 

(f)          Closing.  

If all conditions precedent
contained in this Master Agreement are satisfied, Lender shall cause the Release Mortgaged Property to be Released on an Effective
Date mutually selected by Lender and Borrower, and occurring within thirty (30) days after Lender s receipt of the Release
Request (or on such other date as Borrower and Lender may agree), by executing and delivering, and causing all applicable parties
to execute and deliver, all at the sole cost and expense of Borrower, the Release Documents. If approved by Lender, Borrower may
prepare the Release Documents and submit them to Lender for its review. 

(g)          Staggered
Substitution Specific Terms.  

The following provisions
are applicable to Staggered Substitutions only: 

(1)         The
Substitution Deposit. 

If a Substitution
is a Staggered Substitution, on or before the Effective Date of the Release of the Release Mortgaged Property, Borrower shall deposit
with Lender the   Substitution Deposit   described below in the form of cash in a non-interest bearing account
held by Lender as additional Collateral. In lieu of (or in addition to) depositing cash for the Substitution Deposit, Borrower
may post a Letter of Credit as additional Collateral issued by a financial institution reasonably acceptable to Lender in accordance
with the Letter of Credit Schedule, with a face amount available to be drawn equal to the Substitution Deposit (less any amount
deposited in cash) as additional Collateral. 

(2)         Substitution
Deposit Amount. 

(A)         The
  Substitution Deposit   for each proposed Staggered Substitution shall be an amount equal to the sum of: 

(i)          the
Release Price relating to the Release Mortgaged Property; plus 

(ii)         any
and all Prepayment Premiums, as applicable, for the Selected Advance determined in accordance with the conditions set forth in
Section (d) (Application of Release Price) of this Mortgaged Property Release Schedule, as the Advance(s) that shall be prepaid
if the Substitution fails to take place. The Prepayment Premium shall be calculated as of the end of the month in which the Property
Delivery Deadline occurs, as if the Selected Advance were to be prepaid in such month; plus 

(iii)        estimated
costs, expenses and fees of Lender and Fannie Mae pertaining to the Substitution (such costs, fees and expenses, the   Substitution
Cost Deposit  ); 

(iv)        without
duplication to any other amounts included in the definition of Substitution Deposit, in the event that (1) at the time of the Release
no Note is prepayable (i.e. all Notes are subject to a lockout period) or (2) the Release Price is in excess of all Notes that
are open to prepayment, all scheduled principal and interest due and owing through the end of the lockout period with respect to
such Selected Advance. 

The amount of
the required Substitution Deposit shall be recalculated by Lender in the event the Property Delivery Deadline is extended pursuant
to Section (e) (Closing) of the Mortgaged Property Addition Schedule, and in the event a Substitution is partially satisfied by
the Addition of an Additional Mortgaged Property, as further set forth in Section (f)(2)) (Substitution Deposit Disbursement and
Recalculation) of the Mortgaged Property Addition Schedule. 

(B)         The
Substitution Cost Deposit shall be used by Lender to cover all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by Lender and
Fannie Mae, including any out-of-pocket legal fees and expenses incurred by Fannie Mae and Lender in connection with such Substitution
whether such Substitution actually closes (the   Substitution Costs  ). 

(3)         Continued
Obligations; Restriction on Borrowings. 

(A)         Borrower
shall continue to be obligated to make any regularly scheduled payments of principal and interest due under all Notes Outstanding
during the Staggered Substitution period. Until the completion of the Staggered Substitution, no Future Advances will be permitted
unless and until the provisions of Section (f)(1) (Failure to Close Substitution) of the Mortgaged Property Addition Schedule are
satisfied. 

(B)         In
connection with a Staggered Substitution, until the Addition of the Additional Mortgaged Property to the Collateral Pool and closing
of the Substitution occurs, no Future Advances or other Requests will be permitted, provided that a Termination Request shall be
permitted subject to satisfaction of the conditions in Section 2.11 (Termination of Master Agreement), and a Conversion pursuant
to a Conversion Request shall be permitted subject to satisfaction of the conditions in the Conversion Schedule; provided further,
however, with respect to any Conversion, the Substitution Deposit shall be recalculated based on the provisions in Section (g)
(Staggered Substitution Specific Terms) of this Mortgaged Property Release Schedule and Borrower shall deposit with Lender as additional
Collateral all increases, if any, in such Substitution Deposit within five (5) days after receipt of notice of the same). 

(C)         Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Master Agreement, no Staggered Substitution shall be permitted unless immediately after the Release
of the Release Mortgaged Property the requirements in Section 2.10(e) (Limitation on Collateral Events) are satisfied. 

(h)          Release
of Borrower, Guarantor, and Property Operator.  

Upon the Release of a Mortgaged
Property, Borrower that is the owner of such Release Mortgaged Property (assuming Borrower owns no other Mortgaged Property in
the Collateral Pool), Guarantor, and Property Operator shall be released automatically of all obligations solely related to the
Release Mortgaged Property as set forth in this Master Agreement and the other Loan Documents, except for any provisions of this
Master Agreement and the other Loan Documents that are expressly stated to survive any release or termination or for any liabilities
or obligations of such Borrower, Guarantor, or Property Operator which arose prior to the Effective Date of such Release.

(Collateral Events) of this Master Agreement shall be subject to the terms of this Master Agreement including this Mortgaged Property
Addition Schedule. 

(a)          Request.

(C)         in

Debt Service Coverage Ratio of the Collateral Pool immediately prior to the Release (taking into account any paydown Borrower may
make in order to comply with such ratio, subject to the terms of this Master Agreement); and 

(D)         in
connection with a Substitution, the Aggregate Loan to Value Ratio of the Collateral Pool will not be greater than the Aggregate

the provisions of Section 2.10(e) (Limitation on Collateral Events) shall be satisfied. 

(2)         Lender
shall evaluate the proposed Additional Mortgaged Property in accordance with the Underwriting and Servicing Requirements. Lender
shall determine the Loan to Value Ratio of the proposed Additional Mortgaged Property and the Aggregate Loan to Value Ratio applicable
to the Collateral Pool on the basis of the lesser of: 

(A)         the
acquisition price of the proposed Additional Mortgaged Property, if purchased by Borrower within twelve (12) months of the
related Addition Request, and 

(B)         a

(3)         After
receipt of the Addition Request and all reports, certificates and documents required by Lender to determine compliance with this
Mortgaged Property Addition Schedule, Lender shall notify Borrower whether the proposed Additional Mortgaged Property meets the
requirements for Additions set forth in this Mortgaged Property Addition Schedule. 

(4)         If

any Future Advance made in connection with an Addition) the Advance amount that shall result from the Addition. 

(c)          Additional
Borrower.  

On the Effective Date of
the Addition of an Additional Mortgaged Property, the owner of such Additional Mortgaged Property, if such owner is an Additional
Borrower, shall become a party to the Contribution Agreement in a manner satisfactory to Lender. Any Additional Borrower shall
join into this Master Agreement and other Loan Documents and shall execute and deliver to Lender an amendment adding such Additional
Borrower as a party to this Master Agreement and revising the Schedules and Exhibits hereto, as applicable, to reflect the Additional
Mortgaged Property and Additional Borrower, in each case satisfactory to Lender. Any Additional Borrower and any related general
partner, sole member or managing member must comply with the provisions of this Master Agreement, including the Single Purpose
requirements of Section 4.01(h) (Borrower Status   Representations and Warranties   Single Purpose Status) unless otherwise

by Lender of all Property-Related Documents; 

(5)         receipt
by Lender of a Request Opinion; and 

(6)         receipt
by Lender of a licensing opinion in form and substance satisfactory to Lender in all respects. 

(e)          Closing.  

(1)         Additions.  

Other than in
connection with a Substitution, if the proposed Additional Mortgaged Property meets the conditions set forth in this Mortgaged
Property Addition Schedule, and Borrower timely elects to add the proposed Additional Mortgaged Property to a Collateral Pool,
the proposed Additional Mortgaged Property shall be added to the Collateral Pool on an Effective Date mutually selected by Lender
and Borrower, occurring within thirty (30) Business Days after all of the conditions for an Addition have been satisfied (or
on such other date as Borrower and Lender may agree). 

(2)         Substitutions.  

In connection
with a Substitution, if the Additional Mortgaged Property satisfies the conditions set forth herein and Borrower timely elects
to proceed with the Substitution, the proposed Additional Mortgaged Property shall be added in replacement of the Mortgaged Property
being released on an Effective Date selected by Lender and occurring: 

(A)         if
the Substitution of the proposed Additional Mortgaged Property is to occur simultaneously with the release of the Release Mortgaged
Property, within sixty (60) days after Lender s receipt of Borrower s Release Request indicating there is to be
a Substitution (or on such other date to which Borrower and Lender may agree); or 

(B)         if
the Substitution is a Staggered Substitution, within ninety (90) days after the release of such Release Mortgaged Property
(provided such date shall be extended an additional ninety (90) days if Borrower provides reasonable evidence of Borrower s
diligent efforts in finding a suitable proposed Additional Mortgaged Property) (the   Property Delivery Deadline  )
in accordance with the terms of the Mortgaged Property Release Schedule and this Mortgaged Property Addition Schedule. 

(f)          Staggered
Substitutions.  

(1)         Failure
to Close Substitution. 

If the Substitution
of the proposed Additional Mortgaged Property does not occur by the Property Delivery Deadline, then such Borrower shall have irrevocably
waived its right to substitute such Release Mortgaged Property with the proposed Additional Mortgaged Property, and the release
of the Release Mortgaged Property shall be deemed to be a Release pursuant to the terms of the Mortgaged Property Release Schedule
and shall trigger payment pursuant to the terms of the Mortgaged Property Release Schedule, plus the Release Fee. 

(2)         Substitution
Deposit Disbursement and Recalculation. 

(A)         On
or prior to the Effective Date of the Substitution, Lender shall notify Borrower of the actual amount of the Substitution Costs
incurred by Lender and Fannie Mae in connection with the Substitution and Borrower shall, on or before the Effective Date of the
Substitution, pay to Lender the remainder of such Substitution Costs (if the actual amount of the Substitution Costs exceed the
Substitution Cost Deposit (as defined in Section (g) (Staggered Substitution Specific Terms) of the Mortgaged Property Release
Schedule) and the other amounts previously deposited with Lender by Borrower) or Lender shall promptly refund to Borrower any Substitution
Cost Deposit deposited with Lender by Borrower in excess of the Substitution Costs (if the actual amount of the Substitution Costs
is less than the Substitution Cost Deposit deposited with Lender by Borrower). 

(B)         At
closing of the Substitution, Lender shall disburse or return the Substitution Deposit (as defined in Section (g) (Staggered Substitution
Specific Terms) of the Mortgaged Property Release Schedule), as applicable (less any portion of the Substitution Cost Deposit used
by Lender to cover all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by Lender and Fannie Mae, including any out-of-pocket
legal fees and expenses incurred by Fannie Mae and Lender in connection with such Substitution), directly to Borrower at such time
as the conditions precedent for the Substitution have been satisfied, which must occur no later than the Property Delivery Deadline. 

(C)         If,
pursuant to Section (b) (Underwriting) of this Mortgaged Property Addition Schedule, Borrower substitutes a Mortgaged Property
that has an estimated Allocable Facility Amount that is less than the Allocable Facility Amount of the Release Mortgaged Property
and Borrower notifies Lender that no further property will be substituted or Borrower fails to timely identify an additional replacement
Mortgaged Property, then Lender shall disburse to Borrower that portion of the Substitution Deposit (less any portion of the Substitution
Cost Deposit used by Lender to cover all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by Lender and Fannie Mae, including
any out-of-pocket legal fees and expenses incurred by Fannie Mae and Lender in connection with such Substitution) equal to the
Allocable Facility Amount of such substitute Mortgaged Property and apply the remainder of the Substitution Deposit pursuant to
Section (d) (Application of Release Price) of the Mortgaged Property Release Schedule. 

(D)         Notwithstanding
the foregoing, in the event that (i) the Property Delivery Deadline is extended pursuant to Section (e)(2)(B) (Closing) of this
Mortgaged Property Addition Schedule or (ii) Borrower adds an Additional Mortgaged Property to the Collateral Pool prior to the
Property Delivery Deadline but the addition of such Additional Mortgaged Property has not in and of itself satisfied the requirements
of this Mortgaged Property Addition Schedule, Lender shall recalculate the Substitution Deposit. Any reduction, if any, in the
Substitution Deposit shall be returned to Borrower, or in the case of a Letter of Credit, such Letter of Credit shall be reduced
by such reduction in the Substitution Deposit. Any increase, if any, in the Substitution Deposit shall be paid by Borrower to Lender
within three (3) Business Days of notice from Lender.
