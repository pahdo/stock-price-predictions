EXPLANATORY NOTE

This Amendment is being filed to correct a typographical error relating to the date of the audit report of BDO USA, LLP, our Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm, that had appeared on page F-1 of the original Form 10-K of Dynatronics Corporation for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016.  The correct date of the report is September 28, 2016 and a copy of the report, with the corrected date, is included with this Amendment.  The corrected report replaces in its entirety the report originally included on page F-1 under "Part IV-Item 15. Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules."

Except as expressly set forth above, this Amendment does not, and does not purport to, amend, update or restate the information in any other item of the original Form 10-K or reflect any events that have occurred after the filing of the original Form 10-K.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

Board of Directors and Stockholders

Dynatronics Corporation

Cottonwood Heights, Utah

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Dynatronics Corporation ("Company") as of June 30, 2016 and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for the year then ended.  These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.  Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit.

We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States).  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. Our audit included consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.  An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Dynatronics Corporation at June 30, 2016, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
