     Table of Contents            PETRICHOR CORP.     NOTES TO THE CONDENSED UNAUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS    AUGUST 31, 2016       NOTE 1   SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES       Organization and Description of Business      PETRICHOR CORP. ("the Company") was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada, U.S. on January 14, 2014. Since inception through August 31, 2016 the Company has generated $1,560 in revenue and has accumulated losses of $54,865.      Accounting Basis      The Company uses the accrual basis of accounting and accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP" accounting). The Company has adopted May 31 fiscal year end.      Use of Estimates      The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.      Recent accounting pronouncements      Management has considered all recent accounting pronouncements issued. The Company's management believes that these recent pronouncements will not have a material effect on the Company's financial statements.      NOTE 2   CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS      The accompanying financial statements have been prepared by the Company without audit. In the opinion of management, all adjustments (which include only normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly the financial positions, results of operations, and cash flows on August 31, 2016, and for all periods presented herein, have been made.     Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in the financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America have been condensed or omitted. It is suggested that these condensed financial statements be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s May 31, 2016 audited financial statements. The results of operations for the three months ended August 31, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full year.      NOTE 3   GOING CONCERN      The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principle, which contemplate continuation of the Company as a going concern. The Company currently has limited working capital, and has not completed its efforts to establish a stabilized source of revenues sufficient to cover operating costs over an extended period of time.                   6

Designating 4,000,000 shares of Blank Check PS as Series A Preferred Stock ( Series A PS ), which Series A PS has the same rights, preferences, powers, privileges and restrictions, qualifications and limitations as the Company s common stock, with the exception that (i) each share of Series A PS is entitled to 2 votes on all matters submitted to the Company s shareholders for a vote; and (ii) the Series A PS shall convert, on a share for share basis, into shares of the Company s common stock, at the earlier to occur of the following: (A) any shares of Series A PS that are transferred by the initial holder thereof to an unaffiliated person or entity shall automatically upon said transfer convert to shares of the Company s common stock; and (B) shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall convert to Company common stock at the election of the holder thereof, upon notice to the Company.

     Table of Contents           ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS        FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS      Statements made in this Form 10-Q that are not historical or current facts are "forward-looking statements" made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Act") and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements often can be identified by the use of terms such as "may," "will," "expect," "believe," "anticipate," "estimate," "approximate" or "continue," or the negative thereof. We intend that such forward-looking statements be subject to the safe harbors for such statements. We wish to caution readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. Any forward-looking statements represent management's best judgment as to what may occur in the future. However, forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and important factors beyond our control that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from historical results of operations and events and those presently anticipated or projected. We disclaim any obligation subsequently to revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statement or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events.      General       Petrichor Corp. was incorporated in the State of Nevada on January 14, 2014 and established a fiscal year end of May 31. We have minimal assets and have incurred losses since inception. We are a development-stage company formed to commence operations in the business of web-based human translation. As of today, we have registered our company, developed our business plan and registered a domain name for our web site. To date, we recognized the $1,560 of revenue.      Petrichor Corp. hoped to position itself to take full advantage of the fast growing Internet industry. Our concept would allow anyone who has a mobile device or computer and access to the Internet to send us documents for translation from different languages.      On April 22, 2016, Liudmila Shokhina, the principal shareholder of the Company, consummated the transactions contemplated by a Stock Purchase Agreement, dated April 4, 2016, which provided for the sale of 5,000,000 shares of common stock of the Company (the  Shares ) to Chun-Hao Chang (the  Purchaser ). The consideration paid for the Shares, which represent 65.96% of the issued and outstanding share capital of the Company on a fully-diluted basis, was $242,750. The source of the cash consideration for the Shares was personal funds of the Purchaser. In connection with the transaction, Mrs. Shokhina released the Company from all debts owed to her.     On May 2, 2016, the existing director and officer, Chun-Hao Chang appointed Mei-Chun Lin as the Chief Financial Officer of the Company and to serve on the Company s board of directors.     There are no arrangements or understandings among members of both the former and new control persons and their associates with respect to the election of directors of the Company or other matters.      Our Services       Petrichor Corp. is online-only translation company. We plan to provide on-demand human-translation services to businesses, individuals, and enterprises. Web-based human translation is generally favored by companies and individuals that wish to secure more accurate translations. In view of the frequent inaccuracy of machine translations, we believe that human translation remains the most reliable, most accurate form of translation available. While not instantaneous like its machine counterparts such as Google Translate and Yahoo! Babel Fish, web-based human translation has been gaining popularity by providing relatively fast, accurate translation for business communications, legal documents, medical records, and software localization. Web-based human translation also appeals to private website users and bloggers. The Company has recently abandoned this business strategy as it looks to shift its focus to a yet to be determined business plan.                  8       
     Table of Contents           RESULTS OF OPERATION      We have incurred recurring losses to date. Our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in operation. We expect we will require additional capital to meet our long term operating requirements. We expect to raise additional capital through, among other things, the sale of equity or debt securities.      THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 31, 2016 COMPARED TO THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 31, 2015      Our net loss for the three-month period ended August 31, 2016 was $17,358 compared to a net loss of $4,340 during the three-month period ended August 31, 2015. During the three-month period ended August 31, 2016 and August 31, 2015 we did not generate any revenue.     During the three-month period ended August 31, 2016, we incurred general and administrative expenses of $17,358 compared to $4,340 incurred during the three-month period ended August 31, 2015. General and administrative expenses incurred during the three-month period ended August 31, 2016 were generally related to corporate overhead, financial and administrative contracted services, such as legal and accounting and developmental costs.      LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES       THREE MONTH PERIOD ENDED AUGUST 31, 2016      As of August 31, 2016, our current assets were $833 compared to $3,333 in current assets at May 31, 2016. Current assets were comprised of $833 in prepaid expenses. As of August 31, 2016, our current liabilities were $22,114. Current liabilities were comprised of $21,796 in advances from a Director and $318 in account payable.     Stockholders  deficit was $20,801 as of August 31, 2016 compared to stockholder s deficit of $3,443 as of May 31, 2016.       CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES      We have not generated positive cash flows from operating activities. For the three-month period ended August 31, 2016, net cash flows used in operating activities was $16,796  consisting of a net loss of $17,358, increase in prepaid expenses of $2,500, increase in accounts payable of $1,978 and depreciation of $40. Net cash flows used in operating activities was $4,300, consisting of a net loss of $4,340 and depreciation of $40, during three-month period ended August 31, 2015.      CASH FLOWS FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES      We neither generated, nor used, funds in investing activities during the three-month period ended August 31, 2016. Net cash flows used in investing activities was $0 during three-month period ended August 31, 2015.      CASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES      We have financed our operations primarily from either advances from shareholders or the issuance of equity instruments. For the three month periods ended August 31, 2016, net cash provided by financing activities was $16,796. During three-month period ended August 31, 2015, net cash flows from financing activities was $0.                  9       
     Table of Contents          PLAN OF OPERATION AND FUNDING      We expect that working capital requirements will continue to be funded through a combination of our existing funds and further issuances of securities. Our working capital requirements are expected to increase in line with the growth of our business.     Existing working capital, further advances and debt instruments, and anticipated cash flow are expected to be adequate to fund our operations over the next three months. We have no lines of credit or other bank financing arrangements. Generally, we have financed operations to date through the proceeds of the private placement of equity and debt instruments. In connection with our business plan, management anticipates additional increases in operating expenses and capital expenditures relating to: (i) acquisition of inventory; (ii) developmental expenses associated with a start-up business; and (iii) marketing expenses. We intend to finance these expenses with further issuances of securities, and debt issuances. Thereafter, we expect we will need to raise additional capital and generate revenues to meet long-term operating requirements. Additional issuances of equity or convertible debt securities will result in dilution to our current shareholders. Further, such securities might have rights, preferences or privileges senior to our common stock. Additional financing may not be available upon acceptable terms, or at all. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, we may not be able to take advantage of prospective new business endeavors or opportunities, which could significantly and materially restrict our business operations.      MATERIAL COMMITMENTS      As of August 31, 2016, we had no material commitments.         PURCHASE OF SIGNIFICANT EQUIPMENT      We do not intend to purchase any significant equipment during the next twelve months.       OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS      As of the date of this Quarterly Report, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.      GOING CONCERN      The independent auditors' audit report accompanying our May 31, 2016 financial statements contained an explanatory paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements have been prepared "assuming that we will continue as a going concern," which contemplates that we will realize our assets and satisfy our liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business.       ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.       No report required.       ITEM 4.
