 1. Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies  
 The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of FTI Consulting, Inc., including its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively, the  Company,   we,   our,  or  FTI Consulting ), presented herein, have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ) and under the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) for interim financial information. Some of the information and footnote disclosures normally included in annual financial statements have been condensed or omitted pursuant to those rules and regulations. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. In management s opinion, the interim financial statements reflect all adjustments that are necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim periods presented. All adjustments made were normal recurring accruals. Results of operations for the interim periods presented herein are not necessarily indicative of results of operations for a full year. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the SEC.  

2. Earnings Per Common Share  
 Basic earnings per common share are calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per common share adjust basic earnings per common share for the effects of potentially dilutive common shares. Potentially dilutive common shares include the dilutive effects of shares issuable under our equity compensation plans, including stock options and restricted stock using the treasury stock method.  

3. New Accounting Standards 
   
 In August 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) 2016-15,  Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments , which clarifies how cash receipts and cash payments are classified in the statement of cash flows. This standard is effective January 1, 2018, although early adoption is permitted.  We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
 In   March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09,  Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718):     Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting . This standard makes several modifications to Topic 718, including the accounting for forfeitures, employer tax withholding on share-based compensation and income tax consequences, which are intended to simplify various aspects of the accounting for share-based compensation. ASU 2016-09 also clarifies the statement of cash flows presentation for certain components of share-based awards. The standard is effective beginning January 1, 2017, although early adoption is permitted. We do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 
   In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842) , that replaces existing lease guidance. Under this ASU, leases will be required to record right-of-use assets and corresponding lease liabilities on the balance sheet. This guidance is effective  
 7 

beginning January 1, 2019. The new standard is required to be applied with a modified retrospective approach to each prior reporting period presented. We have not yet determined   the impact that the adoption of this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements.   
 In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) . Under this ASU and subsequently issued amendments, revenue is recognized at the time when goods or services are transferred to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. Companies may use either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach to adopt this ASU. This guidance is effective beginning January 1, 2018. We are currently evaluating how the adoption of this accounting standard will impact our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures, including the transition approach. 

4. Special Charges  
 There were no special charges recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2016.  
 During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded special charges of $6.8 million related to the employee terminations in the health solutions practice of our Forensic and Litigation Consulting segment and employee terminations in our Technology segment.   
 Activity related to the liability for special charges recorded prior to 2016 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is as follows:  

(1)    
 
 Excludes $0.2 million in net non-cash expense reversals.    

A liability for the current and noncurrent portions of the amounts to be paid is included in  Accounts payable, accrued expenses and other  and  Other liabilities,  respectively, on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. Of the $11.5 million liability for special charges, $1.9 million is expected to be paid during the remainder of 2016, $4.1 million is expected to be paid in 2017, $2.6 million is expected to be paid in 2018, $1.2 million is expected to be paid in 2019 and the remaining balance of $1.7 million is expected to be paid between 2020 and 2026.  

5. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts and Unbilled Services  
 We record adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts and unbilled services as a reduction in revenue when there are changes in estimates of fee reductions that may be imposed by bankruptcy courts and other regulatory institutions, for both billed and unbilled receivables. The allowance for doubtful accounts and unbilled services is also adjusted after the related work has been billed to the client and we discover that collectability is not reasonably assured. These adjustments are included in  Selling, general and administrative expenses  on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income and totaled $1.6 million and $5.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and $3.8 million and $10.4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively.  

6. Research and Development Costs  
 Research and development costs related to software development totaled $4.5 million and $13.0 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and $4.0 million and $14.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. Research and development costs are included in  Selling, general and administrative expenses  on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.

7. Financial   Instruments   
 Fair Value of Financial Instruments  
 We consider the recorded value of certain financial assets and liabilities, which consist primarily of cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable, to approximate the fair value of the respective assets and liabilities at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, based on the short-term nature of the assets and liabilities. The fair value of our long-term debt at September 30, 2016 was $490.8 million compared to a carrying value of $475.0 million. At December 31, 2015, the fair value of our long-term debt was $513.5 million compared to a carrying value of $500.0 million. We determine the fair value of our 6% Senior Notes Due 2022 ( 2022 Notes ) primarily based on quoted market prices. The fair value of our borrowings on our $550.0 million s enior secured bank revolving credit facility (  Senior Bank Credit Facility ) approximates the carrying amount. The fair value of our long-term debt is classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, because it is traded in less active markets. 
 We estimate the fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration based on the present value of the consideration expected to be paid during the remainder of the earn-out period, based on management s assessment of the acquired operations  forecasted earnings. This fair value measure is based on significant inputs not observed in the market and thus represents a Level 3 measurement. The fair value of future expected acquisition-related contingent consideration obligations was $5.2 million at September 30, 2016, with payment dates extending through 2018. 
 The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurements of our acquisition-related contingent consideration include our measures of the future profitability and related cash flows of the acquired business or assets, impacted by appropriate discount rates. Significant increases (decreases) in any of these inputs in isolation would result in a significantly lower (higher) fair value measurement. Generally, a change in the assumptions used for the discount rates is accompanied by a directionally opposite change in the fair value measurement and a change in the assumptions used for the future cash flows is accompanied by a directionally similar change in the fair value measurement. The fair value of the contingent consideration is reassessed on a quarterly basis by the Company using additional information as it becomes available.  
 Any change in the fair value of an acquisition s contingent consideration liability results in a remeasurement gain or loss that is recorded as income or expense, respectively, and is included in  Acquisition-related contingent consideration  on the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. There was no remeasurement gain or loss recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2016.  During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we recorded a $1.0 million expense related to the increase in the liability for future expected contingent consideration payments, driven by improved business results in the current period as well as expected results during the remainder of the earn-out period.  No remeasurement gain or loss was recorded for the three months ended September 30, 2015. During the nine months ended September 30, 2015, we recorded a $1.7 million gain related to the change in fair value of future contingent consideration payments, of which $1.5 million related to a termination of a contingent consideration arrangement for which no future payments will be made.   

8. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets  
 Goodwill 
 The changes in the carrying amounts of goodwill by operating segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 are as follows:  

9 

Other Intangible Assets   
 Other intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives. For intangible assets with finite lives, we recorded amortization expense of $2.8 million and $8.0 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and $2.9 million and $8.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 respectively. Based solely on the amortizable intangible assets recorded as of September 30, 2016, we estimate amortization expense to be $2.5 million during the remainder of 2016, $9.4 million in 2017, $7.8 million in 2018, $7.2 million in 2019, $7.0 million in 2020, $6.5 million in 2021 and $8.5 million in years after 2021. Actual amortization expense to be reported in future periods could differ from these estimates as a result of new intangible asset acquisitions, finalization of asset valuations for newly acquired assets, changes in useful lives, changes in value due to foreign currency translation, and other factors.  

9. Long-Term Debt  
 The components of debt obligations are presented in the table below:  

There were $175.0 million in borrowings outstanding under the Company s Senior Bank Credit Facility as of September 30, 2016. The Company has classified these borrowings as long-term debt in the accompanying Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as the Company has the intent and ability, as supported by availability under the credit agreement entered into as of June 26, 2015 which expires on June 26, 2020, to refinance these borrowings for more than one year from the applicable balance sheet date. Additionally, $1.4 million of the borrowing limit was utilized for letters of credit (and, therefore, unavailable) as of September 30, 2016. 
 For further information on our 2022 Notes and Senior Bank Credit Facility, see footnote  12. Long-Term Debt  in Part II, Item 8 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC for the year ended December 31, 2015. 

10. Commitments and Contingencies  
 Contingencies  
 We are subject to legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In management s opinion, we believe we have adequate legal defenses and/or insurance coverage with respect to the eventuality of such actions. We do not believe any settlement or judgment relating to any pending legal action would materially affect our financial position or results of operations.  

11. Share-Based Compensation  
 Share-based Awards and Share-based Compensation Expense  
 During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we awarded 19,053 shares of restricted stock. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we granted stock options exercisable for up to 118,865 shares, and awarded 515,389 shares of restricted stock, 64,948 restricted stock units and 83,914 performance stock units. These awards are recorded as equity on the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, stock options exercisable for up to 1,084 shares and 8,277 shares of restricted stock were forfeited prior to compliance with the applicable vesting requirements.  
 10 

Total share-based compensation expense, net of forfeitures, for the   three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 is detailed in the following table:   

12. Segment Reporting  
 We manage our business in five reportable segments: Corporate Finance   Restructuring, Forensic and Litigation Consulting, Economic Consulting, Technology and Strategic Communications.  
 Our Corporate Finance   Restructuring segment focuses on the strategic, operational, financial and capital needs of businesses around the world and provides consulting and advisory services on a wide range of areas, such as restructuring (including bankruptcy), interim management, financings, mergers and acquisitions ( M A ), M A integration, valuations and tax issues, as well as financial, operational and performance improvement. Our distressed service offerings generally include corporate restructurings and interim management, and our non-distressed service offerings generally include all other services mentioned above.   
 Our Forensic and Litigation Consulting segment provides law firms, companies, government clients and other interested parties with dispute advisory, investigations, forensic accounting, business intelligence assessments, data analytics, risk mitigation and interim management services, as well as performance improvement services for our health solutions practice clients, as well as interim management services. 
 Our Economic Consulting segment provides law firms, companies, government entities and other interested parties with analysis of complex economic issues for use in legal, regulatory and international arbitration proceedings, strategic decision making and public policy debates in the U.S. and around the world. 
   Our Technology segment provides e-discovery and information governance, hosting and consulting services and software to its clients. It provides products, services and consulting to companies, law firms, courts and government agencies worldwide. Its comprehensive suite of software and services help clients locate, review and produce electronically stored information ( ESI ), including e-mail, computer files, voicemail, instant messaging, cloud and social media data, as well as financial and transactional data. 
 Our Strategic Communications segment provides advice and consulting services relating to financial and corporate communications, investor relations, reputation management, brand communications, public affairs, business consulting, digital design and marketing. 
 We evaluate the performance of our operating segments based on Adjusted Segment EBITDA. We define Adjusted Segment EBITDA as a segment s share of consolidated operating income before depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, remeasurement of acquisition-related contingent consideration, special charges and goodwill impairment charges. We define Total Adjusted Segment EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, as the total of Adjusted Segment EBITDA for all segments, which excludes unallocated corporate expenses. We use Adjusted Segment EBITDA to internally evaluate the financial performance of our segments because we believe it reflects current core operating performance and provides an indicator of the segment s ability to generate cash.

            Management s Discussion and Analysis of   Financial Condition and Results of Operations      

 The following is a discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 and significant factors that could affect our prospective financial condition and results of operations. This discussion should be read together with the accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes and with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ). In addition to historical information, the following discussion includes forward-looking statements based on current expectations that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions, such as our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions.  Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements contained herein are reasonable, these expectations or any of the forward-looking statements could prove to be incorrect, and actual results could differ materially from those projected or assumed in the forward-looking statements.   
 BUSINESS OVERVIEW  
 FTI Consulting is a global business advisory firm, dedicated to helping organizations manage change, mitigate risk and resolve disputes: financial, legal, operational, political and regulatory, reputational and transactional.  Individually, each of our practices are staffed with experts recognized for the depth of their knowledge and a track record of making an impact. Collectively, FTI Consulting offers a comprehensive suite of services designed to assist clients across the business cycle, from proactive risk management to rapid response to unexpected events and dynamic environments.   
 We report financial results for the following five reportable segments:  
 Our  Corporate Finance   Restructuring ( Corporate Finance )  segment focuses on the strategic, operational, financial and capital needs of businesses around the world and provides consulting and advisory services on a wide range of areas, such as restructuring (including bankruptcy), interim management, financings, Mergers   Acquisitions ( M A ), M A integration, valuations and tax issues, as well as financial, operational and performance improvement. Our distressed service offerings generally include corporate restructurings and interim management, and our non-distressed service offerings generally include all other services mentioned above.   
 Our  Forensic and Litigation Consulting ( FLC )  segment provides law firms, companies, government clients and other interested parties with dispute advisory, investigations, forensic accounting, business intelligence assessments, data analytics, risk mitigation and interim management services, as well as performance improvement services for our health solutions practice clients, as well as interim management services. 
 Our  Economic Consulting  segment provides law firms, companies, government entities and other interested parties with analysis of complex economic issues for use in legal, regulatory and international arbitration proceedings, strategic decision making and public policy debates in the U.S. and around the world. 
 Our  Technology  segment provides e-discovery and information governance, hosting and consulting services and software to its clients. It provides products, services and consulting to companies, law firms, courts and government agencies worldwide. Its comprehensive suite of software and services help clients locate, review and produce ESI, including e-mail, computer files, voicemail, instant messaging, cloud and social media data, as well as financial and transactional data. 
 Our  Strategic Communications  segment provides advice and consulting services relating to financial and corporate communications, investor relations, reputation management, brand communications, public affairs, business consulting, digital design and marketing. 
     We derive substantially all of our revenues from providing professional services to both U.S. and global clients. Most of our services are rendered under time-and-expense arrangements that obligate the client to pay us a fee for the hours that we incur at agreed upon rates. Under this arrangement, we typically bill our clients for reimbursable expenses, which may include the cost of producing our work product and other direct expenses that we incur on behalf of the client, such as travel costs. We also render services for which certain clients may be required to pay us a fixed-fee or recurring retainer. These arrangements are generally cancellable at any time. Some of our engagements contain performance-based arrangements in which we earn a success fee when and if certain predefined outcomes occur. This type of success fee may supplement a time-and-expense or fixed-fee arrangement. Success fee revenues may cause variations in our revenues and operating results due to the timing of achieving the performance-based criteria. In our Technology segment, certain clients are also billed based on the amount of data stored on our electronic systems, the volume of information processed or the number of users licensing our Ringtail      software products for use or installation within their own environments. We license certain products directly to end users, as well as indirectly through our channel partner relationships. Unit-based revenue is defined as revenue billed on a per-item, per-page, or some other unit-based method and includes revenue from data

Unit-based revenue includes revenue associated with our proprietary software that is made available to customers, either via a web browser ( on-demand ) or installed at our customer or partner locations (   on-premise ). On-demand revenue is charged on a unit or monthly basis and includes, but is not limited to, processing and review related functions. On-premise revenue is comprised of up-front license fees, with recurring support and maintenance. Seasonal f  actors, such as the timing of our employees  and clients  vacations and holidays, impact the timing of our revenues.  
 Our financial results are primarily driven by: 

the number, size and type of engagements we secure;     

the rate per hour or fixed charges we charge our clients for services;     

the utilization rates of the revenue-generating professionals we employ;     

the number of revenue-generating professionals;     

fees from clients on a retained basis or other;     

licensing of our software products and other technology services;     

the types of assignments we are working on at different times;     

the length of the billing and collection cycles; and     

the geographic locations of our clients or locations in which services are rendered.     

 We define acquisition growth as revenue of acquired companies in the first twelve months following the effective date of an acquisition. Our definition of organic growth is the change in revenue excluding the impact of all such acquisitions.  
 When significant, we identify the estimated impact of foreign currency translation driven by our businesses with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar, on the period-to-period performance results. The estimated impact of foreign currency translation is calculated as (i) the difference between the prior period results multiplied by (ii) the change in average foreign currency exchange rates in the current period and the average foreign currency rates in the prior period. 
 Non-GAAP Financial Measures  
 In the accompanying analysis of financial information, we sometimes use information derived from consolidated and segment financial information that may not be presented in our financial statements or prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP ). Certain of these measures are considered  non-GAAP financial measures  under the SEC rules. Specifically, we have referred to the following non-GAAP financial measures: 

Total Segment Operating Income (Loss)     

Adjusted EBITDA     

Total Adjusted Segment EBITDA     

Adjusted EBITDA Margin     

Adjusted Net Income (Loss)     

Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share     

   We have included the definitions of Segment Operating Income (Loss) and Adjusted Segment EBITDA below in order to more fully define the components of certain non-GAAP financial measures in the accompanying analysis of financial information.  As described in Note 12   Segment Reporting in Part 1, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we evaluate the performance of our operating segments based on Adjusted Segment EBITDA, and Segment Operating Income (Loss) is a component of the definition of Adjusted Segment EBITDA. 
   We define Segment Operating Income (Loss) as a segment s share of consolidated operating income (loss). We define Total Segment Operating Income (Loss), which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as the total of Segment Operating Income (Loss) for all segments, which excludes unallocated corporate expenses. We use Segment Operating Income (Loss) for the purpose of calculating Adjusted Segment EBITDA. We define Adjusted Segment EBITDA as a segment s share of consolidated operating income (loss) before depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, remeasurement of acquisition-related contingent consideration, special charges and goodwill impairment charges. We use Adjusted Segment EBITDA to internally evaluate the financial performance of our  
 19 

segments because we believe it reflects current core operating performance and provides an indicator of the segment s ability to generate cash. We define Adjusted Segment EBITDA Marg  in as Adjusted Segment EBITDA as a percentage of a segment s revenues.  
 We define Total Adjusted Segment EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as the total of Adjusted Segment EBITDA for all segments, which excludes unallocated corporate expenses.  We define Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure, as consolidated net income (loss) before income tax provision, other non-operating income (expense), depreciation, amortization of intangible assets, remeasurement of acquisition-related contingent consideration, special charges, goodwill impairment charges and losses on early extinguishment of debt. We believe that the non-GAAP financial measures, which exclude the effects of remeasurement of acquisition-related contingent consideration, special charges and goodwill impairment charges, when considered together with our GAAP financial results and GAAP measures, provide management and investors with a more complete understanding of our operating results, including underlying trends. In addition, EBITDA is a common alternative measure of operating performance used by many of our competitors. It is used by investors, financial analysts, rating agencies and others to value and compare the financial performance of companies in our industry. Therefore, we also believe that these measures, considered along with corresponding GAAP measures, provide management and investors with additional information for comparison of our operating results to the operating results of other companies. 
 We define Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Share ( Adjusted EPS ), which are non-GAAP financial measures, as net income (loss) and earnings per diluted share, respectively, excluding the impact of remeasurement of acquisition-related contingent consideration, special charges, goodwill impairment charges and losses on early extinguishment of debt. We use Adjusted Net Income (Loss) for the purpose of calculating Adjusted EPS. Management uses Adjusted EPS to assess total company operating performance on a consistent basis. We believe that this non-GAAP financial measure, which excludes the effects of the remeasurement of acquisition-related contingent consideration, special charges, goodwill impairment charges and losses on early extinguishment of debt, when considered together with our GAAP financial results, provides management and investors with an additional understanding of our business operating results, including underlying trends.  
 Non-GAAP financial measures are not defined in the same manner by all companies and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, the information contained in our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included elsewhere in this filing.

Third Quarter 2016 Executive Highlights   
 Revenues  
 Revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased $17.4 million, or 3.8%, to $438.0 million, which included a $8.4 million, or 1.8%, estimated negative impact of foreign currency translation ( FX ). Excluding the estimated impact of FX, revenues decreased $9.0 million, or 2.0%.  The decrease in revenues was largely due to a decline in demand for M A related second request activity and litigation services in our Technology segment and lower pass-through revenues in our Strategic Communications segment, partially offset by higher revenues from non-M A related antitrust services in North America in our Economic Consulting segment. 
 Special charges 
 There were no special charges recorded during the three months ended September 30, 2016. 
 Loss on early extinguishment of debt 
 In order to more effectively utilize the Company s growing cash balances, maintain financial flexibility and reduce interest expense, we retired our $400 million principal amount of 6  % senior notes due 2020 ( 2020 Notes ) during the three months ended September 30, 2015. We recognized a $19.6 million loss on early extinguishment of debt for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, consisting primarily of a redemption premium of $14.3 million and a $4.9 million non-cash write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs.  There was no loss on early extinguishment of debt during the three months ended September 30, 2016.    
 Net income  
 Net income for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased $11.4 million, or 110.4%, to $21.7 million compared to $10.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. This increase was due to the absence of the loss on early extinguishment of debt from the debt restructuring recorded in the third quarter of 2015 and lower interest expense in 2016 resulting from the 2015 debt restructuring, partially offset by lower operating results in the three months ended September 30, 2016.   
 Adjusted EBITDA  
 Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased $8.9 million, or 15.8%, to $47.2 million compared to $56.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  Adjusted EBITDA was 10.8% of revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 12.3% of revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was driven by a decline in profits in our Corporate Finance segment as a result of higher costs related to the ramp up of new hires and in our Technology segment as a result of reduced demand and lower pricing for managed review services.  This was partially offset by favorable operating results in our Economic Consulting and Strategic Communications segments.   
 Earnings per diluted share and Adjusted EPS  
 Earnings per diluted share for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased $0.27 to $0.52 compared to $0.25 for the three months ended September 30, 2015, which included an impact from loss on extinguishment of debt, reducing Earnings per diluted share by $0.28.   
 Adjusted EPS for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased $0.01 to $0.52 compared to $0.53 for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  Adjusted EPS for the three months ended September 30, 2015 excludes the $0.28 per share impact of the loss on early extinguishment of debt described above.  
 Liquidity and capital allocation  
 Cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased $3.1 million, or 4.2%, to $70.9 million compared to $74.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The decrease was primarily due to lower cash collections and increased funding of employee notes receivables, partially offset by lower payments for interest expense. Days sales outstanding ( DSO ), which is one measure of the collections cycle, was 106 days at September 30, 2016 compared to 105 days at September 30, 2015.  
 21 

Financing activities in the three months ended September 30, 2016 included a $25.0 million repayment of borrowings under the Company s senior secured bank revolving credit facility ( Senior Bank Credit Facility ). Total   d  ebt outstanding   as of September 30, 2016   w  as $475.0 million, down from $52  0.0 million   as of September 30, 2015  .  
 On June 2, 2016, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program (the  Stock Repurchase Program ) under which FTI Consulting may repurchase up to $100.0 million of its outstanding common stock. No time limit has been established for the completion of the program, and the program may be suspended, discontinued or replaced by the Board of Directors at any time without prior notice.  As of September 30, 2016, we have $100.0 million available under this program to repurchase additional shares. 
 Headcount  
 As of September 30, 2016, our total net headcount of 4,767 increased by 133 from 4,634 as of December 31, 2015.  
 We increased the number of non-billable employees by 31, from 1,118 as of December 31, 2015 to 1,149 as of September 30, 2016. Net change to billable headcount for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is summarized in the table below.

 See  Segment Results  for an expanded discussion of segment revenues and operating income.  
 Unallocated corporate expenses  
 Unallocated corporate expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased $0.9 million, or 4.1%, to $21.7 million compared to $20.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The increase was primarily due to higher outside legal costs and higher costs for infrastructure departments largely to support growth in the business and new initiatives.  These increases were partially offset by a decrease in corporate costs compared to the third quarter of 2015.  In the third quarter of 2015, we transferred to our segments previously recognized cost favorability related to our self-insured benefit plans.

Interest income and other   
 Interest income and other, which includes foreign currency transaction gains and losses, increased $1.2 million to income of $3.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to income of $2.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  The increase was due, in part, to an acquisition-related liability, as well as an increase in net unrealized foreign currency transaction gains, resulting principally from the weakening of the British Pound.   Transaction gains and losses, both realized and unrealized, relate to the remeasurement or settlement of monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in a currency other than an entity s functional currency. These monetary assets and liabilities include both client and current intercompany receivables and payables. 
 Interest expense  
 Interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 decreased $5.4 million, or 46.1%, to $6.3 million compared to $11.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. Interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was favorably impacted by lower average interest rates and borrowings subsequent to the debt restructuring completed in the third quarter of 2015.   
 Income tax provision  
 The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was 32.2% compared to 37.5% for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was favorably impacted by higher foreign earnings in 2016.

 Interest income and other, which includes foreign currency transaction gains and losses, increased $7.1 million to income of $9.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to income of $2.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  The increase was due, in part, to an adjustment of an acquisition-related liability, as well as an increase in net unrealized foreign currency transaction gains.  These foreign currency transaction gains were $5.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, resulting principally from the weakening of the British Pound, compared to a $1.0 million loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.

SEGMENT RESULTS   
 Total Adjusted Segment EBITDA  
 We evaluate the performance of our operating segments based on Adjusted Segment EBITDA. The following table reconciles Net income to Total segment operating income and Total Adjusted Segment EBITDA, which are non-GAAP financial measures, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.  

Other Segment Operating Data  

(1)    
 
 There were 71 revenue-generating professionals as of September 30, 2015 related to a business in Latin America that was disposed at the end of 2015.  Excluding these professionals, the total number of revenue-generating professionals of our Forensic and Litigation Consulting segment would have been 1,138 as of September 30, 2015.      

(2)    
 
 The number of revenue-generating professionals for the Technology segment excludes as-needed professionals who we employ based on demand for the segment s services. We employed an average of 258 as-needed employees during the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to 411 as-needed employees during the three months ended September 30, 2015.     

 26 

(3)    
 
        We calculate the utilization rate for our billable professionals by dividing the number of hours that all of our billable professionals worked on client assignments during a period by the total available working hours for all of our billable professionals   during the same period. Available hours are determined by the standard hours worked by each employee, adjusted for part-time hours, local country standard work weeks and local country holidays. Available working hours include vacation and professional trai  ning days, but exclude holidays. Utilization rates are presented for our segments that primarily bill clients on an hourly basis. We have not presented utilization rates for our Technology and Strategic Communications segments as most of the revenues of th  ese segments are not generated on an hourly basis.      

(4)    
 
 For engagements where revenues are based on number of hours worked by our billable professionals, average billable rate per hour is calculated by dividing revenues (excluding revenues from success fees, pass-through and outside consultants) for a period by the number of hours worked on client assignments during the same period. We have not presented average billable rates per hour for our Technology and Strategic Communications segments as most of the revenues of these segments are not based on billable hours.

Gross profit decreased $7.7 million, or 17.1%, to $37.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016. Gross profit margin decreased 5.9 percentage points for the thre  e months ended September 30, 2016. The decrease was primarily due   to   lower utilization and     higher   costs related to the ramp up of experienced hires, which   contributed to   5.2   percentage points of t  he gross profit margin decrease  .  
 Selling, general and administrative ( SG A ) expense increased $1.3 million, or 6.7%, to $20.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016. SG A expense was 18.2% of revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 16.6% for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  This increase in SG A expense was due to higher infrastructure support costs and recruiting expense to support additional headcount.  
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015  
 Revenues increased $41.1 million, or 12.5%, to $369.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, which included a 1.6% estimated negative impact from FX. Excluding the estimated impact of FX, revenues increased by $46.5 million, or 14.1%. This increase was primarily due to higher demand and higher success fees in distressed service offerings in North America and higher demand in distressed, tax and transaction advisory services in Europe, Middle East and Africa ( EMEA ).

SG A expense was 16.5% of revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 18.0% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in SG A expense was due to higher infrastructure support costs and recruiting expense to support additional headcount.  This increase was partially offset by collections of prior period bad debts.

 SG A expense decreased $6.1 million, or 8.5%, to $65.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. SG A expense was 18.5% of revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 19.5% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.   The decrease in SG A expense was a result of higher severance expenses recorded in 2015 related to the departure of a senior managing director and lower bad debt expense, partially offset by higher infrastructure support costs.

 Gross profit decreased $6.0 million, or 24.6%, to $18.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016. Gross profit margin decreased 2.1 percentage points for the three months ended September 30, 2016. The decrease was primarily due to lower demand and realized pricing for managed review services. 
 SG A expense decreased $2.3 million, or 13.0%, to $15.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016. SG A expense was 34.3% of revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 31.3% for the three months ended September 30, 2015.   The decrease in SG A expense was due to lower infrastructure support and occupancy costs, lower bad debt expense, and lower costs realized from the headcount reduction taken in the first quarter of 2016.  Research and development expense related to software was $4.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $4.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015. 
   
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015  
 Revenues decreased $37.8 million, or 22.0%, to $134.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, which included a 1.1% estimated negative impact from FX. Excluding the estimated impact of FX, revenues decreased by $35.9 million, or 20.9%, largely due to declines in M A related second request activity and in large cross-border investigations. 
 Gross profit decreased $20.1 million, or 26.5%, to $55.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Gross profit margin decreased 2.6 percentage points for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The decrease in gross profit margin was due to lower demand and pricing for managed review and consulting services. 
 SG A expense decreased $6.4 million, or 11.8%, to $47.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. SG A expense was 35.3% of revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 31.2% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.   The decrease in SG A expense was due to lower costs realized from the headcount reduction taken in the first quarter of 2016, as well as lower occupancy costs, infrastructure support costs and research and development expense. Research and development expense related to software was $13.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $14.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.

 Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2015  
 Revenues decreased $9.9 million, or 17.7%, to $45.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016, which included a 3.8% estimated negative impact from FX.  Excluding the estimated impact of FX, revenues decreased by $7.8 million, or 14.0%.  This decline was primarily due to an $8.5 million reduction in pass-through revenues.   
 Gross profit decreased $1.4 million, or 7.3%, to $17.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016. Gross profit margin increased 4.2 percentage points for the three months ended September 30, 2016. The increase was primarily due to lower pass-through revenues in the three months ended September 30, 2016.  Excluding the impact of net pass-through revenues, gross profit margin declined 2.0 percentage points due to higher costs related to ramp up of new hires.   
 SG A expense decreased $0.1 million, or 1.1%, to $9.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016. SG A expense was 21.7% of revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 18.1% for the three months ended September 30, 2015.    
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015  
   Revenues decreased $0.3 million, or 0.2%, to $140.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, which included a 3.2% estimated negative impact from FX.  Excluding the estimated impact of FX, revenues increased by $4.2 million, or 3.0%, primarily due to higher project-based revenues in North America and higher retainer and project-based revenues in EMEA,  
 33 

predominantly in public affairs and financial communica  tions-related engagements.    These increases were partially offset by   a   $7.2 million reduction in pass-through revenues.  
 Gross profit increased $3.7 million, or 7.3%, to $53.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Gross profit margin increased 2.7 percentage points for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Excluding the impact of net pass-through revenues, gross profit margin improved 0.9% due to the mix of higher margin large project engagements with improved utilization across North America. 
 SG A expense increased $1.6 million, or 5.2%, to $32.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. SG A expense was 23.3% of revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 22.1% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.   The increase in SG A expense was primarily due to higher infrastructure support costs and compensation, partially offset by lower legal costs. 

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES  
 Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our condensed consolidated financial statements, which we have prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the SEC describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements. We evaluate our estimates, including those related to bad debts, goodwill, income taxes and contingencies on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. These results form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates, judgments and assumptions and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following:  

Revenue recognition      

Allowance for doubtful accounts and unbilled services      

Goodwill and other intangible assets      

Share-based compensation      

Income taxes      

 There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates from the information provided in  Critical Accounting Policies  in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the SEC.  
 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets  
 On a quarterly basis, we monitor the key drivers of fair value to detect events or other changes that would warrant an interim impairment test of our goodwill and intangible assets. Factors we consider important that could trigger an interim impairment review include, but are not limited to, the following: significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results; a significant change in the manner of our use of the acquired asset or strategy for our overall business; a significant negative industry or economic trend; and our market capitalization relative to net book value. When we evaluate these factors and determine that a triggering event has occurred, we perform an interim impairment analysis.  
 As of October 1, 2015, the date of our last annual goodwill impairment test, the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units significantly exceeded their respective carrying values and no further testing was required. Through our quarterly assessment, we determined that there were no events or circumstances that more likely than not would reduce the fair value of any of our reporting units below their carrying value.  
   There can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions used in our goodwill impairment testing will prove to be accurate predictions of the future. If our assumptions regarding forecasted cash flows are not achieved, we may be required to perform the two-step quantitative goodwill impairment analysis prior to our next annual impairment test. In addition, if the aforementioned factors have the effect of changing one of the critical assumptions or estimates we use to calculate the value of our goodwill or intangible assets, we may be required to record goodwill and/or intangible asset impairment charges in future periods, whether in connection with our next annual impairment test or if a triggering event occurs outside of the quarter during which the annual goodwill impairment test is  
 34 

performed. It is not possible at t  his time to determine if any future impairment charge would result or, if it does, whether such charge would be material.   
 SIGNIFICANT NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS  
 See  Note 3   New Accounting Standards  in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.  
 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  
 Cash Flows  

We have generally financed our day-to-day operations, capital expenditures and acquisition-related contingent payments through cash flows from operations. Generally, during our first quarter of each fiscal year, our cash needs exceed our cash flows from operations due to the payments of annual incentive compensation and acquisition-related contingent payments. Our operating cash flows generally exceed our cash needs in the second half of each year. 
 Our operating assets and liabilities consist primarily of billed and unbilled accounts receivable, notes receivable from employees, accounts payable, accrued expenses and accrued compensation expense. The timing of billings and collections of receivables as well as payments for compensation arrangements affect the changes in these balances.  
 DSO is a performance measure used to assess how quickly revenues are collected by the Company. We calculate DSO at the end of each reporting period by dividing net accounts receivable reduced by billings in excess of services provided, by revenue for the quarter, adjusted for changes in foreign exchange rates. We multiply the result by the number of days in the quarter. Our DSO typically reaches its lowest point at December 31st each year and has consistently increased during the following quarters.  
 Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015 
 Cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $111.6 million compared to $43.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase was primarily due to higher cash collections and lower payments for interest expense and other operating expenses, which were partially offset by increased payments for compensation. DSO was 106 days at September 30, 2016 compared to 105 days at September 30, 2015.  
 Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $22.8 million compared to net cash used in investing activities of $25.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Capital expenditures were $22.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $24.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.  
 Net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was $6.3 million compared to $192.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Cash used in financing activities in the nine months ended September 30, 2016 included a $25.0 million repayment of borrowings under our Senior Bank Credit Facility and repayments in a total amount of $2.9 million to settle repurchases of our common stock, partially offset by $18.4 million in cash received from the issuance of common stock under our equity compensation plan and the receipt of $2.8 million of refundable deposits related to one of our foreign entities.  Our financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 included the retirement of the $400 million principal amount of our 2020 Notes for $414.7 million using cash on hand of $164.7 million and borrowings under our Senior Bank Credit Facility of $250 million. Subsequent to the debt retirement we repaid $30 million of the borrowings under our Senior Bank Credit Facility.  In addition, we repaid the final $11.0 million in notes payable to former shareholders of an acquired business in 2015.  Financing activities in 2015 also included $13.9 million received from the issuance of common stock under our equity compensation plans and $2.4 million of refundable deposits related to one of our foreign entities, offset by the payment of $3.7 million in debt financing fees related to our Senior Bank Credit Facility. 
 35 

Capital Resources   
 As of September 30, 2016, our capital resources included $225.2 million of cash and cash equivalents and available borrowing capacity of $373.6 million under our five-year $550.0 million Senior Bank Credit Facility. As of September 30, 2016, we had $175.0 million of borrowing outstanding under our Senior Bank Credit Facility and $1.4 million of outstanding letters of credit, which reduced the availability of borrowings. We use letters of credit primarily in lieu of security deposits for our leased office facilities.  
 Future Capital Needs  
 We anticipate that our future capital needs will principally consist of funds required for:  

operating and general corporate expenses relating to the operation of our businesses;      

capital expenditures, primarily for information technology equipment, office furniture and leasehold improvements;      

debt service requirements, including interest payments on our long-term debt;      

compensating designated executive management and senior managing directors under our various long-term incentive compensation programs;      

discretionary funding of the Stock Repurchase Program;     

contingent obligations related to our acquisitions;      

potential acquisitions of businesses that would allow us to diversify or expand our service offerings; and      

other known future contractual obligations.      

 For the full fiscal year ending December 31, 2016, we anticipate aggregate capital expenditures will range between $30 million and $33 million to support our organization, including direct support for specific client engagements. We currently anticipate capital expenditures will range between $8 million and $10 million for the fourth quarter of 2016.  Our estimate takes into consideration the needs of our existing businesses but does not include the impact of any purchases that we make as a result of future acquisitions or specific client engagements that are not currently contemplated. Our capital expenditure requirements may change if our staffing levels or technology needs change significantly from what we currently anticipate, if we purchase additional equipment specifically to support a client engagement or if we pursue and complete future acquisitions.  
 Our cash flows from operations have generally exceeded our cash needs for capital expenditures and debt services requirements.  We believe that our cash flows from operations, supplemented by borrowings under our Senior Bank Credit Facility, as necessary, will provide adequate cash to fund our cash needs from normal operations for at least the next twelve months.   
 Our conclusion that we will be able to fund our cash requirements by using existing capital resources and cash generated from operations does not take into account the impact of any future acquisition transactions or any unexpected significant changes in the number of employees or other expenditures that are currently not contemplated. The anticipated cash needs of our businesses could change significantly if we pursue and complete additional business acquisitions, if our business plans change, if economic conditions change from those currently prevailing or from those now anticipated, if our business does not perform at expected levels or is less profitable than expected, or if other unexpected circumstances arise that have a material effect on the cash flow or profitability of our business. Any of these events or circumstances, including any new business opportunities, could involve significant additional funding needs in excess of the identified currently available sources and could require us to raise additional debt or equity funding to meet those needs. Our ability to raise additional capital, if necessary, is subject to a variety of factors that we cannot predict with certainty, including:  

our future profitability;      

the quality of our accounts receivable;      

our relative levels of debt and equity;      

the volatility and overall condition of the capital markets; and      

the market prices of our securities.      

 Any new debt funding, if available, may be on terms less favorable to us than our Senior Bank Credit Facility or the indenture that governs our 2022 Notes. See  Forward-Looking Statements  of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and  Risk Factors  in Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the SEC.  
 36 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements   
 We have no off-balance sheet arrangements, other than operating leases, and we have not entered into any transactions involving unconsolidated subsidiaries or special purpose entities.  
 Future Contractual Obligations  
 There have been no significant changes in our future contractual obligations information as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 filed with the SEC.

PART II OTHER   INFORMATION   

Item 1.   
 
       Legal Proceedings     

 From time to time in the ordinary course of business, we are subject to claims, asserted or unasserted, or named as a party to lawsuits or investigations. Litigation, in general, and intellectual property and securities litigation in particular, can be expensive and disruptive to normal business operations. Moreover, the results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with any certainty and in the case of more complex legal proceedings such as intellectual property and securities litigation, the results are difficult to predict at all. We are not aware of any asserted or unasserted legal proceedings or claims that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of our operations.  

Item 1A.   
 
       Risk Factors

We may disclose changes to risk factors or disclose additional factors from time to time in our future filings with the SEC. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations.
