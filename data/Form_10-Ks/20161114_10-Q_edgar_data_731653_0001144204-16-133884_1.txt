Note 1:  Summary of Significant Accounting Policies 

These interim financial statements
are prepared without audit and reflect all adjustments which, in the opinion of management, are necessary to present fairly the
financial position of United Bancorp, Inc. ( Company ) at September 30, 2016, and its results of operations and cash
flows for the interim periods presented. All such adjustments are normal and recurring in nature. The accompanying condensed consolidated
financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the instructions for Form 10-Q and, therefore, do not purport to contain
all the necessary financial disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America that
might otherwise be necessary in the circumstances and should be read in conjunction with the Company s consolidated financial
statements and related notes for the year ended December 31, 2015 included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K. Reference is made
to the accounting policies of the Company described in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained in its Annual
Report on Form 10-K. The results of operations for the three months and nine months ended, are not necessarily indicative of the
results to be expected for the full year. The condensed consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of December 31, 2015 has been
derived from the audited consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of that date. 

Principles of Consolidation 

The consolidated
financial statements include the accounts of United Bancorp, Inc. ( United  or  the Company ) and its wholly-owned
subsidiary, The Citizens Savings Bank of Martins Ferry, Ohio ( the Bank  or  Citizens ). The Bank operates
two divisions, The Community Bank, a division of The Citizens Savings Bank and The Citizens Bank, a division of The Citizens Savings
Bank. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. 

Nature of Operations 

The Company s revenues,
operating income, and assets are almost exclusively derived from banking. Accordingly, all of the Company s banking operations
are considered by management to be aggregated in one reportable operating segment. Customers are mainly located in Athens, Belmont,
Carroll, Fairfield, Harrison, Jefferson, and Tuscarawas Counties and the surrounding localities in northeastern, east-central and
southeastern Ohio, and include a wide range of individuals, businesses and other organizations. The Citizens Bank division conducts
its business through its main office in Martins Ferry, Ohio and branches in Bridgeport, Colerain, Dellroy, Dillonvale, Dover, Jewett,
New Philadelphia, St. Clairsville East, St. Clairsville West, Sherrodsville, Strasburg, and Tiltonsville, Ohio. The Citizens Bank
division also operates a Loan Production office in Wheeling, West Virginia. The Community Bank division conducts its business through
its main office in Lancaster, Ohio and branches in Amesville, Glouster, Lancaster, and Nelsonville, Ohio. The Company s primary
deposit products are checking, savings, and term certificate accounts, and its primary lending products are residential mortgage,
commercial, and installment loans. Substantially all loans are secured by specific items of collateral including business assets,
consumer assets and real estate and are not considered  sub prime  type loans. The targeted lending areas of our Bank
operations encompass four separate metropolitan areas, minimizing the risk to changes in economic conditions in the communities
housing the Company s branch locations. 

Use of Estimates 

To prepare financial statements
in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, management makes estimates and assumptions
based on available information. These estimates and assumptions affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the
disclosures provided and future results could differ. The allowance for loan losses and fair values of financial instruments are
particularly subject to change.

 For the Three and Nine Months Ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015 

Loans 

Loans that management has the
intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoffs are reported at their outstanding principal
balances adjusted for unearned income, charge-offs, the allowance for loan losses, any unamortized deferred fees or costs on originated
loans and unamortized premiums or discounts on purchased loans. 

For loans amortized at cost,
interest income is accrued based on the unpaid principal balance. Loan origination fees, net of certain direct origination costs,
as well as premiums and discounts, are deferred and amortized as a level yield adjustment over the respective term of the loan. 

For all loan classes, the accrual
of interest is discontinued at the time the loan is 90 days past due unless the credit is well-secured and in process of collection.
Past due status is based on contractual terms of the loan. For all loan classes, the entire balance of the loan is considered past
due if the minimum payment contractually required to be paid is not received by the contractual due date. For all loan classes,
loans are placed on nonaccrual or charged off at an earlier date if collection of principal or interest is considered doubtful. 

Management s general practice
is to proactively charge down loans individually evaluated for impairment to the fair value of the underlying collateral. Consistent
with regulatory guidance, charge-offs on all loan segments are taken when specific loans, or portions thereof, are considered uncollectible.
The Company s policy is to promptly charge these loans off in the period the uncollectible loss is reasonably determined. 

For all loan portfolio segments
except residential and consumer loans, the Company promptly charges-off loans, or portions thereof, when available information
confirms that specific loans are uncollectible based on information that includes, but is not limited to, (1) the deteriorating
financial condition of the borrower, (2) declining collateral values, and/or (3) legal action, including bankruptcy, that impairs
the borrower s ability to adequately meet its obligations. For impaired loans that are considered to be solely collateral
dependent, a partial charge-off is recorded when a loss has been confirmed by an updated appraisal or other appropriate valuation
of the collateral. 

The Company charges-off residential
and consumer loans when the Company reasonably determines the amount of the loss. The Company adheres to timeframes established
by applicable regulatory guidance which provides for the charge-down of 1-4 family first and junior lien mortgages to the net realizable
value less costs to sell when the loan is 120 days past due, charge-off of unsecured open-end loans when the loan is 120 days past
due, and charge down to the net realizable value when other secured loans are 120 days past due. Loans at these respective delinquency
thresholds for which the Company can clearly document that the loan is both well-secured and in the process of collection, such
that collection will occur regardless of delinquency status, need not be charged off. 

For all classes, all interest
accrued but not collected for loans that are placed on nonaccrual or charged off are reversed against interest income. The interest
on these loans is accounted for on the cash-basis or cost-recovery method, until qualifying for return to accrual. Loans are returned
to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably
assured. Nonaccrual loans are returned to accrual status when, in the opinion of management, the financial position of the borrower
indicates there is no longer any reasonable doubt as to the timely collection of interest or principal. The Company requires a
period of satisfactory performance of not less than six months before returning a nonaccrual loan to accrual status.

 For the Three and Nine Months Ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015 

When cash payments are received
on impaired loans in each loan class, the Company records the payment as interest income unless collection of the remaining recorded
principal amount is doubtful, at which time payments are used to reduce the principal balance of the loan. Troubled debt restructured
loans recognize interest income on an accrual basis at the renegotiated rate if the loan is in compliance with the modified terms,
no principal reduction has been granted and the loan has demonstrated the ability to perform in accordance with the renegotiated
terms for a period of at least six months. 

Allowance for Loan
Losses 

The allowance for loan losses
is established as losses are estimated to have occurred through a provision for loan losses charged to income. Loan losses are
charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectability of a loan balance is confirmed. Subsequent recoveries,
if any, are credited to the allowance. 

The allowance for loan losses
is evaluated on a regular basis by management and is based upon management s periodic review of the collectability of the
loans in light of historical experience, the nature and volume of the loan portfolio, adverse situations that may affect the borrower s
ability to repay, estimated value of any underlying collateral and prevailing economic conditions. This evaluation is inherently
subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available. 

The allowance consists of allocated
and general components. The allocated component relates to loans that are classified as impaired. For those loans that are classified
as impaired, an allowance is established when the discounted cash flows (or collateral value or observable market price) of the
impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan. The general component covers non-impaired loans and is based on historical
charge-off experience by segment. The historical loss experience is determined by portfolio segment and is based on the actual
loss history experienced by the Company over the prior five years.  Management believes the three
year historical loss experience methodology is appropriate in the current economic environment.  Other adjustments (qualitative/environmental
considerations) for each segment may be added to the allowance for each loan segment after an assessment of internal or external
influences on credit quality that are not fully reflected in the historical loss or risk rating data. 

A loan is considered impaired
when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments
of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Factors considered by management in
determining impairment include payment status, collateral value and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest
payments when due based on the loan s current payment status and the borrower s financial condition including available
sources of cash flows. Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as
impaired. Management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into
consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons for
the delay, the borrower s prior payment record and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest
owed. Impairment is measured on a loan-by-loan basis for non-homogenous type loans such as commercial, non-owner residential and
construction loans by either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest
rate, the loan s obtainable market price or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. For impaired
loans where the Company utilizes the discounted cash flows to determine the level of impairment, the Company includes the
entire change in the present value of cash flows as bad debt expense.

The fair values of collateral
dependent impaired loans are based on independent appraisals of the collateral. In general, the Company acquires an updated appraisal
upon identification of impairment and annually thereafter for commercial, commercial real estate and multi-family loans. If the
most recent appraisal is over a year old, and a new appraisal is not performed, due to lack of comparable values or other reasons,
the existing appraisal is utilized and discounted generally 10% -35% based on the age of the appraisal, condition of the subject
property, and overall economic conditions. After determining the collateral value as described, the fair value is calculated based
on the determined collateral value less selling expenses. The potential for outdated appraisal values is considered in our
determination of the allowance for loan losses through our analysis of various trends and conditions including the local economy,
trends in charge-offs and delinquencies, etc. and the related qualitative adjustments assigned by the Company. 

Segments of loans with similar
risk characteristics are collectively evaluated for impairment based on the segment s historical loss experience adjusted
for changes in trends, conditions and other relevant factors that affect repayment of the loans. Accordingly, the Company does
not separately identify individual consumer and residential loans for impairment measurements, unless such loans are the subject
of a restructuring agreement due to financial difficulties of the borrower. 

In the course of working with
borrowers, the Company may choose to restructure the contractual terms of certain loans. In this scenario, the Company attempts
to work-out an alternative payment schedule with the borrower in order to optimize collectability of the loan. Any loans that are
modified are reviewed by the Company to identify if a troubled debt restructuring ( TDR ) has occurred, which is when,
for economic or legal reasons related to a borrower s financial difficulties, the Company grants a concession to the borrower
that it would not otherwise consider. Terms may be modified to fit the ability of the borrower to repay in line with its current
financial status and the restructuring of the loan may include the transfer of assets from the borrower to satisfy the debt, a
modification of loan terms, or a combination of the two. If such efforts by the Company do not result in a satisfactory arrangement,
the loan is referred to legal counsel, at which time foreclosure proceedings are initiated. At any time prior to a sale of the
property at foreclosure, the Company may terminate foreclosure proceedings if the borrower is able to work-out a satisfactory payment
plan. 

It is the Company s policy
to have any restructured loans which are on nonaccrual status prior to being restructured remain on nonaccrual status until six
months of satisfactory borrower performance at which time management would consider its return to accrual status. If a loan was
accruing at the time of 
restructuring, the Company reviews the loan to determine if it is appropriate to continue the accrual of interest on the restructured
loan. 

With regard to determination of
the amount of the allowance for credit losses, trouble debt restructured loans are considered to be impaired. As a result, the
determination of the amount of impaired loans for each portfolio segment within troubled debt restructurings is the same as detailed
previously. 

Earnings Per Share 

Basic earnings per share represents
income available to common stockholders divided by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during each period.
Diluted earnings per share reflects additional potential common shares that would have been outstanding if dilutive potential common
shares had been issued, as well as any adjustment to income that would result from the assumed issuance. Potential common shares
that may be issued by the Company relate to outstanding stock options and restricted stock awards and are determined using the
treasury stock method.

Treasury stock shares, deferred
compensation shares and unearned ESOP shares are not deemed outstanding for earnings per share calculations. 

Options
to purchase 53,714 shares of common stock at a weighted-average exercise price of $10.34 per share were outstanding at September
30, 2015, but were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the options  exercise price was
greater than the average market price of the common shares. There are no outstanding options at September 30, 2016.  

Income Taxes 

The Company is subject to income
taxes in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, as well as various state jurisdictions. Tax regulations within each jurisdiction are subject
to the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and require significant judgment to apply. With few exceptions, the
Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local income tax examinations by tax authorities for the years before 2012.

Recent Accounting
Pronouncements 

In August 2016, the Financial
Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-15   Statement of Cash Flows (l'opic
230)  -  Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.    ASU 2016-15 provides cash flow statement classification
guidance for certain transactions including how the predominance principle should be applied when cash receipts and cash payments
have aspects of more than one class of cash flows. The guidance is effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning
after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim
period. The Company is assessing ASU 2016-15 but does not expect a significant impact on its accounting and disclosures. 

In June 2016, the FASB issued
ASU No. 2016-13,   Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326) - Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.  
The provisions of ASU 2016-13 were issued to provide financial statement users with more decision-useful information about the
expected credit losses on financial instruments that are not accounted for at fair value through net income, including loans held
for investment, held-to-maturity debt securities, trade and other receivables, net investment in leases and other commitments to
extend credit held by a reporting entity at each reporting date. ASU 2016-13 requires that financial assets measured at amortized
cost be presented at the net amount expected to be collected, through an allowance for credit losses that is deducted from the
amortized cost basis. The amendments in ASU 2016-13 eliminate the probable incurred loss recognition in current GAAP and reflect
an entity s current estimate of all expected credit losses. The measurement of expected credit losses is based upon historical
experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectibility of the financial assets. 

For purchased financial assets
with a more-than-insignificant amount of credit deterioration since origination ( PCD assets ) that are measured at
amortized cost, the initial allowance for credit losses is added to the purchase price rather than being reported as a credit loss
expense. Subsequent changes in the allowance for credit losses on PCD assets are recognized through the statement of income as
a credit loss expense. 

Credit losses relating to available-for-sale
debt securities will be recorded through an allowance for credit losses rather than as a direct write-down to the security. 

ASU 2016-13 is effective for fiscal
years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted for fiscal
years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company is currently evaluating the
impact of ASU 2016-13 on its accounting and disclosures.

ASU No. 2016-09 was issued in March 2016 and affects
all entities that issue share-based payment awards to their employees. The new guidance involves several aspects of the accounting
for share-based payment transactions, including income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities,
and classification on the statement of cash flows. Under ASU No. 2016-09, any excess tax benefits or tax deficiencies should be
recognized as income tax expense or benefit in the income statement. Excess tax benefits are to be classified as an operating activity
in the statement of cash flows. In accruing compensation cost, an entity can make an entity-wide accounting policy election to
either estimate the number of awards that are expected to vest, as required under current guidance, or account for forfeitures
when they occur. For an award to qualify for equity classification, an entity cannot partially settle the award in excess of the
employer's maximum statutory withholding requirements. Such cash paid by an employer when directly withholding shares for tax withholding
purposes should be classified as a financing activity in the statement of cash flows. The amendments in ASU No. 2016-09 are effective
for public business entities for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15,
2016. Early adoption is permitted. Adoption of ASU No. 2016-09 is not expected to have a material impact on Company s results
of operations or financial position. 

ASU No. 2016-01,  Financial Instruments - Overall
(Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities   

ASU No. 2016-01 was issued in January 2016 and applies
to all entities that hold financial assets or owe financial liabilities. It makes targeted changes to generally accepted accounting
principles for public companies as follows: 

1.  Requires most equity investments to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income.   

2.  Simplifies the impairment assessment of equity investments without readily determinable fair values by requiring a qualitative
assessment to identify impairment. When a qualitative assessment indicates that impairment exists, an entity is required to measure

4.  Requires use of the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes.

For public business entities, the new guidance is effective
for annual reporting periods, and interim reporting periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2017. Adoption
of ASU No. 2016-01 is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's results of operations or financial position. 

In May 2014, the FASB issued
ASU No. 2014-09   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)   (ASU 2014-09). This update to the ASC is
the culmination of efforts by the FASB and the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) to develop a common revenue standard
for U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). ASU 2014-09 supersedes Topic 605   Revenue Recognition
and most industry-specific guidance. The core principle of the guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the
transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to
be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The guidance in ASU 2014-09 describes a 5-step process entities can apply
to achieve the core principle of revenue recognition and requires disclosures sufficient to enable users of financial statements
to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers and the
significant judgments used in determining that information. Originally, the amendments in ASU 2014-09 were effective for annual
reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period and early application
is not allowed. In July 2015, the FASB extended the implementation date to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15,
2017 including interim periods within that reporting period. Transitional guidance is included in the update. Earlier adoption
is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 31, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting
period. The Company is currently evaluating the effects of ASU 2014-09 on its financial statements and disclosures, if any. 

ASU No. 2014-11, Transfer and
Servicing (Topic) 860):   Repurchase-to-Maturity Transactions, Repurchase Financings, and Disclosures   

ASU No. 2014-11 was issued
in June 2014 and requires two accounting changes: 

The accounting for repurchase-to-maturity
transactions is changed to secured borrowings accounting, and 

for repurchase financing arrangements,
separate accounting is required for a transfer of a financial asset executed contemporaneously with a repurchase agreement with
the same counterparty, which results in secured borrowing accounting. 

Additional disclosures are required.
ASU No. 2014-11 was effective for first interim or annual reporting period beginning after December 15, 2014. In addition, for
public companies, the disclosure for certain transactions accounted for as a sale is effective for the first interim or annual
period beginning on or after December 15, 2014, and the disclosure for transactions accounted for as secured borrowings is required
fro annual periods beginning after December 15, 2014, and interim periods beginning after March 15, 2015. The Company adopted ASU
2014-11 as required, without a material impact on the Company s financial position or results of operations.

On February 25, 2016, the FASB
issued ASU 2016-02   Leases (Topic 842).   ASU 2016-02 is intended to improve financial reporting about leasing
transactions. This ASU affects all companies and other organization that lease assets such as real estate, airplanes, and manufacturing
equipment. 

Under the current accounting model,
an organization applies a classification test to determine the accounting for the lease arrangement: 

(a)  Some leases are classified as capital where by the lessee would recognize lease assets and liabilities
on the balance sheet.   

(b)  Other leases are classified as operating leases whereby the lessee would not recognize lease assets
and liabilities on the balance sheet.   

Under the new guidance, a lessee
will be required to recognize assets and liabilities for leases with lease terms of more than 12 months. Consistent with Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), the recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash flows arising from a
lease by a lessee primarily will depend on its classification as a finance or operating lease. 

However, unlike current GAAP which
requires only capital leases to be recognized on the balance sheet the new ASU will require both types of leases to be recognized
on the balance sheet. 

For
public companies, the ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December
15, 2018. Thus, for a calendar year company, it would be effective January 1, 2019.  The Company is currently evaluating
the effects of this ASU on its financial statements and disclosures, if any.

The amortized cost and fair value of available-for-sale
securities at September 30, 2016, by contractual maturity, are shown below. Expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities
because issuers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties. 

The carrying value of securities
pledged as collateral, to secure public deposits and for other purposes, was $28.8 and $22.6 million at September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, respectively. 

Certain investments in debt securities
are reported in the financial statements at an amount less than their historical cost. The total fair value of these investments
at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, was $15.0 million and $24.0 million, which represented approximately 47.2% and 69.2%,
respectively, of the Company s available-for-sale portfolio. 

Based on evaluation of available
evidence, including recent changes in market interest rates, credit rating information and information obtained from regulatory
filings, management believes the declines in fair value for these securities are temporary and are a result on an general increase
in longer term interest rates. 

Should the impairment of any
of these securities become other-than-temporary, the cost basis of the investment will be reduced and the resulting loss recognized
in net income in the period the other-than-temporary impairment is identified. 

The following tables show the
Company s investments  gross unrealized losses and fair value, aggregated by investment category and length of time
that individual securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015:

The unrealized losses on the
Company s investments in U.S. Government agency were caused primarily by interest rate changes. The contractual terms of
those investments do not permit the issuer to settle the securities at a price less than the amortized cost bases of the investments.
Because the Company does not intend to sell the investments and it is not likely the Company will be required or need to sell the
investments before recovery of their amortized cost bases, which may be maturity, the Company does not consider those investments
to be other-than-temporarily impaired at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

For the nine months ended September
30, 2015, proceeds from the sale of investment securities available-for-sale were $383,000, with gross realized gains of $31,000,
and gross realized losses of zero. The gain is included in realized gains on sales of available-for-sale securities, net in the
noninterest income section of the statement of income. There were no available-for  sale investment sales for the nine months
ended September 30, 2016. 

There were no investment sales for the three months

Note 3:  Loans and Allowance for Loan Losses 

Categories of loans include: 

The risk characteristics of each loan portfolio segment
are as follows: 

Commercial  

Commercial loans are primarily
based on the identified cash flows of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower. The cash
flows of borrowers, however, may not be as expected and the collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value. Most commercial
loans are secured by the assets being financed or other business assets, such as accounts receivable or inventory, and may include
a personal guarantee. Short-term loans may be made on an unsecured basis. In the case of loans secured by accounts receivable,
the availability of funds for the repayment of these loans may be substantially dependent on the ability of the borrower to collect
amounts due from its customers. 

Commercial Real Estate  

Commercial real estate loans
are viewed primarily as cash flow loans and secondarily as loans secured by real estate. Commercial real estate lending typically
involves higher loan principal amounts and the repayment of these loans is generally dependent on the successful operation of the
property securing the loan or the business conducted on the property securing the loan. Commercial real estate loans may be more
adversely affected by conditions in the real estate markets or in the general economy. The characteristics of properties securing
the Company s commercial real estate portfolio are diverse, but with geographic location almost entirely in the Company s
market area. Management monitors and evaluates commercial real estate loans based on collateral, geography and risk grade criteria.
In general, the Company avoids financing single purpose projects unless other underwriting factors are present to help mitigate
risk. In addition, management tracks the level of owner-occupied commercial real estate versus nonowner-occupied loans.

Residential and Consumer  

Residential and consumer loans
consist of two segments - residential mortgage loans and personal loans. For residential mortgage loans that are secured by 1-4
family residences and are generally owner-occupied, the Company generally establishes a maximum loan-to-value ratio and requires
private mortgage insurance if that ratio is exceeded. Home equity loans are typically secured by a subordinate interest in 1-4
family residences, and consumer personal loans are secured by consumer personal assets, such as automobiles or recreational vehicles.
Some consumer personal loans are unsecured, such as small installment loans and certain lines of credit. Repayment of these loans
is primarily dependent on the personal income of the borrowers, which can be impacted by economic conditions in their market areas,
such as unemployment levels. Repayment can also be impacted by changes in property values on residential properties. Risk is mitigated
by the fact that the loans are of smaller individual amounts and spread over a large number of borrowers.

To facilitate the monitoring
of credit quality within the loan portfolio, and for purposes of analyzing historical loss rates used in the determination of the
ALLL, the Company utilizes the following categories of credit grades: pass, special mention, substandard, and doubtful. The four
categories, which are derived from standard regulatory rating definitions, are assigned upon initial approval of credit to borrowers
and updated periodically thereafter. Pass ratings, which are assigned to those borrowers that do not have identified potential
or well defined weaknesses and for which there is a high likelihood of orderly repayment, are updated periodically based on the
size and credit characteristics of the borrower. All other categories are updated on at least a quarterly basis. 

The Company assigns a special
mention rating to loans that have potential weaknesses that deserve management s close attention. If left uncorrected, these
potential weaknesses may, at some future date, result in the deterioration of the repayment prospects for the loan or the Company s
credit position. 

The Company assigns a substandard
rating to loans that are inadequately protected by the current sound worth and paying capacity of the borrower or of the collateral
pledged. Substandard loans have well defined weaknesses or weaknesses that could jeopardize the orderly repayment of the debt.
Loans and leases in this grade also are characterized by the distinct possibility that the Company will sustain some loss if the
deficiencies noted are not addressed and corrected. 

The Company assigns a doubtful
rating to loans that have all the attributes of a substandard rating with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection
or liquidation in full, on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. The
possibility of loss is extremely high, but because of certain important and reasonable specific pending factors that may work to
the advantage of and strengthen the credit quality of the loan or lease, its classification as an estimated loss is deferred until
its more exact status may be determined. Pending factors may include a proposed merger or acquisition, liquidation proceeding,
capital injection, perfecting liens on additional collateral or refinancing plans. 

The Company evaluates the loan
risk grading system definitions and allowance for loan losses methodology on an ongoing basis. No significant changes were made
to either during the past year to date period.

A loan is considered impaired,
in accordance with the impairment accounting guidance (ASC 310-10-35-16), when based on current information and events, it is probable
the Company will be unable to collect all amounts due from the borrower in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan. Impaired
loans include nonperforming commercial loans but also include loans modified in troubled debt restructurings where concessions
have been granted to borrowers experiencing financial difficulties. These concessions could include a reduction in the interest
rate on the loan, payment extensions, forgiveness of principal, forbearance or other actions intended to maximize collection.

are agreements to provide credit or to support the credit of others, as long as conditions established in the contracts are met,
and usually have expiration dates. Commitments may expire without being used. Off-balance-sheet risk to credit loss exists up to
the face amount of these instruments, although material losses are not anticipated. The same credit policies are used to make such
commitments as are used for loans, including obtaining collateral at exercise of the commitment.

The Company defines fair value
as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants
at the measurement date. The Company also utilizes a fair value hierarchy which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable
inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The standard describes three levels of inputs that
may be used to measure fair value: 

Level 1     Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 

Level 2     Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets
or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable
market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 

Level 3     Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are
significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities

Available-for-sale Securities 

Where quoted market prices are
available in an active market, securities are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. The Company s equity
securities are classified within Level 1 of the hierarchy. If quoted market prices are not available, then fair values are estimated
by using quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or independent asset pricing services and pricing models, the
inputs of which are market-based or independently sourced market parameters, including, but not limited to, yield curves, interest
rates, volatilities, prepayments, defaults, cumulative loss projections and cash flows. Such securities are classified in Level
2 of the valuation hierarchy.

within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, the process used to develop the reported fair value is described below. 

Impaired Loans (Collateral
Dependent) 

Collateral dependent impaired
loans consisted primarily of loans secured by nonresidential real estate. Management has determined fair value measurements on
impaired loans primarily through evaluations of appraisals performed. Due to the nature of the valuation inputs, impaired loans
are classified within Level 3 of the hierarchy. 

The Company considers the appraisal
or evaluation as the starting point for determining fair value and then considers other factors and events in the environment that
may affect the fair value. Appraisals of the collateral underlying collateral-dependent loans are obtained when the loan is determined
to be collateral-dependent and subsequently as deemed necessary by the Company s Chief Lender. Appraisals are reviewed for
accuracy and consistency by the Company s Chief Lender. Appraisers are selected from the list of approved appraisers maintained
by management. The appraised values are reduced by discounts to consider lack of marketability and estimated cost to sell if repayment
or satisfaction of the loan is dependent on the sale of the collateral. These discounts and estimates are developed by the Company s
Chief Lender by comparison to historical results. 

Foreclosed Assets Held for
Sale 

Assets acquired through, or in
lieu of, loan foreclosure are held for sale and are initially recorded at fair value (based on current appraised value) at the
date of foreclosure, establishing a new cost basis. Subsequent to foreclosure, valuations are periodically performed by management
and the assets are carried at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell. Management has determined fair value
measurements on other real estate owned primarily through evaluations of appraisals performed, and current and past offers for
the other real estate under evaluation. Due to the nature of the valuation inputs, foreclosed assets held for sale are classified
within Level 3 of the hierarchy. 

Appraisals of OREO are obtained
when the real estate is acquired and subsequently as deemed necessary by the Company s Chief lender. Appraisals are reviewed
for accuracy and consistency by the Company s Chief Lender and are selected from the list of approved appraisers maintained
by management.

ratings and for the same remaining maturities. Loans with similar characteristics were aggregated for purposes of the calculations. 

Deposits 

Deposits include demand deposits,
savings accounts, NOW accounts and certain money market deposits. The carrying amount approximates fair value. The fair value of
fixed-maturity time deposits is estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies the rates currently offered for
deposits of similar remaining maturities.

The carrying amount approximates
fair value. 

Short-term Borrowings,
Federal Home Loan Bank Advances and Subordinated Debentures 

Rates currently available to
the Company for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities are used to estimate the fair value of existing debt. 

Commitments to Originate
Loans, Letters of Credit and Lines of Credit 

The fair value of commitments
to originate loans is estimated using the fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements, taking into account the remaining
terms of the agreements and the present creditworthiness of the counterparties. For fixed-rate loan commitments, fair value also
considers the difference between current levels of interest rates and the committed rates. The fair values of letters of credit
and lines of credit are based on fees currently charged for similar agreements or on the estimated cost to terminate or otherwise
settle the obligations with the counterparties at the reporting date. Fair values of commitments were not material at September
30, 2016 and December 31, 2015. 

Note 8:           Repurchase Agreements 

Securities
sold under agreements to repurchase ( repurchase agreements ) with customers represent funds deposited by customers,
generally on an overnight basis that are collateralized by investment securities owned by the Company.   

At
September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, repurchase agreement borrowings totaled $13,554,000 and $5,691,000, respectively and
are included in short-term borrowings on the consolidated condensed balance sheets. All repurchase agreements are subject to term

       Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial    

Condition and Results of Operations    

The following discusses the financial condition
of the Company as of September 30, 2016, as compared to December 31, 2015, and the results of operations for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the interim
condensed consolidated financial statements and related footnotes included herein. 

Introduction  

United Bancorp, Inc. (NASDAQ: UBCP), headquartered
in Martins Ferry, Ohio, reported diluted earnings per share of $0.53 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared
to $0.47 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of 12.8%. This growth in earnings can be attributed to several
factors that are explained below in detail. The Company s diluted earnings per share for the three months ended September
30, 2016, was $0.18, compared to $0.17 for the same period last year, an increase of 5.9%. 

The earnings improvement of our Company
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is reflective of the growth in loan related earning assets. During this period, the
Company s net interest margin increased to a level of 3.87%, as compared to 3.68% for the same period in 2015. This increase
in the net interest margin is primarily attributed to the Company experiencing positive organic growth in its loan portfolio, which
produced higher levels of interest income, and the continued lowering of its interest expense levels year-over-year. As of September
30, 2016, the Company had gross loans of $350.6 million, which is an increase of $24.3 million, or 7.45%, over the same period
last year. This is a direct result of the Company s enhanced loan origination platform started in the late second quarter
of last year. Having a higher level of funding invested in quality loans, as compared to lower-yielding federal funds, helped drive
the increase in the margin. This occurred even though the loan portfolio continued to reprice downward over the course of the past
year as the long-end of the yield curve remained at historic low levels. Considering that longer-term Treasury rates (which have
a correlation to how the Company s loans reprice) have been priced at relatively the same levels for the past several years,
the overall yield in the Company s loan portfolio has stabilized in recent months. The combination of both loan growth and
the stabilization of the yield in the Company s loan portfolio should lead to higher levels of interest income being generated
in the coming quarters. With stronger loan growth, the Company s funds management policy changed during 2016. In prior years,
the majority of surplus funding was invested in very liquid, lower-yielding excess reserves at the Federal Reserve. During the
first quarter of 2016, these excess reserves previously invested in lower-yielding investment alternatives were fully depleted
and the Company, for the first time in several years, switched to a borrowed position to fund its loan growth by utilizing wholesale
funding alternatives. Also, with stronger loan growth, securities and other required stock balances decreased by $876 thousand
to a level of $36.0 million at the most recent quarter-end as compared to the same period in 2015. Going forward, it is anticipated
that the Company s securities portfolio will be maintained at this present level to support its pledge requirement for public
depository accounts until investment yields get to more normalized levels. The Company s credit quality has not changed significantly
and has remained strong on a year-over-year basis, as nonaccrual loans decreased by $150,000 to a level of $1.4 million. Net charge-offs
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, were $291,000, or 0.09% of average loans. The Company continued to see a decrease
in its other real estate and repossessions ( OREO, ) as balances decreased by $42,000, or 11.7%, to a level of $320,000.
Lastly, the overall total allowance for loan losses to total loans was 0.70%, resulting in a total allowance for loan losses to
nonperforming loans of 175.39% at September 30, 2016, as compared to 0.84% and 176.08% respectively at September 30, 2015. During
the third quarter of 2016, the Company sold its Bankers Bancshares, Inc. stock and realized a gain of $162,215.

Management s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial  

   Condition and Results of Operations  

On the liability-side of the balance sheet,
the Company continued to see a positive return on its strategy of attracting lower-cost funding accounts, while allowing higher-cost
funding to run off. Year-over-year, lower-cost funding, consisting of demand and savings deposits, increased by $12.0 million and
comprised 83.58% of total deposits as of September 30, 2016, as compared to 81.13% of total deposits the year prior. This was one
factor that helped the Company reduce its total interest expense by $398,000, or 22.9%, on a year-over-year basis. The other factors
that helped the Company reduce its total interest expense levels during the first nine months of 2016 were the previously announced
repricing of the Company s $4.1 million subordinated debenture on January 1, 2016, from a fixed rate of 6.25% to an average
variable rate of approximately 1.96% (which is based on three-month LIBOR plus a margin of 1.35%) and a $6.0 million Federal Home
Loan Bank advance that matured in May at a rate of 3.28%, which was replaced with a short-term borrowing at approximately 50 basis
points. Both of these events should save the Company approximately $344,000 in interest expense on an annualized basis. Lastly,
for the quarter, noninterest expense levels increased by $311,000, or 3.3%. Part of this increase is attributed to the increase
in lending personnel that have driven the solid growth in loan production. But, during the second quarter of 2016, the Company
was not immune to industry trends related to debit card fraud losses occurring in the primary markets that it serves. As a result,
fraud losses and card-related reissuance costs of approximately $208,000 ($138,000 after tax or approximately $0.025 per share
dilution) were realized during the second quarter of 2016. During the three-months ended September 30, 2016, the Company received
an insurance refund on this fraud of $50,000. Under consumer regulation, the Company bears the financial loss relating to debit
card fraud and its customers are made whole on the loss. During the third quarter, the Company implemented newer fraud prevention
technology relating to its debit cards that included a chip-enabled debit card and a smart phone app,  My Mobile Money, 
that allows our customers to monitor and control their debit card usage by sending transaction alerts. Our goal is to control our
level of noninterest expense while continuing to build and strengthen our operational foundation, which should lead to future growth,
higher levels of operating income and, ultimately, a higher level of performance. Over the next 15 months, it is projected that
our Company s interest expense will be positively impacted by the repricing of $20 million in fixed-rate advances with the
Federal Home Loan Bank ( FHLB ) that are set to mature. The average cost of these advances is 3.91% and, given the
current interest rate environment, should lead to continued savings in interest expense. By growing our loan portfolio and reducing
our overall levels of interest expense, we believe that we will see continued growth in the level of the net interest income that
our Company generates. It is projected that this will lead to a higher level of earnings and profitability for our Company in future
periods.

   Management s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial  

Condition and Results of Operations  

We are seeing the positive results of the
efforts expended over the course of the past couple of years within our Company to gain efficiencies through process improvement,
while building and leveraging our loan origination platforms to generate higher levels of revenue. We are pleased with these results
that we are now seeing and will continue looking for additional opportunities that will help our organization become more operationally
efficient, generate higher levels of revenue and produce higher levels of quality earnings. As we previously announced, our Company
is embarking upon a new period, whereby our exclusive focus is to grow our assets in a profitable fashion that will produce consistent
and increasing earnings. This vision, which is called Mission 2020, sets the course for our Company to grow its assets to a level
of $1.0 billion, or greater, by the end of 2020. In order to achieve this ambitious growth plan, we will need to continue focusing
on being operationally efficient, while taking on higher levels of non-interest expense to support an origination platform that
will drive the organic growth of our Company. It is projected that this enhanced platform, which began being implemented in the
late second quarter of last year, will continue to lead to the origination of higher levels of quality loans as seen in recent
quarters. This will help our Company generate higher levels of interest income, which, in turn, should produce an increase in the
all-important revenue line  net interest income. During the mid-part of this year, our Company further added to its commercial
loan origination platform by hiring supplementary origination personnel in addition to recently opening a new Loan Production Office
(LPO) in Wheeling, West Virginia. Having a LPO in this highly desirable, local market will create value for our Company going forward
and will help us achieve our strategic plan of expanding our markets. As previously announced, the Company also envisions expanding
its geographic footprint by acquiring other community-minded banking organizations within the tri-state area of Ohio, West Virginia
and Pennsylvania, to help it attain the lofty level of growth envisioned under Mission 2020. Being a very well capitalized and
profitable Company in today s environment will help us achieve the goals that are defined under this vision within our current
strategic plan. With the aforementioned change in our funds management policy during the first half of this year, our Company is
now positioned to attract higher levels of funding, both retail and wholesale, which will allow us to leverage our capital at a
more optimal level and produce higher earnings and returns. As of September 30, 2016, our Company is considered to be well-capitalized
by regulatory standards, having equity to assets of 10.03%. With the excess capital that our Company presently has, we will be
able to begin the growth trajectory that we envision, which should benefit all of our valued shareholders. In 2015, we paid a regular
cash dividend of $0.37 and a special dividend of $0.05. With our Company s present regular cash dividend of $0.11, which
began being paid in the third quarter of 2016, our forward yield as of quarter-end is 4.04%. At this level, our Company s
cash dividend yield is nearly twice that of the average bank in our country. With our present focus of increasing our operating
leverage by driving the revenue of our Company while containing expenses, we firmly believe that we will continue to reward our
shareholders by paying higher dividends, while seeing appreciation in our market value. On a year-over-year basis, the market value
of our Company s stock increased by $1.81, or 20.0%, to a level of $10.88. Our number one focus continues to be growing our
shareholders  investment in our Company through profitable operations and strategic growth. In addition to driving the market
value appreciation of our shareholders  ownership, we will continue striving to reward our owners by paying a solid cash
dividend. Overall, we are very pleased with the present operating performance of our Company and the direction that we are going.
We are extremely optimistic about our future potential and look forward to carrying the earnings momentum that we have seen in
recent quarters well into the foreseeable future!

The Company is not aware of any trends,

operations, liquidity or capital resources except as discussed herein. The Company is not aware of any current recommendation by
regulatory authorities that would have such effect if implemented except as discussed herein. 

The Company does not undertake, and specifically

Critical Accounting Policies  

Management makes certain judgments that
affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and footnotes. These estimates, assumptions and judgments are based on
information available as of the date of the financial statements, and as this information changes, the financial statements could
reflect different estimates, assumptions, and judgments. 

The procedures for assessing the adequacy
of the allowance for loan losses reflect our evaluation of credit risk after careful consideration of all information available
to management. In developing this assessment, management must rely on estimates and exercise judgment regarding matters where the
ultimate outcome is unknown such as economic factors, developments affecting companies in specific industries and issues with respect
to single borrowers. Depending on changes in circumstances, future assessments of credit risk may yield materially different results,
which may require an increase or a decrease in the allowance for loan losses. 

The allowance is regularly reviewed by
management and the board to determine whether the amount is considered adequate to absorb probable losses. This evaluation includes
specific loss estimates on certain individually reviewed loans, statistical loss estimates for loan pools that are based on historical
loss experience, and general loss estimates that are based on the size, quality and concentration characteristics of the various
loan portfolios, adverse situations that may affect a borrower s ability to repay and current economic and industry conditions.
Also considered as part of that judgment is a review of the Bank s trend in delinquencies and loan losses, and economic factors.

        Condition and Results of Operations    

The allowance for loan losses is maintained
at a level believed adequate by management to absorb probable loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio. Management s evaluation
of the adequacy of the allowance is an estimate based on management s current judgment about the credit quality of the loan
portfolio. While the Company strives to reflect all known risk factors in its evaluation, judgment errors may occur. 

Analysis of Financial Condition  

Earning Assets   Loans   

Our focus as a community bank is to meet
the credit needs of the markets we serve. At September 30, 2016, gross loans were $350.6 million, compared to $329.7 million at
December 31, 2015, an increase of $20.9 million after offsetting repayments for the period. The overall increase in the loan portfolio
was comprised of a $27.6 million increase in commercial and commercial real estate loans a $4.0 million decrease in residential
loans and a $2.7 million decrease in installment loans since December 31, 2015. 

Commercial and commercial real estate loans comprised 73.7%
of total loans at September 30, 2016, compared to 70.0% at December 31, 2015. Commercial and commercial real estate loans have
increased $27.6 million, or 12.0% since December 31, 2015. This segment of the loan portfolio includes originated loans in our
market areas and purchased participations in loans from other banks for out-of-area commercial and commercial real estate loans
to benefit from consistent economic growth outside the Company s primary market area, but mainly within the state of Ohio
and West Virginia. During the third quarter of 2016, the Company opened up a Loan Production office in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is anticipated this market will provide the Company with continued strong loan growth opportunities. 

Residential real estate loans were 22.1%
of total loans at September 30, 2016 and 24.7% at December 31, 2015, representing a decrease of $4.0 million, or less than 4.9%
since December 31, 2015. As of September 30, 2016, the Bank has approximately $4.4 million in fixed-rate loans that have been sold
in the secondary market but still serviced by the Company as compared to $7.1 million at December 31, 2015. The level of fixed
rate mortgages serviced by the Company will continue to decline as the Company will not retain servicing rights on new sales going
forward for these types of products. The Company will continue to service these loans for a fee that is typically 25 basis points.
At September 30, 2016, the Company did not hold any loans for sale. 

Installment loans represented 4.2% of total
loans at September 30, 2016 and 5.3% at December 31, 2015. Some of the installment loans carry somewhat more risk than real estate
lending; however, it also provides for higher yields. Installment loans have decreased $2.7 million, or 15.0%, since December 31,
2015. The targeted lending areas encompass four separate metropolitan areas, minimizing the risk to changes in economic conditions
in the communities housing the Company s banking locations. The strategic direction of the Company is not to grow installment
based loans at this time. 

The allowance for loan losses totaled $2.5
million at September 30, 2016, which represented 0.69% of total loans, and $2.4 million at December 31, 2015, or 0.73% of total
loans. The allowance represents the amount which management and the Board of Directors estimates is adequate to provide for probable
losses inherent in the loan portfolio. The allowance balance and the provision charged to expense are reviewed by management and
the Board of Directors monthly using a risk evaluation model that considers borrowers  past due experience, economic conditions
and various other circumstances that are subject to change over time. Management believes the current balance of the allowance
for loan losses is adequate to absorb probable incurred credit losses associated with the loan portfolio. Net charge-offs for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 were approximately $290,000, compared to $60,000 during the same period in 2015.

   Management s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial  

Condition and Results of Operations  

Earning Assets   Securities   

The securities portfolio is comprised of
U.S. Government agency-backed securities, tax-exempt obligations of state and political subdivisions and certain other investments.
Securities available for sale at September 30, 2016 decreased approximately $2.8 million from December 31, 2015 totals. The Company
has invested in shorter duration securities to reinvest liquid funds. 

Sources of Funds   Deposits    

The Company s primary source of funds
is core deposits from retail and business customers. These core deposits include all categories of interest-bearing and noninterest-bearing
deposits, excluding certificates of deposit greater than $100,000. For the period ended September 30, 2016, total core deposits
increased approximately $5.1 million, or 1.4%. The Company s savings accounts increased $1.4 million or 1.9% from December
31, 2015 totals. The Company s interest-bearing and non-interest bearing demand deposits increased $6.8 million or 3.6% while
certificates of deposit under $100,000 decreased by $3.1 million, or 7.2%. The Company considers core deposit to be stable; therefore,
the amount of funds anticipated to flow out in the next three to six months is not considered material to the overall liquidity
position of the Company. 

The Company   has a strong deposit
base from public agencies, including local school districts, city and township municipalities, public works facilities and others
that may tend to be more seasonal in nature resulting from the receipt and disbursement of state and federal grants. These entities
have maintained fairly static balances with the Company due to various funding and disbursement timeframes. 

Certificates of deposit greater than $100,000
are not considered part of core deposits and as such are used to balance rate sensitivity as a tool of funds management. At September
30, 2016, certificates of deposit greater than $100,000 decreased $612,000 or 4.3%, from December 31, 2015 totals. 

Sources of Funds   Securities Sold under Agreements
to Repurchase and Other Borrowings   

Other interest-bearing liabilities include
securities sold under agreements to repurchase and Federal Home Loan Bank ( FHLB ) advances. The majority of the Company s
repurchase agreements are with local school districts and city and county governments. The Company s short-term borrowings
increased approximately $7.9 million from December 31, 2015 totals. In prior years, the majority of surplus funding was invested
in very liquid, lower-yielding excess reserves at the Federal Reserve. During the first quarter of 2016, these excess reserves
previously invested in lower-yielding investment alternatives were fully depleted and the Company, for the first time in several
years, switched to a borrowed position to fund its loan growth by utilizing wholesale funding alternatives, mainly overnight borrowings
from the FHLB. At September 30, 2016, FHLB Overnight advances totaled $13.2 million. At December 31, 2015, the Company did have
FHLB Overnight advances as the Company had excess reserves. Over the next 15 months, it is projected that our Company s interest
expense will be positively impacted by the repricing of $20 million in fixed-rate advances with the Federal Home Loan Bank ( FHLB )
that are set to mature. The average cost of these advances is 3.91% and, given the current interest rate environment, should lead
to continued savings in interest expense.

   Management s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial  

Condition and Results of Operations  

Results of Operations for the Nine
Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 

Net Income   

For the nine months ended September 30,
2015 the Company reported net earnings of $2,679,000, compared to $2,358,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. On a
per share basis, the Company s diluted earnings were $0.53 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $0.47
for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. 

Net Interest Income   

Net interest
income, by definition, is the difference between interest income generated on interest-earning assets and the interest expense
incurred on interest-bearing liabilities. Various factors contribute to changes in net interest income, including volumes, interest
rates and the composition or mix of interest-earning assets in relation to interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income increased
7.6%, or $771,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015.  The earnings improvement
of our Company for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is reflective of the growth in loan related earning assets. During
this period, the Company s net interest margin increased to a level of 3.87%, as compared to 3.68% for the same period in
2015. This increase in the net interest margin is primarily attributed to the Company experiencing positive organic growth in its
loan portfolio, which produced higher levels of interest income, and the continued lowering of its interest expense levels year-over-year. 

Provision for Loan Losses   

Non-accrual loans were decreased $150,000
to a level of $1.4 million as of September 30, 2016. With the decrease in the level of non accrual loans and loans past due 30
plus days, the level of risk in loss exposure has decreased since December 31, 2015. Net loans charged off were $291,000 or 0.09%
of average loans. The Company decreased the provision for loan losses which was $387,000 for the nine months ended September 30,
2015 compared to $307,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, a decrease of $80,000 or 20.7%. 

Noninterest Income   

Total noninterest income   is made
up of bank related fees and service charges, as well as other income producing services provided, sales of loans in the secondary
market, ATM income, early redemption penalties for certificates of deposit, safe deposit rental income, internet bank service fees,
earnings on bank-owned life insurance and other miscellaneous items. 

The Company s service charges on
deposit accounts decreased by $173,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. During
the nine months ended September 30, 2015, the Company recorded approximately $95,000 of a gain related to a one time payment from
its debit card processor. 

Noninterest Expense   

Noninterest
expense increased on a year-over-year basis by $312,000 or 3.3%. Salaries and employee benefit expense increased $428,000, or 9.0%,
for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015.  Part of this increase in salaries
and employee benefit expense is attributed to the increase in lending personnel that have driven the solid growth in loan production.
 Provision for losses on foreclosed real estate decreased $51,000 for the nine months ended September
30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. Net occupancy decreased $72,000, or 4.9% for the nine months ended September 30,
2016, compared to the same period in 2015.  

Federal Income Taxes   

The provision for federal income taxes
was $1,148,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $181,000 compared to the same period in 2015. The effective
tax rate was 29.9% and 29.1% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Results of Operations for the Three
Months Ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 

Net Income   

For the three months ended September 30,
2016 the Company reported net earnings of $928,000, compared to $859,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. On a per
share basis, the Company s diluted earnings were $0.18 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to $0.17
for the three months ended September 30, 2015. 

Net Interest Income   

Net interest
income increased 5.5%, or $189,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015.  The
earnings improvement of our Company for the three months ended September 30, 2016 is reflective of the growth in loan related earning
assets. 

Provision for Loan Losses   

The provision for loan losses was $131,000
for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to $126,000 for the same period in 2014. 

Noninterest Income   

The Company s service charges on
deposit accounts decreased by $64,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. 

Noninterest Expense   

Noninterest
expense increased on a quarter-over-quarter basis by $163,000 or 5.1%. Salaries and employee benefit expense increased $248,000,
or 15.6%, for the three month period ended September 30, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015.  Part of this increase
in salaries and employee benefit expense is attributed to the increase in lending personnel that have driven the solid growth in
loan production.    

Federal Income Taxes   

The provision for federal income taxes
was $386,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $26,000 compared to the same period in 2015. The effective
tax rate was 29.4% and 29.5% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Management s Discussion and Analysis

   Condition and Results of Operations  

Capital Resources   

Internal capital growth, through the retention
of earnings, is the primary means of maintaining capital adequacy for the Company. Stockholders  equity totaled $42.8 million
at September 30, 2016 compared to $41.5 million at December 31, 2015, a $1.3 million increase. Total average stockholders 
equity in relation to total average assets was 10.03% at September 30, 2016 and 10.2% at December 31, 2015. Our shareholders approved
an amendment to the Company s Articles of Incorporation to create a class of preferred shares with 2,000,000 authorized shares.
This enables the Company, at the option of the Board of Directors, to issue series of preferred shares in a manner calculated to
take advantage of financing techniques which may provide a lower effective cost of capital to the Company. The amendment also provides
greater flexibility to the Board of Directors in structuring the terms of equity securities that may be issued by the Company.
Although this preferred stock is a financial tool, it has not been utilized to date. 

The Company has offered for many years
a Dividend Reinvestment Plan ( The Plan ) for shareholders under which the Company s common stock will be purchased
by the Plan for participants with automatically reinvested dividends. The Plan does not represent a change in the Company s
dividend policy or a guarantee of future dividends. 

The Company is subject to the regulatory
requirements of The Federal Reserve System as a bank holding company. The Bank is subject to regulations of the FDIC and the State
of Ohio, Division of Financial Institutions. The most important of these various regulations address capital adequacy. 

On January 1, 2015, the final rules of
the Federal Reserve Board went into effect implementing in the United States the Basel III regulatory capital reforms from the
Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain changes required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection
Act. 

Under the final rule, minimum requirements
increased for both the quality and quantity of capital held by banking organizations. The rule requires a new minimum ratio of
common equity tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 4.5 percent and a common equity tier 1 capital conservation buffer of 2.5
percent of risk-weighted assets that will apply to all supervised financial institutions. The rule also raises the minimum ratio
of tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets from 4 percent to 6 percent and includes a minimum leverage ratio of 4 percent for all
banking organizations. 

As of September 30, 2016, the Company continues to be well-capitalized
in accordance with Federal regulatory capital requirements as the capital ratios below show:

Management s Discussion and Analysis
of Financial  

   Condition and Results of Operations  

Liquidity   

Management s objective in managing
liquidity is maintaining the ability to continue meeting the cash flow needs of its customers, such as borrowings or deposit withdrawals,
as well as its own financial commitments. The principal sources of liquidity are net income, loan payments, maturing securities
and sales of securities available for sale, federal funds sold and cash and deposits with banks. Along with its liquid assets,
the Company has additional sources of liquidity available to ensure that adequate funds are available as needed. These include,
but are not limited to, the purchase of federal funds, the ability to borrow funds under line of credit agreements with correspondent
banks, a borrowing agreement with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati and the adjustment of interest rates to obtain depositors.
Management feels that it has the capital adequacy and profitability to meet the current and projected liquidity needs of its customers. 

Inflation   

Substantially all of the Company s
assets and liabilities relate to banking activities and are monetary in nature. The consolidated financial statements and related
financial data are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S.
GAAP ). U.S. GAAP currently requires the Company to measure the financial position and results of operations in terms of
historical dollars, with the exception of securities available for sale, certain impaired loans and certain other real estate and
loans that may be measured at fair value. Changes in the value of money due to rising inflation can cause purchasing power loss. 

Management s opinion is that movements
in interest rates affect the financial condition and results of operations to a greater degree than changes in the rate of inflation.
It should be noted that interest rates and inflation do affect each other, but do not always move in correlation with each other.
The Company s ability to match the interest sensitivity of its financial assets to the interest sensitivity of its liabilities
in its asset/liability management may tend to minimize the effect of changes in interest rates on the Company s performance.

ITEM 4.         Controls and Procedures  

The Company, under the supervision, and
with the participation, of its management, including the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated
the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to the requirements
of Exchange Act Rule 13a-15. Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that

relating to the Company (including its consolidated subsidiary) required to be included in the Company's periodic SEC filings. 

There was no change in the Company's internal
control over financial reporting that occurred during the Company's fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2015 that has materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES 

The Company adopted the United Bancorp,
Inc. Affiliate Banks Directors and Officers Deferred Compensation Plan (the  Plan ), which is an unfunded deferred
compensation plan. Amounts deferred pursuant to the Plan remain unrestricted assets of the Company, and the right to participate
in the Plan is limited to members of the Board of Directors and Company officers. Under the Plan, directors or other eligible participants
may defer fees and up to 50% of their annual incentive award payable to them by the Company, which are used to acquire common shares
which are credited to a participant s respective account. Except in the event of certain emergencies, no distributions are
to be made from any account as long as the participant continues to be an employee or member of the Board of Directors. Upon termination
of service, the aggregate number of shares credited to the participant s account are distributed to him or her along with
any cash proceeds credited to the account which have not yet been invested in the Company s stock. On May 11, 2016, the Plan
purchased a total of 4,136 common shares for participant accounts. All purchases under this deferred compensation plan are funded
with either earned director fees or officer incentive award payments. 

No underwriting fees, discounts, or commissions
are paid in connection with the Plan. The shares allocated to participant accounts have not been registered under the Securities
Act of 1933 in reliance upon the exemption provided by Section 4(2) thereof.
