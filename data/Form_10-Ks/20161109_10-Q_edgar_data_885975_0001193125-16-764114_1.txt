   NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
 In thousands, except share and per share data  
  1. The Company and Basis of Presentation   
 Cinemark USA, Inc. and subsidiaries (the  Company ), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cinemark Holdings, Inc., operates in the motion
picture exhibition industry, with theatres in the United States ( U.S. ), Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Guatemala, Bolivia, Curacao and Paraguay.  
 The accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015, which was derived from audited financial statements, and
the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP ) for interim financial information and in accordance with
the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by U.S. GAAP for complete consolidated financial statements. In the opinion of management, all
adjustments, consisting of normal recurring adjustments, considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Majority-owned subsidiaries that the Company has control of are consolidated while those affiliates of which the
Company owns between 20% and 50% and does not control are accounted for under the equity method. Those affiliates of which the Company owns less than 20% are generally accounted for under the cost method, unless the Company is deemed to have the
ability to exercise significant influence over the affiliate, in which case the Company would account for its investment under the equity method. The results of these subsidiaries and affiliates are included in the condensed consolidated financial
statements effective with their formation or from their dates of acquisition. Intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.  
 These condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited annual consolidated financial statements and
the notes thereto for the year ended December 31, 2015, included in the Annual Report on Form 10-K filed March 4, 2016 by the Company under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange Act ). Operating results
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be achieved for the full year.  
  Accounting Reclassifications   
 The Company has reclassified $8,844 and $24,071 in expenses from film rentals and advertising costs to utilities and other costs on the
condensed consolidated statement of income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively, to be consistent with the presentation for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. During the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, the Company determined that reclassifying the expenses, which are related to the maintenance and monitoring of projection and sound equipment, results in a more clear presentation of film rentals and advertising costs.  
  2. New Accounting Pronouncements     In
February 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued Accounting Standards Update 2015-02,  Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis , ( ASU 2015-02 ). ASU 2015-02 affects
reporting entities that are required to evaluate whether they should consolidate certain legal entities. Specifically, ASU 2015-02 modifies the evaluation of whether limited partnerships and similar legal entities are variable interest entities
(VIEs) or voting interest entities, eliminates the presumption that a general partner should consolidate a limited partnership and affects the consolidation analysis of reporting entities that are involved with certain VIEs. ASU 2015-02 also
provides a scope exception from consolidation guidance for reporting entities with interests in legal entities that are required to comply with or operate in accordance with requirements that are similar to those in Rule 2a-7 of the Investment
Company Act of 1940 for registered money market funds. ASU 2015-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015. Effective January 1, 2016, the Company adopted ASU 2015-02, which had no impact on its condensed
consolidated financial statements.    In February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-02,  Leases (Topic 842) ,
( ASU 2016-02 ). The purpose of ASU 2016-02 is to provide financial statement users a better understanding of the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The adoption of ASU 2016-02 will result in the recognition
of a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for most operating leases. New disclosure requirements include qualitative

and quantitative information about the amounts recorded in the financial statements. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. ASU 2016-02 requires a
modified retrospective transition by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which the guidance is effective with the option to elect certain practical expedients. Early adoption is
permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-02 on its condensed consolidated financial statements.    In March
2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-04,  Liabilities   Extinguishment of Liabilities (Subtopic 405-20) , ( ASU 2016-04 ). The purpose of ASU 2016-04 is to provide a narrow scope exception to the guidance in
Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC ) Subtopic 405-20 to require that breakage of liabilities associated with prepaid stored-value products be accounted for consistent with the breakage guidance in ASC Topic 606. ASU 2016-04 is
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017. The amendments in ASU 2016-04 may be applied either using a modified retrospective transition method by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the
beginning of the fiscal year in which the guidance is effective or retrospectively to each period presented. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-04 on its condensed consolidated financial
statements.    In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-07,  Investments   Equity Method and Joint Ventures
(Topic 323) , ( ASU 2016-07 ). The purpose of ASU 2016-07 is to eliminate the requirement that when an investment qualifies for use of the equity method as a result of an increase in the level of ownership interest or degree of
influence, an investor must adjust the investment, results of operations, and retained earnings retroactively on a step-by-step basis as if the equity method had been in effect during all previous periods that the investment was held. ASU 2016-07 is
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016. The amendments in ASU 2016-07 should be applied prospectively. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect ASU 2016-07 to have an impact on its condensed consolidated
financial statements.    In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-08,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic
606): Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenues Gross versus Net) , ( ASU 2016-08 ). The purpose of ASU 2016-08 is to clarify the implementation of revenue recognition guidance related to principal versus agent
considerations. ASU 2016-08 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that year, concurrent with Accounting Standards Update 2014-09,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic
606) . The amendments in ASU 2016-08 may be applied either using a modified retrospective transition method by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which the guidance is effective
or retrospectively to each period presented. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-08 on its condensed consolidated financial statements.  
 In March 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-09,  Compensation   Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to
Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting , ( ASU 2016-09 ). The purpose of ASU 2016-09 is to simplify the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity
or liabilities, and classification of such activity on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that year. Prospective, retrospective, or modified
retrospective application may be used dependent on the specific requirements of the amendments within ASU 2016-09. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-09 on its condensed consolidated financial
statements.    In May 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-12,  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606):
Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients , ( ASU 2016-12 ). The purpose of ASU 2016-12 is to address certain narrow aspects of ASC Topic 606 including assessing collectability, presentation of sales and other similar taxes,
noncash considerations, contract modifications and completed contracts at transition. ASU 2016-12 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that year, concurrent with Accounting Standards
Update 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). The amendments in ASU 2016-12 may be applied either using a modified retrospective transition method by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the
beginning of the fiscal year in which the guidance is effective or retrospectively to each period presented. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-12 on its condensed consolidated financial
statements.

  In August 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-15,  Statement of Cash
Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments   a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force , ( ASU 2016-15 ). The purpose of ASU 2016-15 is to reduce the diversity in practice regarding how
certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that year. A retrospective
transition method should be used in the application of the amendments within ASU 2016-15. If retrospective application is considered impracticable, retrospective application may be used as of the earliest date practicable. Early adoption is
permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2016-15 on its condensed consolidated financial statements.    In October
2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-16,  Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory , ( ASU 2016-16 ). The purpose of ASU 2016-16 is to improve the accounting for the income tax
consequences of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory. ASU 2016-16 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that year. A modified retrospective transition method should be
used in the application of the amendments within ASU 2016-16 with a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU
2016-16 on its condensed consolidated financial statements.     3. Long Term Debt Activity   
  Senior Secured Credit Facility   
 On May 16, 2016, the Company made a pre-payment of $13,451 on its term loan using the net proceeds received from the sale of shares of
RealD (see Note 6). In accordance with the terms of the senior secured credit facility agreement, the pre-payment was applied first to the next four principal installments, and second, to the remaining installments pro-rata based on the remaining
outstanding principal amount of such installments. Therefore, quarterly payments in the amount of $1,427 are due on the term loan beginning June 30, 2017 through March 31, 2022, with the remaining principal of $635,250 due on May 8,
2022. The Company did not incur any fees as a result of the pre-payment.    On June 13, 2016, the Company amended its senior secured
credit facility to reduce the rate at which the term loan bears interest by 0.25%. The Company incurred debt issue costs of approximately $802 in connection with the amendment, which are reflected as a reduction of long term debt on the condensed
consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2016. In addition, the Company incurred approximately $249 in legal and other fees that are reflected as loss on debt amendments and refinancing on the condensed consolidated statements of income
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.     Issuance of Additional 4.875% Senior Notes   
 On March 21, 2016, Cinemark USA, Inc. issued an additional $225,000 aggregate principal amount of 4.875% senior notes due 2023 (the
 4.875% Senior Notes ), at 99.0% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest from December 1, 2015. Proceeds, after payment of fees, were used to finance the redemption of Cinemark, USA, Inc. s $200,000 7.375% senior
subordinated notes due 2021 (the  7.375% Senior Subordinated Notes ), as discussed below. These additional notes have identical terms, other than the issue date, the issue price and the first interest payment date, and constitute part of
the same series as Cinemark USA, Inc. s existing 4.875% Senior Notes. The aggregate principal amount of $755,000 of 4.875% Senior Notes mature on June 1, 2023. The Company incurred debt issue costs of approximately $3,702 in connection
with the issuance of the additional notes, which, along with the discount of $2,250, are reflected as a reduction of long term debt, net of accumulated amortization, as of September 30, 2016.  
 On April 5, 2016, Cinemark USA, Inc. and its guarantor subsidiaries filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the  Commission ), pursuant to which Cinemark USA, Inc. offered to exchange the additional 4.875% Senior Notes for substantially identical notes registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, that do not contain terms
restricting the transfer thereof or providing for registration rights. The registration statement was declared effective April 18, 2016, and the notes were exchanged on May 17, 2016.

   Redemption of 7.375% Senior Subordinated Notes   
 On March 21, 2016, Cinemark USA, Inc. redeemed its $200,000 7.375% Senior Subordinated Notes at a make-whole premium of approximately 104%
plus accrued and unpaid interest, utilizing the proceeds from the issuance of the additional $225,000 Cinemark USA, Inc. 4.875% Senior Notes discussed above. As a result of the redemption, the Company wrote-off approximately $2,369 in unamortized
debt issue costs, paid the make-whole premium of $9,444 and paid other fees of $1,222, all of which are reflected in loss on debt amendments and refinancing during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  
  Fair Value of Long-Term Debt   
   The Company estimates the fair value of its long-term debt using the market approach, which utilizes quoted market prices that fall
under Level 2 of the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy as defined by FASB ASC Topic 820-10-35,  Fair Value Measurement . The carrying value of the Company s long-term debt was $1,824,355 and $1,814,572 as of September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, respectively, excluding unamortized debt discounts and debt issue costs. The fair value of the Company s long-term debt was $1,839,380 and $1,806,276 as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015,
respectively.       4. Equity   
 Below is a summary of changes in stockholder s equity attributable to Cinemark USA, Inc., noncontrolling interests and total equity for

    5. Investment in National CineMedia   
 The Company has an investment in National CineMedia, LLC ( NCM ). NCM operates a digital in-theatre network in the U.S. for
providing cinema advertising. Upon joining NCM, the Company entered into an Exhibitor Services Agreement with NCM ( ESA ), pursuant to which NCM provides advertising, promotion and event services to our theatres. As described further in
Note 4 to the Company s financial statements as included in its 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K, on February 13, 2007, National CineMedia, Inc. ( NCM, Inc. ), an entity that serves as the sole manager of NCM, completed an initial
public offering ( IPO ) of its common stock. In connection with the NCM Inc. initial public offering, the Company amended its operating agreement and the ESA. Following the NCM, Inc. IPO, the Company does not recognize undistributed equity
in the earnings on its original NCM membership units (referred to herein as the Company s Tranche 1 Investment) until NCM s future net earnings, less distributions received, surpass the amount of the excess distribution. The Company
recognizes equity in earnings on its Tranche 1 Investment only to the extent it receives cash distributions from NCM. The Company recognizes cash distributions it receives from NCM on its Tranche 1 Investment as a component of earnings as
Distributions from NCM. The Company believes that the accounting model provided by ASC 323-10-35-22 for recognition of equity investee losses in excess of an investor s basis is analogous to the accounting for equity income subsequent to
recognizing an excess distribution.

financial statements:      

(1)   
 Amount includes the per patron and per digital screen theatre access fees due to the Company, net of amounts due to NCM for on-screen advertising time provided to the Company s beverage concessionaire of
approximately $8,002.      During the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded equity in
earnings of approximately $5,815 and $6,263, respectively. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, the Company recorded equity in earnings of approximately $7,660 and $6,672, respectively.  
 The Company made payments to NCM of approximately $41 and $39 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively,
related to installation of certain equipment used for digital advertising, which is included in theatre properties and equipment on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.  
 On March 16, 2015, NCM, Inc. announced that it had agreed with Screenvision, LLC ( Screenvision ) to terminate a merger
agreement under which it would have acquired Screenvision. The termination of the merger agreement resulted in a $26.8 million termination payment to Screenvision by NCM, Inc. NCM indemnified NCM, Inc. for the termination fee. The impact of the
termination payment and related merger costs resulted in NCM paying reduced excess cash distributions to its shareholders for the first quarter of 2015 and the second quarter of 2016, as required by NCM s Amended and Restated Operating
Agreement.   Pursuant to a Common Unit Adjustment Agreement dated as of February 13, 2007 between NCM, Inc. and the Company, AMC
Entertainment, Inc. ( AMC ) and Regal Entertainment Group ( Regal ), annual adjustments to the common membership units are made primarily based on increases or decreases in the number of theatre screens operated and theatre
attendance generated by each Founding Member. As further discussed in Note 4 to the Company s financial statements as included in its 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K, the common units received are recorded at fair value as an increase in the
Company s investment in NCM with an offset to deferred revenue. The deferred revenue is amortized over the remaining term of the ESA. During March 2016, NCM performed its annual common unit adjustment calculation under the Common Unit
Adjustment Agreement. As a result of the calculation, the Company received an additional 753,598 common units of NCM, each of which is convertible into one share of NCM, Inc. common stock. The Company recorded the additional common units received at
fair value with a corresponding adjustment to deferred revenue of approximately $11,111. The deferred revenue will be recognized over the remaining term of the ESA, which is approximately 20 years.  
 As of September 30, 2016, the Company owned a total of 26,384,644 common units of NCM, representing an ownership interest of
approximately 19%. The estimated fair value of the Company s investment in NCM was approximately $388,382 as of September 30, 2016, using NCMI s stock price as of September 30, 2016 of $14.72 per share.

   Digital Cinema Implementation Partners LLC   
 On February 12, 2007, the Company, AMC and Regal entered into a joint venture known as DCIP to facilitate the implementation of digital
cinema in the Company s theatres and to establish agreements with major motion picture studios for the financing of digital cinema. On March 10, 2010, the Company signed a master equipment lease agreement and other related agreements
(collectively the  Agreements ) with Kasima LLC ( Kasima ), which is an indirect subsidiary of DCIP and a related party to the Company. Upon signing the Agreements, the Company contributed the majority of its U.S. digital
projection systems to DCIP, which DCIP then contributed to Kasima. The Company has a variable interest in Kasima through the terms of its master equipment lease agreement; however, the Company has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of
Kasima, as the Company does not have the ability to direct the activities of Kasima that most significantly impact Kasima s economic performance. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had a 33% voting interest in DCIP and a 24.3% economic
interest in DCIP. The Company accounts for its investment in DCIP and its subsidiaries under the equity method of accounting.    Below is
summary financial information for DCIP for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.      
   As of September 30, 2016, the Company had 3,788 digital projection systems being leased under the master
equipment lease agreement with Kasima. The Company had the following transactions, recorded in utilities and other on the condensed consolidated statements of income, with DCIP during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015:
     
    RealD, Inc.   
 The Company licenses 3-D systems from RealD. Under its license agreement with RealD, the Company earned options to purchase shares of RealD
common stock as it installed a certain number of 3-D systems as outlined in the license agreement. During 2010 and 2011, the Company vested in a total of 1,222,780 RealD options. Upon vesting in these options, the Company recorded an investment in
RealD and a deferred lease incentive liability using the estimated fair value of the RealD options at the time of vesting. During March 2011, the Company exercised all of its options to purchase shares of common stock in RealD for $0.00667 per
share.    On March 22, 2016, an affiliate of Rizvi Traverse Management, LLC acquired RealD for $11.00 per share. As a result of the
transaction, the Company sold its shares for approximately $13,451 and recognized a gain of $3,742, which included the recognition of a cumulative unrealized holding gain of $3,191 previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. The
gain is reflected as gain on sale of assets and other on the condensed consolidated statement of income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The Company used the proceeds to make a pre-payment on its term loan in accordance with the
terms of its senior secured credit facility (see Note 3).

  7. Share Based Awards      Restricted
Stock    During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, Cinemark Holdings, Inc. granted 322,700 shares of restricted stock to employees of the Company and to directors of Cinemark Holdings, Inc. The fair value of the restricted stock
granted was determined based on the market value of Cinemark Holdings, Inc. s common stock on the dates of grant, which ranged from $29.83 to $36.46 per share. The Company assumed forfeiture rates ranging from 0% to 10% for the restricted stock
awards. Restricted stock granted to employees vests over service periods that range from approximately one month to four years. Restricted stock granted to Cinemark Holdings, Inc. s directors vests over a one-year service period. The recipients
of restricted stock are entitled to receive dividends and to vote their respective shares, however, the sale and transfer of the restricted shares is prohibited during the restriction period.  
 Below is a summary of restricted stock activity for the nine months ended September 30, 2016:

As of September 30, 2016, the estimated remaining unrecognized compensation expense related to restricted stock awards was $13,648, of
which $13,103 will be recognized by the Company and $545 will be recognized by Cinemark Holdings, Inc. The weighted average period over which this remaining compensation expense will be recognized is approximately two years.  
  Restricted Stock Units    During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, Cinemark Holdings, Inc. granted restricted stock
units representing 253,661 hypothetical shares of its common stock to employees of the Company. The restricted stock units vest based on a combination of financial performance factors and continued service. The financial performance factors are
based on an implied equity value concept that determines an internal rate of return ( IRR ) during the two fiscal year periods ending December 31, 2017 based on a formula utilizing a multiple of Adjusted EBITDA subject to certain
specified adjustments as specified by the Compensation Committee of Cinemark Holdings, Inc. s board of directors ( Compensation Committee ) prior to the grant date. The financial performance factors for the restricted stock units have
a threshold, target and maximum level of payment opportunity and vest on a pro-rata basis according to the IRR achieved by the Company during the performance period. If the IRR for the two-year period is at least 6.0%, which is the threshold,
one-third of the maximum restricted stock units vest. If the IRR for the two-year period is at least 8.0%, which is the target, two-thirds of the maximum restricted stock units vest. If the IRR for the two-year period is at least 10.0%, which is the
maximum, 100% of the maximum restricted stock units vest. Grantees are eligible to receive a ratable portion of the common stock issuable if the IRR is within the targets previously noted. Further, as an example, if the Company achieves an IRR equal
to 9.0%, the number of restricted stock units that shall vest will be greater than the target but less than the maximum number that would have vested had the Company achieved the highest IRR. In accordance with their respective employment
agreements, the awards granted to the Company s former Chief Executive Officer and former President and Chief Operating Officer will vest upon the certification of the IRR for the 2016 award by the Compensation Committee. All other restricted
stock units granted during 2016 will vest subject to an additional two-year service requirement and will be paid in the form of Cinemark Holdings, Inc. s common stock if the participant continues to provide services through February 2020, which
is the fourth anniversary of the grant date. Restricted stock unit award participants are eligible to receive dividend equivalent payments from the grant date if, and at the time that, the restricted stock unit awards vest.  
 Below is a table summarizing the potential number of shares that could vest under restricted stock unit awards granted during the nine months
ended September 30, 2016 at each of the three target levels of financial performance (excluding forfeiture assumptions):      
   Due to the fact that the IRR for the two-year performance period could not be determined at the time of the
2016 grant, the Company estimated that the most likely outcome is the achievement of the target IRR level. The fair value of the restricted stock unit awards was determined based on the closing price of Cinemark Holdings, Inc. s common

stock on the date of grant, which was $29.83 per share. The Company assumed forfeiture rates ranging from 0% to 10% for the restricted stock unit awards. If during the service period, additional
information becomes available to lead the Company to believe a different IRR level will be achieved for the two-year performance period, the Company will reassess the number of units that will vest for the grant and adjust its compensation expense
accordingly on a prospective basis over the remaining service period.      
   As of September 30, 2016, the estimated remaining unrecognized compensation expense related to the
outstanding restricted stock unit awards was $7,354. The weighted average period over which this remaining compensation expense will be recognized is approximately two years. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had restricted stock units
outstanding that represented a total of 557,077 hypothetical shares of Cinemark Holdings, Inc. s common stock, net of actual cumulative forfeitures of 30,598 units, assuming the maximum IRR level is achieved for all grants outstanding.  
 Effective March 4, 2016, the Company s former President and Chief Operating Officer resigned with good reason as defined within his
employment agreement. As a result, certain of his restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards vested upon his resignation. The accelerated vesting of these awards were considered a modification of such awards, therefore the Company revalued
the vested awards at their fair value upon modification. The revaluation of these awards resulted in incremental share based award compensation expense of approximately $994, which is included in general and administrative expenses for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016.     8. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets   
 The Company s goodwill was as follows:      

(1)   
 Balances are presented net of accumulated impairment losses of $214,031 for the U.S. operating segment and $27,622 for the international operating segment.    
 The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the
carrying value of the goodwill may not be fully recoverable. The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level and has allocated goodwill to the reporting unit based on an estimate of its relative fair value. Management
considers the reporting unit to be each of its nineteen regions in the U.S. and seven countries internationally with Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama and Guatemala being considered one reporting unit (the Company does not have
goodwill recorded for all of its international locations).    For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company performed a qualitative
goodwill impairment assessment on all reporting units except one, in accordance with ASU 2011-08  Testing Goodwill for Impairment  ( ASU 2011-08 ). The qualitative assessment included consideration of historical and expected future
industry performance, estimated future performance of the Company, current industry trading multiples and other economic factors. Based on the qualitative assessment performed, the Company determined that it was not more likely than not that the
fair value of the reporting units were less than their carrying values. The Company performed a quantitative two-step approach on  
      18  

Table of Contents  

CINEMARK USA, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES  
 NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
 In thousands, except share and per share data      
  
a new U.S. region that had not previously been assessed for goodwill impairment. The two-step approach requires the Company to compute the fair value of a reporting unit and compare it with its
carrying value. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, a second step is performed to measure the potential goodwill impairment. Significant judgment is involved in estimating cash flows and fair value.
Management s estimates, which fall under Level 3 of the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy as defined by FASB ASC Topic 820-10-35, are based on historical and projected operating performance, recent market transactions and current industry trading
multiples. The fair value for the new reporting unit was determined based on a multiple of estimated cash flows, which was eight times, and exceeded its carrying value by more than 10%.  
 No events or changes in circumstances occurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 that indicated the carrying value of
goodwill might exceed its estimated fair value.    Intangible assets consisted of the following:  

(1)   
 Reflects addition of non-compete agreement and favorable lease associated with theatres acquired in the U.S. during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.    

(2)   
 Includes write-off of intangible assets for closed theatres and foreign currency translation adjustments.    
 Estimated aggregate future amortization expense for intangible assets is as follows:  
   
    9. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets   
 The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment indicators on a quarterly basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable.    The Company considers actual theatre level cash flows, budgeted theatre
level cash flows, theatre property and equipment carrying values, amortizing intangible asset carrying values, the age of a recently built theatre, competitive theatres in the marketplace, the impact of recent ticket price changes, available lease
renewal options and other factors considered relevant in its assessment of impairment of individual theatre assets. Long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment on an individual theatre basis, which the Company believes is the lowest applicable
level for which there are identifiable cash flows. The impairment evaluation is based on the estimated undiscounted cash flows from continuing use through the remainder of the theatre s useful life. The remainder of the theatre s useful
life correlates with the available remaining lease period, which includes the probability of renewal periods, for leased properties and the lesser of twenty years or the building s remaining useful life for fee-owned properties. If the
estimated undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover a long-lived asset s carrying value, the Company then compares the carrying value of the asset group (theatre) with its estimated fair value. When estimated fair value is
determined to be lower than the carrying value of the asset group (theatre), the asset group (theatre) is written down to its estimated

fair value. Significant judgment is involved in estimating cash flows and fair value. Management s estimates, which fall under Level 3 of the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy as defined by
FASB ASC Topic 820-10-35, are based on historical and projected operating performance, recent market transactions and current industry trading multiples. Fair value is determined based on a multiple of cash flows, which was six and a half times for
the evaluations performed during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. As of September 30, 2016, the estimated aggregate fair value of the long-lived assets impaired during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 was
approximately $294.    The long-lived asset impairment charges recorded during each of the periods presented are specific to theatres that
were directly and individually impacted by increased competition, adverse changes in market demographics or adverse changes in the development or the conditions of the areas surrounding the theatre.  
   
    10. Fair Value Measurements   
 The Company determines fair value measurements in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 820, which establishes a fair value hierarchy under which an
asset or liability is categorized based on the lowest level of input significant to its fair value measurement. The levels of input defined by FASB ASC Topic 820 are as follows:  
 Level 1   quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that are accessible at the measurement date;  
 Level 2   other than quoted market prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or
indirectly; and    Level 3   unobservable and should be used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not
available.    There were no assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis by the Company under FASB ASC Topic 820 as of
September 30, 2016.    Below is a summary of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis by the Company under
FASB ASC Topic 820 as of December 31, 2015:      
   Below is a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance for liabilities measured at fair value on a
recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3):

  The Company uses the market approach for fair value measurements on a nonrecurring basis in
the impairment evaluations of its long-lived assets (see Note 8 and Note 9). Additionally, the Company uses the market approach to estimate the fair value of its long-term debt (see Note 3). There were no changes in valuation techniques and there
were no transfers in or out of Level 1, Level 2 or Level 3 during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.     11. Foreign Currency Translation
    The accumulated other comprehensive loss account in stockholder s equity of $238,672 and $271,686 at September 30, 2016 and
December 31, 2015, respectively, includes cumulative foreign currency adjustments of $238,430 and $273,404, respectively, from translating the financial statements of the Company s international subsidiaries, and also includes the change
in fair values of the Company s interest rate swap agreements that are designated as hedges and the change in fair value of the Company s available-for-sale securities.  
 All foreign countries where the Company has operations are non-highly inflationary, and the local currency is the same as the functional
currency in all of the locations. Thus, any fluctuation in the currency results in a cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss.  
 Below is a summary of the impact of translating the September 30, 2016 financial statements of the Company s international
subsidiaries:

   13. Segments   
 The Company manages its international market and its U.S. market as separate reportable operating segments, with the international segment
consisting of operations in Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Guatemala, Bolivia, Curacao and Paraguay. Each segment s revenue is derived from admissions and concession
sales and other ancillary revenues. The Company uses Adjusted EBITDA, as shown in the reconciliation table below, as the primary measure of segment profit and loss to evaluate performance and allocate its resources. The Company does not report asset
information by segment because that information is not used to evaluate the performance of or allocate resources between segments.    Below
is a breakdown of selected financial information by reportable operating segment:

claims under California law for alleged meal period, rest break, reporting time pay, unpaid wages, pay upon termination, and wage statements violations. The claims are also asserted as a representative action under the California Private Attorney
General Act ( PAGA ). The Company denies the claims, denies that class certification is appropriate and denies that a PAGA representative action is appropriate, and is vigorously defending against the claims. The Company denies any
violation of law and plans to vigorously defend against all claims. The Court recently determined that class certification is not appropriate and determined that a PAGA representative action is not appropriate. The plaintiff has appealed these
rulings. The Company is unable to predict the outcome of the litigation or the range of potential loss.

 NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  
 In thousands, except share and per share data      
  The Company received a Civil Investigative Demand ( CID ) from the Antitrust
Division of the United States Department of Justice. The CID relates to an investigation under Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act. The Company also received CIDs from the Antitrust Section of the Office of the Attorney General of the State of Ohio
and later from other states regarding similar inquiries under state antitrust laws. The CIDs request the Company to answer interrogatories, and produce documents, or both, related to the investigation of matters including film clearances, potential
coordination and/or communication with other major theatre circuits and related joint ventures. The Company intends to fully cooperate with all federal and state government agencies. Although the Company does not believe that it has violated any
federal or state antitrust or competition laws, it cannot predict the ultimate scope, duration or outcome of these investigations.    From
time to time, the Company is involved in various other legal proceedings arising from the ordinary course of its business operations, such as personal injury claims, employment matters, landlord-tenant disputes, patent claims and contractual
disputes, some of which are covered by insurance. The Company believes its potential liability with respect to proceedings currently pending is not material, individually or in the aggregate, to the Company s financial position, results of
operations and cash flows.     16. Condensed Consolidating Financial Information of Subsidiary Guarantors

     Item 2. Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations     The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our condensed consolidated financial
statements and related notes and schedules included elsewhere in this report.    We are a leader in the motion picture exhibition industry,
with theatres in the U.S., Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Guatemala, Bolivia, Curacao and Paraguay. As of September 30, 2016, we managed our business under two reportable
operating segments   U.S. markets and international markets. See Note 14 to our condensed consolidated financial statements.    We
generate revenues primarily from filmed entertainment box office receipts and concession sales with additional revenues from screen advertising sales and other revenue streams, such as vendor marketing promotions, meeting rentals and electronic
video games located in some of our theatres. Our relationship with NCM has assisted us in expanding our offerings to domestic advertisers and broadening ancillary revenue sources. We also offer alternative entertainment, such as live and
pre-recorded sports programs, concert events, the Metropolitan Opera, in-theatre gaming and other special events in our theatres through our joint venture, AC JV, LLC. Our Flix Media initiative has also allowed us to expand our screen advertising
and alternative content within our international circuit and to other international exhibitors.    Films leading the box office during the
nine months ended September 30, 2016 included the carryover of  Star Wars: The Force Awakens  and  The Revenant;  and new releases such as  Deadpool, Batman V Superman: Dawn Of Justice ,  Zootopia ,  Suicide Squad, The
Jungle Book, Captain America: Civil War, Finding Dory, Jason Bourne, The Secret Life of Pets  and other films. Films scheduled for release during the remainder of 2016 include  Dr. Strange ,  Moana, Passengers ,  Sing,  and
spin-off films  Rogue One: A Star Wars Story  and  Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them , among other films.    Film rental
costs are variable in nature and fluctuate with our admissions revenues. Film rental costs as a percentage of revenues are generally higher for periods in which more blockbuster films are released. Advertising costs, which are expensed as incurred,
are primarily fixed at the theatre level.    Concession supplies expense is variable in nature and fluctuates with our concession revenues.
We purchase concession supplies to replace units sold. We negotiate prices for concession supplies directly with concession vendors and manufacturers to obtain volume rates.  
 Although salaries and wages include a fixed cost component (i.e. the minimum staffing costs to operate a theatre facility during non-peak
periods), salaries and wages move in relation to revenues as theatre staffing is adjusted to respond to changes in attendance. In some international locations, staffing levels are also subject to local regulations.  
 Facility lease expense is primarily a fixed cost at the theatre level as most of our facility leases require a fixed monthly minimum rent
payment. Certain of our leases are subject to percentage rent only while others are subject to percentage rent in addition to their fixed monthly rent if a target annual revenue level is achieved. Facility lease expense as a percentage of revenues
is also affected by the number of theatres under operating leases, the number of theatres under capital leases and the number of fee-owned theatres.  
 Utilities and other costs include both fixed and variable costs and primarily includes utilities, expenses for projection and sound equipment
maintenance and monitoring, property taxes, janitorial costs, repairs and maintenance and security services.

   Results of Operations   
 The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, certain operating data and the percentage of revenues represented by certain items
reflected in our condensed consolidated statements of income.      

(1)   
 We have reclassified approximately $8.9 million and $24.1 million of expenses from film rentals and advertising to utilities and other for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively, to be
consistent with the presentation for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016.    

(2)   
 All costs are expressed as a percentage of total revenues, except film rentals and advertising, which are expressed as a percentage of admissions revenues and concession supplies, which are expressed as a percentage of
concession revenues.

    Three months ended September 30, 2016 versus September 30, 2015    
  Revenues.  Total revenues increased $68.5 million to $768.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 ( third
quarter of 2016 ) from $700.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2015 ( third quarter of 2015 ), representing a 9.8% increase. The table below, presented by reportable operating segment, summarizes our revenue
performance and certain key performance indicators that impact our revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.      

(1)   
 Revenue and attendance amounts in millions. Average ticket price is calculated as admissions revenues divided by attendance. Concession revenues per patron is calculated as concession revenues divided by attendance.

(2)   
 U.S. operating segment revenues include eliminations of intercompany transactions with the international operating segment. See Note 13 of our condensed consolidated financial statements.    

(3)   
 Constant currency revenue amounts, which are non-GAAP measurements, were calculated using the average exchange rates for the corresponding months for 2015. We translate the results of our international operating segment
from local currencies into U.S. dollars using currency rates in effect at different points in time. Significant changes in foreign exchange rates from one period to the next can result in meaningful variations in reported results. We are
providing constant currency amounts for our international operating segment to present a period-to-period comparison of business performance without the impact of foreign currency fluctuations.    

U.S.   Admissions revenues increased $36.3 million due to a 9.6% increase in attendance and a 1.7% increase in average ticket price from $7.27 for the third quarter of 2015 to $7.39 for the third quarter of
2016. The increase in concession revenues of $29.0 million was attributable to the 9.6% increase in attendance and a 6.8% increase in concession revenues per patron from $3.85 for the third quarter of 2015 to $4.11 for the third quarter of 2016. The
increase in attendance was due to the solid slate of films during the third quarter of 2016 and new theatres. The increase in average ticket price was primarily due to price increases. The increase in concession revenues per patron was primarily due
to incremental sales incidence and price increases.        

International .  Admissions revenues increased $4.4 million as reported, and increased $19.1 million in constant currency. The constant currency increase is a result of a 12.7% increase in
constant currency average ticket price from $4.18 for the third quarter of 2015 to $4.71 for the third quarter of 2016 and a 3.7% increase in attendance. Concession revenues increased $2.2 million as reported, and increased $9.6 million in constant
currency. The constant currency increase is a result of an 11.5% increase in constant currency concession revenues per patron from $2.27 for the third quarter of 2015 to $2.53 for the third quarter of 2016 and the 3.7% increase in attendance. The
increase in attendance was primarily due to new theatres. Average ticket price and concession revenues per patron increased primarily driven by price increases, which was primarily due to local inflation.

   Cost of Operations.  The table below summarizes our theatre operating costs (in millions) by reportable
operating segment for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.      

(1)   
 We made certain reclassifications from film rentals and advertising to utilities and other for the three months ended September 30, 2015 related to the maintenance and monitoring of projection and sound equipment,
which results in a more clear presentation of film rental and advertising costs. Such expenses, which totaled $7.2 million and $1.7 million for the U.S. operating segment and the international operating segment, respectively, are now presented as
utilities and other for all periods presented.    

(2)   
 Constant currency expense amounts, which are non-GAAP measurements, were calculated using the average exchange rates for the corresponding months for 2015. We translate the results of our international operating segment
from local currencies into U.S. dollars using currency rates in effect at different points in time. Significant changes in foreign exchange rates from one period to the next can result in meaningful variations in reported results. We are providing
constant currency amounts for our international operating segment to present a period-to-period comparison of business performance without the impact of foreign currency fluctuations.    
   
   Salaries and wages increased to $63.2
million for the third quarter of 2016 from $57.1 million for the third quarter of 2015 primarily due to new theatres and increases in minimum wages. Facility lease expense increased to $60.5 million for the third quarter of 2016 from $59.8 million
for the third quarter of 2015 primarily due to new theatres. Utilities and other costs increased to $66.9 million for the third quarter of 2016 from $66.3 million for the third quarter of 2015 due to increased repairs and maintenance expenses and
security expense, partially offset by decreases in projection and sound equipment maintenance and monitoring expenses.      
 
 Salaries and wages were $21.2 million as reported, or $24.3 million in constant currency, for the third quarter of 2016 compared to $19.5
million for the third quarter of 2015. The increase was due to increased wage rates and new theatres, partially offset by the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in certain countries in which we operate. Facility lease expense was
$22.3 million as reported, or $24.1 million in constant currency, for the third quarter of 2016 compared to $20.8 million for the third quarter of 2015. The increase was primarily due to new theatres, partially offset by the impact of changes in
foreign currency exchange rates in certain countries in which we operate. Utilities and other costs were $28.1 million as reported, or $31.6 million in constant currency, for the third quarter of 2016 compared to $27.2 million for the third quarter
of 2015. The increase was primarily due to increased projection and sound equipment and monitoring expenses, partially offset by the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in certain countries in which we operate.  
  General and Administrative Expenses.  General and administrative expenses decreased to $34.7 million for the third quarter of 2016 from
$38.6 million for the third quarter of 2015. The decrease was primarily due to decreases in net credit card fees and the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in certain countries in which we operate, partially offset by increased
salaries and incentive compensation expense.  
      41  

Table of Contents  

   Depreciation and Amortization.  Depreciation and amortization expense was $54.2 million
during the third quarter of 2016 compared to $47.5 million during the third quarter of 2015. The increase was primarily due to new theatres and theatre remodels.  
  Impairment of Long-Lived Assets.  We recorded asset impairment charges on assets held and used of $0.4 million during the third quarter
of 2016 compared to $0.6 million during the third quarter of 2015. The long-lived asset impairment charges recorded during each of the periods presented were specific to theatres that were directly and individually impacted by increased competition,
adverse changes in market demographics or adverse changes in the development or the conditions of the areas surrounding the theatre. Impairment charges for the third quarter of 2016 impacted four of our twenty-seven reporting units. See Note 10 to
our condensed consolidated financial statements.     (Gain) Loss on Sale of Assets and Other.  We recorded a loss on sale of assets and
other of $7.0 million during the third quarter of 2016 compared to a gain of $0.5 million during the third quarter of 2015. The loss recorded during the third quarter of 2016 was primarily due to the retirement of assets due to theatre remodels
partially offset by a gain on the sale of a land parcel. The gain recorded during the third quarter of 2015 was primarily due to a gain on the sale of an investment in a Taiwan joint venture and a gain on the sale of a land parcel in the U.S.,
partially offset by costs resulting from the replacement of certain theatre assets.     Interest Expense.  Interest costs incurred,
including amortization of debt issue costs, were $26.7 million during the third quarter of 2016 compared to $28.4 million during the third quarter of 2015. The decrease was due to the redemption of our previously outstanding $200.0 million 7.375%
senior subordinated notes (the  7.375% Senior Subordinated Notes ) funded by a $225.0 million add-on to our 4.875% senior notes (the  4.875% Senior Notes), which occurred on March 21, 2016. See Note 3 to our condensed
consolidated financial statements for discussions of changes in long-term debt.     Foreign Currency Exchange Gain (Loss ). We recorded
a foreign currency exchange gain of approximately $0.5 million during the third quarter of 2016 compared to a foreign currency exchange loss of $11.9 million during the third quarter of 2015. These amounts primarily represent the impact of changes
in foreign currency exchange rates on intercompany transactions between our domestic subsidiaries and our international subsidiaries.  
  Distributions from NCM.  We recorded a distribution from NCM of $1.4 million during the third quarter of 2016 compared to a distribution
of $4.6 million during the third quarter of 2015, each of which was in excess of the carrying value of our Tranche 1 investment. See Note 5 to our condensed consolidated financial statements.  
  Equity in Income of Affiliates.  We recorded equity in income of affiliates of $12.4 million during the third quarter of 2016 compared
to $11.1 million during the third quarter of 2015. See Notes 5 and 6 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for information about our equity investments.  
  Income Taxes.  Income tax expense of $41.2 million was recorded for the third quarter of 2016 compared to $30.3 million recorded for the
third quarter of 2015. The effective tax rate was approximately 38.2% for the third quarter of 2016 compared to 39.2% for the third quarter of 2015. Income tax provisions for interim (quarterly) periods are based on estimated annual income tax rates
and are adjusted for the effects of significant, infrequent or unusual items (i.e. discrete items) occurring during the interim period. As a result, the interim rate may vary significantly from the normalized annual rate.

    Nine months ended September 30, 2016 versus September 30, 2015    
  Revenues.  Total revenues increased $72.5 million to $2,217.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 ( the 2016
period ) from $2,145.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 ( the 2015 period ), representing a 3.4% increase. The table below, presented by reportable operating segment, summarizes our revenue performance and
certain key performance indicators that impact our revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.      

(1)   
 Revenue and attendance amounts in millions. Average ticket price is calculated as admissions revenues divided by attendance. Concession revenues per patron is calculated as concession revenues divided by attendance.

(2)   
 U.S. operating segment revenues include eliminations of intercompany transactions with the international operating segment. See Note 13 of our condensed consolidated financial statements.    

(3)   
 Constant currency revenue amounts, which are non-GAAP measurements, were calculated using the average exchange rates for the corresponding months for 2015. We translate the results of our international operating segment
from local currencies into U.S. dollars using currency rates in effect at different points in time. Significant changes in foreign exchange rates from one period to the next can result in meaningful variations in reported results. We are providing
constant currency amounts for our international operating segment to present a period-to-period comparison of business performance without the impact of foreign currency fluctuations.    

U.S.   Admissions revenues increased $47.7 million due to a 2.8% increase in attendance and a 2.0% increase in average ticket price from $7.37 for the 2015 period to $7.52 for the 2016 period. The increase
in concession revenues of $52.2 million was attributable to a 6.9% increase in concession revenues per patron from $3.90 for the 2015 period to $ 4.17 for the 2016 period and the 2.8% increase in attendance. The increase in average ticket price was
primarily due to price increases. The increase in concession revenues per patron was primarily due to incremental sales incidence and price increases.        

International.   Admissions revenues decreased $18.7 million as reported, but increased $53.8 million in constant currency. The constant currency increase is a result of a 6.1% increase in attendance
and an 8.9% increase in constant currency average ticket price from $4.38 for the 2015 period to $4.77 for the 2016 period. Concession revenues decreased $3.6 million as reported, but increased $33.5 million in constant currency. The constant
currency increase is a result of the 6.1% increase in attendance and an 11.3% increase in constant currency concession revenues per patron from $2.30 for the 2015 period to $2.56 for the 2016 period. The increase in attendance was due to new
theatres and the success of the films released during the 2016 period. Average ticket price and concession revenues per patron increased primarily driven by price increases, which was primarily due to local inflation.

   Cost of Operations.  The table below summarizes our theatre operating costs (in millions) by reportable
operating segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.      

(1)   
 We made certain reclassifications from film rentals and advertising to utilities and other for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 related to the maintenance and monitoring of projection and sound equipment,
which results in a more clear presentation of film rental and advertising costs. Such expenses, which totaled $18.6 million and $5.5 million for the U.S. operating segment and the international operating segment, respectively, are now presented as
utilities and other for all periods presented.    

(2)   
 Constant currency expense amounts, which are non-GAAP measurements, were calculated using the average exchange rates for the corresponding months for 2015. We translate the results of our international operating segment
from local currencies into U.S. dollars using currency rates in effect at different points in time. Significant changes in foreign exchange rates from one period to the next can result in meaningful variations in reported results. We are providing
constant currency amounts for our international operating segment to present a period-to-period comparison of business performance without the impact of foreign currency fluctuations.    

U.S.   Film rentals and advertising costs were $578.2 million, or 55.7% of admissions revenues for the 2016 period compared to $548.9 million, or 55.4% of admissions revenues for the 2015 period. The
increase in the film rentals and advertising rate was primarily due to the higher concentration of blockbuster films during the 2016 period. Concession supplies expense was $79.9 million, or 13.9% of concession revenues, for the 2016 period compared
to $70.3 million, or 13.4% of concession revenues, for the 2015 period. The increase in the concession supplies rate was primarily due to the impact of our expanded concession offerings.    
 Salaries and wages increased to $183.1 million for the 2016 period from $165.4 million for the 2015 period primarily due to new theatres and
increases in minimum wages. Facility lease expense increased to $179.7 million for the 2016 period from $179.1 million for the 2015 period due to increased percentage rent expense partially offset by decreased common area maintenance expenses.
Utilities and other costs decreased to $188.0 million for the 2016 period from $189.2 million for the 2015 period due to a decrease in projection and sound equipment maintenance and monitoring expenses, partially offset by increased security
expense.      
   Salaries
and wages were $60.7 million as reported, or $75.2 million in constant currency, for the 2016 period compared to $56.9 million for the 2015 period. The increase was due to incremental staffing to support the 6.1 % increase in attendance,
increased wage rates, a payroll tax reserve recorded for an ongoing labor audit and new theatres, partially offset by the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in certain countries in which we operate. Facility lease expense was $62.2
million as reported, or $73.6 million in constant currency, for the 2016 period compared to $63.5 million for the 2015 period. The increase was due to increased percentage rent as a result of increased constant currency revenues and new theatres,
partially offset by the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in certain countries in which we operate. Utilities and other costs were $77.5 million as reported, or $95.1 million in constant currency, for the 2016 period compared to
$80.0 million for the 2015 period. The increase was primarily due to increased utilities costs, increased projection and sound equipment and monitoring expenses, increased repairs and maintenance expenses and increased janitorial services, partially
offset by the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in certain countries in which we operate.     General and
Administrative Expenses.  General and administrative expenses decreased to $107.0 million for the 2016 period from $114.3 million for the 2015 period. The decrease was primarily due to the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in
certain countries in which we operate, partially offset by increased salaries and incentive compensation expense.

   Depreciation and Amortization.  Depreciation and amortization expense was $155.9 million
for the 2016 period compared to $139.4 million for the 2015 period. The increase was primarily due to new theatres and theatre remodels.  
  Impairment of Long-Lived Assets.  We recorded asset impairment charges on assets held and used of $2.3 million for the 2016 period
compared to $5.0 million for the 2015 period. The long-lived asset impairment charges recorded during each of the periods presented were specific to theatres that were directly and individually impacted by increased competition, adverse changes in
market demographics or adverse changes in the development or the conditions of the areas surrounding the theatre. Impairment charges for the 2016 period impacted six of our twenty-seven reporting units. See Note 10 to our condensed consolidated
financial statements.     Loss on Sale of Assets and Other.  We recorded a loss on sale of assets and other of $11.0 million during the
2016 period compared to $3.9 million during the 2015 period. The loss recorded during the 2016 period was primarily due to the retirement of assets due to theatre remodels and closures, partially offset by a gain on the sale of our investment in
RealD stock (see Note 6) and a gain on the sale of a land parcel. The loss recorded during the 2015 period included lease termination costs, contract termination costs and the retirement of assets due to theatre remodels and closures, partially
offset by gains related to lease amendments that resulted in a reduction of certain capital lease liabilities, the sale of an investment in a Taiwan joint venture, and the sale of a land parcel in the U.S.  
  Interest Expense.  Interest costs incurred, including amortization of debt issue costs, were $82.0 million for the 2016 period compared
to $84.9 million for the 2015 period. The decrease was due to the redemption of our previously outstanding $200.0 million 7.375% senior subordinated notes (the  7.375% Senior Subordinated Notes ) funded by a $225.0 million add-on to our
4.875% senior notes (the  4.875% Senior Notes), which occurred on March 21, 2016. See Note 3 to our condensed consolidated financial statements.  
  Loss On Debt Amendments and Refinancing . We recorded a loss of $13.3 million during the 2016 period primarily related to the early
redemption of our $200.0 million 7.375% Senior Subordinated Notes (see Note 4 to our condensed consolidated financial statements). We recorded a loss of $0.9 million during the 2015 period related to the amendment of our senior secured credit
facility to extend the maturity of the $700.0 million term loan from December 2019 to May 2022.     Foreign Currency Exchange Gain
(Loss ). We recorded a foreign currency exchange gain of approximately $2.9 million during the 2016 period compared to a foreign currency exchange loss of $18.7 million during the 2015 period. These amounts primarily represent the impact of
changes in foreign currency exchange rates on intercompany transactions between our domestic subsidiaries and our international subsidiaries.  
  Distributions from NCM.  We recorded distributions from NCM of $10.1 million during the 2016 period and $13.1 million during the 2015
period, each of which were in excess of the carrying value of our Tranche 1 investment. See Note 5 to our condensed consolidated financial statements.  
  Equity in Income of Affiliates.  We recorded equity in income of affiliates of $24.6 million during the 2016 period compared to $20.4
million during the 2015 period. See notes 5 and 6 for information about the equity investments to our condensed consolidated financial statements.  
  Income Taxes.  Income tax expense of $106.8 million was recorded for the 2016 period compared to $100.0 million recorded for the 2015
period. The effective tax rate was 37.1% for the 2016 period compared to 38.2% for the 2015 period. Income tax provisions for interim (quarterly) periods are based on estimated annual income tax rates and are adjusted for the effects of significant,
infrequent or unusual items (i.e. discrete items) occurring during the interim period. As a result, the interim rate may vary significantly from the normalized annual rate.  
  Liquidity and Capital Resources   
  Operating Activities     We
primarily collect our revenues in cash, mainly through box office receipts and the sale of concessions. Nearly all of our theatres also provide the patron a choice of using a credit card, debit card or advanced-sale type certificates such as a gift
card. Because our revenues are received in cash prior to the payment of related expenses, we have an operating  float  and historically have not required traditional working capital financing. Cash provided by operating activities was
$277.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $225.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.

   Investing Activities   
 Our investing activities have been principally related to the development, remodel and acquisition of theatres. New theatre openings and
acquisitions historically have been financed with internally generated cash and by debt financing, including borrowings under our senior secured credit facility. Cash used for investing activities was $230.5 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 compared to $231.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.   Capital expenditures for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 were as follows (in millions):      

(a)   
 Includes approximately $26.3 million for the purchase of our corporate headquarters building in Plano, TX.    
 Capital expenditures for existing theatres in the table above includes the costs of remodeling certain of our existing properties to include
Luxury Loungers and expanded concession offerings. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, we had an average of 75 and 28 of our domestic screens, respectively, temporarily closed for such remodels.  
 Our U.S. theatre circuit consisted of 339 theatres and 4,542 screens at September 30, 2016. During the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, we built three new theatres with 33 screens, acquired four theatres with 52 screens and closed five theatres and 61 screens. At September 30, 2016, we had signed commitments to open three new theatres with 36 screens in
domestic markets during the remainder of 2016 and open ten new theatres with 106 screens subsequent to 2016. We estimate the remaining capital expenditures for the development of these 142 domestic screens will be approximately $87 million.  
 Our international theatre circuit consisted of 183 theatres and 1,323 screens at September 30, 2016. During the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, we built eight new theatres with 54 screens and closed one theatre with nine screens. At September 30, 2016, we had signed commitments to open four new theatres with 24 screens in international markets during the
remainder of 2016 and open six new theatres and 41 screens subsequent to 2016. We estimate the remaining capital expenditures for the development of these 65 international screens will be approximately $31 million.  
 Actual expenditures for continued theatre development, remodels and acquisitions are subject to change based upon the availability of
attractive opportunities. We plan to fund capital expenditures for our continued development with cash flow from operations, borrowings under our senior secured credit facility, and proceeds from debt issuances, sale leaseback transactions and/or
sales of excess real estate.     Financing Activities   
 Cash used for financing activities was $110.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to $113.5 million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2015. Financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 included the redemption of Cinemark USA, Inc. s $200.0 million 7.375% Senior Subordinated Notes with proceeds from the issuance of a
$225.0 million add-on to Cinemark USA, Inc. s existing 4.875% Senior Notes. See Note 3 to our condensed consolidated financial statements.

  We may from time to time, subject to compliance with our debt instruments, purchase our debt
securities on the open market depending upon the availability and prices of such securities. Long-term debt consisted of the following as of September 30, 2016 (in millions):  
   
   As of September 30, 2016, Cinemark USA, Inc. had $100.0 million in available borrowing capacity on
our revolving credit line.     Contractual Obligations   
 Due to the redemption of the 7.375% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2021 and issuance of the additional $225.0 million 4.875% Senior Notes as
well as a prepayment to our term loan (see Note 3 to the condensed consolidated financial statements), which impacted the maturity of and the amount of outstanding long-term debt and related interest rates, we have included below our long-term debt
and estimated scheduled interest payments as of September 30, 2016.      

(1)   
 Amounts are presented before adjusting for debt discounts and debt issuance costs.    

(2)   
 Amounts include scheduled interest payments on fixed rate and variable rate debt agreements. Estimates for the variable rate interest payments were based on interest rates currently in effect. The average interest rates
currently in effect on our fixed rate and variable rate debt are 5.0% and 3.3%, respectively.      Other than the changes in our
long term debt obligations discussed above, there have been no material changes in our contractual obligations previously disclosed in  Liquidity and Capital Resources  in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2015 filed March 4, 2016.     Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements   
 Other than the operating leases and purchase commitments disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015
filed March 4, 2016, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.     Senior Secured Credit Facility   
 Cinemark USA, Inc. has a senior secured credit facility that includes a $700.0 million term loan, with a maturity date of May 2022, and a
$100.0 million revolving credit line, with a maturity date of December 2017.    On May 16, 2016, Cinemark USA, Inc. made a principal
pre-payment of $13.5 million using the proceeds received from the sale of shares of RealD (see Note 6 to the condensed consolidated financial statements). In accordance with the terms of the senior secured credit facility agreement (the  Credit
Agreement ), the pre-payment was applied first to the next four principal installments, and second, to the remaining installments pro-rata based on the remaining outstanding principal amount of such installments. Therefore, quarterly payments
in the amount of $1.4 million are due on the term loan beginning June 30, 2017 through March 31, 2022, with the remaining principal of $635.3 million due on May 8, 2022. The Company did not incur any fees as a result of the
pre-payment.  
      47  

Table of Contents  

  On June 13, 2016, Cinemark USA, Inc. amended its senior secured credit facility, to reduce
the rate at which the term loan bears interest by 0.25%. The Company incurred debt issue costs of approximately $0.8 million in connection with the amendment, which are reflected as a reduction of long term debt on the condensed consolidated balance
sheet as of September 30, 2016. In addition, the Company incurred approximately $0.3 million in legal and other fees that are reflected as loss on debt amendments and refinancing on the condensed consolidated statements of income for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016.    Interest on the term loan accrues at Cinemark USA, Inc. s option at: (A) the base rate
equal to the greater of (1) the US  Prime Rate  as quoted in The Wall Street Journal or if no such rate is quoted therein, in a Federal Reserve Board statistical release, (2) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50%, and
(3) a one-month Eurodollar-based rate plus 1.0%, plus, in each case, a margin of 1.75% per annum, or (B) a Eurodollar-based rate for a period of 1, 2, 3, 6, 9 or 12 months plus a margin of 2.75% per annum. Interest on the
revolving credit line accrues, at our option, at: (A) a base rate equal to the greater of (1) the US  Prime Rate  as quoted in The Wall Street Journal or if no such rate is quoted therein, in a Federal Reserve Board statistical
release, (2) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50%, and (3) a one-month Eurodollar-based rate plus 1.0%, plus, in each case, a margin that ranges from 1.00% to 1.75% per annum, or (B) a Eurodollar-based rate for a period of
1, 2, 3, 6, 9 or 12 months plus a margin that ranges from 2.00% to 2.75% per annum. The margin of the revolving credit line is determined by the consolidated net senior secured leverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement.  
 The Credit Agreement contains usual and customary negative covenants for agreements of this type, including, but not limited to, restrictions
on Cinemark USA, Inc. s ability, and in certain instances, its subsidiaries  and our ability, to consolidate or merge or liquidate, wind up or dissolve; substantially change the nature of its business; sell, transfer or dispose of assets;
create or incur indebtedness; create liens; pay dividends or repurchase stock; and make capital expenditures and investments. If Cinemark USA, Inc. has borrowings outstanding on the revolving credit line, it is required to satisfy a consolidated net
senior secured leverage ratio covenant as determined in accordance with the Credit Agreement.    The dividend restriction contained in the
Credit Agreement prevents the Company and any of its subsidiaries from paying a dividend or otherwise distributing cash to its stockholders unless (1) the Company is not in default, and the distribution would not cause Cinemark USA, Inc. to be
in default, under the Credit Agreement; and (2) the aggregate amount of certain dividends, distributions, investments, redemptions and capital expenditures made since December 18, 2012, including dividends declared by the board of
directors, is less than the sum of (a) the aggregate amount of cash and cash equivalents received by Cinemark Holdings, Inc. or Cinemark USA, Inc. as common equity since December 18, 2012, (b) Cinemark USA, Inc. s consolidated
EBITDA minus 1.75 times its consolidated interest expense, each as defined in the Credit Agreement, and (c) certain other defined amounts. As of September 30, 2016, Cinemark USA, Inc. could have distributed up to approximately $2,161.9
million to its parent company and sole stockholder, Cinemark Holdings, Inc., under the terms of the Credit Agreement, subject to its available cash and other borrowing restrictions outlined in the agreement.  
 At September 30, 2016, there was $663.8 million outstanding under the term loan and no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit
line. Cinemark USA, Inc. had $100.0 million in available borrowing capacity on the revolving credit line. The average interest rate on outstanding term loan borrowings under the Credit Agreement at September 30, 2016 was approximately
3.3% per annum.     Cinemark USA, Inc. 5.125% Senior Notes   
 On December 18, 2012, Cinemark USA, Inc. issued $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.125% senior notes due 2022, at par value
(the  5.125% Senior Notes ). Interest on the 5.125% Senior Notes is payable on June 15 and December 15 of each year. The 5.125% Senior Notes mature on December 15, 2022.  
 The indenture to the 5.125% Senior Notes contains covenants including limitations on the amount of dividends that could be paid by Cinemark
USA, Inc. As of September 30, 2016, Cinemark USA, Inc. could have distributed up to approximately $2,186.1 million to its parent company and sole stockholder, Cinemark Holdings, Inc., under the terms of the indenture to the 5.125% Senior Notes,
subject to its available cash and other borrowing restrictions outlined in the indenture. The indenture allows Cinemark USA, Inc. to incur additional indebtedness if it satisfies the coverage ratio specified in the indenture, after giving effect to
the incurrence of the additional indebtedness, and in certain other circumstances. The required minimum coverage ratio is 2 to 1 and our actual ratio as of September 30, 2016 was approximately 8.4 to 1.

   Cinemark USA, Inc. 4.875% Senior Notes   
 On May 24, 2013, Cinemark USA, Inc. issued $530.0 million aggregate principal amount of 4.875% Senior Notes due 2023, at par value. On
March 21, 2016, Cinemark USA, Inc. issued an additional $225.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 4.875% Senior Notes at 99.0% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest from December 1, 2015. Proceeds, after payment
of fees, were used to finance the redemption of Cinemark, USA, Inc. s $200.0 million 7.375% Senior Subordinated Notes, as discussed below. These additional notes have identical terms, other than the issue date, the issue price and the first
interest payment date, and constitute part of the same series as the Company s existing 4.875% Senior Notes. Interest on the 4.875% Senior Notes is payable on June 1 and December 1 of each year. The 4.875% Senior Notes mature on
June 1, 2023.    The indenture to the 4.875% Senior Notes contains covenants that include limitations on the amount of dividends that
Cinemark USA, Inc. can pay. As of September 30, 2016, Cinemark USA, Inc. could have distributed up to approximately $2,182.2 million to its parent company and sole stockholder, Cinemark Holdings, Inc., under the terms of the indenture to the
4.875% Senior Notes, subject to its available cash and other borrowing restrictions outlined in the indenture. The indenture allows Cinemark USA, Inc. to incur additional indebtedness if it satisfies the coverage ratio specified in the indenture,
after giving effect to the incurrence of the additional indebtedness, and in certain other circumstances. The required minimum coverage ratio is 2 to 1 and our actual ratio as of September 30, 2016 was approximately 8.6 to 1.  
 On April 5, 2016, Cinemark USA, Inc. and its guarantor subsidiaries filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (the  Commission ), pursuant to which Cinemark USA, Inc. offered to exchange the additional 4.875% Senior Notes for substantially identical notes registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, that do not contain terms
restricting the transfer thereof or providing for registration rights. The registration statement was declared effective April 18, 2016, and the notes were exchanged on May 17, 2016.  
  Cinemark USA, Inc. 7.375% Senior Subordinated Notes   
 On June 3, 2011, Cinemark USA, Inc. issued $200.0 million aggregate principal amount of 7.375% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2021, at par
value. Interest on the 7.375% Senior Subordinated Notes is payable on June 15 and December 15 of each year. The 7.375% Senior Subordinated Notes were scheduled to mature on June 15, 2021.  
 On March 21, 2016, Cinemark USA, Inc. redeemed the 7.375% Senior Subordinated Notes at a make-whole premium of approximately 104% plus
accrued and unpaid interest, utilizing the proceeds from the issuance of the additional $225.0 million 4.875% Senior Notes discussed above. As a result of the redemption, the Company wrote-off approximately $2.4 million in unamortized debt issue
costs, paid the make-whole premium of approximately $9.4 million and paid other fees of $1.2 million, all of which are reflected in loss on debt amendments and refinancing during the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  
  Covenant Compliance     As
of September 30, 2016, we believe we were in full compliance with all agreements, including all related covenants, governing our outstanding debt.  
  Seasonality     Our revenues
have historically been seasonal, coinciding with the timing of releases of motion pictures by the major distributors. Generally, the most successful motion pictures have been released during the summer, extending from May to July, and during the
holiday season, extending from early November through year-end. The unexpected emergence of a hit film during other periods can alter this seasonality trend. The timing of such film releases can have a significant effect on our results of
operations, and the results of one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for the next quarter or for the same period in the following year.

     Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk   
 We have exposure to financial market risks, including changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and other relevant market
prices.     Interest Rate Risk     We are
currently party to a variable rate debt facility. An increase or decrease in interest rates would affect our interest expense relating to our variable rate debt. At September 30, 2016, we had an aggregate of approximately $663.8 million of
variable rate debt outstanding. Based on the interest rates in effect on the variable rate debt outstanding at September 30, 2016, a 100 basis point increase in market interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by approximately
$6.6 million.    The table below provides information about our fixed rate and variable rate long-term debt agreements as of
September 30, 2016:      
    Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk

4, 2016.       Item 4. Controls and Procedures   
  Evaluation of the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures   
 As of September 30, 2016, we carried out an evaluation required by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the  Exchange
Act ), under the supervision and with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e)
of the Exchange Act. Based on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that
information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms and were effective to
provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.
    Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting   
 There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph
(d) of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 that occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

  Reclassification of Certain Expenses   
 As a result of certain financial statement reclassifications the Company made effective January 1, 2016 that are discussed in Note 1 to
the condensed consolidated financial statements, the Company has presented below the impact of such reclassifications on the financial information for the year ended December 31, 2015.  

(1)   
 Amounts unaudited.       Calculation of Adjusted EBITDA   
 The Company includes Adjusted EBITDA in its segment disclosure, which is included in Note 13 to the condensed consolidated financial
statements. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure commonly used in the Company s industry. The Company includes Adjusted EBITDA in its financial statement disclosures because the Company uses Adjusted EBITDA as the primary measure of
segment profit and loss to evaluate performance and allocate its resources, and believes it provides management and investors with additional information to measure the Company s performance and liquidity, estimate the Company s value and
evaluate its ability to service debt. In addition, the Company uses Adjusted EBITDA for incentive compensation purposes.   The Company
receives cash distributions from certain of its equity investees that, under equity method accounting, are applied against the investment basis of such equity investees. The Company has determined that including these cash distributions in its
calculation of Adjusted EBITDA provides investors with meaningful information regarding the Company s performance and liquidity and does so in a manner comparable with industry peers. As noted in Note 13 to the condensed consolidated financial
statements, the Company began including such cash distributions received from equity investees that were recorded as a reduction of the respective investment balances as part of its Adjusted EBITDA calculation. The change was made effective
beginning with the three months ended March 31, 2016, with prior periods being recast to reflect the same presentation. The table below presents Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2015 on this recast basis.
