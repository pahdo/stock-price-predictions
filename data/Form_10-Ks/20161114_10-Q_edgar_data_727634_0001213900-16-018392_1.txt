Nature
of Business   

On
January 21, 2016, iSign Solutions Inc. (the  Company  or  iSign ) filed a Certificate of Amendment to its
Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the  Certificate of Amendment ) with the Secretary of State of
the State of Delaware to effect a 1-for-1,250 reverse split of the Company s outstanding shares of common stock. The reverse
split became effective on January 22, 2016. The information with respect to common stock for the period ended September 30, 2015
has been retroactively restated to give effect to the 1-for-1,250 reverse split.

Basis
of Presentation   

The
financial information contained herein should be read in conjunction with the Company's consolidated audited financial statements
and notes thereto included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.  

The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared pursuant to the rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required
by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP ) for complete consolidated financial
statements. In the opinion of management, the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements included in this quarterly
report reflect all adjustments (consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) that the Company considers necessary for a fair
presentation of its financial position at the dates presented and the Company s results of operations and cash flows for
the periods presented. The Company s interim results are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the
entire year.  

Going
Concern   

The
accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue
as a going concern. The Company has incurred significant cumulative losses since its inception and, at September 30, 2016, the
Company s accumulated deficit was $129,843. The Company has primarily met its working capital needs through the sale of
debt and equity securities. As of September 30, 2016, the Company s cash balance was $140. These factors raise substantial
doubt about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern.  

There
can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in securing adequate capital resources to fund planned operations or
that any additional funds will be available to the Company when needed, or if available, will be available on favorable terms
or in amounts required by the Company. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital resources to fund operations, it
may be required to delay, scale back or eliminate some or all of its operations, which may have a material adverse effect on
the Company's business,  results
of operations and ability to operate as a going concern. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements do not include
any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

Accounting
Changes and Recent Accounting Pronouncements   

In
January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01,  Financial Instruments   Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement
of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities . ASU 2016-01 requires all financial assets and liabilities not accounted for
under the equity method to be measured at fair value with the changes in fair value recognized in net income. The amendments in
this update also require an entity to separately present in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in the
fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk when the entity has elected to measure
the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments. In addition, the amendments in
this update supersede the requirement to disclose the methods and significant assumptions used in calculating the fair value that
is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet for public business entities.
Early adoption is not permitted except for the comprehensive income presentation requirement, and the updated guidance requires
a prospective application with a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption.
The guidance is effective for annual periods after December 15, 2017.  

In
February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued an Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016, Leases (Topic
842) intended to improve financial reporting about leasing transactions which requires companies to report capital and operating
leases with a term of 12 Months or longer on their balance sheets. Disclosure requirements of the leasing arrangement will include
qualitative and quantitative information about the amounts recorded in the financial statements. The guidance is effective for
annual periods after December 15, 2018.  

In
March 2016 the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09 Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based
Payment Accounting. ASU 2016-09 provides for simplification involving several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment
transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and classification
on the statement of cash flows. In addition to these simplifications, ASU 2016-09 also eliminates the guidance in Topic 718 that
was indefinitely deferred shortly after the issuance of FASB Statement No. 123 (revised 2004), Share-Based Payment. Early
adoption is permitted and the application of the guidance is different for each update included within ASU 2016-09. The guidance
is effective for annual periods after December 15, 2016.  

In
May 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2016-12 Revenue from
Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients. ASU 2016-12 provides for improvements
and practical expedients for specific areas of Topic 606. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10 Revenue from Contracts
with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing. ASU 2016-10 provides for clarification of two aspects
of Topic 606: identifying performance obligations and the licensing implementation guidance. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU
No. 2016-08 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) - Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross
versus Net). ASU No. 2016 - 08 requires an entity to determine whether the nature of its promise to provide goods or services
to a customer is performed in a principal or agent capacity and to recognize revenue in a gross or net manner based on its principal/agent
designation.

ASUs
2016-12, 2016-10 and 2016-08 allow for companies to choose to apply the standard retrospectively to each prior reporting period
presented (full retrospective application) or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the standard as
an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings of the annual reporting period that includes the date of initial application
(modified retrospective application). Each guidance is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017,
including interim periods within that reporting period. Early application is permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning
after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within that reporting period.

3.     Intangible
                                         Assets     

The
Company performs an intangible asset impairment analysis at least annually or whenever circumstances or events indicate such assets
might be impaired. The Company would recognize an impairment charge in the event the net book value of such assets exceeded the
future undiscounted cash flows attributable to such assets.  

Management
completed an analysis of the Company s intangible assets as of December 31, 2015. Based on that analysis, the Company concluded
that no impairment of the carrying value of the intangible assets existed. The Company believes that no events or circumstances
changed during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 that would impact this conclusion.  

Amortization
of intangible asset costs was $81 and $242 for the three and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and $87 and $260 for
the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2015.

                                         loss per share     

The
Company calculates basic net loss per share based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding, and when applicable, diluted
net income per share, which is based on the weighted average number of shares and potential dilutive shares outstanding.  

The
Company s Preferred Shareholders converted all of their Preferred Stock into shares of Common Stock on May 19, 2016. The
following table lists shares and warrants that were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share as the exercise
of such options and warrants and the conversion of such preferred shares would be anti-dilutive:  

Note
payable    

In
the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company entered into unsecured convertible promissory note purchase agreements with investors
and affiliates of the Company aggregating $1,268 in cash. Promissory notes with a principal amount of $1,068 plus accrued interest
converted into shares of our Common Stock on May 19, 2016.   

The
notes and accrued interest converted at a price of $1.74 per share into 683 shares of our Common Stock. The holders of the notes
also received 854 warrants to purchase 854 shares of Common Stock. Such warrants have a 5-year term and are exercisable at a price
of $2.175 per share. The Company ascribed a relative fair value to the warrants using the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model
of $586, which was charged to additional paid-in capital during the quarter ended June 30, 2016.  

In
August 2016, the Company issued long-term unsecured convertible promissory notes to investors and affiliates of the Company aggregating
$240 in cash. The notes are mandatorily convertible to common stock at a conversion rate of $0.91 per share upon closing a new
debt and or equity financing of at least $500 in aggregate proceeds. The notes bear interest at the rate of 1% per annum and are
due December 31, 2017. The holders shall also receive, on a pro rata basis, cash payments payable from 3% of the revenue actually
received by the Company from its European customer, not to exceed one and one-half (1.5) times the aggregate principal amount
of the notes. Such cash payments only occur if the notes are converted into Common Stock. The convertible notes contained an embedded
beneficial conversion feature having an intrinsic value of $103 at the issuance date, for which the Company recorded a discount
to the long-term notes payable and a corresponding additional paid-in capital attributable to the beneficial conversion feature.
The discount will be amortized using the effective interest method over the term of the notes. The Company recorded $7 in debt
discount amortization expense associated with these notes for the three and nine month period ended September 30, 2016. The proceeds
from the notes were used to pay off the $200 promissory note outstanding plus accrued interest that was due on August 24, 2016.

In
September 2016, the Company issued demand promissory notes to affiliates of the Company aggregating $100 in cash. The notes bear
interest at the rate of 1% per annum and are due on demand. In addition, the affiliate will be a paid a financing fee of 10% of
the face value of the demand notes upon such repayment of the demand notes or their exchange into the next financing. In the event
the demand notes are not
repaid or exchanged by December 31, 2016, the demand notes will automatically be exchanged into unsecured convertible promissory
notes, substantially with the same terms described in the previous paragraph.

6.     Derivative
                                         Liability     

The
Company has determined that a contract that would otherwise meet the definition of a derivative but is both (a) indexed to the
Company s own stock and (b) classified in stockholders  deficit in the statement of financial position would not be
considered a derivative financial instrument. The Company applies a two-step model in determining whether a financial instrument
or an embedded feature is indexed to an issuer s own stock and thus able to qualify for the scope exception.  

In
November and December 2015, the Company entered into unsecured convertible promissory note purchase agreements with investors
and affiliates of the Company. The accounting for the unsecured convertible notes, which are convertible into shares of our common
stock, requires us to bifurcate the conversion feature and account for it as a derivative liability at the estimated fair value
upon issuance.  

The
fair value framework requires a categorization of assets and liabilities into three levels based upon the assumptions (inputs)
used to price the assets and liabilities. Level 1 provides the most reliable measure of fair value, whereas Level 3 generally
requires significant management judgment. The three levels are defined as follows:  

Level
1: Applies to assets or liabilities for which there are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.  

Level
2: Applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability
such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in

the above mentioned derivative liability (level 3) as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  

The
previously outstanding short-term note payable balance of $200 in aggregate principal was fully paid off on August 24, 2016 and

Stock-based
compensation expense is based on the estimated grant date fair value of the portion of stock-based payment awards that are ultimately
expected to vest during the period. The grant date fair value of stock-based awards to employees and directors is calculated using
the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model.  

Forfeitures
of stock-based payment awards are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures
differ from those estimates. The estimated average forfeiture rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, was
approximately 12.34% and 7.89%, respectively, based on historical data.  

Valuation
and Expense Information:    

The
weighted-average fair value of stock-based compensation is based on the Black-Scholes-Merton valuation model. Forfeitures are
estimated and it is assumed no dividends will be declared. The estimated fair value of stock-based compensation awards to employees
is amortized using the accrual method over the vesting period of the options. The fair value calculations are based on the following
assumptions:  

There
were no stock options granted during the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016. There were no stock options exercised
during the three- and nine-months ended September 30, 2016.  

There
were no stock options granted during the three month period ended September 30, 2015. The Company granted 29 stock options during
the nine months ended September 30, 2015 at a weighted average exercise price of $28.13 per share. There were no stock options
exercised during the three- and nine-months ended September 30, 2015.

                                         events     

On
November 3, 2016, the Company issued $900 in senior convertible promissory notes. The notes bear interest at the rate of
6% per annum and mature on December 31, 2018. The notes are convertible into common stock of the Company at any time at
a conversion rate of $1.30, or, in connection with a financing of at least $1 million, at the price of such financing, if
such price is lower than $1.30. Investors received warrants to purchase 276 shares of common stock in the aggregate. The
warrants are exercisable for a period of three years from the date of closing at an exercise price of $1.625 per share.
Shares underlying the notes do not have registration rights. The funds from the financing will be used for working capital
and general corporate purposes.  

On
October 17, 2016, the Company issued demand promissory notes to affiliates of the Company aggregating $100 in cash. The notes
bear interest at the rate of 1% per annum and are due on demand. In addition, the affiliate will be a paid a financing fee of
10% of the face value of the demand notes upon such repayment of the demand notes or their exchange into the next financing. In
the event the demand notes are not repaid or exchanged by December 31, 2016, the demand notes will automatically be exchanged
into unsecured convertible promissory notes. The unsecured convertible promissory notes are mandatorily convertible to common
stock at a conversion rate of $0.91 per share upon closing a new debt and or equity financing of at least $500 in aggregate proceeds.
The notes bear interest at the rate of 1% per annum and are due December 31, 2017. The holders shall also receive, on a pro rata
basis, cash payments payable from 3% of the revenue actually received by the Company from its European customer, not to exceed
one and one-half (1.5) times the aggregate principal amount of the notes. Such cash payments only occur if the notes are converted
into Common Stock.  

On
October 21, 2016, the Company entered into a Lease Agreement for approximately 2,972 square feet of office space in San Jose,
California. The initial term of the lease is 36 months commencing on November 1, 2016 with an option term of five years. The base
rent will increase by approximately 3% per annum over the term of the new lease, which expires on October 31, 2019. In addition
to the monthly rent, the Company is responsible for a portion of the land lords annual operating expenses based on a percentage
the Company s rentable square footage to the total square footage of the building.

statements and notes thereto included in Part 1, Item 1 of this quarterly report on Form 10-Q and  Management s Discussion
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  set forth in the Company s Annual report on Form 10-K
for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015.  

Overview

The
Company was incorporated in Delaware in October 1986. Except for the year ended December 31, 2004, in each year since its inception
the Company has incurred losses. For the two-year period ended December 31, 2015, net losses attributable to common stockholders
aggregated approximately $14,998, and, at September 30, 2016, the Company's accumulated deficit was approximately $129,843.  

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016, total revenue was $221, a decrease of $130, or 37%, compared to total revenue of $351
in the prior year period. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, total revenue was $853, a decrease of $311, or 27%, compared
to total revenue of $1,164 in the prior year period. The decrease in revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2016 is
due to lower product and maintenance revenue. The decrease in revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is due primarily
to a decrease in engineering services revenue.  

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016, the loss from operations was $570, a decrease of $280, or 33%, compared with a loss
from operations of $850 in the prior year period. The decrease in the loss for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was due
primarily to cost reductions put in place beginning in the first quarter of 2016. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
the loss from operations was $2,565, a decrease of $332, or 11%, compared with a loss from operations of $2,897 in the prior year
period. The decrease in the loss from operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 is primarily attributable to cost
reductions put in place beginning in the first quarter of 2016.

to Item 7,  Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  in the Company s
2015 Form 10-K.  

Effect
of Recent Accounting Pronouncement    

On
February 25, 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued an Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-02, Leases
(Topic 842) intended to improve financial reporting about leasing transactions which requires companies to report capital and
operating leases with a term of 12 Months or longer on their balance sheets. Disclosure requirements of the leasing arrangement
will include qualitative and quantitative information about the amounts recorded in the financial statements.  

Implementation
of ASU 2016-02 did not have a material impact on the Company s financial position, results of operations and cash flows
as of September 30, 2016.  

Results
of Operations    

Revenue    

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016, product revenue was $50, a decrease of $77, or 61%, compared to product revenue of
$127 in the prior year period. The decrease in product revenue is primarily due to a decrease in engineering services revenue.
For the three months ended September 30, 2016, maintenance revenue was $171, a decrease of $53, or 24%, compared to maintenance
revenue of $224 in the prior year period. This decrease is primarily due to the non-renewal of two maintenance contracts entered
into in prior years.  

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, product revenue was $273, a decrease of $237, or 46%, compared to product revenue of
$510 in the prior year period. The decrease in product revenue is primarily attributable to reduction in engineering service revenue
and the timing of the revenue recognition for certain recurring revenue contracts. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
maintenance revenue was $580, a decrease of $74, or 11%, compared to maintenance revenue of $654 in the prior year period. The
decrease in maintenance revenue is primarily due to the factors discussed for the three-month period above.  

Cost
of Sales     

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016, cost of sales was $89, an increase of $20, or 29%, compared to cost of sales of $69
in the prior year period. The increase in cost of sales was due to an increase in direct labor related to maintenance revenue
generating contracts during the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to the prior year period.  

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, cost of sales was $360, an increase of $73, or 25%, compared to cost of sales of $287
in the prior year period. The increase in cost of sales was due to an increase in direct labor related to transactional and maintenance
revenue generating contracts, compared to the prior year period.

Research
and Development Expenses   

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016, research and development expense was $282, a decrease of $164, or 37%, compared to
research and development expense of $446 in the prior year period. Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries
and related costs, outside engineering, maintenance items, and allocated facilities expenses. The most significant factors in
the $164 decrease was a $72, or 21%, decrease in total salaries and benefits due to the reduction of one engineer in the third
quarter of the prior year together with a $120, or 117%, decrease in professional service expenses associated with product development.
Total expenses, before allocations for the three months ended September 30, 2016, were $381, a decrease of $174, or 31%, compared
to $555 in the prior year period. The decrease in gross expenses is primarily due to the factors discussed above.  

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, research and development expense was $968, a decrease of $499, or 34%, compared to research
and development expense of $1,467 in the prior year period. The most significant factors in the $499 decrease was a $179, or 17%,
decrease in total salaries and benefits due to the reduction of one engineer in the third quarter of the prior year and reduction
in the time commitment of a second engineer. In addition, there was a $221, or 74%, decrease in professional service expenses
associated with product development. These expense reductions were augmented by an increase of $57, or 17%, in allocations related
to cost of sales and IT support compared to the prior year period. Total expenses, before allocations to cost of sales, for the
nine months ended September 30, 2016, were $1,368 a decrease of $442, or 24%, compared to $1,810 in the prior year period.  

Sales
and Marketing Expense   

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016, sales and marketing expense was $52, a decrease of $164, or 76%, compared to sales
and marketing expense of $216 in the prior year period. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, sales and marketing expense
was $381, a decrease of $375, or 50%, compared to sales and marketing expense of $756 in the prior year period. These decreases
were primarily attributable to salary and related cost savings implemented during the three months ended June 30, 2016 as part
of the Company s transition to a go to market strategy principally focused on partner integrations.  

General
and Administrative Expense   

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016, general and administrative expense was $368, a decrease of $102, or 22%, compared to
general and administrative expense of $470 in the prior year period. The decrease was primarily due to reductions in salaries
and related expense and professional services including legal and accounting fees compared to the prior year period.  

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, general and administrative expense was $1,709, an increase of $158, or 10%, compared
to general and administrative expense of $1,551 in the prior year period. The increase was primarily due to an increase in professional
service expenses of $353, or 63%, related to legal, accounting and other offering expenses that could not be brought forward and
applied against the public offering that was completed in May 2016. The increase in professional services was partially offset
by a decrease in salaries and related expense of $120, or 29%. The decrease in salaries and related expense is due primarily to
the reduction in stock-based compensation expense, compared to the prior year period.  

Other
Income and Expense, net   

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016, interest expense was $19, an increase of $15, compared to interest expense of $4 in
the prior year period. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, interest expense was $198, an increase of $194, compared
to interest expense of $4 in the prior year period. The increase in interest expense is primarily due to the convertible notes
and deferred compensation that were outstanding for the first five months of 2016, and converted into shares of Common Stock on
May 19, 2016.

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016, amortization of debt discount was $17, an increase of $17, compared to $0 in the in
the prior year period. The increase is due to the discount associated with the long  term debt issued in August 2016 to
pay the reaming principal balance of a $200 promissory note outstanding plus accrued interest that was due on August 24, 2016.  

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, amortization of debt discount was $283, an increase of $283. The increase was due to
the same factors described for the three month period discussed above.  

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016, the gain on derivative liability was $156, an increase of $155 compared to the gain
on derivative liability of $1 in the prior year period. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the gain on derivative liability
was $330, an increase of $312, compared to a gain on derivative liability of $18 in the prior year period. The increases in the
gain on derivative liability were primarily due to extinguishment of derivative liability by the conversion of $1,068 of short-term
debt in conjunction with the public offering in May 2016 and the repayment of the remaining short-term note payable balance of
$236, including accrued interest, in August 2016.  

For
both the three months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, there was no accretion of a beneficial conversion feature
on the Company s preferred stock.  

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, accretion of the beneficial conversion feature on the Company s Preferred Stock
with a conversion price less than the closing market price of the Company s common stock on the issuance date for new issuances
of preferred stock and for preferred share dividends was $245, a decrease of $282, or 54%, compared to $527 in the prior year
period. The decrease is due to the absence of new preferred shares issuances and the conversion of all classes of preferred stock
into common Stock on May 19, 2016. (See Liquidity and Capital Resources).  

The
Company recorded dividends in kind on shares of its Series A-1 Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Series C Preferred Stock
and Series D Preferred Stock during the period January 1, 2016 through May 19, 2016, at which time all outstanding shares of preferred
stock were exchanged for common stock, and no further dividends were declared.  

For
the three months ended September 30, 2016, dividends on shares of preferred stock were $0, a decrease of $819, or 100% compared
to $819 in the prior year period. The decrease was due to the conversion of all classes of Preferred Stock into Common Stock on
May 19, 2016.  

For
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, dividends in kind on shares of preferred stock were $1,313, a decrease of $1,022, or
44%, compared to $2,335 in the prior year period. The decrease was due to the above mentioned conversion of all classes of preferred
stock into common stock.  

Liquidity
and Capital Resources    

At
September 30, 2016, cash and cash equivalents totaled $140, compared to cash and cash equivalents of $846 at December 31, 2015.
The decrease in cash was primarily due to net cash used in operating activities of $1,270. The use of cash was partially offset
by the proceeds from the sale of common stock and warrants during the nine-month period, and a net increase of $140 in proceeds
from the issuance of notes. At September 30, 2016, total current assets were $374, compared to total current assets of $1,312
at December 31, 2015. At September 30, 2016, the Company's principal sources of funds included its aggregated cash and cash equivalents
of $140.  

At
September 30, 2016, accounts receivable net, was $169, an increase of $75, or 80%, compared to accounts receivable net of $94
at December 31, 2015. The increase is due primarily to the timing of billings during the three months ended September 30, 2016.  

At
September 30, 2016, prepaid expenses and other current assets were $65, a decrease of $307, or 83%, compared to prepaid expenses
and other current assets of $372 at December 31, 2015. The decrease is due primarily to offsetting the prepaid financing expenses
against the proceeds from the sale of common stock and warrants in the second quarter of 2016.

At
September 30, 2016, total current liabilities were $2,493, a decrease of $877, or 26%, compared to total current liabilities of
$3,370 at December 31, 2015. At September 30, 2016, accounts payable were $1,389, an increase of $602, or 76% compared to $787
at December 31, 2015. At September 30, 2016, accrued compensation was $264, an increase of $1, or 0%, compared to accrued compensation
of $263 at December 31, 2015. The increases in accounts payable and accrued compensation are due primarily to delays in the Company s
fundraising efforts and to the amount of funding secured to date. Other accrued liabilities were $374, a decrease of $241, or
39%, from $615 at December 31, 2015 due primarily to the conversion of $498 of deferred compensation including accrued interest
into 286 shares of common stock. This reduction was offset by the accrual of additional professional services during the period.
Debt, net of the unamortized discount, decreased $747, or 75%, to $244 compared to $991 at December 31, 2015, due to the conversion
of $1,068 of the notes plus accrued interest, into 683 shares of the Company s common stock. In addition the Company paid
off the remaining $200 unsecured convertible note plus accrued interest through the issuance of $240 in new notes discussed below.
Additionally, the Company received proceeds of $100 through the issuance of short-term notes payable in September 2016.  

In
August 2016, the Company issued long-term unsecured convertible promissory notes to investors and affiliates of the Company aggregating
$240 in cash. The notes are mandatorily convertible to common stock at a conversion rate of $0.91 per share upon closing a new
debt and or equity financing of at least $500 in aggregate proceeds. The notes bear interest at the rate of 1% per annum and are
due December 31, 2017. The holders shall also receive, on a pro rata basis, cash payments payable from 3% of the revenue actually
received by the Company from its European customer, not to exceed one and one-half (1.5) times the aggregate principal amount
of the notes. Such cash payments only occur if the notes are converted into Common Stock. Additionally, the convertible notes
contained an embedded beneficial conversion feature having an intrinsic value of $103 at the issuance date, for which the Company
recorded a discount to the long-term notes payable and a corresponding additional paid-in capital attributable to the beneficial
conversion feature. The discount will be amortized using the effective interest method over the term of the notes. The Company
recorded $7 in debt discount amortization expense associated with these notes for the three and nine month period ended September
30, 2016. The proceeds from the notes were used to pay off the $200 promissory note outstanding plus accrued interest that was
due on August 24, 2016.  

In
September and October 2016, the Company issued demand promissory notes to affiliates of the Company aggregating $200 in cash.
The notes bear interest at the rate of 1% per annum and are due on demand. In addition, the affiliate will be a paid a financing
fee of 10% of the face value of the demand notes upon such repayment or exchange of the demand notes or their exchange into the
next financing. In the event the demand notes are not repaid or exchanged by December 31, 2016, the demand notes will automatically
be exchanged into unsecured convertible promissory notes, substantially with the same terms described in the previous paragraph.  

Current
deferred revenue was $362, a decrease of $22, or 6%, compared to current deferred revenue of $384 at December 31, 2015. Deferred
revenue primarily reflects advance payments for maintenance fees from the Company s licensees that are generally recognized
as revenue by the Company when all obligations are met or over the term of the maintenance agreement, whichever is longer. Deferred
revenue is recorded when the Company receives advance payment from its customers.  

The
Company exercised its option to pay in kind the accrued dividends on preferred stock as follows:

On
May 19, 2016, the Company closed an underwritten public offering of 690,000 shares of common stock at a public offering price
of $1.74 per share. In addition, the Company sold 345,000 warrants, at a public offering price of $0.01 per warrant, to purchase
shares of Common Stock. The warrants expire on May 18, 2021 and have an exercise price of $2.175 per share. The Company raised
gross cash proceeds of $1,204 before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses of $780. As
a result of the consummation of the offering, each series of the Company s outstanding preferred stock, including accrued
and unpaid dividends through May 19, 2016, were converted into shares of common stock.  

The
Company is using the funds received from the above financing for working capital and general corporate purposes.  

The
Company incurred $19 and $198, respectively, of interest expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. The interest
expense was related to the notes issued in August and September 2016, the note that was paid off in August 2016 and the convertible
notes and deferred compensation that were converted to Common Stock in May 2016. The Company paid $40 of the above interest in
cash over the nine months ended September 30, 2016.  

The
Company had the following material commitments as of September 30, 2016:  

1.    The
                                         Company extended the lease on its offices in April 2010. The base rent decreased by approximately
                                         6% in November 2011 and will increase by approximately 3% per annum over the term of
                                         the new lease, which expires on October 31, 2016.   
 
  2.    The
                                         Company sublet approximately 3,000 feet of unutilized office space in August 2015. The
                                         sub-lease expired on September 1, 2016.   
 
  3.    Includes
                                         other capital leases associated with leased office equipment.    

The
Company has experienced recurring losses from operations that raise a substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going
concern. There can be no assurance that the Company will have adequate capital resources to fund planned operations or that any
additional funds will be available to it when needed, or if available, will be available on favorable terms or in amounts required
by it. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate capital resources to fund operations, it may be required to delay, scale back
or eliminate some or all of its operations, which may have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations
and ability to operate as a going concern.  

Item
    3.  
       Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.    

Interest
Rate Risk   

The
Company did not enter into any short-term security investments during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016.  

Foreign
Currency Risk   

From
time to time, the Company makes certain capital equipment or other purchases denominated in foreign currencies. As a result, the
Company s cash flows and earnings are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. The
Company attempts to limit these exposures through operational strategies and generally has not hedged currency exposures. During
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015, foreign currency translation gains and losses were insignificant.

4.  Controls and Procedures .  

Disclosure
Controls and Procedures  

As
of the end of the period covered by this report, we conducted an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of
our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure
controls and procedures pursuant to paragraph (b) of Rule 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act of 1934 (the  Exchange
Act ). Based on that evaluation our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of the end of
the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that the information required
to be disclosed in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the
time periods specified in the SEC s rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.  

Our
management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, do not expect that our disclosure controls and
procedures will prevent all errors or fraud. A control procedure, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only
reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control procedures are met. Because of the inherent limitations
in all control procedures, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud,
if any, within the Company have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making
can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by
the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control. The Company
considered these limitations during the development of its disclosure controls and procedures, and will continually reevaluate
them to ensure they provide reasonable assurance that such controls and procedures are effective.  

Changes
in Internal Control over Financial Reporting   

There
has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2016 that has materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
