(UNAUDITED)  

NOTE 1: SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING
POLICIES  

NATURE OF OPERATIONS   

On September 10, 2013,
Mobiquity Technologies, Inc. changed its name from Ace Marketing   Promotions, Inc. (the  Company  or  Mobiquity ).
We operate through two wholly-owned U.S. subsidiaries, namely, Mobiquity Networks, Inc. and Ace Marketing   Promotions,
Inc. Mobiquity Networks owns 100% of Mobiquity Wireless S.L.U, a company incorporated in Spain. This corporation has an office
in Spain to support our U.S. operations. 

We operate a national location-based
mobile advertising network that has developed a consumer-focused proximity network which we believe is unlike any other in the
United States. Our integrated suite of proprietary location based mobile advertising technologies allows clients to execute more
personalized and contextually relevant experiences, driving brand awareness and incremental revenue. 

Leveraging our agreements
with Simon Property Group, Inc. (which we refer to herein as  Simon  or  Simon Property ), and Macerich
Partnership, L.P. (which we refer to as  Macerich ), the number one and number three mall operators, respectively,
in the U.S. in terms of number of Class A properties, we have installed our location-based mobile advertising solutions in the
common areas of approximately 295 retail destinations across the U.S. to create  smart malls  using Bluetooth-enabled
iBeacon compatible technology. As part of our plan to expand our mall footprint into the common areas of other malls, we recently
have also added 27 malls operated by PREIT Services, LLC, which we will refer to as  PREIT.  We have also added 30
malls operating by Rouse Properties TRS, Inc. which we will refer to as  Rouse.  In December 2015, we entered into
an agreement with GGPLP REIT Services, LLC (which we refer to as  GGP ), the second largest mall operator in the United
States, to install our Mobi-Beacons in approximately 120 malls in 2016, about half of which are installed. We plan to further expand
our mall footprint into the common areas of other malls and outside of malls with additional synergistic venues that will allow
for cross marketing opportunities, including venues such as stadiums, arenas, additional college campuses, airports and retail
chains. For example, we have entered into an agreement with the New York State University at Stony Brook to deploy a mobile advertising
network in their new arena. This type of installation will enable fan engagement, cross-marketing opportunities, sponsorship activation
and create interactive event experiences. This is our first installation in the university market. 

Ace Marketing is our legacy
marketing and promotions business which provides integrated marketing services to our commercial customers. While Ace Marketing
currently represents substantially all of our revenue, we anticipate that activity from Ace Marketing will represent a diminishing
portion of corporate revenue as our attention is now principally focused on developing and executing on opportunities in our Mobiquity
Networks business. 

GOING CONCERN - The accompanying consolidated
financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company's continued existence
is dependent upon the Company's ability to obtain additional debt and/or equity financing to advance its new technology revenue
stream. The Company has incurred losses for the three months and nine months ended September 30, 2016. As of September 30, 2016,
the Company has an accumulated deficit of $47,993,384. The Company has had negative cash flows from operating activities of $4,792,828
for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. These factors raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue
as a going concern. 

Management has plans to
address the Company s financial situation as follows: 

In the near term, management
plans to continue to focus on raising the funds necessary to implement the Company s business plan related to the Bluetooth-enabled
iBeacon compatible technology. Management will continue to seek out debt financing to obtain the capital required to meet the Company s
financial obligations. There is no assurance, however, that lenders and investors will continue to advance capital to the Company
or that the new business operations will be profitable. The possibility of failure in obtaining additional funding and the potential
inability to achieve profitability raises doubts about the Company s ability to continue as a going concern. 

In the long term, management
believes that the Company s projects and initiatives will be successful and will provide cash flow to the Company that will
be used to finance the Company s future growth. However, there can be no assurances that the Company s efforts to raise
equity and debt at acceptable terms or that the planned activities will be successful, or that the Company will ultimately attain
profitability. The Company s long-term viability depends on its ability to obtain adequate sources of debt or equity funding
to meet current commitments and fund the continuation of its business operations, and the ability of the Company to achieve adequate
profitability and cash flows from operations to sustain its operations. 

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION - The accompanying
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Mobiquity Technologies, Inc., formerly known as Ace Marketing   Promotions,
Inc., and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Mobiquity Networks, Inc., Ace Marketing, Inc., (which has had its name changed to Ace
Marketing   Promotions, Inc. and Mobiquity Wireless S.L.U.). All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated
in consolidation. 

The Condensed Consolidated
Balance Sheets as of September 30, 2016, the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2016 and 2015 and the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015 have been prepared by us without audit, and in accordance with the requirements of Form 10-Q and, therefore, they do not
include all information and footnotes necessary for a fair presentation of financial position, results of operations, and cash
flows in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. In our opinion, the accompanying
unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments necessary to present fairly in all material respects
our financial position as of September 30, 2016, results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and
2015 and cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature.
The results of operations and cash flows for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and our cash flows for the nine
months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year. We have evaluated
subsequent events through the filing of this Form 10-Q with the SEC, and determined there have not been any events that have occurred
that would require adjustments to our unaudited Condensed Financial Statements. 

The information contained
in this report on Form 10-Q should he read in conjunction with our Form 10-K for our fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. 

ESTIMATES - The preparation of financial statements
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS- The Company
measures assets and liabilities at fair value based on an expected exit price as defined by the authoritative guidance on fair
value measurements, which represents the amount that would be received on the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability,
as the case may be, in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value may be based on assumptions that
market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. The authoritative guidance on fair value measurements establishes
a consistent framework for measuring fair value on either a recurring or nonrecurring basis whereby inputs, used in valuation techniques,
are assigned a hierarchical level.  

The following are the hierarchical
levels of inputs to measure fair value: 

Level 1 - Observable inputs that reflect quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.   

Level 2 - Inputs reflect quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the assets or liabilities; or inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.   

Level 3 - Unobservable inputs reflecting the Company's assumptions incorporated in valuation techniques used to determine fair value. These assumptions are required to be consistent with market participant assumptions that are reasonably available.   

The carrying amounts of
the Company's financial assets and liabilities, such as cash, prepaid expenses, other current assets, accounts payable   accrued
expenses, certain notes payable and notes payable - related party, approximate their fair values because of the short maturity
of these instruments.  

The following table summarizes
the derivative liability activity for the period December 31, 2015 through September 30, 2016: 

For the three month period
ended September 30, 2016, net derivative income/(loss) was $1,494,861 and an initial derivative expense of $0.00. 

The Company accounts for
its derivative liabilities, at fair value, on a recurring basis under level 2.   

The Company accounts for
its derivative liabilities, at fair value, on a recurring basis under level 2.   

Embedded Conversion Features  

The Company evaluates embedded
conversion features within convertible debt under ASC 815  Derivatives and Hedging  to determine whether the embedded
conversion feature(s) should be bifurcated from the host instrument and accounted for as a derivative at fair value with changes
in fair value recorded in earnings. If the conversion feature does not require derivative treatment under ASC 815, the instrument
is evaluated under ASC 470-20  Debt with Conversion and Other Options  for consideration of any beneficial conversion
feature. 

Derivative Financial Instruments  

The
Company has financial instruments that are considered derivatives or contain embedded features subject to derivative accounting
 related to 22 convertible notes issued totaling $3,675,000 which included a ratchet provision in the conversion price of
$0.30 or a price equal to the last equity transaction completed by the Company as part of a subscription agreement .
The notes all have a maturity date of December 31, 2016.   

In
this period ending September 30, 2016 the Company issued additional financial instruments in a subscription that are considered
derivatives or contain embedded features subject to derivative accounting  related to six convertible notes issued totaling
$700,000 which included a ratchet provision in the conversion price of $0.20 or a price equal to the last equity transaction completed
by the Company as part of the ongoing subscription agreement and the additional warrants (3 year options with an exercise price
of $0.20) issued as part of the note conversions . The notes all have a maturity date of October
31, 2016. Subsequent to period end, the notes have been extended to December 15, 2015.  

Embedded
derivatives are valued separately from the host instrument and are recognized as derivative liabilities in the Company s
balance sheet. The Company measures these instruments at their estimated fair value and recognizes changes in their estimated
fair value in results of operations during the period of change. The Company has estimated the fair value of these embedded derivatives
for convertible debentures and associated warrants using a multinomial lattice model as of September 30, 2016. The fair values
of the derivative instruments are measured each quarter $19,657 as of September 30, 2016, which resulted in a fair value gain
of $1,494,861 and derivative expense of $ 0.00  during the three months ended September
30, 2016. As of September 30, 2016, the fair market value of the derivatives aggregated $19,657, using the following assumptions:
estimated 0.050 to 5.0-year term (notes and warrants), estimated volatility of 131.39% to 275.40%, and a discount rate of 0.36%
to 0.49%.  

Cash and cash equivalents
include money market securities that are considered to be highly liquid and easily tradable as of September 30, 2016 and December
31, 2015. These securities are valued using inputs observable in active markets for identical securities and are therefore classified
as Level 1 within our fair value hierarchy. 

The carrying amounts of
financial instruments, including accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and promissory note, approximated
fair value as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, because of the relatively short-term maturity of these instruments and
their market interest rates. No instruments are carried at fair value. 

RECLASSIFICATIONS - Certain amounts in the prior period financial
statements have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on reported
losses. 

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS  - 
The Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments with a maturity of three months or less, as well as bank money market
accounts, to be cash equivalents. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the balances were $224,974 and $2,044,662, respectively. 

CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK  - 
Financial instruments, which potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk, consist principally of trade receivables
and cash and cash equivalents. 

Concentration of credit
risk with respect to trade receivables is generally diversified due to the large number of entities comprising the Company's customer
base and their dispersion across geographic areas principally within the United States. The Company routinely addresses the financial
strength of its customers and, as a consequence, believes that its receivable credit risk exposure is limited. 

The Company places its
temporary cash investments with high credit quality financial institutions. At times, the Company maintains bank account balances,
which exceed FDIC limits. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company exceeded FDIC limits by $0 and $1,644,032,
respectively. 

REVENUE RECOGNITION   The Company recognizes revenue, for
all revenue streams, when it is realized or realizable and estimable in accordance with ASC 605,   Revenue Recognition .
 The Company will recognize revenue only when all of the following criteria have been met: 

Persuasive evidence for an agreement exists;   

Service has been provided;   

The fee is fixed or determinable; and,   

Collection is reasonably assured.   

ACE MARKETING   Ace Marketing's revenue is recognized when
title and risk of loss transfers to the customer and the earnings process is complete. In general, title passes to our customers
upon the customer's receipt of the merchandise. Revenue is recognized on a gross basis since Ace Marketing has the risks and rewards
of ownership, latitude in selection of vendors and pricing, and bears all credit risk. Advance payments made by customers are included
in customer deposits. Ace Marketing records all shipping and handling fees billed to customers as revenues and related costs as
cost of goods sold, when incurred. Additional source of revenue, derived from emails/texts directly to consumers are recognized
under contractual arrangements. Revenue from this advertising method is recognized at the time of service provided. 

MOBIQUITY NETWORKS - Mobiquity has three avenues of income with
our beacon platform, Bluetooth Push and Wi-Fi. Revenue is realized with the signing of the advertising contract. The customer signs
a contract directly with us for an advertising campaign with mutually agreed upon term and is billed on the start date of the advertising
campaign, which are normally in short duration periods. Revenue is recognized the same way for the three mobile solutions. The
first option to earn revenue with the beacon platform is for customers to contract for advertising campaigns, on our platform,
either directly through their own app or through various third party apps. The second option to earn revenue is through a revenue
share with advertising exchanges and networks that deliver advertising campaigns to their customers based on our real-time location
signal data. The third option would be through selling our historical data to data management platform companies. 

ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS - Management must make estimates
of the collectability of accounts receivable. Management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and analyzes historical bad
debts, customer concentrations, customer credit-worthiness, current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms when
evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, allowance for doubtful
accounts were $104,611 and $104,611, respectively. 

INVENTORY - Inventory is recorded at cost (First In, First Out)
and is comprised of finished goods. The Company maintains an inventory on hand for its largest customer's frequent order items.
All items held are branded for the customer, therefore are not available for public distribution. The Company has an agreement
with this customer, for cost recovery, if vendor relationship is terminated. There have been minimal reserves placed on inventory,
based on this arrangement. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company has reserved against $31,676 and $31,676,
respectively. 

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT - Property and equipment are stated at cost.
Depreciation is expensed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. Leasehold improvements
are being amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets or the remaining term
of the lease. The costs of additions and improvements, which substantially extend the useful life of a particular asset, are capitalized.
Repair and maintenance costs are charged to expense. When assets are sold or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated
depreciation are removed from the account and the gain or loss on disposition is reflected in operating income. 

LONG LIVED ASSETS - Long-lived assets such as property, equipment
and identifiable intangibles are reviewed for impairment whenever facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may
not be recoverable. When required impairment losses on assets to be held and used are recognized based on the fair value of the
asset. The fair value is determined based on estimates of future cash flows, market value of similar assets, if available, or independent
appraisals, if required. If the carrying amount of the long-lived asset is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows, an
impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of the asset. When fair values are
not available, the Company estimates fair value using the expected future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the
risk associated with the recovery of the assets. We did not recognize any impairment losses for any periods presented. 

WEBSITE TECHNOLOGY - Website technology developed during the prior
years were capitalized for the period of development and testing. Expenditures during the planning stage and after implementation
have been expensed in accordance with ASC 985. 

ADVERTISING COSTS -  Advertising
costs are expensed as incurred. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, there were advertising costs
of $3,129 and $5,495, respectively. 

ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK BASED COMPENSATION. Stock based compensation
cost is measured at the grant date fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period. The
Company uses the Black-Sholes option-pricing model to determine fair value of the awards, which involves certain subjective assumptions.
These assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them
( expected term ), the estimated volatility of the Company's common stock price over the expected term ( volatility )
and the number of options for which vesting requirements will not be completed ( forfeitures ). Changes in the subjective
assumptions can materially affect estimates of fair value stock-based compensation, and the related amount recognized on the consolidated
statements of operations. Refer to Note 8  Stock Option Plans  in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements  in
 this report for a more detailed discussion. 

BENEFICIAL CONVERSIONS - Debt instruments that contain a beneficial
conversion feature are recorded as deemed interest to the holders of the convertible debt instruments. The beneficial conversion
is calculated as the difference between the fair values of the underlying common stock less the proceeds that have been received
for the debt instrument limited to the value received. 

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATIONS - The Company's functional and reporting
currency is the U.S. dollar. We own a subsidiary in Europe. Our subsidiary's functional currency is the EURO. All transactions
initiated in EUROs are translated into U.S. dollars in accordance with ASC 830-30,   Translation of Financial Statements, 
 as follows: 

(i)  
      Monetary assets and liabilities at the rate of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date.   

(ii)  
      Fixed assets and equity transactions at historical rates.   

(iii)  
      Revenue and expense items at the average rate of exchange prevailing during the period.   

Adjustments arising from
such translations are deferred until realization and are included as a separate component of stockholders' equity as a component
of comprehensive income or loss. Therefore, translation adjustments are not included in determining net income (loss) but reported
as other comprehensive income. 

INCOME TAXES - Deferred income taxes are recognized for temporary
differences between financial statement and income tax basis of assets and liabilities for which income tax or tax benefits are
expected to be realized in future years. A valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets, if it is more likely
than not, that all or some portion of such deferred tax assets will not be realized. The effect on deferred taxes of a change in
tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. 

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS 

We have reviewed the FASB
issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU ) accounting pronouncements and interpretations thereof that have effectiveness
dates during the periods reported and in future periods. The Company has carefully considered the new pronouncements that alter
previous generally accepted accounting principles and does not believe that any new or modified principles will have a material
impact on the corporation's reported financial position or operations in the near term. The applicability of any standard is subject
to the formal review of our financial management and certain standards are under consideration. 

NOTE 2: LOSS PER SHARE  

Basic loss per share is
determined by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted
EPS is determined by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares used in the basic EPS calculation plus the
number of common shares that would be issued assuming conversion of all potentially dilutive securities outstanding under the treasury
stock and if converted method. As of September 30, 2016 there were 48,866,270 potential dilutive shares that needed to be considered
as common share equivalents. 

NOTE 3: CONVERTIBLE
PROMISSORY NOTE   

Summary of Convertible
Promissory Notes: 

(a)  
      Between August and December 2015, the Company borrowed $3,675,000 from accredited investors. These loans are due and payable the earlier of December 31, 2016 or the completion of an equity financing of at least $2,500,000. Upon the sale of the unsecured promissory notes, the Company issued $1 of principal, one share of common stock and a warrant to purchase one share of common stock at an exercise price of $0.40 per share through August 31, 2017. Accordingly, an aggregate of 3,675,000 shares of common stock and warrants to purchase a like amount were issued in the last six months of 2015. Each noteholder has the right to convert the principal of their note and accrued interest thereon at a conversion price of $0.30 per share or at the noteholder s option, into equity securities of the Company on the same terms as the last equity transaction completed by the Company prior to each respective conversion date.   

The Company has financial
instruments that are considered derivatives or contain embedded features subject to derivative accounting related to 22 convertible
notes issued totaling $3,675,000 which included a ratchet provision in the conversion price of $0.30 or a price equal to the last
equity transaction completed by the Company as part of a subscription agreement. The notes all have a maturity date of December
31, 2016. Embedded derivatives are valued separately from the host instrument and are recognized as derivative liabilities in the
Company s balance sheet. The Company measures these instruments at their estimated fair value and recognizes changes in their
estimated fair value in results of operations during the period of change. The Company has estimated the fair value of these embedded
derivatives for convertible debentures and associated warrants using a multinomial lattice model as of September 30, 2016. The
fair values of these derivative instruments are measured each quarter, which resulted in a gain of $573,610. As of September 30,
2016, the fair market value of these derivatives aggregated $2,947, using the following assumptions: estimated 0.25 year term,
estimated volatility of 275%, and a discount rate of 0.29%. 

In April 2016 through the
filing date of this Form 10-Q, the Company issued and sold 12% unsecured promissory notes in the principal amount of $1,025,000,
convertible at $0.20 per common share. Upon conversion, the note holders would receive 100% warrant coverage, exercisable at $0.20
per common share over a period of five years with cashless exercise provisions. These notes automatically convert in the event
at least $5 million is raised in an equity financing. Prior to the mandatory conversion date, note holders have the option to convert
the principal and accrued interest also on the same terms as the mandatory conversion and the Company has the option to prepay.
The fair values of the derivative instruments are measured each quarter, which resulted in a gain of $1,112,089. As of September
30, 2016, the fair market value of these derivatives aggregated $16,710, using the following assumptions: estimated 0.54 year term,
estimated volatility of 201.10% , and a discount rate of 0.45%. 

The Company
raised $700,000 in the third quarter of 2016 from the sale of secured promissory notes in the principal amount of $700,000
from six accredited investors. Each Note was scheduled to be repaid on October 31, 2016, but payment was not made. In lieu of
interest on the Note, 4,900,000 restricted shares of common stock were issued to the Note Holders. At the option of the Note
Holder, each Note shall be convertible at the lower of $.20 per common share or into securities on the same terms of the next
completed equity offering of at least $10 million in gross proceeds. In the event the Note is converted into common stock,
100% warrant conversion shall be provided to the Note Holder for each share of common stock issued upon conversion. These
warrants will have a term of three years and shall be exercisable at $.20 per common share. Prior to this offering, Thomas
Arnost, Executive Chairman, has a secured interest in the amount of $322,000 in the assets of the Company and its
subsidiaries. Mr. Arnost has agreed that the investors in this offering will have a pari passu first secured interest with
Mr. Arnost in all assets of the Company and its subsidiaries. The fair values of the derivative instruments are measured each
quarter, which resulted in a gain of $54,016. As of September 30, 2016, the fair market value of these derivatives aggregated
$0.00, using the following assumptions: estimated volatility of 201.10% , and a discount rate of 0.20%. 

NOTE 4: STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY (DEFICIT)  

In December 2015, the Company
sold 200,000 shares of its Series AA Preferred Stock at a purchase price of $10 per share and raised $2 million. Each share of
Preferred Stock is convertible into 50 shares of Common Stock at an effective conversion price of $.20 per share of Common Stock.
The Preferred Stockholder has anti-dilution protection rights through December 31, 2016. In the first quarter of 2016, the Company
sold an additional 40,000 shares of its Series AA Preferred Stock and raised $400,000. 

During the quarter
ended March 31, 2016, the Company issued 695,000 common shares, at $0.10 to $0.19 per share, valued at $97,800. During the
June 30, 2016 quarter the Company issued 245,000 common shares, at $0.10 to $0.11 per share, valued at $24,950 in exchange
for services rendered.

quarter the Company issued 244,344 common shares, at $0.11 per share, valued at $27,000 in exchange for interest. During the September
30, 2016 quarter the Company issued 5,215,334 common shares, at $0.06 to $0.11 per share, valued at $387,082 in exchange for interest. 

NOTE 5: STOCK COMPENSATION  

Compensation costs related
to share-based payment transactions, including employee stock options, are recognized in the financial statements utilizing the
straight line method for the cost of these awards. 

The Company's results for
the three-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 include employee share-based compensation expense totaling approximately
163,500 and $361,500, respectively. The Company's results for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 include
employee share-based compensation expense totaling approximately $512,900 and $361,500, respectively. Such amounts have been included
in the Condensed Consolidated Statements of Operations within selling, general and administrative expenses. No income tax benefit
has been recognized in the statement of operations for share-based compensation arrangements due to a history of operating losses. 

The following table summarizes
stock-based compensation expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 (unaudited): 

NOTE 6: STOCK OPTION PLAN  

During Fiscal 2005, the
Company established, and the stockholders approved, an Employee Benefit and Consulting Services Compensation Plan (the  2005
Plan ) for the granting of up to 2,000,000 non-statutory and incentive stock options and stock awards to directors, officers,
consultants and key employees of the Company. On June 9, 2005, the Board of Directors amended the Plan to increase the number of
stock options and awards to be granted under the Plan to 4,000,000. During Fiscal 2009, the Company established a plan of long-term
stock-based compensation incentives for selected Eligible Participants of the Company covering 4,000,000 shares. This plan was
adopted by the Board of Directors and approved by stockholders in October 2009 and shall be known as the 2009 Employee Benefit
and Consulting Services Compensation Plan (the  2009 Plan ). In September 2013, the Company's stockholders approved an
increase in the number of shares covered by the 2009 Plan to 10,000,000. In February 2015, the board approved, subject to stockholder
approval within one year, an increase in the number of shares under the 2009 Plan to 20,000,000 shares. (The 2005 and 2009 Plans
are collectively referred to as the  Plans  and the Company has a combined 14,000,000 shares, which will increase to
24,000,000 shares upon stockholder approval of the increase in the 2009 Plan, available for issuance under the Plans.) 

In the first quarter of
2016, the Board approved and stockholders ratified a 2016 Employee Benefit and Consulting Services Compensation Plan covering 10,000,000
shares (the  2016 Plan ) and approving moving all options which exceeded the 2009 Plan limits to the 2016 Plan. 

All stock options under
the Plans are granted at or above the fair market value of the common stock at the grant date. Employee and non-employee stock
options vest over varying periods and generally expire either 5 or 10 years from the grant date. The fair value of options at the
date of grant was estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. For option grants, the Company will take into consideration
payments subject to the provisions of ASC 718  Stock Compensation , previously Revised SFAS No. 123  Share-Based
Payment  ( SFAS 123 (R) ). The fair values of these restricted stock awards are equal to the market value of the
Company's stock on the date of grant, after taking into certain discounts. The expected volatility is based upon historical volatility
of our stock and other contributing factors. The expected term is based upon observation of actual time elapsed between date of
grant and exercise of options for all employees. Previously, such assumptions were determined based on historical data. 

The weighted average assumptions
made in calculating the fair values of options granted during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are as
follows: 

The weighted-average grant-date
fair value of options granted during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 was $0.10 and $0.40, respectively. 

The aggregate intrinsic
value of options outstanding and options exercisable at September 30, 2016 is calculated as the difference between the exercise
price of the underlying options and the market price of the Company's common stock for the shares that had exercise prices, that
were lower than the $0.02 closing price of the Company's common stock on September 30, 2016. 

As of September 30, 2016,
the fair value of unamortized compensation cost related to unvested stock option awards was $606,698. 

The weighted average assumptions
made in calculating the fair value of warrants granted during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 are as
follows: 

NOTE 7: COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES   

COMMITMENTS   

Simon Properties  

In April 2011, we entered
into our agreement with Simon Property Group, which agreement was amended first in September 2013 and then in July 2014. This second
amendment provides for us to expand our location-based mobile mall network footprint to about 240 Simon malls across the United
States. Our agreement with Simon currently expires December 31, 2017. Simon is entitled to receive fees from us equal to the greater
of a pre-set per mall fee or a percentage of revenues derived from within the Simon Mall network. The revenue share agreement in
which Simon participates will exceed the minimum annual mall fees if the Company has generated revenues within the Simon network
of about $15 million or more in a calendar year. Our agreement with Simon requires the company to maintain letters of credit for
each calendar year under the agreement represented by the minimum amount of fees due for such calendar year. For 2015, the minimum
fees of $2.7 million has been secured through two bank letters of credit, one of which was issued in the amount of $1,350,000 utilizing
the funds of a non-affiliated stockholder and the second letter of credit was obtained in the same amount through the funds of
Thomas Arnost, our Executive Chairman. In the event Simon draws down upon either letter of credit, we have until the next minimum
payment due date (approximately 90 days) after the draw down to obtain replacement letters of credit. Each person who secured our
letters of credit has the opportunity to notify us that they wish to turn the cash funds securing the letters of credit over to
us and to convert such funds into Common Stock currently at a conversion price of $.20 per share. Also, each person who issued
the letter of credit is receiving quarterly, while the letters of credit are outstanding, options to purchase 125,000 shares of
Common Stock, exercisable at the prevailing market price per share on the date of grant and interest at the rate of 8% per annum
on the monies that they have had to set aside in their bank accounts and are unable to have access to such monies. In April, July
and October, 2016, Simon drew down on each bank letter of credit for an aggregate of $557,688 owed to each letter of credit provider.

generated through Macerich s sales efforts. We believe that the revenue share in which Macerich participates will exceed
the minimum annual mall fees if we generate revenues within the Macerich network of approximately $3 million or more in a calendar
year. The agreement also provides for Macerich to adjust the number of malls subject to the agreement from time-to-time based upon
changes in its beneficial ownership in the malls. Our agreement with Macerich has a term of three years but is subject to earlier
termination (i) with cause following a notice and cure period in the event of material breach of the agreement or (ii) without

NOTE 8: SEGMENT INFORMATION  

Reportable operating segment
is determined based on Mobiquity Technologies, Inc.'s management approach. The management approach, as defined by accounting standards
which have been codified into FASB ASC 280,  Segment Reporting,  is based on the way that the chief operating decision-maker
organizes the segments within an enterprise for making decisions about resources to be allocated and assessing their performance.
Our chief operating decision-maker is our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer. 

While our results of operations
are primarily reviewed on a consolidated basis, the chief operating decision-maker also manages the enterprise in two operating
segments: (i) Ace Marketing and Promotions, Inc. captures Branding   Branded Merchandise (ii) Mobiquity Networks represent
our Mobil Marketing. 

Corporate management defines
and reviews segment profitability based on the same allocation methodology as presented in the segment data tables below:

Company Overview  

We operate a national location-based
mobile advertising network that has developed a consumer-focused proximity network which we believe is unlike any other in the
United States. Our integrated suite of proprietary location based mobile advertising technologies allows clients to execute more
personalized and contextually relevant experiences, driving brand awareness and incremental revenue. 

We have installed our location-based
mobile advertising solutions in mall locations to create  smart malls  using Bluetooth-enabled iBeacon compatible technology.
Mall locations include Simon malls, Macerich malls, GGP malls, Rouse malls and Preit malls across the United States. We plan to
expand our mall footprint in other malls and outside the malls with additional synergistic venues that will allow for cross marketing
opportunities in such venues as stadiums, arenas, additional college campuses, airports and retail chains. For example, we have
entered into an agreement with the New York State University at Stony Brook to deploy a mobile advertising network in their new
arena. This type of installation will enable fan engagement, cross-marketing opportunities, sponsorship activation and create interactive
event experiences. This is our first installation in the university market. 

Ace Marketing is our legacy
marketing and promotions business which provides integrated marketing services to our commercial customers. While Ace Marketing
currently represents substantially all of our revenue, we anticipate that activity from Ace Marketing will represent a diminishing
portion of corporate revenue as our attention is now principally focused on developing and executing on opportunities in our Mobiquity
Networks business. 

Our Agreements with Mall Property Owners/Managers and
IBM   

Simon Properties  

In April 2011, we entered
into our agreement with Simon Property Group, which agreement was amended first in September 2013 and then in July 2014. This second
amendment provides for us to expand our location-based mobile mall network footprint to about 240 Simon malls across the United
States. Our agreement with Simon currently expires December 31, 2017. Simon is entitled to receive fees from us equal to the greater
of a pre-set per mall fee or a percentage of revenues derived from within the Simon Mall network. The revenue share agreement in
which Simon participates will exceed the minimum annual mall fees if the Company has generated revenues within the Simon network
of about $15 million or more in a calendar year. Our agreement with Simon requires the company to maintain letters of credit for
each calendar year under the agreement represented by the minimum amount of fees due for such calendar year. For 2015, the minimum
fees of $2.7 million has been secured through two bank letters of credit, one of which was issued in the amount of $1,350,000 utilizing
the funds of a non-affiliated stockholder and the second letter of credit was obtained in the same amount through the funds of
Thomas Arnost, our Executive Chairman. In the event Simon draws down upon either letter of credit, we have until the next minimum
payment due date (approximately 90 days) after the draw down to obtain replacement letters of credit. Each person who secured our
letters of credit has the opportunity to notify us that they wish to turn the cash funds securing the letters of credit over to
us and to convert such funds into Common Stock currently at a conversion price of $.20 per share. Also, each person who issued
the letter of credit is receiving quarterly, while the letters of credit are outstanding, options to purchase 125,000 shares of
Common Stock, exercisable at the prevailing market price per share on the date of grant and interest at the rate of 8% per annum
on the monies that they have had to set aside in their bank accounts and are unable to have access to such monies. In April and
July, 2016, Simon drew down on each bank letter of credit for an aggregate of $557,688 owed to each letter of credit provider. 

Macerich   

In April 2015, we entered
into a license agreement with Macerich, which became effective June 2015. Pursuant to our agreement with Macerich, we have the
right to install Mobi-Beacons to send information across the air space of the common areas of our Macerich mall network, which
will include approximately 55 malls across the United States. Our right to install our Mobi-Beacons to market and sell third party
paid advertising in the interior common areas of these malls is exclusive. Under a license agreement between us and Macerich currently
covering 55 malls, Macerich is entitled to receive fees from us equal to a minimum fee plus the greater of a pre-set per mall fee
or a percentage of revenues derived from within the Macerich mall network as well as certain commission fees based on revenues
generated through Macerich s sales efforts. We believe that the revenue share in which Macerich participates will exceed
the minimum annual mall fees if we generate revenues within the Macerich network of approximately $3 million or more in a calendar
year. The agreement also provides for Macerich to adjust the number of malls subject to the agreement from time-to-time based upon
changes in its beneficial ownership in the malls. Our agreement with Macerich has a term of three years but is subject to earlier
termination (i) with cause following a notice and cure period in the event of material breach of the agreement or (ii) without
cause by Macerich after one year on 90 days  prior written notice to us. In the event of termination of the agreement without
cause, Macerich will reimburse us for certain out-of-pocket expenses. 

PREIT  

Pursuant to a master agreement
effective August, 2015, we entered into an agreement with PREIT pursuant to which we have the right to install our Mobi-Beacons
to send information across the air space of the common areas of our PREIT mall network, which will include approximately 27 malls
in select states in the United States. Our right to install our Mobi-Beacons to market and sell third party paid advertising in
the interior common areas of these malls is exclusive. Under our agreement between us and PREIT, PREIT is entitled to an agreed
upon revenue share over the four year term of the agreement. In the event the net revenue share as defined in the agreement is
not attained for any measurement period, also as defined in the agreement, either party may terminate the agreement upon 90 days
prior written notice. PREIT may also terminate the agreement if it determines that Mobiquity s installed equipment is not
adequate and/or provides a negative user experience for the visitors to the PREIT malls. The agreement also provides for PREIT
to adjust the number of malls subject to the agreement from time-to-time based upon changes in its beneficial ownership in the
malls. 

Rouse  

Pursuant to a master agreement
entered into in 2015, we entered into an agreement with Rouse pursuant to which we have the right to install our Mobi-Beacons to
send information across the air space of the common areas of our Rouse mall network, which will include approximately 30 malls
in select states in the United States. Our right to install our Mobi-Beacons to market and sell third party paid advertising in
the interior common areas of these malls is exclusive. Under our agreement between us and Rouse, Rouse is entitled to an agreed
upon revenue share over the four-year term of the agreement. In the event the net revenue share as defined in the agreement is
not attained for any measurement period, also as defined in the agreement, either party may terminate the agreement upon 90 days
prior written notice. Either party may also terminate the agreement due to a material breach which is not cured within 30 days
of written notice. Also, Rouse upon at least 60 days written notice to us prior to the end of the second contract year, may terminate
the agreement with respect to any participating property for any reason at the end of the second contract year. The agreement also
provides for Rouse to adjust the number of malls subject to the agreement from time-to-time based upon changes in its beneficial
ownership in the malls. 

Critical Accounting Policies  

Our discussion and analysis
of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of financial statements requires management
to make estimates and disclosures on the date of the financial statements. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates including,
but not limited to, those related to revenue recognition. We use authoritative pronouncements, historical experience and other
assumptions as the basis for making judgments. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We believe that the following
critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our financial statements. 

REVENUE RECOGNITION  
The Company recognizes revenue, for all revenue streams, when it is realized or realizable and estimable in accordance with ASC
605,   Revenue Recognition .  The Company will recognize revenue only when all of the following criteria have been
met: 

Persuasive evidence for an agreement exists;   

Service has been provided;   

The fee is fixed or determinable; and,   

Collection is reasonably assured.   

ACE MARKETING   Ace
Marketing's revenue is recognized when title and risk of loss transfers to the customer and the earnings process is complete. In
general, title passes to our customers upon the customer's receipt of the merchandise. Revenue is recognized on a gross basis since
Ace Marketing has the risks and rewards of ownership, latitude in selection of vendors and pricing, and bears all credit risk.
Advance payments made by customers are included in customer deposits. Ace Marketing records all shipping and handling fees billed
to customers as revenues and related costs as cost of goods sold, when incurred. Additional source of revenue, derived from emails/texts
directly to consumers are recognized under contractual arrangements. Revenue from this advertising method is recognized at the
time of service provided. 

MOBIQUITY NETWORKS  
Mobiquity Networks. Mobiquity has three avenues of income with our beacon platform, Bluetooth Push and Wi-Fi. Revenue is realized
with the signing of the advertising contract. The customer signs a contract directly with us for an advertising campaign with mutually
agreed upon term and is billed on the start date of the advertising campaign, which are normally in short duration periods. Revenue
is recognized the same way for the three mobile solutions. The first option to earn revenue with the beacon platform is for customers
to contract for advertising campaigns, on our platform, either directly through their own app or through various third party apps.
The second option to earn revenue is through a revenue share with advertising exchanges and networks that deliver advertising campaigns
to their customers based on our real-time location signal data. The third option would be through selling our historical data to
data management platform companies. 

ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL
ACCOUNTS. We are required to make judgments based on historical experience and future expectations, as to the realizability of
our accounts receivable. We make these assessments based on the following factors: (a) historical experience, (b) customer concentrations,
customer credit worthiness, (d) current economic conditions, and (e) changes in customer payment terms. 

ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK BASED
COMPENSATION. Stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date fair value of the award and is recognized as expense
over the requisite service period. The Company uses the Black-Sholes option-pricing model to determine fair value of the awards,
which involves certain subjective assumptions. These assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their
vested stock options before exercising them ( expected term ), the estimated volatility of the Company's common stock
price over the expected term ( volatility ) and the number of options for which vesting requirements will not be completed
( forfeitures ). Changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect estimates of fair value stock-based compensation,
and the related amount recognized on the consolidated statements of operations. 

Plan of Operation  

Our goal is
to enhance the shopper experience with retail customers by providing valuable and relevant content in real-time based on location.
We achieve this goal by providing our customers (such as retailers, brands, and the entertainment industry) with a highly-targeted
form of mobile marketing engagement. Our platform enables interaction and advertising based on time, location and personalization
to create the most effective campaigns and experiences possible, in a way that is not possible without our network. We connect
customers to brands in the retail space by increasing individual retail location app usage and driving foot traffic to such individual
retail locations. We have deployed our Mobiquity hardware solutions in Simon malls, Macerich malls, Preit malls and Rouse malls
in the United States. We are attempting to raise financing to support our operations and to expand our sales and marketing human
resource capability to focus on generating revenue over our network. Our sales and marketing team will be seeking to generate revenue
over our network through five primary verticals: 

Retailers, Brands and Apps relevant to the shopping experience.   

Shopping/Coupon related Apps with relevant offers.   

Entertainment Apps relevant to the shopper demographic.   

Advertising Networks and Exchanges serving location relevant ads.   

Data Analytic and Social Media Apps requesting real-time location based signal.   

We plan to expand
on our current footprint into the common areas of other mall operations as well as outside of the malls with additional synergistic
venues that will allow for cross marketing opportunities. Such venues include but are not limited to; stadiums, arenas, college
campuses, airports and retail chains. The purpose of this type of expansion will be to create a unified network that will allow
relevant beacon companies the opportunity to become part of our Mobiquity network. They may find it advantageous to become part
of our network, so they will have the ability to drive traffic into their stores. In the future, we may also build a private advertising
exchange system that would allow for programmatic buying where advertisers will be given permission to engage with shoppers through
our Mobiquity network. Additionally, we plan to add other mobile services and plug-ins such as; loyalty programs, indoor mapping,
security and mobile payments. 

We anticipate continuing
to rely on external financing from sales of our common stock to support our operations until cash flow from operations has a positive
impact on operations, although no assurances can be given in this regard. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

The following table sets
forth certain selected unaudited condensed statement of operations data for the periods indicated in dollars and as a percentage
of total net revenues. The following discussion relates to our results of operations for the periods noted and is not necessarily
indicative of the results expected for any other interim period or any future fiscal year. In addition, we note that the period-to-period
comparison may not be indicative of future performance. 

We generated revenues of
$530,573 in the third quarter of 2016 compared to $595,760 in the same period of the prior year. As our mall network has only recently
been expanded, at the current time, revenues from the use of our Mobiquity devices are consisted of $42,562 of our consolidated
revenues. In future reporting periods, we anticipate our revenues increasing in our Mobiquity Networks subsidiary due to the implementation
of our Mobi-Beacons and the data that can be derived therefrom and the expectation that advertisers will begin to utilize our mall
network. See  Plan of Operation.  

Cost of revenues was $375,441
or 70.8% of revenues in the third quarter of 2016 compared to $520,145 or 87.3% of revenues in the same fiscal period of the prior
year. Cost of revenues includes purchases and freight costs associated with the shipping of merchandise to our customers. The decrease
in cost of revenues of $144,704 in 2016 is related to volume and product mix of the products our customers purchased along with
the establishment of our Mobiquity devices. 

Gross profit was $155,132
for the third quarter of 2016 or 29.2% of net revenues compared to $75,615 in the same fiscal period of the prior year or 12.7%
of revenues. Gross profits will vary period-to-period depending upon a number of factors including the mix of items sold and the
volume of product sold. Also, it is our practice to pass freight costs on to our customers with low to no profit margin. As advertising
revenue from the use of our Mobiquity devices increases, it is expected that our margins will increase significantly. As our mall
network has only recently been expanded, at the current time, revenues from the use of our Mobiquity devices are not a material
portion of our consolidated revenues. 

Selling, general, and administrative
expenses were $2,074,282 for the third quarter of 2016 compared to $2,782,678 in the comparable period of the prior year, a decrease
of approximately $708,396. Reduction in such operating costs include payroll, and related expenses, non-cash stock based compensation
costs and professional fees. 

The net operating loss
for the third quarter of 2016 was $(1,919,150) as compared to $(2,707,063) for the comparable period of the prior year. The decrease
in operating loss is attributable to the reduction of non-cash stock based compensation, payroll and the related expenses along
with reducing professional fees. 

No benefit for income taxes
is provided for in the reported periods due to the full valuation allowance on the net deferred tax assets. Our ability to be profitable
in the future is dependent upon the successful introduction and usage of our proximity marketing services. 

Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 versus
Nine Months Ended 2015 

We generated revenues of
$1,644,295 in the first nine months of 2016 compared to $1,682,711 in the same period of the prior year. As our mall network has
only recently been constructed and is being expanded, at the current time, revenues from the use of our Mobiquity devices are consisted
of $113,494 of our consolidated revenues. In future reporting periods, we anticipate our revenues increasing in our Mobiquity Networks
subsidiary due to the implementation of our Mobi-Beacons and the data that can be derived therefrom and the expectation that advertisers
will begin to utilize our mall network. See  Plan of Operation.  

Cost of revenues was $1,237,631
or 75.3% of revenues in the first nine months of 2016 compared to $1,388,168 or 82.5% of revenues in the same fiscal period of
the prior year. Cost of revenues includes purchases and freight costs associated with the shipping of merchandise to our customers.
The decrease in cost of revenues of $150,537 in 2016 is related to volume and product mix of the products our customers purchased. 

Gross profit was $406,664
for the first nine months of 2016 or 24.7% of net revenues compared to $294,543 in the same fiscal period of the prior year or
17.5% of revenues. Gross profits will vary period-to-period depending upon a number of factors including the mix of items sold
and the volume of product sold. Also, it is our practice to pass freight costs on to our customers with low to no profit margin.
As advertising revenue from the use of our Mobiquity devices increases, it is expected that our margins will increase significantly.
As our mall network has only recently been expanded, at the current time, revenues from the use of our Mobiquity devices are not
a material portion of our consolidated revenues. 

Selling, general, and administrative
expenses were $6,945,037 for the first nine months of 2016 compared to $8,345,178 in the comparable period of the prior year, a
decrease of approximately $1,400,141. Such operating cost reductions include payroll and related expenses, professional fees and
non-cash stock based compensation. 

The net operating loss
for the first nine months of 2016 was $(6,538,373) as compared to $(8,050,635) for the comparable period of the prior year. The
decrease in operating loss is attributable to the focused effort in creating and streamlining the infrastructure required to move
forward with the mall network, to provide information technology support. 

No benefit for income taxes
is provided for in the reported periods due to the full valuation allowance on the net deferred tax assets. Our ability to be profitable
in the future is dependent upon the successful introduction and usage of our proximity marketing services. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources    

The Company had cash and
cash equivalents of $224,974 at September 30, 2016. Cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016
was $4,792,828 This resulted primarily from a net loss of $7,521,794 offset by stock based compensation of $512,949, depreciation
and amortization of $112,392, decrease in accounts receivable of $119,202 and a decrease in Inventory of $25,430 and an initial
derivative expense of $565,780 and an amortization of debt discounts of $1,878,002 and a change in derivatives of $2,201,696, decrease
in prepaid expenses and other assets of $574,108 and an increase of accounts payable and accrued expenses of $1,002,523. The Company
had an increase in investing activities of $257,575 with the purchase of equipment and expansion to the network platform in new
and existing mall and other locations. Cash flow from financing activities of $3,240,376 resulted from the proceeds from the issuance
of the Company's preferred stock $400,000 and use of the letter of credit and securing promissory notes totaling $2,840,376. 

We had cash and cash
equivalents of $2,055,697 at September 30, 2015. Cash used by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30,
2015 was $6,533,705. This resulted primarily from a net loss of $8,318,690 partially offset by a decreases in accounts
receivable of $53,774 and a decrease of $21,719 in prepaid expenses and other assets. Net cash of $5,221 was used by
investing activities to acquire property and equipment. Net cash was provided by financing activities totaling $6,945,000
resulting from $2,720,000 in the issuance of common stock and $4,225,000 in loan proceeds. 

Our Company commenced operations
in 1998 and was initially funded by our three founders, each of whom has made demand loans to our Company that have been repaid.
Since 1999, we have relied primarily on equity financing from outside investors to supplement our cash flow from operations. 

We anticipate
that our future liquidity requirements will arise from the need to finance our accounts receivable and inventories, hire additional
sales persons, capital expenditures and possible acquisitions. The primary sources of funding for such requirements will be cash
generated from operations, raising additional capital from the sale of equity or other securities and borrowings under debt facilities
which currently do not exist. We believe that we can generate sufficient cash flow from these sources to fund our operations for
at least the next twelve months. In the event we should need additional financing, we can provide no assurances that we will be
able to obtain financing on terms satisfactory to us, if at all. 

Recent Financings    

Since January
1, 2014, we have completed the various financing summarized below. 

(1) See  Loan Agreements and Related Party
Transactions  below. 

Loan Agreements and Related Party Transactions  

In November 2014, Carl
and Mary Ann Berg 2011 CRT Carl Berg Trustee loaned Mobiquity $1 million. In December 2014, Clyde J. Berg 2011 CRT Carl Berg Trustee
loaned Mobiquity $1 million. In December 2014, Sherry Berg-Zorn loaned Mobiquity $50,000. An additional $500,000 was loaned in
January 2015 by the Clyde J. Berg CRT. In February 2015, Berg   Berg Enterprises loaned $850,000 to Mobiquity. On July 31,
2015, the Company agreed on behalf of the aforementioned debt holders (in anticipation of the $500,000 loan referenced in the next
paragraph by Berg   Berg Enterprises) that the principal and accrued interest on these Notes aggregating $3.4 million are now
convertible at $.30 per share. Further, for every $1.00 principal and accrued interest thereon converted, the Note Holder will
receive a five-year warrant to purchase one share of common stock at an exercise price of $.50 per share. No other securities will
be issued to the Note Holders upon conversion of their securities. In August 2015, Berg   Berg Enterprises loaned an additional
$500,000 to us and received prepaid interest of 500,000 shares of common stock and warrants to purchase an additional 500,000 shares
at $.40 per share through August 31, 2017. The Berg   Berg Enterprise note is convertible at $.30 per share and is repayable
at the earlier of December 31, 2016 or the completion of an equity financing of at least $2.5 million. The Note Holder also has
the right to elect to convert the $500,000 note into equity securities of our company on the same terms as the last equity transaction
completed by us. In August 2015, Mr. and Mrs. Anthony Abbruzzese loaned $105,000 to us and received prepaid interest of 105,000
shares of common stock and warrants to purchase an additional 105,000 shares at $.40 per share through August 31, 2017. The Abbruzzese
note is convertible at $.30 per share and is repayable at the earlier of December 31, 2016 or the completion of an equity financing
of at least $2.5 million. The Note Holder also has the right to elect to convert the $105,000 note into equity securities of our
company on the same terms as the last equity transaction completed by us. 

In September and October
2015, the Company raised an additional $3,070,000 through the issuance of its unsecured debt on the same terms as set forth in
the preceding paragraph. The Company issued 3,070,000 shares of Common Stock and warrants to purchase a like number of shares as
prepaid interest. Of the $3,070,000, Berg   Berg Enterprises invested an additional $500,000. In December 2015, Berg  
Berg Enterprises also purchase 200,000 shares of the Company s preferred stock convertible into 10,000,000 shares of common
stock with anti-dilution protection for 2016. 

In April through June 2016,
the Company issued and sold 12% unsecured promissory notes in the principal amount of $1,025,000, convertible at $.20 per common
share. Upon conversion, the note holders would receive 100% warrant coverage, exercisable at $.20 per common share over a period
of five years with cashless exercise provisions. These notes automatically convert in the event at least $5 million is raised in
an equity financing. Prior to the mandatory conversion date, note holders have the option to convert the principal and accrued
interest also on the same terms as the mandatory conversion and the Company has the option to prepay. 

The Company raised $700,000
in the third quarter of 2016 from the sale of secured promissory notes in the principal amount of $700,000 from six accredited
investors. Each Note was scheduled to be repaid on October 31, 2016, but payment was not made. In lieu of interest on the Note,
4,900,000 restricted shares of common stock were issued to the Note Holders. At the option of the Note Holder, each Note shall
be convertible at the lower of $.20 per common share or into securities on the same terms of the next completed equity offering
of at least $10 million in gross proceeds. In the event the Note is converted into common stock,100% warrant conversion shall be
provided to the Note Holder for each share of common stock issued upon conversion. These warrants will have a term of three years
and shall be exercisable at $.20 per common share. Prior to this offering, Thomas Arnost, Executive Chairman, has a secured interest
in the amount of $322,000 in the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries. Mr. Arnost has agreed that the investors in this offering
will have a pari passu first secured interest with Mr. Arnost in all assets of the Company and its subsidiaries. 

Assignment of Secured Promissory Note  

In December 2013, Thomas
Arnost, a director of Mobiquity, purchased from TCA Global Credit Master Fund, the Company s outstanding convertible promissory
note in the amount of $350,000. Subsequently Mr. Arnost and the Company agreed to fix the conversion price of the note at $.30
per share, extend the due date of the Note to June 12, 2014, which was subsequently extended to December 22, 2014 and again extended
to December 31, 2015, subject to Mr. Arnost s right to call the note at any time in his sole discretion, and increase the
interest rate to 15% per annum. In December 2015, Mr. Arnost extended the due date of the note to December 31, 2016 and the Company
agreed to lower the conversion price to $.20 per share. The Company has the right to prepay the note, subject to Mr. Arnost s
right of conversion. 

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT
MARKET RISK  

Market risk is the
risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and
commodity prices. Our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk associated with our short term money market investments.
The Company does not have any financial instruments held for trading or other speculative purposes and does not invest in derivative
financial instruments, interest rate swaps or other investments that alter interest rate exposure. The Company does not have any
credit facilities with variable interest rates. 

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES  

We maintain disclosure
controls and procedures, which are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated
to our management, including our CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. 

Under the supervision
and with the participation of our management, including our CEO and CFO, an evaluation was performed on the effectiveness of the
design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report. Based
on that evaluation, our management, including our CEO and CFO, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective
as of the end of the period covered by this report. 

There were no changes
in the Company's internal controls over financial reporting during the most recently completed fiscal quarter that have materially
affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the Company's internal control over financial reporting.

ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.  

As of the
filing date of this Form 10-Q, we are not a party to any pending legal proceedings. 

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS  

As a Smaller Reporting
Company, as defined Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act and in item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K, we are electing scaled disclosure reporting
