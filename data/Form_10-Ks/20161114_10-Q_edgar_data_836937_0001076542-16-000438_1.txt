CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING
FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  

The statements contained in this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q that are not historical fact are forward-looking statements (as such term is defined in the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995), within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.  The forward-looking statements contained herein are based on current expectations
that involve a number of risks and uncertainties.  These statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology
such as  believes,   expects,   may,   will,   should,  or  anticipates, 
or the negative thereof or other variations thereon or comparable terminology, or by discussions of strategy that involve risks
and uncertainties.  Investors are cautioned that these forward-looking statements that are not historical facts are only
predictions.  No assurances can be given that the future results indicated, whether expressed or implied, will be achieved.
Because of the number and range of assumptions underlying the Company s projections and forward-looking statements, many
of which are subject to significant uncertainties and contingencies that are beyond the reasonable control of the Company, some
of the assumptions inevitably will not materialize, and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur subsequent to the date
of this report.  These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and the Company assumes no obligation
to update this information.  Therefore, the actual experience of the Company and the results achieved during the period covered
by any particular projections or forward-looking statements may differ substantially from those projected.  The inclusion
of projections and other forward-looking statements should not be regarded as a representation by the Company or any other person
that these estimates and projections will be realized, and actual results may vary materially.  There can be no assurance
that any of these expectations will be realized or that any of the forward-looking statements contained herein will prove to be
accurate.

STATEMENTS  

NOTE 1   BUSINESS, BASIS OF PRESENTATION
AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES; GOING CONCERN  

Business, Operations and Organization  

Esio Water   Beverage Development Corp.
was incorporated in Nevada in June 1988 as Richard Barrie Fragrances, Inc. Over the years, the Company changed its name several
times, most recently from Tempco, Inc. to Esio Water   Beverage Development Corp. Esio Water   Beverage Development Corp.
and its wholly-owned subsidiaries Net Edge Devices, LLC, an Arizona Limited Liability Company, and iMetabolic Corp, ( IMET )
a Nevada Corporation are hereinafter collectively referred to as the  Company.  

On March 16, 2015, the Company issued to the
IMET 16 shareholders of record an aggregate of 60,000,000 shares, or 76.2% of the Company s common stock. Prior to the close
of the reverse merger, IMET had 10,000,000 common shares outstanding immediately prior to the merger and net liabilities of $20,500.
Prior to closing, the predecessor company had 18,566,636 shares outstanding and net assets of $89,615, of which $85,378 was cash
and $4,237 was non-cash. As a result of the closing of this transaction, IMET is now a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company
and its business and operations represent those of the Company 

For accounting purposes, this transaction
is being accounted for as a reverse merger and has been treated as a recapitalization of the Company with IMET considered the
accounting acquirer, and the financial statements of the accounting acquirer become the financial statements of the registrant.
This transaction is hereinafter referred to as the  Reverse Merger.  The Company did not recognize goodwill or any
intangible assets in connection with the transaction. The 60,000,000 common shares issued to the shareholders of IMET in conjunction
with the share exchange transaction have been presented as outstanding for all periods. 

On December 30, 2015, the Company filed Articles
of Merger (the  Merger ) with the Nevada Secretary of State. The Merger was between the Company and our wholly-owned
subsidiary, UPD Holding Corp. (the  Subsidiary ). Pursuant to Nevada corporate law, we amended our Articles of Incorporation
by the Merger to change our name to UPD Holding Corp. We believe our new name more properly indicates our current lines of business
because the Company has not been in the water and beverage industry since 2012.  UPD  stands for United Product Development. 

Beneficial Conversion Feature  

 The intrinsic value of a beneficial conversion feature inherent to
a convertible note payable, which is not bifurcated and accounted for separately from the convertible note payable and may not
be settled in cash upon conversion, is treated as a discount to the convertible note payable. This discount is amortized over
the period from the date of issuance to the date the note is due using the effective interest method. If the note payable is retired
prior to the end of its contractual term, the unamortized discount is expensed in the period of retirement to interest expense.
In general, the beneficial conversion feature is measured by comparing the effective conversion price, after considering the relative
fair value of detachable instruments included in the financing transaction, if any, to the fair value of the common shares at
the commitment date to be received upon conversion. 

Going Concern  

The Company s unaudited interim consolidated
financial statements are prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America applicable to
a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business.
The Company has not yet established an ongoing source of revenue sufficient to cover its operating costs and allow it to continue
as a going concern.  The ability of the Company to continue as a going concern is dependent on the Company obtaining
adequate capital to fund operating losses until it becomes profitable.  If the Company is unable to obtain adequate
capital, it could be forced to cease operations. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company s ability to continue
as a going concern.

NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

NOTE 1   BUSINESS, BASIS OF PRESENTATION
AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES; GOING CONCERN (Continued)  

Going Concern (Continued)  

In order to continue as a going concern, the
Company will need, among other things, additional capital resources. Management s plans to obtain such resources for the
Company include (i) obtaining capital from management and significant stockholders sufficient to meet its minimal operating expenses;
(ii) obtaining funding from outside sources through the sale of its debt and/or equity securities; and (iii) completing a merger
with or acquisition of an existing operating company. However, management cannot provide any assurances that the Company will
be successful in accomplishing any of its plans. 

Unaudited Interim Financial Statements  

The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated
financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
( GAAP ), pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and are unaudited. Accordingly,
they do not include all the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management,
all adjustments (which include only normal recurring adjustments) necessary for a fair presentation of the results for the interim
periods presented have been made. The results for the three month period ended September 30, 2016, may not be indicative of the
results for the entire year. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 13, 2016. 

The preparation of the Company s unaudited
interim consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting
periods. Management makes these estimates using the best information available at the time the estimates are made; however, actual
results could differ materially from these estimates. 

NOTE 2   RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS  

For the three months ended September 30, 2016,
the President has provided the Company rent at no charge. 

On September 1, 2016, through unanimous approval
by its Board, the Company opened an escrow to initiate a proposed funding arrangement for future capital demands. The related
party portion of this escrow consists of a convertible note which matures March 1, 2017. If not repaid by maturity, the note is
convertible into 1,200,000 common shares at $0.0125 per share. If share conversion is not elected, then interest will be due at
the face value of the original note of $15,000. 

The Company analyzed the conversion option
in the notes for derivative accounting treatment under ASC Topic 815,   Derivatives and Hedging   and determined
that the instrument does not qualify for derivative accounting. 

The Company therefore performed an analysis
to determine if the conversion option was subject to a beneficial conversion feature and determined that the instrument does have
a beneficial conversion feature equivalent. The intrinsic value of a beneficial conversion feature inherent to a convertible note
payable, which is not bifurcated and accounted for separately from the convertible note payable and may not be settled in cash
upon conversion, is treated as a discount to the convertible note payable. This discount is amortized over the period from the
date of issuance to the date the note is due using the effective interest method. If the note payable is retired prior to the
end of its contractual term, the unamortized discount is expensed in the period of retirement to interest expense. In general,
the beneficial conversion feature is measured by comparing the effective conversion price, after considering the relative fair
value of detachable instruments included in the financing transaction, if any, to the fair value of the common shares at the commitment
date to be received upon conversion.

March 1, 2017. If not repaid by maturity, the note is convertible into 4,000,000 common shares at $0.0125 per share. If share
conversion is not elected, then interest will be due at the face value of the original note of $50,000. 

The Company analyzed the conversion option

       Management s
    Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations    

The following management discussion and
analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited interim consolidated
financial statements and related notes which are included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, and with our audited
financial statements included in our Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission on October 13, 2016.  

Overview  

Acquisition of iMetabolic Corp.  

On December 31 ,  2014, we entered into
an Agreement of Share Exchange and Plan of Reorganization (the  Share Exchange Agreement ) and consummated a share
exchange (the  Share Exchange ) with iMetabolic Corp. ( IMET ), a Nevada corporation.  The Effective
Date of the transaction was March 16, 2015 (the  Effective Date ) and resulted in the acquisition of IMET (the
 Acquisition ).  Pursuant to the terms of the Share Exchange Agreement, we acquired all of the outstanding capital
stock of IMET from the 16 IMET shareholders for an aggregate of 60,000,000 shares, or 76.2% of the Company s common stock. 

As a result of the Share Exchange Agreement,
the IMET shareholders transferred all their interest in IMET to the Company and, as a result, IMET became a wholly owned subsidiary
of the Company. 

As a further condition of the Share Exchange
Agreement, the then current officers of the Company resigned on March 16, 2015 and Mark W. Conte was appointed President, CEO
and a director of the Company, Kevin J. Pikero as CFO, Treasurer, Secretary, and a director and Andrew D. Smith as a director. 

The IMET acquisition is discussed more fully
in the Form 8-K we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) on March 20, 2015. Included as an exhibit
to that Form 8-K is a copy of the Share Exchange Agreement. 

Name Change  

On December 30, 2015, the Company filed Articles
of Merger (the  Merger ) with the Nevada Secretary of State. The Merger was between the Company and our wholly-owned
subsidiary, UPD Holding Corp. (the  Subsidiary ). Pursuant to Nevada corporate law, we amended our Articles of Incorporation
by the Merger to change our name to UPD Holding Corp. We believe our new name more properly indicates our current lines of business
because the Company has not been in the water and beverage industry since 2012.  UPD  stands for United Product Development
which is the name of one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries. We will be applying to FINRA to have our common stock traded under
the new name and for a new trading symbol as soon as possible. 

IMET Products  

IMET was  formed on July 1, 2013 for
the purpose of marketing products under the brand  iMetabolic  that were previously being sold by the brand s
licensor, International Metabolic Institute LLC ( IMI ), as well as to develop new products that would be specifically
suited for a national marketing plan.  IMI transferred certain product and trademark rights to IMET on July 22, 2013 (the
 License ).  The License was amended on March 16, 2015 to clarify IMET s and IMI s future rights.
See   IMET License Agreement   below. The mission of IMET is to build upon preexisting brand equity and the expert
copy and other literature authored by Dr. Kent Sasse as applied to the national launch of products with extraordinary profitability
and novel market appeal. 

A pre-existing line of five (5) soft-bound
books authored by the founder of the iMetabolic brand, Dr. Kent Sasse, is available for sale under the brand  A Sasse Guide 
on both the www.imetabolic.com and www.sasseguide.com websites. These books are titled: (i) Life-Changing Weight Loss; (ii) Doctor s
Orders   101 Medically Proven Tips for Losing Weight; (iii) Outpatient Weight Loss Surgery   Safe and Successful Weight
Loss with Modern Bariatric Surgery; (iv) Weight-Loss Surgery   Which One is Right for You?; and (v) After Weight Loss Surgery.
 Pursuant to the terms of the License Amendment these books will continue to be the property of and sold by IMI.

but not limited to, proprietary blend meal replacements, dietary specialty foods, and nutraceuticals, have been sold by IMI at
IMI s company store / doctor s office pursuant to a reservation of rights in the License and online at www.imetabolic.com.
 An amendment to the License provides that after IMI has sold its entire inventory existing or ordered on March 16, 2015,
IMI will not sell any more products which may be deemed to compete with IMET s products. 

IMET has developed the following four new
products to be marketed: 

A new product concept
    to be marketed under the name iMetabolic  Catalyst , which is intended to provide the essential vitamins and plant
    compounds that are necessary to aid in metabolic functions. Such ingredients include broad spectrum B-Complex Vitamins, as
    well as Green Tea Extract and Resveratrol (polyphenols).   

A new product concept to be marketed under the name iMetabolic
     Mini-Meal , which is intended to provide the essential whey protein isolate intake for a person who is on a four-to-five
    meal per day diet or needs a snack that will act as a low-calorie, high nutritional value appetite suppressant.   

A new product concept to be marketed under the name iMetabolic
     Multi-Pro , which is intended to provide the essential broad-spectrum vitamins and minerals that are typically
    marketed as  multi-vitamin supplements;  however, this product is specifically tailored to dovetail with the  Catalyst 
    so as to virtually eliminate the duplicate consumption of overlapping ingredients that routinely plagues supplement users.   

A new product concept to be marketed under the name iMetabolic
     BittX.  This product is premised on the scientific theory that modern horticulture and food producers have systematically
    promoted foods that are sweet or lack bitterness, which is the flavor typically associated with foods that have the greatest
    health benefits. Accordingly, this product is intended to reform the body s disposition toward bitter foods in a subtle,
    inoffensive way.   

We believe IMET s current four products
can be successfully marketed through the use of infomercials and have made progress with identifying a creator and producer for
an infomercial to sell the products. Additionally, the Company is building a new website with e-commerce capabilities and plans
to use SEO (search engine optimization), social media, e-mail marketing, and PPC (pay for click) venues as well to drive the business.
However, there is no assurance IMET s infomercial marketing strategy will be successful. 

We have also investigated using regional distributors
for our products and may use them in the future, on a region by region basis as working capital permits. The Company has identified
some prospects and is working to move those prospects forward. 

We believe IMET has located experienced nutrition
and supplemental manufacturers who have indicated an interest and an ability to manufacture IMET s initial four products.
 We have received written cost quotations from these manufactures and production timetables, as well. The Company is in the
process of evaluating the best venue to move forward. 

The Company was hopeful that it was going
to be able to secure its new website, marketing program, and product manufacturing schedules to begin marketing our products within
six months of the closing of the Exchange. In reality, these details are taking more time to prepare and thus the Company is now
targeting some initial product and marketing launches in 2016   2017. 

IMET License Agreement  

IMET entered into a license with IMI, a Nevada
limited liability company, on July 22, 2013 (the  License ).  In the License, IMI granted to IMET the exclusive
licenses to use, produce, market and sell: (i) five marks (the  Licensed Marks ); (ii) four books written by Dr. Sasse
(the  Licensed Content ); and (iii) approximately 150 supplements and foods created and previously sold by IMI (the
 Licensed Articles ).  The Licensed Marks include the trademark  iMetabolic  the domain name  www.imetabolic.com 
the trademark  iMetabolic Catalyst  and a trademark and domain name related to Dr. Sasse.  The License had a
term of three years, commencing on July 1, 2013 (the  Initial Term ), with a provision stating that the term of the
License would automatically become perpetual if IMET sold $3.0 Million of Licensed Content or Licensed Articles before July 1,
2016. IMET is to bear all expenses of the creation and sale of the Licensed Content and Licensed Articles.  The License contains
other provisions standard in licenses. 

Table of Contents    

In conjunction with closing the Exchange,
on March 16, 2015 IMI and IMET executed an amendment to the License (the  License Amendment ). In the License Amendment:
(i) IMET returned to IMI all rights to the Licensed Content (Dr. Sasse s books), the two Dr. Sasse Licensed Marks and all
revenues from the sale of the Licensed Articles since July 1, 2013 through the date of closing the Exchange; (ii) the Initial
Term was increased from three to four years; (iii) a provision was added stating that after the closing of the Exchange, IMI shall
not sell any more of the Licensed Articles or any other products IMET deems as competing with the Licensed Articles; (iv) a provision
was added stating that upon reaching the $3.0 Million milestone, IMI shall transfer and or assign to IMET the three remaining
Licensed Marks; and (v) a provision was added stating that upon completion of the Initial Term, IMET shall have all rights, obligations,
and burdens of enforcing the Licensed Marks. 

During 2014, the
trademark  iMetabolic  expired at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.  In conjunction with the closing of the
Exchange, IMI re-applied for that trademark and the service mark  iMetabolic  on December 16, 2014.  In May 2015,
we engaged Drinker, Biddle   Reath, LLP to correspond with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office regarding our application. 
As of April 19, 2016, the Company was awarded Registration Number 4,941,531 in the Class 5 Category. Additionally, on September
6, 2016, the Company was awarded Registration Number 5,034,186 in the Class 44 Category. At this juncture, the Company has succeeded
in reclaiming both marks for consideration in its future operations. 

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  

General and Administrative Expenses  

For the three months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015, we have recorded operating expenses of $13,015 and $12,592, respectively, consisting primarily of general and administrative
expenses along with professional fees all of which are associated with maintaining the Company as a publicly traded entity. 

Net Loss  

For the three months ended September 30, 2016
and 2015, we have recorded a net loss of $23,848 and $12,582, respectively. 

Liquidity and Capital Resources   

At September 30, 2016, the Company does not
currently engage in any business activities that generate cash flow. As of September 30, 2016, the Company had current assets
of $76,076, current liabilities of $106,336, and a working capital deficit of $30,260. 

Over the next twelve months, we have estimated
that in order to maintain reporting company status as defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, we will require
cash for general and administrative expenses and professional fees, which include accounting, legal and other professional fees,
as well as filing fees. We believe we will be able to meet these costs through the use of existing cash and cash equivalents or
additional amounts, as necessary, to be loaned by or invested in us by our stockholders, management or other investors. However,
no assurance can be given that we will be able to raise additional capital, when needed or at all, or that such capital, if available,
will be on acceptable terms. In the absence of obtaining additional financing, we may be unable to fund our operations. As a result,
the Company s independent registered public accounting firm has issued going concern opinion on the consolidated financial
statements of the Company for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016. 

Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  

During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we did not engage
in any off-balance sheet arrangements set forth in Item 303(a) (4) of Regulation S-K.  

Table of Contents    

Critical Accounting Policies   

Our consolidated financial statements have
been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which require us to
make estimates and judgments that significantly affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and
related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements.  Note 1 ,   Business,
Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies   in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained
in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission on October 13, 2016, describes our significant accounting policies which are reviewed by management on a regular basis.  

New Accounting Pronouncements  

Management does not believe that any recently
issued, but not yet effective accounting pronouncements, if adopted, would have a material effect on the accompanying financial
statements. 

Item
    3.   
       Quantitative
    and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk    

Our exposure to market risks is limited to
changes in interest rates. We do not use derivative financial instruments as part of an overall strategy to manage market risk.
We have no debt outstanding nor do we have any investment in debt instruments other than highly liquid short-term investments.
Accordingly, we consider our interest rate risk exposure to be insignificant at this time. 

Item
    4.   
       Controls
    and Procedures    

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  

Under the supervision and with the participation
of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design
and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934)
as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief
Financial Officer concluded that, as of September 30, 2016, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the
size and nature of the existing business operation. Given the size of our current operation and existing personnel, the opportunity
to implement internal control procedures that segregate accounting duties and responsibilities is limited. Until the organization
can increase in size to warrant an increase in personnel, formal internal control procedure will not be implemented until they
can be effectively executed and monitored. As a result of the size of the current organization, there will not be significant
levels of supervision, review, independent directors nor formal audit committee. 

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting  

During the quarter ended September 30, 2016,
there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under
the Exchange Act) that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial
reporting.

them (the  Notes ).  The Notes are convertible on March 1, 2017 at $0.0125 per share. At September 30, 2016,
the Company had a total of 5,200,000 shares reserved for issuance upon conversion of the Notes. $15,000 of the $65,000 private
