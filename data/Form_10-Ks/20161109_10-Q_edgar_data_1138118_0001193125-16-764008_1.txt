1.  
  Basis of Presentation       Readers of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (Quarterly Report)
should refer to the audited financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements of CBRE Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (which may be referred to in these financial statements as the  Company,   we, 
 us  and  our ), for the year ended December 31, 2015, which are included in our 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K (2015 Annual Report), filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and also available on
our website ( www.cbre.com ), since we have omitted from this Quarterly Report certain footnote disclosures which would substantially duplicate those contained in such audited financial statements. You should also refer to Note 2, Significant
Accounting Policies, in the notes to consolidated financial statements in our 2015 Annual Report for further discussion of our significant accounting policies and estimates.  
 The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the rules applicable to quarterly reports on Form
10-Q and include all information and footnotes required for interim financial statement presentation, but do not include all disclosures required under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) for annual financial
statements. In our opinion, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments, except as otherwise noted) considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP
requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future events. These estimates and the underlying assumptions affect the amounts of assets and liabilities reported, and reported amounts of revenue and expenses. Such estimates include the value
of goodwill, intangibles and other long-lived assets, real estate assets, accounts receivable, investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries and assumptions used in the calculation of income taxes, retirement and other post-employment benefits, among
others. These estimates and assumptions are based on our best judgment. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis using historical experience and other factors, including consideration of the current economic environment, and
adjust such estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstances dictate. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from these estimates. Changes in these estimates resulting
from continuing changes in the economic environment will be reflected in the financial statements in future periods. Certain reclassifications have been made to the 2015 financial statements to conform with the 2016 presentation.  
 The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations
to be expected for the year ending December 31, 2016.

  New Accounting Pronouncements         Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
     In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-09,
  Compensation Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.   This ASU is intended to improve the accounting for share-based payment transactions as part of the FASB s
simplification initiative. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted. We elected to early adopt the provisions of ASU 2016-09 during the third
quarter of 2016, which required us to reflect any adjustments as of January 1, 2016, the beginning of the annual period that includes the interim period of adoption. The adoption of this ASU did not have a material impact on our consolidated
financial statements.    ASU 2016-09 permits companies to make an accounting policy election to either estimate forfeitures on share-based
payment awards, as previously required, or to recognize forfeitures as they occur. We elected to change our accounting policy to recognize forfeitures when they occur and the impact of this change in accounting policy has been recorded as a $3.3
million cumulative effect adjustment to accumulated earnings as  
      8  

CBRE GROUP, INC.  
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued)  
 (Unaudited)      
  
of January 1, 2016. Additionally, this ASU requires the recognition of excess tax benefits and deficiencies as income tax benefits or expenses in the income statement rather than to
additional paid-in capital, which has been applied on a prospective basis to settlements of share-based payment awards occurring on or after January 1, 2016. ASU 2016-09 also requires that excess tax benefits be presented as operating
activities on the statement of cash flows, which we have elected to apply on a prospective basis. The remaining provisions of ASU 2016-09 did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.  
   Recent Accounting Pronouncements Pending Adoption    
 The FASB has recently issued four ASUs related to revenue recognition, all of which become effective for the Company on January 1,
2018. The ASUs issued are: (1) in May 2014, ASU 2014-09,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606);   (2) in March 2016, ASU 2016-08,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Principal versus Agent
Considerations (Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net);   (3) in April 2016, ASU 2016-10,   Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing;   and (4) in May 2016, ASU 2016-12,
  Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-scope Improvements and Practical Expedients.     ASU 2014-09 requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the
transfer of promised goods or services to customers and will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance under GAAP. This ASU permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. We are evaluating the
effect that ASU 2014-09 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. We have not yet selected a transition method nor have we determined the effect of this ASU on our ongoing financial reporting. ASU 2016-08 clarifies
the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations. We are evaluating the effect that ASU 2016-08 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. ASU 2016-10 clarifies guidance related to identifying
performance obligations and licensing implementation guidance contained in ASU 2014-09. ASU 2016-12 clarifies guidance in certain narrow areas and adds some practical expedients. We do not believe the application of ASU 2016-10 and ASU 2016-12
will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.    In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU
2016-01,   Financial Instruments Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.   This ASU will significantly change the income statement impact of equity investments
and the recognition of changes in fair value of financial liabilities when the fair value option is elected. This ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is
not permitted, except for the provisions related to the recognition of changes in fair value of financial liabilities when the fair value option is elected. We do not believe the adoption of ASU 2016-01 will have a material impact on our
consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.    In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02,  Leases (Topic
842).  This ASU requires lessees to recognize most leases on-balance sheet and mandates a modified retrospective transition method for all entities. This ASU is effective for annual periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2018. We are evaluating the effect that ASU 2016-02 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.   In
March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-05,   Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Effect of Derivative Contract Novations on Existing Hedge Accounting Relationships.   This ASU clarifies that a change in one of the parties to a
derivative contract (through novation) that is part of a hedge accounting relationship does not, by itself, require designation of that relationship, as long as all other hedge accounting criteria continue to be met. This ASU is effective for annual
and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. We do not believe the adoption of ASU 2016-05 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.

 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued)  
 (Unaudited)      
  In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-07,   Investments Equity Method and Joint
Ventures (Topic 323): Simplifying the Transition to the Equity Method of Accounting.     This ASU eliminates the requirement for an investor to retroactively apply the equity method when its increase in ownership interest (or
degree of influence) in an investee triggers equity method accounting. ASU 2016-07 should be applied prospectively upon its effective date to increases in the level of ownership interest or degree of influence that result in the adoption of the
equity method. This ASU is effective for all entities for interim and annual periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, with early application permitted. We do not believe the application of ASU 2016-07 will have a material impact on
our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.    In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13,   Financial
Instruments Credit Losses (Topic 326):     Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.     This ASU is intended to improve financial reporting by requiring timelier recording of credit losses on loans
and other financial instruments held by financial institutions and other organizations. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted. We are
evaluating the effect that ASU 2016-13 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.    In August 2016, the
FASB issued ASU 2016-15,   Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.     This ASU addresses eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing
diversity in practice. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those years, with early adoption permitted. We are evaluating the effect that ASU 2016-15 will have on our consolidated
financial statements and related disclosures.

  Acquisition of Global Workplace Solutions       On September 1, 2015, CBRE, Inc., our
wholly-owned subsidiary, pursuant to a Stock and Asset Purchase Agreement with Johnson Controls, Inc. (JCI), acquired JCI s Global Workplace Solutions business (we refer to this transaction as the GWS Acquisition). The acquired GWS
business is a market-leading provider of integrated facilities management solutions for major occupiers of commercial real estate and has significant operations around the world. The purchase price was $1.475 billion, paid in cash, plus adjustments
totaling $46.5 million for working capital and other items.    The purchase accounting for the GWS Acquisition, including assignment of
goodwill to our reporting units, has been finalized. There were no significant adjustments to the purchase price allocation recorded during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The excess purchase price over the estimated fair value of net
assets acquired of $858 million has been recorded to goodwill, with $406 million assigned to our Americas segment, $438 million assigned to our EMEA segment and $14 million assigned to our Asia Pacific segment. The goodwill arising from the GWS
Acquisition consists largely of the synergies and economies of scale expected from combining the operations acquired from JCI with our business. Of the $858 million of goodwill recorded in connection with the GWS Acquisition, approximately $435
million is deductible for tax purposes.   Unaudited pro forma results, assuming the GWS Acquisition had occurred as of January 1, 2015 for
purposes of the 2015 pro forma disclosures, are presented below. They include certain adjustments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, including $17.9 million and $53.8 million, respectively, of increased amortization expense as a
result of intangible assets acquired in the GWS Acquisition, $9.7 million and $30.8 million, respectively, of additional interest expense as a result of debt incurred to finance the GWS Acquisition, the removal of $16.9 million and $24.9 million,
respectively, of direct costs incurred by us related to the GWS Acquisition, net of the tax impact during the period of these pro forma adjustments. These pro forma results have

indicative of future operating results (dollars in thousands, except share data):      

4.  
  Variable Interest Entities (VIEs)       We hold variable interests in certain variable
interest entities (VIEs) in our Global Investment Management and Development Services segments which are not consolidated as it was determined that we are not the primary beneficiary. Our involvement with these entities is in the form of equity
co-investments and fee arrangements.    As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, our maximum exposure to loss related to the VIEs
which are not consolidated was as follows (dollars in thousands):      

5.  
  Fair Value Measurements       The   Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures  
topic (Topic 820) of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the
asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Topic 820 also establishes a three-level fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value. This hierarchy requires entities
to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows:      

Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.        

Level 2 Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in
markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data.    
      11  

CBRE GROUP, INC.  
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued)  
 (Unaudited)      

Level 3 Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. This includes certain pricing models, discounted cash flow
methodologies and similar techniques that use significant unobservable inputs.      There were no significant transfers in or
out of Level 1 and Level 2 during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015. There have been no significant changes to the valuation techniques and inputs used to develop the recurring fair value measurements from those
disclosed in our 2015 Annual Report.    The following tables present the fair value of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a
recurring basis as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 (dollars in thousands):

   The following table provides additional information about fair value measurements for the Level 3 assets for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 (dollars in thousands):      
   There were no significant non-recurring fair value measurements recorded during the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2016 and 2015.    FASB ASC Topic 825,   Financial Instruments   requires disclosure of fair value
information about financial instruments, whether or not recognized in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Our financial instruments are as follows:      

Cash and Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash  These balances include cash and cash equivalents as well as restricted cash with maturities of less than three months. The carrying amount approximates fair
value due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.        

Receivables, less Allowance for Doubtful Accounts  Due to their short-term nature, fair value approximates carrying value.    
      13  

CBRE GROUP, INC.  
 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   (Continued)  
 (Unaudited)      

Warehouse Receivables  These balances are carried at fair value based on market prices at the balance sheet date.        

Trading and   Available for Sale Securities  These investments are carried at their fair value.        

Foreign Currency Exchange Forward Contracts  These assets and liabilities are carried at their fair value as calculated by using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on
the expected cash flows of each derivative.        

Securities Sold, not yet Purchased  These liabilities are carried at their fair value.        

Short-Term Borrowings  The majority of this balance represents outstanding amounts under our warehouse lines of credit of our wholly-owned subsidiary, CBRE Capital Markets, Inc. (CBRE Capital Markets), and
our revolving credit facility. Due to the short-term nature and variable interest rates of these instruments, fair value approximates carrying value (see Note 7).    

Interest Rate Swaps  These liabilities are carried at their fair value as calculated by using widely-accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each
derivative.

are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Our investment ownership percentages in equity method investments vary, generally ranging up to 5.0% in our Global Investment Management segment, up to 10.0% in our Development Services
segment, and up to 50% in our other business segments.    Combined condensed financial information for the entities actually accounted for
using the equity method is as follows (dollars in thousands):

  On January 9, 2015, CBRE Services, Inc. (CBRE), our wholly-owned subsidiary, entered into an
amended and restated credit agreement (the 2015 Credit Agreement) with a syndicate of banks jointly led by Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner   Smith Incorporated, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Credit Suisse AG. On March 21, 2016, we executed an
amendment to the 2015 Credit Agreement which, among other things, extended the maturity on our revolving credit facility to March 2021 and increased the borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility by $200.0 million.  
 The 2015 Credit Agreement is an unsecured credit facility that is jointly and severally guaranteed by us and substantially all of our material
domestic subsidiaries. As of September 30, 2016, the 2015 Credit Agreement provided for the following: (1) a $2.8 billion revolving credit facility, which includes the capacity to obtain letters of credit and swingline loans and matures on March 21,
2021; (2) a $500.0 million tranche A term loan facility requiring quarterly principal payments, which began on June 30, 2015 and continue through maturity on January 9, 2020; (3) a $270.0 million tranche B-1 term loan facility requiring quarterly
principal payments, which began on December 31, 2015 and continue through maturity on September 3, 2020; and (4) a $130.0 million tranche  B-2  term loan facility requiring quarterly principal payments, which
began on December 31, 2015 and continue through maturity on September 3, 2022.    Our 2015 Credit Agreement and the indentures governing our
5.00% senior notes, 4.875% senior notes and 5.25% senior notes contain restrictive covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends or make distributions to stockholders, repurchase capital stock
or debt, make investments, sell assets or subsidiary stock, create or permit liens on assets, engage in transactions with affiliates, enter into sale/leaseback transactions, issue subsidiary equity and enter into consolidations or mergers. Our 2015
Credit Agreement also requires us to maintain a minimum coverage ratio of EBITDA (as defined in the 2015 Credit Agreement) to total interest expense of 2.00x and a maximum leverage ratio of total debt less available cash to EBITDA (as defined in the
2015 Credit Agreement) of 4.25x as of the end of each fiscal quarter. On this basis, our coverage ratio of EBITDA to total interest expense was 12.09x for the trailing twelve months ended September 30, 2016, and our leverage ratio of total debt less
available cash to EBITDA was 1.57x as of September 30, 2016.    On August 13, 2015, CBRE issued $600.0 million in aggregate principal amount
of 4.875% senior notes due March 1, 2026 at a price equal to 99.24% of their face value. The 4.875% senior notes are unsecured obligations of CBRE, senior to all of its current and future subordinated indebtedness, but effectively subordinated to
all of its current and future secured indebtedness. The 4.875% senior notes are jointly and severally guaranteed on a senior basis by us and each domestic subsidiary of CBRE that guarantees our 2015 Credit Agreement. Interest accrues at a rate
of 4.875% per year and is payable semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1, with the first interest payment made on March 1, 2016. The amount of the 4.875% senior notes, net of unamortized discount and unamortized debt issuance
costs, included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets was $591.0 million and $590.5 million at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively.  
   Short-Term Borrowings    
  Revolving Credit Facility   
 As of September 30, 2016, we had $83.0 million of revolving credit facility principal outstanding under the 2015 Credit Agreement with a
weighted average annual interest rate of 3.5% and which was included in short-term borrowings in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. As of September 30, 2016, letters of credit totaling $2.0 million were outstanding under the revolving
credit facility. These letters of credit, which reduce the amount we may borrow under the revolving credit facility, were primarily issued in the ordinary course of business. As of December 31, 2015, no amounts were outstanding under our revolving
credit facility other than letters of credit totaling $2.0 million.

   Warehouse Lines of Credit   
 CBRE Capital Markets has warehouse lines of credit with third-party lenders for the purpose of funding mortgage loans that will be resold, and
a funding arrangement with Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) for the purpose of selling a percentage of certain closed multifamily loans to Fannie Mae. These warehouse lines are recourse only to CBRE Capital Markets and are secured
by our related warehouse receivables.    During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we had a maximum of $1.9 billion of warehouse
lines of credit principal outstanding. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had $1.6 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively, of warehouse lines of credit principal outstanding, which are included in short-term borrowings in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Additionally, we had $1.6 billion and $1.8 billion of mortgage loans held for sale (warehouse receivables) as of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, included in the accompanying
consolidated balance sheets, which substantially represented mortgage loans funded through the lines of credit that were either under commitment to be purchased by Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) or had confirmed forward trade
commitments for the issuance and purchase of Fannie Mae or Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae) mortgage backed securities that will be secured by the underlying loans.  

8.  
  Commitments and Contingencies       We are a party to a number of pending or threatened
lawsuits arising out of, or incident to, our ordinary course of business. We believe that any losses in excess of the amounts accrued therefor as liabilities on our financial statements are unlikely to be significant, but litigation is inherently
uncertain and there is the potential for a material adverse effect on our financial statements if one or more matters are resolved in a particular period in an amount materially in excess of what we anticipated.  
 In January 2008, CBRE Multifamily Capital, Inc. (CBRE MCI), a wholly-owned subsidiary of CBRE Capital Markets, entered into an agreement with
Fannie Mae under Fannie Mae s Delegated Underwriting and Servicing Lender Program (DUS Program), to provide financing for multifamily housing with five or more units. Under the DUS Program, CBRE MCI originates, underwrites, closes and services
loans without prior approval by Fannie Mae, and in selected cases, is subject to sharing up to one-third of any losses on loans originated under the DUS Program. CBRE MCI has funded loans subject to such loss sharing arrangements with unpaid
principal balances of $15.0 billion at September 30, 2016. CBRE MCI, under its agreement with Fannie Mae, must post cash reserves or other acceptable collateral under formulas established by Fannie Mae to provide for sufficient capital in the
event losses occur. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, CBRE MCI had a $42.0 million and $35.0 million, respectively, letter of credit under this reserve arrangement, and had provided approximately $25.7 million and $21.8 million,
respectively, of loan loss accruals. Fannie Mae s recourse under the DUS Program is limited to the assets of CBRE MCI, which assets totaled approximately $847.2 million (including $652.2 million of warehouse receivables, a substantial majority
of which are pledged against warehouse lines of credit and are therefore not available to Fannie Mae) at September 30, 2016.    We had
outstanding letters of credit totaling $48.0 million as of September 30, 2016, excluding letters of credit for which we have outstanding liabilities already accrued on our consolidated balance sheet related to our subsidiaries  outstanding
reserves for claims under certain insurance programs as well as letters of credit related to operating leases. CBRE MCI s letter of credit totaling $42.0 million as of September 30, 2016 referred to in the preceding paragraph represented the
majority of the $48.0 million outstanding letters of credit as of such date. The remaining letters of credit are primarily executed by us in the ordinary course of business and expire at varying dates through September 2017.

CBRE GROUP, INC.

  We had guarantees totaling $56.9 million as of September 30, 2016, excluding guarantees
related to pension liabilities, consolidated indebtedness and other obligations for which we have outstanding liabilities already accrued on our consolidated balance sheet, and excluding guarantees related to operating leases. The $56.9 million
primarily represents guarantees executed by us in the ordinary course of business, including various guarantees of management and vendor contracts in our operations overseas, which expire at the end of each of the respective agreements.  
 In addition, as of September 30, 2016, we had issued numerous non-recourse carveout, completion and budget guarantees relating to development
projects for the benefit of third parties. These guarantees are commonplace in our industry and are made by us in the ordinary course of our Development Services business. Non-recourse carveout guarantees generally require that our project-entity
borrower not commit specified improper acts, with us potentially liable for all or a portion of such entity s indebtedness or other damages suffered by the lender if those acts occur. Completion and budget guarantees generally require us to
complete construction of the relevant project within a specified timeframe and/or within a specified budget, with us potentially being liable for costs to complete in excess of such timeframe or budget. However, we generally use  guaranteed
maximum price  contracts with reputable, bondable general contractors with respect to projects for which we provide these guarantees. These contracts are intended to pass the risk to such contractors. While there can be no assurance, we do not
expect to incur any material losses under these guarantees.    An important part of the strategy for our Global Investment Management
business involves investing our capital in certain real estate investments with our clients. These co-investments generally total up to 2.0% of the equity in a particular fund. As of September 30, 2016, we had aggregate commitments of $28.9 million
to fund future co-investments.    Additionally, an important part of our Development Services business strategy is to invest in
unconsolidated real estate subsidiaries as a principal (in most cases co-investing with our clients). As of September 30, 2016, we had committed to fund $24.2 million of additional capital to these unconsolidated subsidiaries.

  Income Per Share Information       The calculations of basic and diluted income per share
attributable to CBRE Group, Inc. shareholders are as follows (dollars in thousands, except share data):      
   For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, 1,972,360 and 1,704,848, respectively, of contingently
issuable shares were excluded from the computation of diluted income per share because their inclusion would have had an anti-dilutive effect.  
 For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, 743,638 of contingently issuable shares were excluded from the computation of diluted
income per share because their inclusion would have had an anti-dilutive effect.      
   We report our operations through the following segments: (1) Americas; (2)
Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA); (3) Asia Pacific; (4) Global Investment Management; and (5) Development Services.    The Americas
segment is our largest segment of operations and provides a comprehensive range of services throughout the U.S. and in the largest regions of Canada and key markets in Latin America. The primary services offered consist of the following: property
sales, property leasing, mortgage services, appraisal and valuation, property management and occupier outsourcing services.    Our EMEA and
Asia Pacific segments generally provide services similar to the Americas business segment. The EMEA segment has operations primarily in Europe, while the Asia Pacific segment has operations in Asia, Australia and New Zealand.

 Summarized financial information by segment is as follows (dollars in thousands):  

(1) 
 During 2016, we changed our methodology for allocating certain costs to our reporting segments, including stock compensation, currency hedging and certain intercompany transactions. Prior year amounts have been
reclassified to conform with the current year presentation. Such changes had no impact on our consolidated results.      EBITDA
represents earnings before net interest expense, write-off of financing costs on extinguished debt, income taxes, depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is not a recognized measurement under GAAP and when analyzing our operating performance,
investors should use EBITDA in addition to, and not as an alternative for, net income as determined in accordance with GAAP. Because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly
titled measures of other companies.    We generally use EBITDA to evaluate operating performance and for other discretionary purposes, and
we believe that this measure provides a more complete understanding of ongoing operations and enhances comparability of current results to prior periods. We further believe that investors may find EBITDA useful in evaluating our operating
performance compared to that of other companies in our industry because EBITDA calculations generally eliminate the effects of acquisitions, which would include impairment charges of goodwill and intangibles created from acquisitions, the effects of
financings and income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending. EBITDA may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance.

  EBITDA is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for our discretionary use because it
does not consider certain cash requirements such as tax and debt service payments. EBITDA may also differ from the amount calculated under similarly titled definitions in our debt instruments, which amounts are further adjusted to reflect certain
other cash and non-cash charges and are used by us to determine compliance with financial covenants therein and our ability to engage in certain activities, such as incurring additional debt and making certain restricted payments.  
 Net interest expense and write-off of financing costs on extinguished debt have been expensed in the segment where incurred. Provision for
income taxes has been allocated among our segments by using applicable U.S. and foreign effective tax rates. EBITDA for our segments is calculated as follows (dollars in thousands):

  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations     
 This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (Quarterly Report) for CBRE Group, Inc. for the three months ended September 30, 2016 represents an update
to the more detailed and comprehensive disclosures included in our Annual Report on Form  10-K  for the year ended December 31, 2015. Accordingly, you should read the following discussion in conjunction with the
information included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015 as well as the unaudited financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report.  
 In addition, the statements and assumptions in this Quarterly Report that are not statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements
within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 or Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, each as amended, including, in particular, statements about our plans, strategies and prospects as well as estimates of industry
growth for the next quarter and beyond. For important information regarding these forward-looking statements, please see the discussion below under the caption  Cautionary Note on Forward-Looking Statements.   
  Overview     We are the world s largest
commercial real estate services and investment firm, based on 2015 revenue, with leading full-service operations in major metropolitan areas throughout the world. We offer a full range of services to occupiers, owners, lenders and investors in
office, retail and industrial properties as well as sales and financing services to owners of multifamily and hotel properties. As of December 31, 2015, excluding independent affiliates, we operated in more than 400 offices worldwide with more than
70,000 employees providing commercial real estate services under the  CBRE  brand name, investment management services under the  CBRE Global Investors  brand name and development services under the  Trammell Crow
Company  brand name. Our business is focused on several competencies, including commercial property, corporate facilities, project and transaction management, tenant/occupier and property/agency leasing, capital markets solutions (property
sales, commercial mortgage origination, sales and servicing, and structured finance) real estate investment management, valuation, development services and proprietary research. We generate revenue from both management fees (large multi-year
portfolio and per-project contracts) and from commissions on transactions. We have been included in the  Fortune  500 since 2008 (ranking #259 in 2016) and among the  Fortune  Most Admired Companies in the real estate sector for four
consecutive years. In 2016, we were ranked by  Forbes  as the 15 th  best employer in America, and the International Association of Outsourcing Professionals (IAOP) has ranked us among the top
outsourcing service providers across all industries for five consecutive years, including in 2016. Additionally, we were one of only two companies to be ranked in the top 12 in the  Barron s  500, which evaluates companies on growth and
financial performance, in each of the past three years, including 2016.    Critical Accounting Policies   
 Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States,
which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts. The estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and on other factors that we believe to be reasonable. Actual results may differ from those estimates.
Critical accounting policies represent the areas where more significant judgments and estimates are used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. A discussion of such critical accounting policies, which include revenue
recognition, goodwill and other intangible assets, and income taxes can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. There have been no material changes to these policies as of September 30, 2016.  
  New Accounting Pronouncements     See Note 2
of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) set forth in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report.  
      36  

Seasonality   
 A significant portion of our revenue is seasonal, which an investor should keep in mind when comparing our financial condition and results of
operations on a quarter-by-quarter basis. Historically, our revenue, operating income, net income and cash flow from operating activities tend to be lowest in the first quarter, and highest in the fourth quarter of each year. Revenue, earnings and
cash flow have generally been concentrated in the fourth calendar quarter due to the focus on completing sales, financing and leasing transactions prior to year-end.  
  Inflation     Our commissions and other
variable costs related to revenue are primarily affected by commercial real estate market supply and demand, which may be affected by inflation. However, to date, we do not believe that general inflation has had a material impact upon our
operations.     Items Affecting Comparability   
 When you read our financial statements and the information included in this Quarterly Report, you should consider that we have experienced, and
continue to experience, several material trends and uncertainties that have affected our financial condition and results of operations that make it challenging to predict our future performance based on our historical results. We believe that the
following material trends and uncertainties are crucial to an understanding of the variability in our historical earnings and cash flows and the potential for continued variability in the future.  
   Macroeconomic Conditions    
 Economic trends and government policies affect global and regional commercial real estate markets as well as our operations directly. These
include: overall economic activity and employment growth; interest rate levels and changes in interest rates; the cost and availability of credit; and the impact of tax, government and regulatory policies. Periods of economic weakness or recession,
significantly rising interest rates, fiscal uncertainty, declining employment levels, decreasing demand for commercial real estate, falling real estate values, disruption to the global capital or credit markets, or the public perception that any of
these events may occur, will negatively affect the performance of our business.    Compensation is our largest expense and the sales and
leasing professionals in our advisory services business generally are paid on a commission and/or bonus basis that correlates with their revenue production. As a result, the negative effect of difficult market conditions on our operating margins is
partially mitigated by the inherent variability of our compensation cost structure. In addition, when negative economic conditions have been particularly severe, we have moved decisively to lower operating expenses to improve financial performance,
and then have restored certain expenses as economic conditions improved. Nevertheless, adverse global and regional economic trends could pose significant risks to the performance of our operations and our financial condition.  
 Commercial real estate markets have recovered over the past several years, along with the steady improvement in global economic activity, most
particularly in the United States. Since 2010, U.S. leasing markets have been marked by increased demand for space, falling vacancies and higher rents. During this time, healthy U.S. property sales activity has been sustained by gradually improving
market fundamentals, low-cost credit availability and increased global and domestic capital flows. Property sales volumes slowed in the first nine months of 2016 following several years of strong growth; however, the market remained active.
Commercial mortgage services activity rose in the first nine months of 2016 driven by a favorable lending environment (including regulatory support) for the U.S. Government Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs) as well as a long-term trend of increased
renting versus home ownership. Strong mortgage services activity is expected for the remainder of 2016. 
      37  

European economies began to emerge from recession in 2013, with most countries returning to
positive, albeit modest, economic growth. Sales and leasing activity in Europe has improved across most of Europe for much of the past two years. An exception is London, where uncertainty in advance of and following the United Kingdom s
referendum to leave the European Union, commonly referred to as  Brexit,  has constrained occupier and investor activity in 2016. 
 In Asia Pacific, the performance of real estate leasing and investment markets has varied from country to country amid slowing economic
growth. In 2016, leasing markets have been mixed, while investment market activity has waned across most of the region. However, local capital from the Asia-Pacific region continues to migrate to other parts of the world.  
 Real estate investment management and property development markets have been generally favorable with abundant debt and equity capital flows
into commercial real estate. Real estate equity securities markets rebounded through the first nine months of 2016, but weakened in the late third quarter and the early fourth quarter amid concerns about potentially higher interest rates.  
 The performance of our global services and real estate investment businesses depends on sustained economic growth and job creation; stable,
healthy global credit markets; and continued positive business and investor sentiment.      Effects of Acquisitions    
 We historically have made significant use of strategic acquisitions to add new service competencies, to increase our scale within existing
competencies and to expand our presence in various geographic regions around the world. On September 1, 2015, CBRE, Inc., our wholly-owned subsidiary, pursuant to a Stock and Asset Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement) with Johnson Controls,
Inc. (JCI), acquired JCI s Global Workplace Solutions (GWS) business (we refer to this transaction as the GWS Acquisition). The acquired GWS business is a market-leading provider of integrated facilities management solutions for major
occupiers of commercial real estate and has significant operations around the world. The purchase price was $1.475 billion, paid in cash, plus adjustments totaling $46.5 million for working capital and other items. We completed the GWS Acquisition
in order to advance our strategy of delivering globally integrated services to major occupiers in our Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific segments. We merged the acquired GWS business with our existing occupier outsourcing business line, and the new
combined business adopted the  Global Workplace Solutions  name.    Strategic in-fill acquisitions have also played a key role in
expanding our geographic coverage and broadening and strengthening our service offerings. The companies we acquired have generally been regional or specialty firms that complement our existing platform, or independent affiliates in which, in some
cases, we held a small equity interest. During 2015, we completed eight in-fill acquisitions, including a Seattle-based leader in capital markets services for affordable housing, a Texas-based commercial real estate firm specializing in retail
services, an energy management specialist based in Brookfield, Wisconsin, a Chicago-based location data analytics firm, one of the leading retail real estate services firms in the midwestern United States, an advisory, consulting and research firm
specializing in the Canadian hospitality and tourism industries and our former independent affiliate companies in Columbia, South Carolina, and Memphis, Tennessee. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, we completed two in-fill
acquisitions, including the acquisition of our independent affiliate in Norway and a London-based retail property advisor specializing in the luxury goods retail sector.  
 Although we believe that strategic acquisitions can significantly decrease the cost, time and commitment of management resources necessary to
attain a meaningful competitive position within targeted markets or to expand our presence within our current markets, in general, most acquisitions will initially have an adverse impact on our operating and net income. The adverse impact is a
result of transaction-related expenditures, which include severance, lease termination, transaction and deferred financing costs, among others, and the charges and costs of integrating the acquired business and its financial and accounting systems
into our own. In addition, our acquisition structures often include deferred and/or contingent purchase price payments in future periods that are  
      38  

subject to the passage of time or achievement of certain performance metrics and other conditions. As of September 30, 2016, we have accrued deferred consideration totaling $73.6 million, which
is included in accounts payable and accrued expenses and in other long-term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets set forth in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report.  
   International Operations    
 We are monitoring the economic and political developments related to Brexit and the potential impact on our businesses in the United Kingdom
and the rest of Europe, including, in particular, sales and leasing activity in the United Kingdom, as well as any associated currency volatility impact on our results of operations.  
 As we increase our international operations through either acquisitions or organic growth, fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar
relative to the other currencies in which we may generate earnings could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. Our Global Investment Management business has a significant amount of euro-denominated assets under
management, or AUM, as well as associated revenue and earnings in Europe, which has recently seen more pronounced (and adverse) movement in the value of the euro against the U.S. dollar. Similarly, the GWS business also has a significant amount of
its revenue and earnings denominated in foreign currencies, such as the euro and the British pound sterling, which has significantly declined in value as compared to the U.S. dollar and other currencies as a result of Brexit. Fluctuations in foreign
currency exchange rates have resulted and may continue to result in corresponding fluctuations in our AUM, revenue and earnings.    During
the nine months ended September 30, 2016, approximately 47% of our business was transacted in non-U.S. dollar currencies, the majority of which included the Australian dollar, Brazilian real, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Chinese yuan,
euro, Hong Kong dollar, Indian rupee, Japanese yen, Mexican peso, Singapore dollar and Swiss franc. The following table sets forth our revenue derived from our most significant currencies (dollars in thousands):  
   
   Although we operate globally, we report our results in U.S. dollars. As a result, the strengthening or
weakening of the U.S. dollar may positively or negatively impact our reported results. For example, we estimate that had the British pound sterling-to-U.S. dollar exchange rates been 10% higher during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the
net impact would have been an increase in pre-tax income of $3.9 million. Had the  euro-to-U.S.  dollar exchange rates been 10% higher during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the net
 
      39  

impact would have been an increase in pre-tax income of $0.7 million. These hypothetical calculations estimate the impact of translating results into U.S. dollars and do not include an estimate
of the impact that a 10% change in the U.S. dollar against other currencies would have had on our foreign operations.    We enter into
derivative financial instruments to attempt to protect the value or fix the amount of certain obligations in terms of our reporting currency, the U.S. dollar. In March 2014, we began a foreign currency exchange forward hedging program by entering
into foreign currency exchange forward contracts, including agreements to buy U.S. dollars and sell Australian dollars, British pound sterling, Canadian dollars, euros and Japanese yen. The purpose of these forward contracts is to attempt to
mitigate the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates that would adversely impact some of our foreign currency denominated EBITDA. Hedge accounting was not elected for any of these contracts. As such, changes in the fair values of
these contracts are recorded directly in earnings. Included in the consolidated statement of operations set forth in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report were net gains of $0.2 million and $1.2 million from foreign currency exchange forward contracts for
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and $9.3 million and $16.6 million from foreign currency exchange forward contracts for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015, respectively. As of September 30,
2016, we had 15 foreign currency exchange forward contracts outstanding covering a notional amount of $168.8 million.    Due to the
constantly changing currency exposures to which we are subject and the volatility of currency exchange rates, we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results. In addition, fluctuations in currencies relative
to the U.S. dollar may make it more difficult to perform   period-to-period   comparisons of our reported results of operations. Our international operations also are
subject to, among other things, political instability and changing regulatory environments, which affects the currency markets and which as a result may adversely affect our future financial condition and results of operations. We routinely monitor
these risks and related costs and evaluate the appropriate amount of oversight to allocate towards business activities in foreign countries where such risks and costs are particularly significant.

Results of Operations   
 The following table sets forth items derived from our consolidated statements of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30,
2016 and 2015 (dollars in thousands):      
   EBITDA represents earnings before net interest expense, write-off of financing costs on extinguished debt,
income taxes, depreciation and amortization. Amounts shown for Adjusted EBITDA further remove (from EBITDA) the impact of certain cash and non-cash charges related to acquisitions, cost-elimination expenses as well as certain carried interest
incentive compensation expense. Neither EBITDA nor Adjusted EBITDA is a recognized measurement under United States generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, and when analyzing our operating performance, investors should use them in addition
to, and not as an alternative for, net income as determined in accordance with GAAP. Because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of these measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.
   We generally use these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate operating performance and for other discretionary purposes, and we believe
that these measures provide a more complete understanding of ongoing operations, enhance comparability of current results to prior periods and may be useful for investors to analyze  
      41  

our financial performance because they eliminate the impact of selected charges that may obscure trends in the underlying performance of our business. We further believe that investors may find
these measures useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry because their calculations generally eliminate the effects of acquisitions, which would include impairment charges of goodwill and
intangibles created from acquisitions, the effects of financings and income taxes and the accounting effects of capital spending. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance.
   These measures are not intended to be measures of free cash flow for our discretionary use because they do not consider certain cash
requirements such as tax and debt service payments. These measures may also differ from the amounts calculated under similarly titled definitions in our debt instruments, which amounts are further adjusted to reflect certain other cash and non-cash
charges and are used by us to determine compliance with financial covenants therein and our ability to engage in certain activities, such as incurring additional debt and making certain restricted payments. We also use Adjusted EBITDA as a
significant component when measuring our operating performance under our employee incentive compensation programs.    EBITDA and Adjusted
EBITDA are calculated as follows (dollars in thousands):

 Represents cost-elimination expenses relating to a program initiated in the fourth quarter of 2015 to reduce the Company s global cost structure after several years of significant revenue and related cost growth.
Cost-elimination expenses incurred in three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 consisted of $36.7 million and $73.6 million, respectively, of severance costs related to headcount reductions in connection with the program and $2.2 million and
$4.9 million, respectively, of third-party contract termination costs. The total amount for each period does have a cash impact.       Three
Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2015     We reported consolidated net income of $104.2
million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 on revenue of $3.2 billion as compared to consolidated net income of $149.1 million on revenue of $2.7 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2015.  
 Our revenue on a consolidated basis for the three months ended September 30, 2016 increased by $480.9 million, or 17.7%, as compared to the
three months ended September 30, 2015. This increase was largely due to  
      42  

contributions from the GWS Acquisition (acquired on September 1, 2015), which added $429.1 million of revenue, with a full quarter of activity reflected in the current-year quarter versus only
one month of activity in the third quarter of 2015. Additionally, the revenue increase reflects strong organic growth, fueled by higher worldwide property, facilities and project management fees (excluding the impact of the GWS Acquisition, up
13.1%), as well as increased commercial mortgage brokerage (up 23.8%) and leasing (up 1.7%) activity. These increases were partially offset by sales activity, which was down 6.6% in the third quarter, as well as foreign currency translation, which
had a $72.4 million negative impact on total revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2016 versus the same period in 2015, primarily driven by weakness in the British pound sterling.  
 Our cost of services on a consolidated basis increased by $479.1 million, or 27.0%, during the three months ended September 30, 2016 as
compared to the same period in 2015. This increase was primarily due to higher costs associated with our global property and facilities management businesses, particularly due to the GWS Acquisition. We also incurred $14.7 million of costs in
connection with a cost-elimination project (our  cost elimination project ) that began in the fourth quarter of 2015 to enhance margins and reduce our global cost structure going forward (the expenses of which primarily consisted of
severance costs related to headcount reductions and third-party contract termination costs). These increases were partially offset by foreign currency translation, which had a $55.1 million positive impact on cost of services during the three
months ended September 30, 2016. Cost of services as a percentage of revenue increased from 65.4% for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to 70.5% for the three months ended September 30, 2016, largely due to the GWS Acquisition.
Excluding activity associated with the acquired GWS business, cost of services as a percentage of revenue was 65.0% for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to 63.0% for the three months ended September 30, 2015, partly driven by the
aforementioned costs associated with our cost-elimination project.    Our operating, administrative and other expenses on a consolidated
basis increased by $59.6 million, or 9.5%, during the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase was partly driven by costs associated with the GWS Acquisition. Additionally, we
incurred $24.2 million of costs in connection with our cost elimination project. Also contributing to the variance were higher bonuses primarily attributable to improved results in our Development Services segment. Foreign currency had a net $5.7
million positive impact on total operating expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2016, which included $8.0 million of unfavorable foreign currency transaction activity over the same period last year, much of which related to hedging
activities, that was more than offset by a $13.7 million positive impact from foreign currency translation. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased from 23.1% for the three months ended September 30, 2015 to 21.5% for the three
months ended September 30, 2016, primarily due to the GWS Acquisition. Excluding activity associated with the acquired GWS business, operating expenses as a percentage of revenue was 24.7% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to
24.2% for the same period in 2015, mainly driven by the aforementioned costs associated with our cost-elimination project.    Our
depreciation and amortization expense on a consolidated basis increased by $17.7 million, or 23.6%, during the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. This increase was primarily attributable to higher
amortization expense relative to intangibles acquired in the GWS Acquisition.    Our equity income from unconsolidated subsidiaries on a
consolidated basis increased by $7.4 million, or 43.1%, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015, primarily driven by higher equity earnings associated with gains on property sales reported in our
Development Services segment.    Our consolidated interest expense increased by $6.6 million, or 21.4%, for the three months ended September
30, 2016 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. This increase was primarily driven by higher interest expense in the current year associated with $600.0 million of 4.875% senior notes issued in August 2015 as well as higher
interest expense associated with borrowings under our amended and restated credit agreement dated January 9, 2015 (our 2015 Credit Agreement) due to an increase in interest rates.  
      43  

Our provision for income taxes on a consolidated basis was $51.4 million for the three months
ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $72.9 million for the same period in 2015. This decrease was driven by the decline in pre-tax income during the three months ended September 30, 2016. Our effective tax rate, after adjusting pre-tax
income to remove the portion attributable to non-controlling interests, was relatively consistent at 33.0% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 32.8% for the three months ended September 30, 2015. We experienced an
unfavorable change in earnings mix in the current-year quarter, with 65% of our earnings, after removing the portion attributable to non-controlling interests, forecasted from the United States for 2016 as of September 30, 2016 versus 61% forecasted
for 2016 as of June 30, 2016. This compares to a favorable change in earnings mix in the prior-year quarter, with 65% of our earnings, after removing the portion attributable to non-controlling interests, forecasted from the United States for 2015
as of September 30, 2015 versus 68% forecasted for 2015 as of June 30, 2015. Additionally, higher losses were sustained in the current year in jurisdictions where no tax benefit could be provided. These items were largely offset by the positive
impact from discrete items recorded in the current-year quarter.     Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30,
2015     We reported consolidated net income of $308.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 on revenue of $9.2 billion as
compared to consolidated net income of $367.1 million on revenue of $7.2 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2015.    Our
revenue on a consolidated basis for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 increased by $2.1 billion, or 29.2%, as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This increase was largely due to contributions from the GWS Acquisition,
which added $1.8 billion of revenue, with a full nine months of activity reflected in the current year versus only one month of activity in 2015. Additionally, the revenue increase reflects strong organic growth, fueled by higher worldwide
property, facilities and project management fees (excluding the impact of the GWS Acquisition, up 12.0%), as well as increased leasing (up 7.2%), and commercial mortgage brokerage (up 14.3%) activity. These increases were partially offset by sales
activity, which was down 1.7% in the current-year period, as well as foreign currency translation, which had a $168.8 million negative impact on total revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 versus the same period in 2015, primarily
driven by weakness in the British pound sterling.    Our cost of services on a consolidated basis increased by $2.0 billion, or 43.2%,
during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to same period in 2015. This increase was primarily due to higher costs associated with our global property and facilities management businesses, particularly due to the GWS
Acquisition. Additionally, we incurred $37.1 million of costs in the current-year period in connection with our cost-elimination project. These increases were partially offset by foreign currency translation, which had a $122.5 million positive
impact on cost of services during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Cost of services as a percentage of revenue increased from 63.6% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 to 70.5% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016,
largely due to the GWS Acquisition. Excluding activity associated with the acquired GWS business, cost of services as a percentage of revenue was 64.7% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to 62.7% for the nine months ended
September 30, 2015, partly driven by the aforementioned costs incurred in connection with our cost-elimination project in the current-year period.  
 Our operating, administrative and other expenses on a consolidated basis increased by $241.5 million, or 13.7%, during the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase was mostly driven by costs associated with the GWS Acquisition. Also contributing to the variance were higher worldwide payroll-related costs (particularly
bonuses largely attributable to improved results, most notably in our Development Services segment). Lastly, we incurred $41.4 million of costs in connection with our cost-elimination project. Foreign currency had a net $31.6 million positive
impact on total operating expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, which included $5.8 million in unfavorable foreign currency transaction activity over the same period last year, much of which related to
 
      44  

hedging activities, that was more than offset by a $37.4 million positive impact from foreign currency translation. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased from 24.7% for the nine
months ended September 30, 2015 to 21.7% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, primarily due to the GWS Acquisition. Excluding activity associated with the acquired GWS business, operating expenses as a percentage of revenue was 25.3% for
the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to 25.1% for the same period in 2015, mainly driven by increased bonus expense in the current year associated with gains on property sales in our Development Services segment reflected outside of
revenue (in equity income from unconsolidated subsidiaries and gain on disposition of real estate) and the aforementioned costs associated with our cost-elimination project.  
 Our depreciation and amortization expense on a consolidated basis increased by $54.5 million, or 25.3%, during the nine months ended September
30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. This increase was primarily attributable to higher amortization expense relative to intangibles acquired in the GWS Acquisition.  
 Our equity income from unconsolidated subsidiaries on a consolidated basis increased by $77.5 million, or 196.8%, for the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015, primarily driven by higher equity earnings associated with gains on property sales reported in our Development Services segment.  
 Our consolidated interest expense increased by $26.0 million, or 31.3%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the nine
months ended September 30, 2015. This increase was primarily driven by interest expense in the current year associated with $600.0 million of 4.875% senior notes issued in August 2015 as well as higher interest expense associated with
borrowings under our 2015 Credit Agreement due to an increase in interest rates.   Our write-off of financing costs on extinguished debt on
a consolidated basis was $2.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. These costs included the write-off of $1.7 million of unamortized deferred financing costs associated with our prior credit agreement dated March 28, 2013, as
amended, and $1.0 million of fees incurred in connection with our 2015 Credit Agreement.    Our provision for income taxes on a consolidated
basis was $165.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to $206.2 million for the same period in 2015. This decrease was driven by the decline in pre-tax income during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Our
effective tax rate, after adjusting pre-tax income to remove the portion attributable to non-controlling interests, decreased to 35.0% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 36.0% for the nine months ended September 30,
2015. Favorable discrete items recorded in the current-year period as compared to unfavorable discrete items recorded in the prior-year period led to the lower effective tax rate for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. This was offset, in
part, by higher losses sustained in the current year in jurisdictions where no tax benefit could be provided.    Segment Operations   
 We report our operations through the following segments: (1) Americas; (2) Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA); (3) Asia Pacific; (4) Global
Investment Management; and (5) Development Services. The Americas consists of operations located in the United States, Canada and key markets in Latin America. EMEA mainly consists of operations in Europe, while Asia Pacific includes operations in
Asia, Australia and New Zealand. The Global Investment Management business consists of investment management operations in North America, Europe and Asia Pacific. The Development Services business consists of real estate development and investment
activities primarily in the United States.  
      45  

The following table summarizes our revenue, costs and expenses and operating income (loss) by our
Americas, EMEA, Asia Pacific, Global Investment Management and Development Services operating segments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2015 (dollars in thousands):

 During 2016, we changed our methodology for allocating certain costs to our reporting segments, including stock compensation, currency hedging and certain intercompany transactions. Prior year amounts have been
reclassified to conform with the current year presentation. Such changes had no impact on our consolidated results.

 See Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) set forth in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report for a reconciliation of segment EBITDA to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated
and presented in accordance with GAAP (which is segment net income (loss) attributable to CBRE Group, Inc.), as well as for an explanation of this non-GAAP financial measure.    
  Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to the Three Months Ended September 30, 2015   
  Americas     Revenue increased by $213.7
million, or 13.7%, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. This increase was largely due to contributions from the GWS Acquisition, which added $148.7 million of revenue, with a full
quarter of activity reflected in the current-year quarter versus only one month of activity in the third quarter of 2015. Additionally, the revenue increase reflects strong organic growth, fueled by higher property, facilities and project
management fees (excluding the impact of the GWS Acquisition, up 8.8%), as well as improved commercial mortgage brokerage and leasing activity. Foreign currency translation had a $3.9 million negative impact on revenue during the three months ended
September 30, 2016 versus the same period in 2015, primarily driven by weakness in the Mexican peso.    Cost of services increased by $206.3
million, or 19.7%, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015, primarily due to higher costs associated with our global property and facilities management businesses, particularly due to the GWS Acquisition.
We also incurred $11.1 million of costs in connection with our cost-elimination project. Foreign currency translation had a $2.6 million positive impact on cost of services during the three months ended September 30, 2016. Cost of services as a
percentage of revenue increased to 70.7% for the three months ended September 30, 2016 compared to 67.2% for the same period in 2015, largely due to the GWS Acquisition. Excluding activity associated with the acquired GWS business, cost of services
as a percentage of revenue was 67.3% for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to 66.0% for the three months ended September 30, 2015, driven by the aforementioned cost-elimination expenses.  
 Operating, administrative and other expenses increased by $15.8 million, or 5.0%, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to
the three months ended September 30, 2015. The increase was partly driven by costs associated with the GWS Acquisition. We also incurred $6.9 million of costs in connection with our cost-elimination project. Foreign currency had a net $0.6
million negative impact on total operating expenses  
      47  

during the three months ended September 30, 2016, which included a positive impact from foreign currency translation of $0.5 million that was more than offset by unfavorable foreign currency
transaction activity, mostly hedging related, of $1.1 million.    In connection with the origination and sale of mortgage loans for which
the company retains servicing rights, we record servicing assets or liabilities based on the fair value of the retained mortgage servicing rights on the date the loans are sold. We also assume or purchase certain servicing assets. Gains from
mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) are initially recorded at fair value within revenue. Subsequent to the initial recording, MSRs are amortized (within amortization expense) and carried at the lower of amortized cost or fair value in other intangible
assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. They are amortized in proportion to and over the estimated period that the servicing income is expected to be received. In any given period, the net of gains from MSRs less related amortization
equals the net non-cash impact to operating income from such activity (Net MSRs). For the three months ended September 30, 2016, Net MSRs increased $23.9 million over the same period in the prior year. For the three months ended
September 30, 2016, Net MSRs contributed $30.9 million to operating income, consisting of $48.9 million of gains recognized in conjunction with the origination and sale of mortgage loans, offset by $18.0 million of amortization
of related intangible assets. For the three months ended September 30, 2015, Net MSRs contributed $7.0 million to operating income, consisting of $22.4 million of gains recognized in conjunction with the origination and sale of
mortgage loans, offset by $15.4 million of amortization of related intangible assets.     EMEA   
 Revenue increased by $218.6 million, or 29.6%, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three months ended September
30, 2015. This increase was largely due to contributions from the GWS Acquisition, which added $230.4 million of revenue, with a full quarter of activity reflected in the current-year quarter versus only one month of activity in the third
quarter of 2015. In addition, the revenue increase also reflects strong organic growth, fueled by higher property, facilities and project management fees (excluding the impact of the GWS Acquisition, up 15.7%). Sales and leasing activity
were relatively consistent for the third quarter of 2016 and 2015. Foreign currency translation had a $71.4 million negative impact on total revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2016 versus the same period in 2015, primarily
driven by weakness in the British pound sterling.    Cost of services increased by $198.8 million, or 36.7%, for the three months ended
September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. This increase was primarily due to higher costs associated with our global property and facilities management businesses, particularly due to the GWS Acquisition. These increases were
partially reduced by foreign currency translation, which had a $55.9 million positive impact on cost of services during the three months ended September 30, 2016. Cost of services as a percentage of revenue increased to 77.5% for the three
months ended September 30, 2016 from 73.5% for the three months ended September 30, 2015, largely due to the GWS Acquisition. Excluding activity associated with the acquired GWS business, cost of services as a percentage of revenue was consistent at
69.5% for the three months ended September 30, 2016, compared to 69.7% for the three months ended September 30, 2015.    Operating,
administrative and other expenses increased by $25.8 million, or 18.4%, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015, primarily driven by higher costs associated with the GWS Acquisition as
well as higher payroll-related costs (including bonuses). This increase was partially mitigated by foreign currency, which had a net $9.8 million positive impact on total operating expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2016,
including $3.0 million in unfavorable foreign currency transaction activity over the same period last year, much of which related to hedging activities, that was more than offset by a positive impact of $12.8 million from foreign currency
translation.

Asia Pacific   
 Revenue increased by $73.0 million, or 25.6%, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three months ended September 30,
2015. This increase was largely due to contributions from the GWS Acquisition, which added $50.0 million of revenue, with a full quarter of activity reflected in the current-year quarter versus only one month of activity in the third quarter of
2015. The revenue increase also reflects strong organic growth, fueled by higher property, facilities and project management fees (excluding the impact of the GWS Acquisition, up 29.5%) as well as improved leasing activity. This increase was
partially offset by lower sales activity. Foreign currency translation had a $6.7 million positive impact on total revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2016 versus the same period in 2015, primarily driven by strength in the Japanese
yen.    Cost of services increased by $74.1 million, or 40.0%, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period
in 2015, mainly driven by higher costs associated with our property and facilities management businesses, particularly due to the GWS Acquisition. We also incurred $2.8 million of costs in the current year in connection with our cost-elimination
project. Foreign currency translation had a $3.4 million negative impact on cost of services during the three months ended September 30, 2016. Cost of services as a percentage of revenue increased to 72.4% for the three months ended September
30, 2016 as compared to 65.0% for the same period in 2015, primarily due to the GWS Acquisition. Excluding activity associated with the acquired GWS business, cost of services as a percentage of revenue was 67.8% for the three months ended September
30, 2016, compared to 62.6% for the same period in 2015, primarily driven by the aforementioned costs incurred in connection with our cost-elimination project as well as due to our revenue mix, with outsourcing revenue, which has a lower margin than
sales and lease revenue, being a higher percentage of revenue than in the prior-year quarter.    Operating, administrative and other
expenses increased by $5.5 million, or 8.2%, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015, primarily driven by costs associated with the GWS Acquisition. In addition, foreign currency had a
$4.2 million negative impact on total operating expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2016, including $2.2 million of unfavorable foreign currency transaction activity over the same period last year, much of which related to hedging
activities, and a $2.0 million negative impact from foreign currency translation. These items were partially offset by lower payroll-related costs (including bonuses) in the current year.  
  Global Investment Management     Revenue
decreased by $22.3 million, or 19.5%, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2015. This decrease was primarily driven by lower carried interest revenue and acquisition fees in the current
year. Foreign currency translation had a $3.8 million negative impact on total revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2016 versus the same period in 2015, primarily driven by weakness in the British pound sterling. 
 Operating, administrative and other expenses increased by $5.4 million, or 6.7%, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to
the same period in 2015, primarily driven by $15.6 million of costs incurred in the current-year quarter in connection with our cost-elimination project. These costs were partially offset by lower carried interest expense incurred in the
current-year quarter. Additionally, foreign currency had a net $0.8 million positive impact on total operating expenses during the three months ended September 30, 2016, which included $1.6 million of unfavorable foreign currency transaction
activity over the same period last year, much of which related to hedging activities, that was more than offset by a $2.4 million positive impact from foreign currency translation.

A roll forward of our AUM by product type for the three months ended September 30, 2016 is as
follows (dollars in billions):      
   AUM generally refers to the properties and other assets with respect to which we provide (or participate in)
oversight, investment management services and other advice, and which generally consist of real estate properties or loans, securities portfolios and investments in operating companies and joint ventures. Our AUM is intended principally to reflect
the extent of our presence in the real estate market, not the basis for determining our management fees. Our assets under management consist of:      

the total fair market value of the real estate properties and other assets either wholly-owned or held by joint ventures and other entities in which our sponsored funds or investment vehicles and client accounts have
invested or to which they have provided financing. Committed (but unfunded) capital from investors in our sponsored funds is not included in this component of our AUM. The value of development properties is included at estimated completion
cost. In the case of real estate operating companies, the total value of real properties controlled by the companies, generally through joint ventures, is included in AUM; and    

the net asset value of our managed securities portfolios, including investments (which may be comprised of committed but uncalled capital) in private real estate funds under our fund of funds program.    
 Our calculation of AUM may differ from the calculations of other asset managers, and as a result, this measure may not be comparable to
similar measures presented by other asset managers.     Development Services   
 Revenue decreased by $2.1 million, or 11.4%, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the three months ended
September 30, 2015, primarily driven by lower development fees in the current year.    Operating, administrative and other expenses
increased by $7.1 million, or 35.7%, for the three months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. This increase was primarily driven by higher bonuses in the current year as a result of significantly improved
operating performance due to property sales (reflected in equity income from unconsolidated subsidiaries and gain on disposition of real estate).  
 As of September 30, 2016, development projects in process totaled $7.1 billion, up $400 million from the third quarter of 2015. The
pipeline inventory totaled $3.7 billion, down $300 million from a year ago, as development projects converted from pipeline to in-process.     Nine Months
Ended September 30, 2016 Compared to the Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015      Americas   
 Revenue increased by $910.9 million, or 21.6%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 compared to the nine months ended
September 30, 2015. This increase was in part due to contributions from the GWS Acquisition, which added $636.3 million of revenue, with a full nine months of activity reflected in the current
 
      50  

year versus only one month of activity in 2015. Additionally, the revenue increase reflects strong organic growth, fueled by higher property, facilities and project management fees
(excluding the impact of the GWS Acquisition, up 8.2%), as well as improved leasing and commercial mortgage brokerage activity. Foreign currency translation had a $28.1 million negative impact on revenue during the nine months ended September 30,
2016 versus the same period in 2015, primarily driven by weakness in the Brazilian real, Canadian dollar and Mexican peso.    Cost of
services increased by $825.7 million, or 29.9%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015, primarily due to higher costs associated with our global property and facilities management businesses,
particularly due to the GWS Acquisition. This increase was also due to higher commission expense resulting from improved lease transaction revenue. Additionally, we incurred $11.9 million of costs in connection with our cost-elimination project.
Foreign currency translation had an $18.7 million positive impact on cost of services during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Cost of services as a percentage of revenue increased to 69.9% for the nine months ended September 30,
2016 compared to 65.4% for the same period in 2015, largely due to the GWS Acquisition. Excluding activity associated with the acquired GWS business, cost of services as a percentage of revenue was 66.2% for the nine months ended September 30,
2016, compared to 64.9% for the nine months ended September 30, 2015, partly driven by the aforementioned costs associated with our cost-elimination project  
 Operating, administrative and other expenses increased by $95.4 million, or 10.6%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as
compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase was partly driven by costs associated with the GWS Acquisition as well as higher payroll-related costs, including an increase in 401(k) contributions in the United States, and $10.4
million of expenses associated with our cost-elimination project. Higher software license and maintenance contract costs also contributed to the increase. Foreign currency had a net $3.5 million positive impact on total operating expenses during the
nine months ended September 30, 2016, which included a positive impact from foreign currency translation of $7.0 million, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency transaction activity, mostly hedging related, of $3.5 million.  
 For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, Net MSRs increased $13.9 million over the same period in the prior year. For the nine
months ended September 30, 2016, Net MSRs contributed $51.2 million to operating income, consisting of $104.0 million of gains recognized in conjunction with the origination and sale of mortgage loans, offset by $52.8 million of amortization of
related intangible assets. For the nine months ended September 30, 2015, Net MSRs contributed $37.3 million to operating income, consisting of $81.0 million of gains recognized in conjunction with the origination and sale of mortgage loans,
offset by $43.7 million of amortization of related intangible assets.     EMEA   
 Revenue increased by $948.2 million, or 52.2%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the nine months ended
September 30, 2015. This increase was largely due to contributions from the GWS Acquisition, which added $914.5 million of revenue, with a full nine months of activity reflected in the current year versus only one month of activity in
2015. In addition, the revenue increase also reflects strong organic growth, fueled by higher property, facilities and project management fees (excluding the impact of the GWS Acquisition, up 15.3%). Leasing activity was up slightly, but was more
than offset by lower sales activity. Foreign currency translation had a $120.8 million negative impact on total revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 versus the same period in 2015, primarily driven by weakness in the British
pound sterling.    Cost of services increased by $882.8 million, or 67.6%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to
the same period in 2015. This increase was primarily due to higher costs associated with our global property and facilities management businesses, particularly due to the GWS Acquisition. We also incurred $18.8 million of costs in the current
year in connection with our cost-elimination project. These increases were partially reduced by foreign currency translation, which had a $93.0 million positive impact on cost of services during the  

      51  

nine months ended September 30, 2016. Cost of services as a percentage of revenue increased to 79.1% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 from 71.8% for the nine months ended
September 30, 2015, largely due to the GWS Acquisition. Excluding activity associated with the acquired GWS business, cost of services as a percentage of revenue was 71.6% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to 70.3% for the
nine months ended September 30, 2015, primarily driven by the aforementioned costs incurred in connection with our cost-elimination project.  
 Operating, administrative and other expenses increased by $77.1 million, or 19.2%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as
compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015, primarily driven by higher costs associated with the GWS Acquisition. Higher payroll-related costs (including bonuses) in the current year also contributed to the variance. Lastly, we
incurred $6.8 million of costs in the current-year period in connection with our previously mentioned cost-elimination project. These increases were partially mitigated by foreign currency, which had a $30.6 million positive impact on total
operating expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, including $7.8 million in favorable foreign currency transaction activity over the same period last year, much of which related to hedging activities, and $22.8 million from
foreign currency translation.    Asia Pacific   
 Revenue increased by $267.6 million, or 35.4%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the nine months ended September 30,
2015. This increase was largely due to contributions from the GWS Acquisition, which added $222.8 million of revenue, with a full nine months of activity reflected in the current year versus only one month of activity in 2015. The revenue
increase also reflects strong organic growth, fueled by higher property, facilities and project management fees (excluding the impact of the GWS Acquisition, up 21.3%) as well as improved leasing activity. This increase was partially offset by lower
sales activity as well as by foreign currency translation, which had a $12.3 million negative impact on total revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2016 versus the same period in 2015, primarily driven by weakness in the Australian
dollar, Chinese yuan and Indian rupee, partly mitigated by strength in the Japanese yen.    Cost of services increased by $259.8 million, or
53.1%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015, driven by higher costs associated with our property and facilities management businesses, including the acquired GWS business. We also incurred $6.4
million of costs in the current year in connection with our cost-elimination project. These increases were partially offset by foreign currency translation, which had a $10.8 million positive impact on cost of services during the nine months ended
September 30, 2016. Cost of services as a percentage of revenue increased to 73.2% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to 64.7% for the same period in 2015, primarily due to the GWS Acquisition. Excluding activity
associated with the acquired GWS business, cost of services as a percentage of revenue was 67.6% for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, compared to 63.9% for the same period in 2015, primarily driven by the aforementioned costs incurred in
connection with our cost-elimination project as well as due to our revenue mix, with outsourcing revenue, which has a lower margin than sales and lease revenue, being a higher percentage of revenue than in the prior-year period.  
 Operating, administrative and other expenses increased by $27.5 million, or 14.5%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to
the nine months ended September 30, 2015, mainly driven by costs associated with the GWS Acquisition. Additionally, foreign currency activity had an overall negative impact of $6.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, including
unfavorable foreign currency transaction activity, mostly hedging related, of $8.6 million, partially offset by foreign currency translation, which had a $2.4 million positive impact on total operating expenses.  
  Global Investment Management     Revenue
decreased by $40.4 million, or 12.7%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This decrease was primarily driven by lower carried interest
 
      52  

revenue as well as lower asset management and acquisition fees in the current year. Foreign currency translation had a $7.6 million negative impact on total revenue during the nine months ended
September 30, 2016 versus the same period in 2015, primarily driven by weakness in the British pound sterling.   Operating,
administrative and other expenses increased by $3.0 million, or 1.3%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015, primarily driven by $21.3 million of charges incurred in the current year in connection
with our cost-elimination project. These increases were mostly offset by lower carried interest expense incurred in the current-year period. Additionally, foreign currency had a net $3.8 million positive impact on total operating expenses during the
nine months ended September 30, 2016, which included $1.4 million of unfavorable foreign currency transaction activity over the same period last year, much of which related to hedging activities, that was more than offset by a $5.2 million
positive impact from foreign currency translation.    A roll forward of our AUM by product type for the nine months ended September 30,
2016 is as follows (dollars in billions):      
   We describe above how we calculate AUM. Also as noted above, our calculation of AUM may differ from the
calculations of other asset managers, and as a result, this measure may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other asset managers.  
  Development Services     Revenue increased
by $5.9 million, or 12.9%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015, primarily driven by higher development fees in the current year.  
 Operating, administrative and other expenses increased by $38.6 million, or 72.3%, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as compared to
the same period in 2015. This increase was primarily driven by higher bonuses in the current year as a result of significantly improved operating performance due to property sales (reflected in equity income from unconsolidated subsidiaries and
gain on disposition of real estate).     Liquidity and Capital Resources   
 We believe that we can satisfy our working capital requirements and funding of investments with internally generated cash flow and, as
necessary, borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Our expected capital requirements for 2016 include up to approximately $180 million of anticipated capital expenditures, net of tenant concessions. During the nine months ended
September 30, 2016, we incurred $126.7 million of capital expenditures, net of tenant concessions received. As of September 30, 2016, we had aggregate commitments of $28.9 million to fund future co-investments in our Global Investment
Management business, $14.8 million of which is expected to be funded in 2016. Additionally, as of September 30, 2016, we are committed to fund $24.2 million of additional capital to unconsolidated subsidiaries within our Development
Services business, which we may be required to fund at any time. As of September 30, 2016, we had $2.7 billion of borrowings available under our $2.8 billion revolving credit facility.  
 We have historically relied on our internally generated cash flow and our revolving credit facility to fund our working capital, capital
expenditure and investment requirements (including strategic in-fill acquisitions) and  
      53  

have not sought other external sources of financing to help fund these requirements. In the absence of extraordinary events or a large strategic acquisition, we anticipate that our cash flow from
operations and our revolving credit facility would be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for the foreseeable future, and at a minimum for the next 12 months. We may seek to take advantage of market opportunities to refinance
existing debt instruments, as we have done in the past, with new debt instruments at interest rates, maturities and terms we deem attractive.  
 As noted above, we believe that any future significant acquisitions that we may make could require us to obtain additional debt or equity
financing. In the past, we have been able to obtain such financing for material transactions on terms that we believed to be reasonable. However, it is possible that we may not be able to obtain acquisition financing on favorable terms, or at all,
in the future if we decide to make any further significant acquisitions.    Our long-term liquidity needs, other than those related to
ordinary course obligations and commitments such as operating leases, are generally comprised of three elements. The first is the repayment of the outstanding and anticipated principal amounts of our long-term indebtedness. We are unable to project
with certainty whether our long-term cash flow from operations will be sufficient to repay our long-term debt when it comes due. If our cash flow is insufficient, then we expect that we would need to refinance such indebtedness or otherwise amend
its terms to extend the maturity dates. We cannot make any assurances that such refinancing or amendments would be available on attractive terms, if at all.  
 The second long-term liquidity need is the payment of obligations related to acquisitions. Our acquisition structures often include deferred
and/or contingent purchase price payments in future periods that are subject to the passage of time or achievement of certain performance metrics and other conditions. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had accrued $73.6
million and $79.7 million, respectively, of deferred purchase consideration, which was included in accounts payable and accrued expenses and in other long-term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets set forth in Item 1 of
this Quarterly Report.    The third long-term liquidity need relates to the repurchase of our common stock. On October 27, 2016, we
announced that our board of directors has authorized the company to repurchase up to an aggregate of $250 million of its Class A common stock over three years.  
   Historical Cash Flows    
  Operating Activities     Net
cash used in operating activities totaled $53.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $142.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The increase in
net cash used in operating activities was primarily due to higher net payments to vendors, income taxes paid and lower operating performance (driven by costs incurred in connection with our cost elimination program and relating to the integration of
our acquisition of GWS) in the current year. These items were partially offset by higher commissions paid in the prior year and a decrease in receivables recorded in the current year. 
  Investing Activities     Net
cash used in investing activities totaled $39.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, a decrease of $1.6 billion as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2015. This variance was primarily driven by a greater
amount invested in acquisitions in the prior year, particularly the GWS Acquisition.     Financing Activities   
 Net cash used in financing activities totaled $0.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, as compared to net cash provided
by financing activities of $1.2 billion for the nine months ended September 30,  
      54  

2015. This variance was primarily due to proceeds received from the issuance of $600.0 million of 4.875% senior notes in August 2015, $313.0 million of greater net borrowings under our
revolving credit facility in the prior year as well as $271.3 million of higher net borrowings of term loans under our 2015 Credit Agreement in the prior year. These collective borrowings in the prior year, as well as cash on hand, were used to fund
the GWS Acquisition, which closed on September 1, 2015.      Indebtedness    
 Our level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to pay the principal amount of our indebtedness and other obligations
when due. In addition, we may incur additional debt from time to time to finance strategic acquisitions, investments, joint ventures or for other purposes, subject to the restrictions contained in the documents governing our indebtedness. If we
incur additional debt, the risks associated with our leverage, including our ability to service our debt, would increase.     Long-Term
Debt     We maintain credit facilities with third-party lenders, which we use for a variety of purposes. On January 9, 2015, we
entered into our 2015 Credit Agreement with a syndicate of banks jointly led by Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner   Smith Incorporated, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Credit Suisse AG. On March 21, 2016, we executed an amendment to our 2015 Credit
Agreement that, among other things, extended the maturity on our revolving credit facility to March 2021 and increased the borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility by $200.0 million.  
 The 2015 Credit Agreement is an unsecured credit facility that is jointly and severally guaranteed by us and substantially all of our material
domestic subsidiaries. The 2015 Credit Agreement currently provides for the following: (1) a $2.8 billion revolving credit facility, which includes the capacity to obtain letters of credit and swingline loans and matures on March 21, 2021;
(2) a $500.0 million tranche A term loan facility requiring quarterly principal payments, which began on June 30, 2015 and continue through maturity on January 9, 2020; (3) a $270.0 million tranche B-1 term loan facility requiring
quarterly principal payments, which began on December 31, 2015 and continue through maturity on September 3, 2020; and (4) a $130.0 million tranche  B-2  term loan facility requiring quarterly principal
payments, which began on December 31, 2015 and continue through maturity on September 3, 2022. On November 1, 2016, we prepaid a total of $101.9 million of the 2017 and 2018 required amortization on our senior term loans, which included
$59.4 million for the tranche A term loan facility, $28.7 million for the tranche B-1 term loan facility and $13.8 million for the tranche B-2 term loan facility.  
 In prior years, we also issued 5.00%, 4.875% and 5.25% senior notes that are due in 2023, 2026 and 2025, respectively. For additional
information on all of our long-term debt, see Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 included in our Annual Report on Form  10-K  for the year ended December 31, 2015
and Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) set forth in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report.    Short-Term
Borrowings     We maintain a $2.8 billion revolving credit facility under our 2015 Credit Agreement and warehouse lines of credit with
certain third-party lenders. For additional information on all of our short-term borrowings, see Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 included in our Annual Report on
 Form 10-K  for the year ended December 31, 2015 and Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Unaudited) set forth in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report. 
  Interest Rate Swap Agreements   
 In March 2011, we entered into five interest rate swap agreements, all with effective dates in October 2011, and immediately designated them as
cash flow hedges in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards  
      55  

Boards (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 815,   Derivatives and Hedging.   The purpose of these interest rate swap agreements is to attempt to hedge potential
changes to our cash flows due to the variable interest nature of our senior term loan facilities. The total notional amount of these interest rate swap agreements is $400.0 million, with $200.0 million expiring in October 2017 and $200.0 million
expiring in September 2019. As of September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the fair values of such interest rate swap agreements were reflected as an $18.9 million liability and $21.5 million liability, respectively, and were included in other
long-term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets set forth in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report.    In July 2015, we
entered into three interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of $300.0 million, all with effective dates in August 2015, and designated them as cash flow hedges in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 815. In August 2015, we
elected to terminate these agreements and paid a $6.2 million cash settlement, which has been recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets set forth in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report. This
settlement fee is being amortized to interest expense throughout the remaining term of the terminated hedge transaction until August 2025.

particular in Part II, Item 1A,  Risk Factors , or as described in the other documents and reports we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission.    
 Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date the statements are made. You should not put undue reliance on any forward-looking
statements. We assume no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect actual results, changes in assumptions or changes in other factors affecting forward-looking information, except to the extent required by applicable securities
laws. If we do update one or more forward-looking statements, no inference should be drawn that we will make additional updates with respect to those or other forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning these and other risks and
uncertainties is contained in our other periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.      

Item 3.  
  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk       The information in this
section should be read in connection with the information on market risk related to changes in interest rates and non-U.S. currency exchange rates in Part II, Item 7A,  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
in our Annual Report on  Form 10-K  for the year ended December 31, 2015.    Our exposure to
market risk primarily consists of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations related to our international operations and changes in interest rates on debt obligations. We manage such risk primarily by managing the amount, sources, and duration of
our debt funding and by using derivative financial instruments. We apply Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 815,   Derivatives and Hedging,   when accounting for derivative
financial instruments. In all cases, we view derivative financial instruments as a risk management tool and, accordingly, do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes.  
   Exchange Rates    
 Our foreign operations expose us to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. These fluctuations may impact the value of our cash receipts and
payments in terms of our functional (reporting) currency, which is U.S. dollars. See the discussion of international operations, which is included in Item 2.  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations  under the caption  Items Affecting Comparability International Operations  and is incorporated by reference herein.  
      58  

Interest Rates    
 We manage our interest expense by using a combination of fixed and variable rate debt. We enter into interest rate swap agreements to attempt
to hedge the variability of future interest payments due to changes in interest rates. See discussion of our interest rate swap agreements, which is included in Item 2.  Management s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations  under the caption  Liquidity and Capital Resources Indebtedness Interest Rate Swap Agreements  and is incorporated by reference herein.  
 The estimated fair value of our senior term loans was approximately $855.8 million at September 30, 2016. Based on dealers 
quotes, the estimated fair values of our 5.00% senior notes, 4.875% senior notes and 5.25% senior notes were $853.5 million, $638.0 million and $458.1 million, respectively, at September 30, 2016.  
 We utilize sensitivity analyses to assess the potential effect on our variable rate debt. If interest rates were to increase 100 basis points
on our outstanding variable rate debt at September 30, 2016, excluding notes payable on real estate, the net impact of the additional interest cost would be a decrease of $4.1 million on pre-tax income and an increase of $4.1 million in cash used in
operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016.      

Item 4.  
  Controls and Procedures         Disclosure Controls and Procedures    
 Rule 13a-15 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, requires that we conduct an evaluation of the effectiveness of our
disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report, and we have a disclosure policy in furtherance of the same. This evaluation is designed to ensure that all corporate disclosure is complete and accurate
in all material respects. The evaluation is further designed to ensure that all information required to be disclosed in our SEC reports is accumulated and communicated to management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures and
recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods and in the manner specified in the SEC s rules and forms. Any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of
achieving the desired control objectives. Our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer supervise and participate in this evaluation, and they are assisted by our Deputy Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer and other
members of our Disclosure Committee. In addition to our Deputy Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer, our Disclosure Committee consists of our General Counsel, our chief communication officer, our corporate controller, our head of
Global Internal Audit, our senior officers of significant business lines and other select employees.    We conducted the required
evaluation, and our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined by Securities Exchange Act  Rule 13a-15(e))  were effective as
of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report to accomplish their objectives at the reasonable assurance level.      Changes
in Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting      No changes in our internal control over financial reporting occurred during the
fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2016 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
