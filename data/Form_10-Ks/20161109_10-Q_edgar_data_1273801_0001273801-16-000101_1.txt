  This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains certain  forward-looking statements  within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or Securities Act, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or Exchange Act.

           1. 
    Business and Organization 
     NorthStar Realty Finance Corp. is a diversified commercial real estate company (the  Company  or  NorthStar Realty ).  The Company invests in multiple asset classes across commercial real estate ( CRE ) that it expects will generate attractive risk-adjusted returns and may take the form of acquiring real estate, originating or acquiring senior or subordinate loans, as well as pursuing opportunistic CRE investments.  The Company is a Maryland corporation and completed its initial public offering in October 2004.  The Company conducts its operations so as to continue to qualify as a real estate investment trust ( REIT ) for U.S. federal income tax purposes.  The Company is externally managed and advised by an affiliate of NorthStar Asset Management Group Inc. (NYSE: NSAM), which together with its affiliates is referred to as NSAM.  
  Substantially all of the Company s assets, directly or indirectly, are held by, and the Company conducts its operations, directly or indirectly, through NorthStar Realty Finance Limited Partnership, a Delaware limited partnership and the operating partnership of the Company (the  Operating Partnership ).  All references herein to the Company refer to NorthStar Realty Finance Corp. and its consolidated subsidiaries, including the Operating Partnership, collectively, unless the context otherwise requires. 
  Merger Agreement with NSAM and Colony Capital, Inc. 
  In June 2016, the Company announced that it entered into a merger agreement with NSAM and Colony Capital, Inc. ( Colony ) under which the companies will combine in an all-stock merger of equals transaction to create an internally-managed, diversified real estate and investment management platform (the  Mergers ).  The transaction has been approved by the Company s and NSAM s respective board of directors, including the unanimous approval by their respective Special Committees and the board of directors of Colony. 
  Under the terms of the merger agreement, as amended, NSAM will redomesticate to Maryland and elect to be treated as a REIT beginning in 2017 and the Company and Colony, through a series of transactions, will merge with and into the redomesticated NSAM, which will be renamed Colony NorthStar, Inc. ( Colony NorthStar ).  The Company s common stockholders will receive   1.0996   shares of Colony NorthStar s common stock for each share of common stock they own.  Holders of preferred stock will receive shares of preferred stock of Colony NorthStar that are substantially similar to the preferred stock held prior to the closing of the transaction.  Upon completion of the transaction, NSAM stockholders will own approximately   32.85%  , Colony stockholders will own approximately   33.25%   and the Company s stockholders will own approximately   33.90%   of the combined company on a fully diluted basis, excluding the effect of certain equity-based awards issuable in connection with the Mergers.   
  In October 2016, the Company amended the merger agreement and provided for, among other matters, an enhanced governance structure for Colony NorthStar, modified severance terms for NSAM s executive officers and a special cash dividend for NSAM s stockholders now totaling   $228 million  .  In connection with the amendment to the merger agreement, NSAM entered into a voting agreement with MSD Capital L.P. ( MSD ) and its affiliates, which together own approximately   10.2%   of NSAM s outstanding shares, pursuant to which MSD agreed to vote in favor of the Mergers and related proposals.  In addition, Colony NorthStar, a Maryland subsidiary of NSAM that will be the surviving parent company of the combined company, filed with the SEC an amended registration statement on Form S-4 that includes a joint proxy statement of the Company, Colony and NSAM and that also constitutes a prospectus of Colony NorthStar. 
  The transaction is expected to close in January 2017, subject to, among other things, regulatory approvals and the receipt of the Company s, Colony s and NSAM s respective stockholder approvals. 
  Sales Initiatives 
  The Company continues to execute a series of sales initiatives including: (i) sales of certain real estate assets; (ii) sales of certain of the Company s limited partnership interests in real estate private equity funds ( PE Investments  and (iii) sales and/or accelerated repayments of the Company s CRE debt and securities investments.  
   
           2. 
    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  
     Basis of Quarterly Presentation 
  The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements and related notes of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( U.S. GAAP ) for interim financial reporting and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Rule 10-01 of Regulation S-X.  Accordingly, certain information and note disclosures normally included in the consolidated financial statements prepared under U.S. GAAP have been condensed or omitted.  In the opinion of management, all adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of the Company s financial position, results of operations and cash flows have been included and are of a normal and recurring nature.  The operating results presented for interim periods are not  
  
   11 

     Table of Contents   
  NORTHSTAR REALTY FINANCE CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 
  (Unaudited) 

necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any other interim period or for the entire year.  These consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015  , which was filed with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the  SEC ). 
  The three and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   represent the Company s results of operations following the spin-off of its European real estate business (the  NRE Spin-off ) into a separate publicly-traded REIT, NorthStar Realty Europe Corp. ( NorthStar Europe ).  The   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015   include a carve-out of revenues and expenses attributable to NorthStar Europe recorded in discontinued operations.  As a result, the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   may not be comparable to the prior periods presented.  Expenses also included an allocation of indirect expenses of the Company to NorthStar Europe, including salaries and other general and administrative expenses (primarily occupancy and other cost) based on an estimate had the European real estate business been run as an independent entity.  This allocation method was principally based on relative headcount and management s knowledge of the Company s operations. 
  Principles of Consolidation 
  The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, the Operating Partnership and their consolidated subsidiaries.  The Company consolidates variable interest entities ( VIE ) where the Company is the primary beneficiary and voting interest entities which are generally majority owned or otherwise controlled by the Company.  All significant intercompany balances are eliminated in consolidation. 
  Variable Interest Entities 
  A VIE is an entity that lacks one or more of the characteristics of a voting interest entity.  A VIE is defined as an entity in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties.  The determination of whether an entity is a VIE includes both a qualitative and quantitative analysis.  The Company bases its qualitative analysis on its review of the design of the entity, its organizational structure including decision-making ability and relevant financial agreements and the quantitative analysis on the forecasted cash flow of the entity. 
  The Company reassesses its initial evaluation of an entity as a VIE upon the occurrence of certain reconsideration events. 
  A VIE must be consolidated only by its primary beneficiary, which is defined as the party who, along with its affiliates and agents has both the: (i) power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance; and (ii) obligation to absorb the losses of the VIE or the right to receive the benefits from the VIE, which could be significant to the VIE.  The Company determines whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE by considering qualitative and quantitative factors, including, but not limited to: which activities most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance and which party controls such activities; the amount and characteristics of its investment; the obligation or likelihood for the Company or other interests to provide financial support; consideration of the VIE s purpose and design, including the risks the VIE was designed to create and pass through to its variable interest holders and the similarity with and significance to the business activities of the Company and the other interests.  The Company reassesses its determination of whether it is the primary beneficiary of a VIE each reporting period.  Significant judgments related to these determinations include estimates about the current and future fair value and performance of investments held by these VIEs and general market conditions. 
  The Company evaluates its CRE debt and securities, investments in unconsolidated ventures and securitization financing transactions, such as its collateralized debt obligations ( CDOs ) and its liabilities to subsidiary trusts issuing preferred securities ( junior subordinated notes ) to determine whether they are a VIE.  The Company analyzes new investments and financings, as well as reconsideration events for existing investments and financings, which vary depending on type of investment or financing. 
  Voting Interest Entities 
  A voting interest entity is an entity in which the total equity investment at risk is sufficient to enable it to finance its activities independently and the equity holders have the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact its economic performance, the obligation to absorb the losses of the entity and the right to receive the residual returns of the entity.  The usual condition for a controlling financial interest in a voting interest entity is ownership of a majority voting interest.  If the Company has a majority voting interest in a voting interest entity, the entity will generally be consolidated.  The Company does not consolidate a voting interest entity if there are substantive participating rights by other parties and/or kick-out rights by a single party or through a simple majority vote.

  NORTHSTAR REALTY FINANCE CORP. AND SUBSIDIARIES 
  NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) 
  (Unaudited) 

The Company performs on-going reassessments of whether entities previously evaluated under the voting interest framework have become VIEs, based on certain events, and therefore subject to the VIE consolidation framework. 
  Investments in Unconsolidated Ventures 
  A non-controlling, unconsolidated ownership interest in an entity may be accounted for using the equity method, at fair value or the cost method. 
  Under the equity method, the investment is adjusted each period for capital contributions and distributions and its share of the entity s net income (loss).  Capital contributions, distributions and net income (loss) of such entities are recorded in accordance with the terms of the governing documents.  An allocation of net income (loss) may differ from the stated ownership percentage interest in such entity as a result of a preferred return and allocation formula, if any, as described in such governing documents. 
  The Company may account for an investment in an unconsolidated entity at fair value by electing the fair value option.  The Company elected the fair value option for its investments (directly or indirectly in joint ventures) that own PE Investments and certain investments in unconsolidated ventures (refer to Note 6).  The Company records the change in fair value for its share of the projected future cash flow of such investments from one period to another in equity in earnings (losses) from unconsolidated ventures in the consolidated statements of operations.  Any change in fair value attributed to market related assumptions is considered unrealized gain (loss). 
  The Company may account for an investment that does not qualify for equity method accounting or for which the fair value option was not elected using the cost method if the Company determines the investment in the unconsolidated entity is insignificant.  Under the cost method, equity in earnings is recorded as dividends are received to the extent they are not considered a return of capital, which is recorded as a reduction of cost of the investment. 
  Non-controlling Interests 
  A non-controlling interest in a consolidated subsidiary is defined as the portion of the equity (net assets) in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, to the Company.  A non-controlling interest is required to be presented as a separate component of equity on the consolidated balance sheets and presented separately as net income (loss) and other comprehensive income (loss) ( OCI ) attributable to non-controlling interests.  An allocation to a non-controlling interest may differ from the stated ownership percentage interest in such entity as a result of a preferred return and allocation formula, if any, as described in such governing documents. 
  Estimates 
  The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that could affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.  Actual results could materially differ from those estimates and assumptions. 
  Reclassifications 
  Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified in the consolidated financial statements to conform to current period presentation including amounts related to discontinued operations (refer to Note 3). 
  Comprehensive Income (Loss) 
  The Company reports consolidated comprehensive income (loss) in separate statements following the consolidated statements of operations.  Comprehensive income (loss) is defined as the change in equity resulting from net income (loss) and OCI.  The components of OCI principally include: (i) unrealized gain (loss) on real estate securities available for sale for which the fair value option is not elected; (ii) the reclassification of unrealized gain (loss) on real estate securities available for sale for which the fair value option was not elected to realized gain (loss) upon sale or realized event; (iii) the reclassification of unrealized gain (loss) to interest expense on derivative instruments that are or were deemed to be effective hedges; (iv) foreign currency translation adjustment; and (v) reclassification of foreign currency translation into realized gain (loss) on investments and other upon realized event.

Restricted Cash 
  Restricted cash primarily consists of amounts related to operating real estate.  The following table presents a summary of restricted cash as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   (dollars in thousands): 

__________________________________________________ 
           (1) 
    Primarily represents capital improvements, furniture, fixtures and equipment, tenant improvements, lease renewal and replacement reserves related to operating real estate. 
              (2) 
    Primarily represents insurance, real estate tax, repair and maintenance, tenant security deposits and other escrows related to operating real estate. 
              (3) 
    Represents proceeds from repayments and/or sales pending distribution in consolidated N-Star CDOs. 
     Fair Value Option 
  The fair value option provides an election that allows a company to irrevocably elect to record certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on an instrument-by-instrument basis at initial recognition.  The Company may elect to apply the fair value option for certain investments due to the nature of the instrument.  Any change in fair value for assets and liabilities for which the election is made is recognized in earnings. 
  Operating Real Estate 
  Operating real estate is carried at historical cost less accumulated depreciation.  Ordinary repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.  Major replacements and improvements which improve or extend the life of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over their useful life.  Operating real estate is depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, summarized as follows: 
                   Category: 
      
    Term: 
      Building (fee interest) 
      
    15 to 40 years 
      Building improvements 
      
    Lesser of the useful life or remaining life of the building 
      Building leasehold interests 
      
    Lesser of 40 years or remaining term of the lease 
      Land improvements 
      
    10 to 30 years 
      Tenant improvements 
      
    Lesser of the useful life or remaining term of the lease 

The Company accounts for purchases of operating real estate that qualify as business combinations using the acquisition method, where the purchase price is allocated to tangible assets such as land, building, tenant and land improvements and other identified intangibles, such as goodwill.  Costs directly related to an acquisition deemed to be a business combination are expensed and included in transaction costs in the consolidated statements of operations.  The Company evaluates whether real estate acquired in connection with a foreclosure, UCC/deed in lieu of foreclosure or a consentual modification of a loan (herein collectively referred to as taking title to collateral) ( REO ) constitutes a business and whether business combination accounting is appropriate.  Any excess upon taking title to collateral between the carrying value of a loan over the estimated fair value of the property is charged to provision for loan losses. 
  Operating real estate, including REO, which has met the criteria to be classified as held for sale, is separately presented on the consolidated balance sheets.  Such operating real estate is recorded at the lower of its carrying value or its estimated fair value less the cost to sell.  Once a property is determined to be held for sale, depreciation is no longer recorded.  The Company records a gain (loss) on sale of real estate when title is conveyed to the buyer and the Company has no substantial economic involvement with the property.  If the sales criteria for the full accrual method are not met, the Company defers some or all of the gain (loss) recognition by applying the finance, leasing, profit sharing, deposit, installment or cost recovery method, as appropriate, until the sales criteria are met.

CRE debt investments are generally intended to be held to maturity and, accordingly, are carried at cost, net of unamortized loan fees, premium and discount.  CRE debt investments that are deemed to be impaired are carried at amortized cost less a loan loss reserve, if deemed appropriate, which approximates fair value.  CRE debt investments where the Company does not have the intent to hold the loan for the foreseeable future or until its expected payoff are classified as held for sale and recorded at the lower of cost or estimated value. 
  The Company may syndicate a portion of the CRE debt investments that it originates or sell the CRE debt investments individually.  When a transaction meets the criteria for sale accounting, the Company will derecognize the CRE debt investment sold and recognize gain or loss based on the difference between the sales price and the carrying value of the CRE debt investment sold. 
  Any related unamortized deferred origination fee, original issue discount, loan origination costs, discount or premium at the time of sale are recognized as an adjustment to the gain (loss) on sale, which is included in interest income on the consolidated statement of operations.  Any fees received at the time of sale or syndication are recognized as part of interest income. 
  Real Estate Securities 
  The Company classifies its CRE securities investments as available for sale on the acquisition date, which are carried at fair value.  The Company historically elected to apply the fair value option for its CRE securities investments.  For those CRE securities for which the fair value option was elected, any unrealized gains (losses) from the change in fair value is recorded in unrealized gains (losses) on investments and other in the consolidated statements of operations. 
  The Company may decide to not elect the fair value option for certain CRE securities due to the nature of the particular instrument.  For those CRE securities for which the fair value option was not elected, any unrealized gain (loss) from the change in fair value is recorded as a component of accumulated OCI in the consolidated statements of equity, to the extent impairment losses are considered temporary. 
  Deferred Costs 
  Deferred costs primarily include deferred financing costs and deferred lease costs.  Deferred financing costs represent commitment fees, legal and other third-party costs associated with obtaining financing.  Costs related to revolving credit facilities are recorded in other assets and are amortized to interest expense using the straight-line basis over the term of the facility.  Costs related to other borrowings are recorded net against the carrying value of such borrowings and are amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method.  Unamortized deferred financing costs are expensed when the associated facility is repaid before maturity.  Costs incurred in seeking financing transactions, which do not close, are expensed in the period in which it is determined that the financing will not occur.  Deferred lease costs consist of fees incurred to initiate and renew operating leases, which are amortized on a straight-line basis over the remaining lease term and are recorded to depreciation and amortization in the consolidated statements of operations.  
  Intangible Assets and Intangible Liabilities  
  The Company records acquired identified intangibles, which includes intangible assets (such as value of the above-market leases, in-place leases, below-market ground leases, goodwill and other intangibles) and intangible liabilities (such as the value of below-market leases), based on estimated fair value.  The value allocated to the identified intangibles are amortized over the remaining lease term.  Above/below-market leases are amortized into rental income, below-market ground leases are amortized into real estate properties-operating expense and in-place leases are amortized into depreciation and amortization expense. 
  Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination and is not amortized.  The Company analyzes goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be fully recoverable.  The Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit, related to such goodwill, is less than the carrying amount as a basis to determine whether the two-step impairment test is necessary.  The first step in the impairment test compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount.  If the carrying amount exceeds fair value, the second step is required to determine the amount of the impairment loss, if any, by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of such goodwill.  The implied fair value of goodwill is derived by performing a hypothetical purchase price allocation for the reporting unit as of the measurement date, allocating the reporting unit s estimated fair value to its net assets and identifiable intangible assets.  The residual amount represents the implied fair value of goodwill.  To the extent this amount is below the carrying value of goodwill, an impairment loss is recorded in the consolidated statements of operations.  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , there were no triggering events that required a test of impairment of goodwill.

Revenue Recognition 
  Operating Real Estate 
  Rental and escalation income from operating real estate is derived from leasing of space to various types of tenants and healthcare operators.  Rental revenue recognition commences when the tenant takes possession of the leased space and the leased space is substantially ready for its intended use.  The leases are for fixed terms of varying length and generally provide for annual rentals and expense reimbursements to be paid in monthly installments.  Rental income from leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the respective leases.  The excess of rents recognized over amounts contractually due pursuant to the underlying leases are included in unbilled rent receivable in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets.  The Company amortizes any tenant inducements as a reduction of revenue utilizing the straight-line method over the term of the lease.  Escalation income represents revenue from tenant/operator leases which provide for the recovery of all or a portion of the operating expenses and real estate taxes paid by the Company on behalf of the respective property.  This revenue is accrued in the same period as the expenses are incurred.   
  The Company generates operating income from healthcare and hotel properties permitted by RIDEA.  Revenue related to healthcare properties includes resident room and care charges and other resident charges.  Revenue related to operating hotel properties primarily consists of room and food and beverage sales.  Revenue is recognized when such services are provided, generally defined as the date upon which a resident or guest occupies a room or uses the healthcare property or hotel services and is recorded in resident fee income for healthcare properties and hotel related income for hotel properties in the consolidated statements of operations. 
  In a situation in which a lease(s) associated with a significant tenant have been, or are expected to be, terminated early, the Company evaluates the remaining useful life of depreciable or amortizable assets in the asset group related to the lease that will be terminated (i.e., tenant improvements, above- and below-market lease intangibles, in-place lease value and deferred leasing costs).  Based upon consideration of the facts and circumstances surrounding the termination, the Company may write-off or accelerate the depreciation and amortization associated with the asset group.  Such amounts are included within rental and escalation income for above-and below-market lease intangibles and depreciation and amortization in the consolidated statements of operations. 
  Real Estate Debt Investments 
  Interest income is recognized on an accrual basis and any related premium, discount, origination costs and fees are amortized over the life of the investment using the effective interest method.  The amortization is reflected as an adjustment to interest income in the consolidated statements of operations.  The amortization of a premium or accretion of a discount is discontinued if such loan is reclassified to held for sale. 
  Real Estate Securities 
  Interest income is recognized using the effective interest method with any premium or discount amortized or accreted through earnings based on expected cash flow through the expected maturity date of the security.  Changes to expected cash flow may result in a change to the yield which is then applied retrospectively for high-credit quality securities that cannot be prepaid or otherwise settled in such a way that the holder would not recover substantially all of the investment or prospectively for all other securities to recognize interest income. 
  Credit Losses and Impairment on Investments 
  Operating Real Estate 
  The Company s real estate portfolio is reviewed on a quarterly basis, or more frequently as necessary, to assess whether there are any indicators that the value of its operating real estate may be impaired or that its carrying value may not be recoverable.  A property s value is considered impaired if the Company s estimate of the aggregate expected future undiscounted cash flow to be generated by the property is less than the carrying value of the property.  In conducting this review, the Company considers U.S. and global macroeconomic factors and real estate sector conditions together with investment specific and other factors.  To the extent an impairment has occurred, the loss is measured as the excess of the carrying value of the property over the estimated fair value of the property and recorded in impairment losses in the consolidated statements of operations. 
  An allowance for a doubtful account for a receivable is established based on a periodic review of aged receivables resulting from estimated losses due to the inability of such tenant/operator/resident/guest to make required rent and other payments contractually due.  Additionally, the Company establishes, on a current basis, an allowance for future lessee credit losses on unbilled rent receivable based on an evaluation of the collectability of such amounts.

Real Estate Debt Investments 
  Loans are considered impaired when based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will not be able to collect principal and interest amounts due according to the contractual terms.  The Company assesses the credit quality of the portfolio and adequacy of loan loss reserves on a quarterly basis or more frequently as necessary.  Significant judgment of the Company is required in this analysis.  The Company considers the estimated net recoverable value of the loan as well as other factors, including but not limited to the fair value of any collateral, the amount and the status of any senior debt, the quality and financial condition of the borrower and the competitive situation of the area where the underlying collateral is located.  Because this determination is based on projections of future economic events, which are inherently subjective, the amount ultimately realized may differ materially from the carrying value as of the balance sheet date.  If upon completion of the assessment, the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral is less than the net carrying value of the loan, a loan loss reserve is recorded with a corresponding charge to provision for loan losses.  The loan loss reserve for each loan is maintained at a level that is determined to be adequate by management to absorb probable losses. 
  Income recognition is suspended for a loan at the earlier of the date at which payments become   90  -days past due or when, in the opinion of the Company, a full recovery of income and principal becomes doubtful.  When the ultimate collectability of the principal of an impaired loan is in doubt, all payments are applied to principal under the cost recovery method.  When the ultimate collectability of the principal of an impaired loan is not in doubt, contractual interest is recorded as interest income when received, under the cash basis method until an accrual is resumed when the loan becomes contractually current and performance is demonstrated to be resumed.  A loan is written off when it is no longer realizable and/or legally discharged. 
  Investments in Unconsolidated Ventures 
  The Company reviews its investments in unconsolidated ventures for which the Company did not elect the fair value option on a quarterly basis, or more frequently as necessary, to assess whether there are any indicators that the value may be impaired or that its carrying value may not be recoverable.  An investment is considered impaired if the projected net recoverable amount over the expected holding period is less than the carrying value.  In conducting this review, the Company considers U.S. and global macroeconomic factors, including real estate sector conditions, together with investment specific and other factors.  To the extent an impairment has occurred and is considered to be other than temporary, the loss is measured as the excess of the carrying value of the investment over the estimated fair value and recorded in provision for loss on equity investment in the consolidated statements of operations.   
  Real Estate Securities 
  CRE securities for which the fair value option is elected are not evaluated for other-than-temporary impairment ( OTTI ) as any change in fair value is recorded in the consolidated statements of operations.  Realized losses on such securities are reclassified to realized gain (loss) on investments and other as losses occur.   
  CRE securities for which the fair value option is not elected are evaluated for OTTI quarterly.  Impairment of a security is considered to be other-than-temporary when: (i) the holder has the intent to sell the impaired security; (ii) it is more likely than not the holder will be required to sell the security; or (iii) the holder does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost of the security.  When a CRE security has been deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired due to (i) or (ii), the security is written down to its fair value and an OTTI is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations.  In the case of (iii), the security is written down to its fair value and the amount of OTTI is then bifurcated into: (a) the amount related to expected credit losses; and (b) the amount related to fair value adjustments in excess of expected credit losses.  The portion of OTTI related to expected credit losses is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations.  The remaining OTTI related to the valuation adjustment is recognized as a component of accumulated OCI in the consolidated statements of equity.  The portion of OTTI recognized through earnings is accreted back to the amortized cost basis of the security through interest income, while amounts recognized through OCI are amortized over the life of the security with no impact on earnings.  CRE securities which are not high-credit quality are considered to have an OTTI if the security has an unrealized loss and there has been an adverse change in expected cash flow.  The amount of OTTI is then bifurcated as discussed above.   
  Troubled Debt Restructuring 
  CRE debt investments modified in a troubled debt restructuring ( TDR ) are modifications granting a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties where a lender agrees to terms that are more favorable to the borrower than is otherwise available in the current market.  Management judgment is necessary to determine whether a loan modification is considered a TDR.  Troubled debt that is fully satisfied via taking title to collateral, repossession or other transfers of assets is generally included in the definition of TDR.  Loans acquired as a pool with deteriorated credit quality that have been modified are not considered a TDR.

Equity-Based Compensation 
  The Company accounts for equity-based compensation awards, including awards granted to co-employees, using the fair value method, which requires an estimate of fair value of the award.  Awards may be based on a variety of measures such as time, performance, market or a combination thereof.  For time-based awards, fair value is determined based on the stock price on the grant date.  The Company recognizes compensation expense over the vesting period on a straight-line basis or the attribution method depending if the grant is to an employee or non-employee.  For performance-based awards, fair value is determined based on the stock price at the date of grant and an estimate of the probable achievement of such measure.  The Company recognizes compensation expense over the requisite service period, net of estimated forfeitures, using the accelerated attribution expense method.  For market-based measures, fair value is determined using a Monte Carlo analysis under a risk-neutral premise using a risk-free interest rate.  The Company recognizes compensation expense, over the requisite service period, net of estimated forfeitures, on a straight-line basis.  For awards with a combination of performance or market measures, the Company estimates the fair value as if it were two separate awards.  First, the Company estimates the probability of achieving the performance measure.  If it is not probable the performance condition will be met, the Company records the compensation expense based on the fair value of the market measure, as described above.  This expense is recorded even if the market-based measure is never met.  If the performance-based measure is subsequently estimated to be achieved, the Company records compensation expense based on the performance-based measure.  The Company would then record a cumulative catch-up adjustment for any additional compensation expense.   
  Equity-based compensation issued to non-employees is accounted for using the fair value of the award at the earlier of the performance commitment date or performance completion date.  Time-based awards are remeasured every quarter based on the stock price as of the end of the reporting period until such awards vest, if any.   
  Foreign Currency 
  Assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency for which the functional currency is a foreign currency are translated using the currency exchange rate in effect at the end of the period presented and the results of operations for such entities are translated into U.S. dollars using the average currency exchange rate in effect during the period.  The resulting foreign currency translation adjustment is recorded as a component of accumulated OCI in the consolidated statements of equity.   
  Assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency for which the functional currency is the U.S. dollar are remeasured using the currency exchange rate in effect at the end of the period presented and the results of operations for such entities are remeasured into U.S. dollars using the average currency exchange rate in effect during the period.  The resulting foreign currency remeasurement adjustment is recorded in unrealized gain (loss) on investments and other in the consolidated statements of operations. 
  Earnings Per Share 
  The Company s basic earnings per share ( EPS ) is calculated by dividing net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common stock outstanding.  Diluted EPS includes restricted stock and the potential dilution that could occur if outstanding restricted stock units ( RSUs ) or other contracts to issue common stock, assuming performance hurdles have been met, were converted to common stock (including limited partnership interests in the Operating Partnership which are structured as profits interests ( LTIP Units ) (refer to Note 10), where such exercise or conversion would result in a lower EPS.  The dilutive effect of such RSUs and LTIP Units is calculated assuming all units are converted to common stock. 
  Discontinued Operations 
  Subsequent to the early adoption of the accounting standards update on the presentation of discontinued operations beginning in April 2014, the Company presents spin-offs of businesses and portfolios of properties that are sold or classified as held for sale as discontinued operations provided that the disposal represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on the Company s operations and financial results. 
  Income Taxes  
  The Company has elected to be taxed as a REIT and to comply with the related provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, the ( Code ).  Accordingly, the Company generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax to the extent of its distributions to stockholders and as long as certain asset, income and share ownership tests are met.  To maintain its qualification as a REIT, the Company must annually distribute at least 90% of its REIT taxable income to its stockholders and meet certain other requirements.  The Company may also be subject to certain state, local and franchise taxes.  Under certain circumstances, federal income and excise taxes may be due on its undistributed taxable income.  If the Company were to fail to meet these requirements, it would be subject to U.S. federal income tax, which could have a material adverse impact on its results of operations

and amounts available for distributions to its stockholders.  The Company believes that all of the criteria to maintain the Company s REIT qualification have been met for the applicable periods, but there can be no assurance that these criteria will continue to be met in subsequent periods.   
  The Company may invest through a taxable REIT subsidiary ( TRS ) which can be subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes and foreign taxes.  In general, a TRS of the Company may perform non-customary services for tenants, hold assets that the REIT cannot hold directly and may engage in real estate or non-real estate-related business.  The Company has established several TRSs in jurisdictions for which no taxes are assessed on corporate earnings.  The Company generally must include in earnings the income from these TRSs even if it has received no cash distributions.  Additionally, the Company has invested in certain real estate assets in Europe, for which local country level taxes will be due on earnings (or other measure) and in some cases withholding taxes for the repatriation of earnings back to the REIT.  The REIT will not generally be subject to any additional U.S. taxes on the repatriation of its earnings. 
  Current and deferred taxes are recorded on the portion of earnings (losses) recognized by the Company with respect to its interest in TRSs and taxable foreign subsidiaries.  Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are calculated based on temporary differences between the Company s U.S. GAAP consolidated financial statements and the federal, state, local and foreign tax basis of assets and liabilities as of the consolidated balance sheet date.  The Company evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets (e.g., net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards) and recognizes a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of its deferred tax assets will not be realized.  When evaluating the realizability of its deferred tax assets, the Company considers estimates of expected future taxable income, existing and projected book/tax differences, tax planning strategies available and the general and industry specific economic outlook.  This realizability analysis is inherently subjective, as it requires the Company to forecast its business and general economic environment in future periods.  Changes in estimate of deferred tax asset realizability, if any, are included in provision for income tax expense included in income tax benefit (expense) in the consolidated statements of operations.

  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB ) issued an accounting update requiring a company to recognize as revenue the amount of consideration it expects to be entitled to in connection with the transfer of promised goods or services to customers.  The accounting standard update will replace most of the existing revenue recognition guidance currently promulgated by U.S. GAAP.  In July 2015, the FASB decided to delay the effective date of the new revenue standard by one year.  The effective date of the new revenue standard for the Company will be January 1, 2018.  The Company is evaluating the impact, if any, of the update on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and financial statement disclosures.   
  In February 2015, the FASB issued updated guidance that changes the rules regarding consolidation.  The pronouncement eliminates specialized guidance for limited partnerships and similar legal entities and removes the indefinite deferral for certain investment funds.  The new guidance is effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted.  The Company adopted this guidance in the first quarter 2016 and determined the Company s Operating Partnership is considered a VIE.  The Company is the primary beneficiary of the VIE, the VIE s assets can be used for purposes other than the settlement of the VIE s obligations and the Company s partnership interest is considered a majority voting interest.  As such, this standard resulted in the identification of additional VIEs, however it did not have a material impact on the Company s consolidated financial position or results of operations.  Refer to Note 16 for further disclosure. 
  In January 2016, the FASB issued an accounting update that addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments.  The new guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017.  The Company is evaluating the impact, if any, that this guidance will have on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and financial statement disclosures. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued an accounting update that requires lessees to present right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet.  The new guidance is to be applied using a modified retrospective approach at the beginning of the earliest comparative period in the financial statements and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption is permitted.  The Company is evaluating the impact, if any, that this guidance will have on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and financial statement disclosures.

In March 2016, the FASB issued guidance clarifying that an assessment of whether an embedded contingent put or call option is clearly and closely related to a borrowing requires only an analysis of the four-step decision sequence.  Additionally, entities are not required to separately assess whether the contingency itself is clearly and closely related.  Entities are required to apply the guidance to existing instruments in scope using a modified retrospective transition method as of the period of adoption.  The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those years.  Early adoption is permitted.  The Company is evaluating the impact, if any, that this guidance will have on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and financial statement disclosures. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued guidance which eliminates the requirement for an investor to retroactively apply the equity method when its increase in ownership interest (or degree of influence) in an investee triggers equity method accounting.  The update requires that the equity method investor add the cost of acquiring the additional interest in the investee to the current basis of the investor s previously held interest and adopt the equity method of accounting as of the date the investment become qualified for equity method accounting.  The update should be applied prospectively upon their effective date to increases in the level of ownership interests or degree of influence that results in the adoption of the equity method.  The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption is permitted.  The Company has concluded that this guidance will not have any impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and financial statement disclosures. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued guidance which amends several aspects of the accounting for equity-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statements of cash flows.  The guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017.  The Company is evaluating the impact, if any, that this guidance will have on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and financial statement disclosures. 
  In June 2016, the FASB issued guidance which changes how entities will measure credit losses for most financial assets and certain other instruments that are not measured at fair value through net income.  Additionally, entities will have to disclose significantly more information, including information used to track credit quality by year of origination, for most financing receivables.  The new guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2019.  Early adoption is permitted.  The Company is evaluating the impact, if any, that this guidance will have on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and financial statement disclosures. 
  In September 2016, the FASB issued final amendments to clarify how entities should classify certain cash receipts and cash payments in the consolidated statement of cash flows as they may have aspects of more than one class of cash flows.  The guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017.  The Company is evaluating the impact, if any, that this guidance will have in its consolidated statement of cash flows.

    Operating Real Estate 
     The following table presents operating real estate, net as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   (dollars in thousands):  

Real Estate Impairment 
  During the quarter ended September 30, 2016, the Company identified an indicator of impairment at   18   of its hotels in one of its hotel portfolios, primarily due to decreased operating performance and continued economic weakness. As required by the impairment guidance, once an indicator of impairment is identified, the Company is required to perform a test of recoverability. This test compares the sum of the estimated future cash flow attributable to the hotel over its remaining anticipated holding period

and from its disposition to its carrying value. Assumptions used for the individual hotels were determined by management, based on discussions with NSAM s asset management group and its hotel management company. The Company determined that the estimated undiscounted future cash flow attributable to the hotels did not exceed their carrying value and impairment existed. As a result, the Company recorded a   $69.7 million   impairment charge in the consolidated statements of operations. Fair value was determined based on a discounted cash flow using third-party market data, considered Level 3 inputs. As the fair value of the properties impaired for the three months ended September 30, 2016 was determined in part by management estimates, a reasonable possibility exists that future changes to inputs and assumptions could affect the accuracy of management s estimates and such future changes could lead to recovery of impairment or further possible impairment in the future. 
  In addition, in connection with a property held for sale, the Company recognized a   $0.7 million   impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of such property as compared to its estimated net realizable value. The impairment charge was based upon certain disposition costs incurred in connection with such sale. These inputs are classified as Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

              (2) 
    Excludes   $2.8 million   of provision for loan losses primarily relating to exit fees on real estate debt, held for sale. 
     Credit Quality Monitoring 
  CRE debt investments are typically loans secured by direct senior priority liens on real estate properties or by interests in entities that directly own real estate properties, which serve as the primary source of cash for the payment of principal and interest.  The Company evaluates its debt investments at least quarterly and differentiates the relative credit quality principally based on: (i) whether the borrower is currently paying contractual debt service in accordance with its contractual terms; and (ii) whether the Company believes the borrower will be able to perform under its contractual terms in the future, as well as the Company s expectations as to the ultimate recovery of principal at maturity. 
  The Company categorizes a debt investment for which it expects to receive full payment of contractual principal and interest payments as a  loan with no loan loss reserve.   The Company categorizes a debt investment as an NPL if it is in maturity default and/or past due at least   90   days on its contractual debt service payments.  The Company considers the remaining debt investments to be of weaker credit quality and categorizes such loans as  other loans with a loan loss reserve/non-accrual status.   These loans are not considered NPLs because such loans are performing in accordance with contractual terms but the loans have a loan loss reserve and/or are on non-accrual status.  Even if a borrower is currently paying contractual debt service or debt service is not due in accordance with its contractual terms, the Company may still determine that the borrower may not be able to perform under its contractual terms in the future and make full payment upon maturity.  The Company s definition of an NPL may differ from that of other companies that track NPLs. 
  The following table presents the carrying value of CRE debt investments, by credit quality indicator, as of each applicable balance sheet date (dollars in thousands):

    Investments in Private Equity Funds 
     The following is a description of investments in private equity funds that own PE Investments either through unconsolidated ventures ( PE Investment I  and  PE Investment II ) or consolidated ventures and direct investments ( PE Investment III to XIV,  collectively  Direct PE Investments ) which are recorded as investments in private equity funds at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets.  The Company elected the fair value option for PE Investments, of which certain are cost method investments and the remainder are equity method investments.  As a result, the Company records equity in earnings (losses) based on the change in fair value for its share of the projected future cash flow from one period to another.  All PE Investments are considered variable interest entities, except for PE Investment I and II (refer to Note 16).  PE Investment I and II are considered voting interest entities and are not consolidated by the Company due to the substantive participating rights of the partners in joint ventures that own the interests in the real estate private equity funds.  The Company does not consolidate any of the underlying real estate private equity funds owned in Direct PE Investments as it does not own a majority voting interest in any such funds or is not the primary beneficiary of such funds.   
  The following tables summarize the Company s PE Investments as of   September 30, 2016   (dollars in millions):

Accordingly, the Company funded   $282.1 million   and NorthStar Real Estate Income Trust, Inc. ( NorthStar Income ) (together with the Company, the  NorthStar Entities ) funded   $118.0 million  .

  PE Investment I provides for all cash distributions on a priority basis to the NorthStar Entities as follows: (i) first,   85%   to the NorthStar Entities and   15%   to the Class B Partner until the NorthStar Entities receive a   1.5  x multiple on all of their invested capital, including amounts funded in connection with future capital commitments; (ii) second,   15%   to the NorthStar Entities and   85%   to the Class B Partner until the Class B Partner receives a return of its then remaining June 30, 2012 capital; and (iii) third,   51%   to the NorthStar Entities and   49%   to the Class B Partner.  All amounts paid to and received by the NorthStar Entities are based on each partner s proportionate interest.

The Company and NorthStar Income each agreed to indemnify the other proportionately for any losses that may arise in connection with the funding and other obligations as set forth in the governing documents in the case of a joint default by the Company and NorthStar Income.  The Company and NorthStar Income further agreed to indemnify each other for all of the losses that may arise as a result of a default that is solely caused by the Company or NorthStar Income, as the case may be.

    As of   September 30, 2016  , the weighted average remaining life of the N-Star CDO bonds and N-Star CDO equity is   1.3   years and   2.4   years, respectively. 
     The Company sponsored   nine   CDOs,   three   of which were primarily collateralized by CRE debt and   six   of which were primarily collateralized by CRE securities.  The Company acquired equity interests of   two   CRE debt focused CDOs, the CSE RE 2006-A CDO ( CSE CDO ) and the CapLease 2005-1 CDO ( CapLease CDO ) sponsored by third parties.  These CDOs are collectively referred to as the N-Star CDOs.  All N-Star CDOs are considered VIEs (refer to Note 16).  At the time of issuance of the sponsored CDOs, the Company retained the below investment grade bonds, which are referred to as subordinate bonds, and preferred shares and equity notes, which are referred to as equity interests.  In addition, the Company repurchased CDO bonds originally issued to third parties at discounts to par.  These repurchased CDO bonds and retained subordinate bonds are herein collectively referred to as N-Star CDO bonds. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company s CRE securities portfolio is comprised of N-Star CDO bonds and N-Star CDO equity and other securities which are predominantly conduit commercial mortgage-backed securities ( CMBS ), meaning each asset is a pool backed by a large number of commercial real estate loans.  As a result, this portfolio is typically well-diversified by collateral type and geography.  As of   September 30, 2016  , contractual maturities of CRE securities investments ranged from   three   months to   37   years, with a weighted average expected maturity of   3.2   years.

The Company recognized a   $9.7 million   net cash gain related to acceleration of discount in connection with these sales.  For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2015  , proceeds from the sale of CRE securities were   $14.9 million   and   $95.7 million   resulting in a net realized gain of   $9.3 million   and   $22.1 million  , respectively.

Based on management s quarterly evaluation, the Company recorded OTTI of   $0.4 million   and   $12.5 million   for the three and   nine months ended September 30, 2016  , respectively, which was recorded in realized gain (loss) on investments and other in the consolidated statements of operations.

  The Company s management agreement with NSAM provides that in the event of a change of control of NSAM or other event that could be deemed an assignment of the management agreement, the Company will consider such assignment in good faith and not unreasonably withhold, condition or delay the Company s consent.  The management agreement further provides that the Company anticipates consent would be granted for an assignment or deemed assignment to a party with expertise in commercial real estate and over   $10 billion   of assets under management.

  In addition, the Company, together with NorthStar Europe and any company spun-off from the Company or NorthStar Europe, will pay directly or reimburse NSAM for up to   50%   of any long-term bonus or other compensation that NSAM s compensation committee determines shall be paid and/or settled in the form of equity and/or equity-based compensation to executives, employees and service providers of NSAM during any year.  Subject to this limitation and limitations contained in any applicable management agreement between NSAM and NorthStar Europe or any company spun-off from the Company or NorthStar Europe, the amount paid by the Company, NorthStar Europe and any company spun-off from the Company or NorthStar Europe will be determined by NSAM in its discretion.  At the discretion of NSAM s compensation committee, this compensation may be granted in shares of the Company s restricted stock, restricted stock units, LTIP Units or other forms of equity compensation or stock-based awards; provided that if at any time a sufficient number of shares of the Company s common stock are not available for issuance under the Company s equity compensation plan, such compensation shall be paid in the form of RSUs, LTIP Units or other securities that may be settled in cash.  The Company s equity compensation for each year may be allocated on an individual-by-individual basis at the discretion of the NSAM compensation committee and, as long as the aggregate amount of the equity compensation for such year does not exceed the limits set forth in the management agreement, the proportion of any particular individual s equity compensation may be greater or less than   50%  . 
  In connection with the above obligation, the Company was responsible for paying approximately   50%   of the 2015 and 2014 long-term bonuses earned under the NorthStar Asset Management Group Inc.  Executive Incentive Bonus Plan ( NSAM Bonus Plan ).  Long-term bonuses were paid to executives in the form of equity-based awards of both the Company and NSAM, subject to performance-based and time-based vesting conditions over the   four  -year performance period from January 1, 2014 through December 31, 2017.  The long-term bonuses paid in the form of equity-based awards of the Company were adjusted for the NRE Spin-off and Reverse Split in the same manner as all other equity-based awards of the Company. 
  Investment Opportunities 
  Under the management agreement, the Company agreed to make available to NSAM for the benefit of NSAM and its managed companies, including the Company, all investment opportunities sourced by the Company.  NSAM agreed to fairly allocate such opportunities among NSAM s managed companies, including the Company and NSAM in accordance with an investment allocation policy.  Pursuant to the management agreement, the Company is entitled to fair and reasonable compensation for its services in connection with any loan origination opportunities sourced by the Company, which may include first mortgage loans, subordinate mortgage interests, mezzanine loans and preferred equity interests, in each case relating to commercial real estate.

    Compensation Expense 
     Summary 
    
  The following table presents a summary of compensation expense for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   (dollars in thousands): 

Equity-Based Compensation 
  The Company has issued equity-based awards to directors, officers, employees, consultants and advisors pursuant to the NorthStar Realty Finance Corp. 2004 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan (the  Stock Plan ) and the NorthStar Realty Executive Incentive Bonus Plan, as amended (the  Plan  and collectively the  NorthStar Realty Equity Plans ). 
  Prior to the NSAM Spin-off, the Company conducted substantially all of its operations and made its investments through an operating partnership which issued LTIP Units as equity-based compensation.  Additionally, prior to the NSAM Spin-off, the Company completed an internal corporate reorganization whereby the Company collapsed its   three   tier holding company structure, including such operating partnership, into a single tier (the  Reorganization ).  All of the vested and unvested equity-based awards granted by the Company prior to the NSAM Spin-off remain outstanding following the Reorganization and the NSAM Spin-off.  Appropriate adjustments were made to all awards to reflect the Reorganization, the Reverse Split and the NSAM Spin-off and NRE Spin-off, collectively referred to as the Spin-offs.  Pursuant to the Reorganization, such LTIP Units were converted into an equal number of shares of common stock of the Company (refer to Note 12), which are referred to as restricted stock, and holders of such shares received an equal number of shares of NSAM s common stock in connection with the NSAM Spin-off, all of which generally remain subject to the same vesting and other terms that applied prior to the NSAM Spin-off.  In connection with the NSAM Spin-off, equity and equity-based awards relating to the Company s common stock, such as RSUs and Deferred LTIP Units, were adjusted to also relate to an equal number of shares of NSAM s common stock, but otherwise generally remain subject to the same vesting and other terms that applied prior to the NSAM Spin-off.  Vesting conditions for outstanding awards have been adjusted to reflect the impact of NSAM in terms of employment for service based on awards and total stockholder return for performance-based awards with respect to periods after the NSAM Spin-off. 
  In connection with the formation of the Operating Partnership, the Operating Partnership issued LTIP Units to each holder of the Company s outstanding Deferred LTIP Units, which were equity awards representing the right to receive either LTIP units in the Company s successor operating partnership or, if such LTIP units were not available upon settlement of the award, shares of

common stock of the Company, in settlement of such Deferred LTIP Units on a   one   for one basis in accordance with the terms of the outstanding Deferred LTIP Units.  Conditioned upon minimum allocations to the capital account of the LTIP Unit for federal income tax purposes, each LTIP Unit will be convertible, at the election of the holder, into   one   common unit of limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership ( OP Unit ).  Each of the OP Units underlying these LTIP Units will be redeemable at the election of the OP Unit holder for: (i) cash equal to the then fair market value of one share of the Company s common stock; or (ii) at the option of the Company in its capacity as general partner of the Operating Partnership, one share of the Company s common stock.  LTIP Units issued remain subject to the same vesting terms as the Deferred LTIP Units. 
  In connection with the NRE Spin-off, equity and equity-based awards relating to the Company s common stock, such as RSUs, were adjusted to also relate to   one   share of NorthStar Europe common stock for each six shares of the Company s common stock, but otherwise generally remain subject to the same vesting and other terms that applied prior to the NRE Spin-off.  Appropriate adjustments were also made to all awards to reflect the Reverse Split.  
  Following the Spin-offs, the Company and the compensation committee of its board of directors (the  Committee ) continues to administer all awards issued under the NorthStar Realty Equity Plans but NSAM and NorthStar Europe are obligated to issue shares of their common stock or other equity awards of their subsidiaries or make cash payments in lieu thereof with respect to dividend or distribution equivalent obligations to the extent required by such awards previously issued under the NorthStar Realty Equity Plans.  These awards will continue to be governed by the NorthStar Realty Equity Plans, as applicable, and shares of NSAM s common stock or NorthStar Europe s common stock issued pursuant to these awards will not be issued pursuant to, or reduce availability, under the NorthStar Realty Equity Plans. 
  All of the adjustments made in connection with the Reorganization, the Spin-offs and the Reverse Splits were deemed to be equitable adjustments pursuant to anti-dilution provisions in accordance with the terms of the NorthStar Realty Equity Plans.  As a result, there was no incremental value attributed to these adjustments and these adjustments do not impact the amount recorded for equity-based compensation expense for the   three   and   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  . 
  The following summarizes the equity-based compensation plans and related expenses. 
  All share amounts and related information disclosed below have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the Reverse Split.  
  NorthStar Realty Equity Plans 
  Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan 
  In September 2004, the board of directors of the Company adopted the Stock Plan, and such plan, as amended and restated, was further adopted by the board of directors of the Company on April 27, 2016 and approved by the stockholders on June 20, 2016.  The Stock Plan provides for the issuance of stock-based incentive awards, including incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, shares of common stock of the Company, in the form of restricted stock and other equity-based awards such as LTIP Units or any combination of the foregoing.  The eligible participants in the Stock Plan include directors, officers, employees, consultants and advisors of the Company. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   791,552   unvested shares of restricted stock issued under the Stock Plan were outstanding and   3,400,652   shares of common stock remained available for issuance pursuant to the Stock Plan, which includes shares reserved for issuance upon settlement of outstanding LTIP Units and RSUs.  Holders of shares of restricted stock or LTIP Units are entitled to receive dividends or distributions with respect to the Company s shares of restricted stock and vested and unvested LTIP Units for as long as such shares and LTIP Units remain outstanding. 
  Incentive Compensation Plan 
  In July 2009, the Committee approved the material terms of the Plan for the Company s executive officers and other employees.  Pursuant to the Plan, an incentive pool was established each calendar year through 2013.  The size of the incentive pool was calculated as the sum of: (a)   1.75%   of the Company s  adjusted equity capital  for the year; and (b)   25%   of the Company s adjusted funds from operations, as adjusted, above a   9%   return hurdle on adjusted equity capital.  Payout from the incentive pool is or was subject to achievement of additional performance and/or time-based goals summarized below. 
  The portion of the incentive pool for the executive officers was divided into the following   three   separate incentive compensation components: (a) an annual cash bonus, tied to annual performance of the Company and paid prior to or shortly after completion of the year-end audit ( Annual Bonus  (b) a deferred bonus, determined based on the same year s performance, but paid   50%   following the close of each of the first and second years after such incentive pool is determined, subject to the participant s continued employment through each payment date ( Deferred Bonus  and (c) a long-term incentive in the form of RSUs, LTIP Units and/or Deferred LTIP Units.  RSUs are subject to the Company achieving cumulative performance hurdles and/or total stockholder

return hurdles established by the Committee for a   three  - or   four  -year period, subject to the participant s continued employment through the payment date.  Upon the conclusion of the applicable performance period, each executive officer will receive a payout, if any, equal to the value of   one   share of common stock at the time of such payout, including the dividends paid with respect to a share of common stock following the first year of the applicable performance period, for each RSU actually earned (the  Long-Term Amount Value ).  The Long-Term Amount Value, if any, other than the portion related to dividends paid, will be paid in the form of shares of common stock of the Company or LTIP Units in the Operating Partnership, to the extent available under the NorthStar Realty Equity Plans, or in cash to the extent shares of common stock of the Company or LTIP Units in the Operating Partnership are unavailable under the NorthStar Realty Equity Plans, and, pursuant to adjustments made in connection with the NSAM Spin-off and the NRE Spin-off, shares of NSAM s common stock or LTIP Units in NSAM s operating partnership and shares of NorthStar Europe s common stock or LTIP Units in NorthStar Europe s operating partnership (the  Long-Term Amount Payout ).  These performance-based RSUs were adjusted to refer to combined total stockholder return of the Company and NSAM with respect to periods after the NSAM Spin-off.  These performance-based RSUs were again adjusted to refer to combined total stockholder return of the Company, NorthStar Europe and NSAM after the NRE Spin-off.  Restricted stock or LTIP Units granted as a portion of the long-term incentive are subject to vesting based on continued employment during the performance period, but are not subject to performance-based vesting hurdles.  
  Under the Plan, for 2011, the Company issued   381,449   RSUs to executive officers which were subject to vesting based on continued employment and achieving total stockholder return hurdles for the   four  -year period ended   December 31, 2014  .  The grant date fair value was   $4.32   per RSU determined using a risk-free interest rate of   0.42%  .  As of   December 31, 2014  , the Company determined the performance hurdle was met which resulted in all of these RSUs vesting.  To settle these RSUs, the Company issued   24,575   shares of common stock, net of the minimum statutory tax withholding requirements, on January 1, 2015 and the Operating Partnership issued   334,871   LTIP Units.  Under the Plan, for 2011, the Company also granted   381,449   LTIP Units to executive officers which were subject to vesting in   four   annual installments ending on January 29, 2015, subject to the executive officer s continued employment through the applicable vesting date, and were converted into shares of restricted stock pursuant to the Reorganization.  The Company also granted   151,340   shares of restricted stock (net of forfeitures occurring through   September 30, 2016  ) to certain non-executive employees, which were subject to vesting quarterly over   three   years beginning April 2012, subject to continued employment through the applicable vesting date.

As of   December 31, 2015  , the Company determined the performance hurdle was met which resulted in all of these RSUs vesting.

Under the Plan, for 2012, the Company also granted   352,418   LTIP Units to executive officers which were subject to vesting in   four   annual installments beginning on January 29, 2013, subject to the executive officer s continued employment through the applicable vesting date, and were converted into shares of restricted stock pursuant to the Reorganization.

  Under the Plan, for 2013, the Company issued   250,184   RSUs to executive officers which are subject to vesting based on continued employment and achieving total stockholder return hurdles for the   four  -year period ending December 31, 2016.

Such Deferred LTIP Units were subsequently settled as LTIP Units in the Operating Partnership or shares of restricted stock, which remain subject to the same vesting terms that applied to the Deferred LTIP Units.

Such Deferred LTIP Units were settled as LTIP Units in the Operating Partnership or shares of restricted stock, which remain subject to the same vesting terms that applied to the Deferred LTIP Units. 
  In connection with the NSAM Bonus Plan, for 2015, a portion of the long-term bonus was paid in restricted shares of common stock and a portion of the long-term bonus was paid by the Company by issuing RSUs.  In connection with the 2015 long-term bonuses paid by the Company, in February 2016, the Company granted   1,006,006   restricted shares of common stock to NSAM s executive officers, of which   25%   were vested upon grant and the remainder is subject to vesting in equal installments on December 31, 2016, 2017 and 2018, subject to the recipient s continued employment through the applicable vesting dates.

In addition, in February 2016, the Company granted   583,261   RSUs to NSAM s executive officers, which are subject to vesting based on the Company s absolute total stockholder return, CAD and continued employment over the   four  -year period ending December 31, 2018.

    Stockholders  Equity 
     Reverse Split 
  On November 1, 2015, the Company effected a Reverse Split of its common stock with any fractional shares settled in cash.  As a result of the Reverse Split, common stock was reduced by dividing the par value prior to the Reverse Split by   two   (including retrospective adjustment of prior periods) with a corresponding increase to additional paid-in capital.  The par value per share of common stock remained unchanged. 
  Share and per share amounts disclosed in the Company s consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the Reverse Split, including common stock outstanding, earnings per share and shares or units outstanding related to equity-based compensation, where applicable (refer to Note 10). 
  Share Repurchase 
  In September 2015, the Company s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to   $500.0 million   of its outstanding common stock.  The authorization expired in September 2016.  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company repurchased   3.9   million shares of its common stock for   $50.0 million  .  From September 2015 through   September 30, 2016  , the Company repurchased   10.4 million   shares for   $168.0 million  . 
  Dividend Reinvestment Plan 
  In April 2007, as amended effective January 1, 2012, the Company implemented a Dividend Reinvestment Plan (the  DRP ), pursuant to which it registered with the SEC and reserved for issuance   3,569,962   shares of its common stock, after giving effect to the Reverse Split.  Pursuant to the amended terms of the DRP, stockholders are able to automatically reinvest all or a portion of their dividends for additional shares of the Company s common stock.  The Company expects to use the proceeds from the DRP for general corporate purposes.  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , the Company issued   11,808   shares of its common stock pursuant to the DRP for   $0.2 million   of proceeds.

Earnings Per Share 
  The following table presents EPS for the   three and nine   months ended and   September 30, 2016   and   2015   (dollars and shares in thousands, except per share data): 

____________________________________________________________ 
           (1) 
    The EPS calculation takes into account LTIP Units, which receive non-forfeitable dividends from the date of grant, share equally in the Company s net income (loss) and convert on a   one  -for-one basis into common stock. 
              (2) 
    Excludes the effect of exchangeable senior notes, restricted stock and RSUs outstanding that were not dilutive as of   September 30, 2016  .  These instruments could potentially impact diluted EPS in future periods, depending on changes in the Company s stock price and other factors. 
       
           12. 
    Non-controlling Interests 
     Operating Partnership 
  Non-controlling interests include the aggregate LTIP Units held by limited partners (the  Unit Holders ) in the Operating Partnership.  Net income (loss) attributable to this non-controlling interest is based on the weighted average Unit Holders  ownership percentage of the Operating Partnership for the respective period.  The issuance of additional common stock or LTIP Units changes

the percentage ownership of both the Unit Holders and the Company.  Since an LTIP Unit is generally redeemable for cash or common stock at the option of the Company, it is deemed to be equivalent to common stock.  Therefore, such transactions are treated as capital transactions and result in an allocation between stockholders  equity and non-controlling interests on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets to account for the change in the ownership of the underlying equity in the Operating Partnership.  On a quarterly basis, the carry value of such non-controlling interest is allocated based on the number of LTIP Units held by Unit Holders in total in proportion to the number of LTIP Units in total plus the number of shares of common stock.  As of   September 30, 2016  , LTIP Units of   1,855,571   were outstanding representing a   1.0%   ownership and non-controlling interest in the Operating Partnership.  Net income (loss) attributable to the Operating Partnership non-controlling interest for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   was a net loss of   $1.0 million   and   $1.3 million  , respectively.  Net income (loss) attributable to the Operating Partnership non-controlling interest for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   was a net loss of $  3.5   million and $  2.4   million, respectively.  In connection with the Mergers, the Operating Partnership will merge with and into NorthStar Realty and each LTIP Unit outstanding as of immediately prior to such effective time will convert into   one   share of common stock. 
  Other 
  Other non-controlling interests represent third-party equity interests in ventures that are consolidated with the Company s financial statements.  Net income (loss) attributable to the other non-controlling interests for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   was a net loss of   $2.5 million   and   $2.2 million  , respectively.  Net income (loss) attributable to the other non-controlling interests for the   nine months ended September 30, 2016   and   2015   was a net loss of $  4.4   million and $  12.7   million, respectively.  
  The following table presents net income (loss) attributable to the Company s common stockholders for the   three and nine   months   September 30, 2016   and   2015   (dollars in thousands): 

Fair Value Measurement 
  The fair value of financial instruments is categorized based on the priority of the inputs to the valuation technique and categorized into a three-level fair value hierarchy.  The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3).  If the inputs used to measure the financial instruments fall within different levels of the hierarchy, the categorization is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the instrument. 
  Financial assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets and are categorized based on the inputs to the valuation techniques as follows: 
           Level 1. 
    Quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in an active market. 
              Level 2. 
    Financial assets and liabilities whose values are based on the following: 
              (a) 
    Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets. 
              (b) 
    Quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in non-active markets. 
              (c) 
    Pricing models whose inputs are observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. 
              (d) 
    Pricing models whose inputs are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. 
              Level 3. 
    Prices or valuation techniques based on inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement.

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis 
  The following is a description of the valuation techniques used to measure fair value of assets and liabilities accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis and the general classification of these instruments pursuant to the fair value hierarchy. 
  PE Investments 
  The Company accounts for PE Investments at fair value which is determined based on a valuation model using assumptions for the timing and amount of expected future cash flow for income and realization events for the underlying assets in the funds and discount rate.  This fair value measurement is generally based on unobservable inputs and, as such, is classified as Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.  The Company is not using the NAV (practical expedient) of the underlying funds for purposes of determining fair value. 
  Investments in Unconsolidated Ventures 
  The Company accounts for certain investments in unconsolidated ventures at fair value determined based on a valuation model using assumptions for the timing and amount of expected future cash flow for income and realization events for the underlying assets, discount rate and foreign currency exchange rates.  Additionally, the Company accounts for a CRE debt investment made in connection with an investment in unconsolidated venture at fair value, which is determined based on comparing the current yield to the estimated yield for newly originated loans with similar credit risk.  These fair value measurements are generally based on unobservable inputs and, as such, are classified as Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. 
  Real Estate Securities 
  N-Star CDO Bonds 
  The fair value of N-Star CDO bonds is determined using quotations from nationally recognized financial institutions that generally acted as underwriter for the transactions.  These quotations are not adjusted and are generally based on a valuation model with observable inputs such as interest rate and other unobservable inputs for assumptions related to the timing and amount of expected future cash flow, discount rate, estimated prepayments and projected losses.  The fair value of subordinate N-Star CDO bonds is determined using an internal price interpolated based on third-party prices of the more senior N-Star CDO bonds of the respective CDO.  All N-Star CDO bonds are classified as Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. 
  N-Star CDO Equity 
  The fair value of N-Star CDO equity is determined based on a valuation model using assumptions for the timing and amount of expected future cash flow for income and realization events for the underlying collateral of these CDOs and discount rate.  This fair value measurement is generally based on unobservable inputs and, as such, is classified as Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. 
  Other CRE Securities 
  Other CRE securities are generally valued using a third-party pricing service or broker quotations.  These quotations are not adjusted and are based on observable inputs that can be validated, and as such, are classified as Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.  Certain CRE securities may be valued based on a single broker quote or an internal price which may have less observable pricing, and as such, would be classified as Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.  Management determines the prices are representative of fair value through a review of available data, including observable inputs, recent transactions as well as its knowledge of and experience in the market. 
  Derivative Instruments 
  Derivative instruments are valued using a third-party pricing service.  These quotations are not adjusted and are generally based on valuation models with observable inputs such as interest rates and contractual cash flow, and as such, are classified as Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.  Derivative instruments are also assessed for credit valuation adjustments due to the risk of non-performance by the Company and derivative counterparties.  If a credit valuation adjustment is applied to a derivative asset or liability, such fair value measurement is classified as Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.  For derivatives held in non-recourse CDO financing structures where, by design, the derivative contracts are senior to all the CDO bonds payable, there is no material impact of a credit valuation adjustment.

CDO Bonds Payable 
  CDO bonds payable are valued using quotations from nationally recognized financial institutions that generally acted as underwriter for the transactions.  These quotations are not adjusted and are generally based on a valuation model with observable inputs such as interest rate and other unobservable inputs for assumptions related to the timing and amount of expected future cash flow, discount rate, estimated prepayments and projected losses.  CDO bonds payable are classified as Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. 
  Junior Subordinated Notes 
  Junior subordinated notes may be valued using quotations from nationally recognized financial institutions or an internal model.  A quotation from a financial institution is not adjusted.  The fair value is  generally based on a valuation model with observable inputs such as interest rate and other unobservable inputs for assumptions related to the implied credit spread of the Company s other borrowings and the timing and amount of expected future cash flow.  Junior subordinated notes are classified as Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. 
  Financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.  The following tables present financial assets and liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   by level within the fair value hierarchy (dollars in thousands):

    Excludes   one   derivative instrument, which for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , an unrealized loss of   $95.9 million   was recorded.  Such amount is net of an unrealized gain of   $23.1 million   related to a credit valuation adjustment. 
     There were   no   transfers, other than those identified in the tables above, during the periods ended   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  . 
  The Company relies on the third-party pricing exception with respect to the requirement to provide quantitative disclosures about significant Level 3 inputs being used to determine fair value measurements related to CRE securities (including N-Star CDO bonds), junior subordinated notes and CDO bonds payable.  The Company believes such pricing service or broker quotation for such items may be based on a market transaction of comparable securities, inputs including forecasted market rates, contractual terms, observable discount rates for similar securities and credit (such as credit support and delinquency rates).

Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Non-recurring Basis 
  Non-financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis in the consolidated financial statements consist of real estate held for sale or assets for which an impairment has been recorded, such as goodwill.  Such fair value measurements are generally considered to be Level 3 within the valuation hierarchy, where applicable, based on estimated sales price, adjusted for closing costs and expenses, determined by discounted cash flow analysis, direct capitalization analyses or a sales comparison approach if no contracts had been consummated.  The discounted cash flow and direct capitalization analyses include all estimated cash inflows and outflows over a specific holding period and, where applicable, any estimated debt premiums.  This cash flow is comprised of unobservable inputs which included forecasted rental revenues and expenses based upon existing in-place leases, market conditions and expectations for growth.  Capitalization rate and discount rate used in these analyses are based upon observable rates that the Company believes to be within a reasonable range of current market rates for the respective properties. 
  Valuations are prepared using internally-developed valuation models.  These valuations are reviewed and approved, during each reporting period, by management, as deemed necessary, including personnel from the accounting, finance and operations and the valuations are updated as appropriate.  In addition, the Company may engage third-party valuation experts to assist with the preparation of certain of its valuations.  Refer to Note 3 for further disclosure regarding non-recurring fair value measurement of impairment on operating real estate. 
  Fair Value Option 
  The Company has historically elected to apply the fair value option for the following financial assets and liabilities existing at the time of adoption or at the time the Company recognizes the eligible item for the purpose of consistent accounting application: CRE securities financed in N-Star CDOs; CDO bonds payable; and junior subordinated notes.  Given past market volatility the Company had observed that the impact of electing the fair value option would generally result in additional variability to the Company s consolidated statements of operations which management believes is not a useful presentation for such financial assets and liabilities.  Therefore, the Company more recently has not elected the fair value option for new investments in CRE securities and securitization financing transactions.  The Company may elect the fair value option for certain of its financial assets or liabilities due to the nature of the instrument.  In the case of PE Investments, certain investments in unconsolidated ventures (refer to Note 6) and N-Star CDO equity, the Company elected the fair value option because management believes it is a more useful presentation for such investments.  The Company determined recording such investments based on the change in fair value of projected future cash flow from one period to another better represents the underlying economics of the respective investment.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments 
  In addition to the above disclosures regarding financial assets or liabilities which are recorded at fair value, U.S. GAAP requires disclosure of fair value about all financial instruments.  The following disclosure of estimated fair value of financial instruments was determined by the Company using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies.  Considerable judgment is necessary to interpret market data and develop estimated fair value.  Accordingly, the estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the Company could realize on disposition of the financial instruments.  The use of different market assumptions and/or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on estimated fair value.   
  The following table presents the principal amount, carrying value and fair value of certain financial assets and liabilities as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   (  dollars   in thousands): 

____________________________________________________________ 
           (1) 
    The fair value of other financial instruments not included in this table is estimated to approximate their carrying value. 
              (2) 
    Refer to  Determination of Fair Value  above for disclosures of methodologies used to determine fair value. 
               (4) 
    The fair value option has been elected for these liabilities. 
     Disclosure about fair value of financial instruments is based on pertinent information available to management as of the reporting date.  Although management is not aware of any factors that would significantly affect fair value, such amounts have not been comprehensively revalued for purposes of these consolidated financial statements since that date and current estimates of fair value may differ significantly from the amounts presented herein. 
  Real Estate Debt Investments 
  For CRE debt investments, fair value was approximated by comparing the current yield to the estimated yield for newly originated loans with similar credit risk or the market yield at which a third party might expect to purchase such investment.  Fair value was determined assuming fully-extended maturities regardless of structural or economic tests required to achieve such extended maturities.  For any CRE debt investments that are deemed impaired, carrying value approximates fair value.  The fair value of CRE debt investments held for sale is determined based on the expected sales price.  Fair value measurements related to CRE debt are generally based on unobservable inputs and, as such, are classified as Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. 
  Mortgage and Other Notes Payable 
  For mortgage and other notes payable, the Company primarily uses rates currently available with similar terms and remaining maturities to estimate fair value.  These measurements are determined using comparable U.S. Treasury rates as of the end of the reporting period or market credit spreads over the rate payable on fixed rate U.S. Treasury of like maturities.  These fair value measurements are based on observable inputs, and as such, are classified as Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.  For the borrowings of properties held for sale, the Company uses available market information, which includes quoted market prices or recent transactions, if available, to estimate their fair value and are, therefore, based on observable inputs, and as such, are classified as Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

Credit Facilities and Term Borrowings 
  As of the reporting date, the Company believes the carrying value of its credit facilities and term borrowings approximate fair value.  These fair value measurements are based on observable inputs, and as such, are classified as Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 
  Exchangeable Senior Notes 
  For the exchangeable senior notes, the Company uses available market information, which includes quoted market prices or recent transactions, if available, to estimate their fair value and are, therefore, based on observable inputs, and as such, are classified as Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 
   
           14. 
    Risk Management and Derivative Activities 
     Derivatives 
  The Company uses derivative instruments primarily to manage interest rate risk and such derivatives are not considered speculative.  These derivative instruments are typically in the form of interest rate swap and cap agreements and the primary objective is to minimize interest rate risks associated with investment and financing activities.  The counterparties of these arrangements are major financial institutions with which the Company may also have other financial relationships.  The Company is exposed to credit risk in the event of non-performance by these counterparties and it monitors their financial condition; however, the Company currently does not anticipate that any of the counterparties will fail to meet their obligations. 
  The following tables present derivative instruments that were not designated as hedges under U.S. GAAP as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015   (dollars in thousands): 

____________________________________________________________ 
            (2) 
    Interest rate swaps in consolidated N-Star CDOs are liabilities and are only subject to the credit risks of the respective CDO transaction.  As the interest rate swaps are senior to all the liabilities of the respective CDO and the fair value of each of the CDO s investments exceeded the fair value of the CDO s derivative liabilities, a credit valuation adjustment was not recorded. 
              (3) 
    Includes a   $2.0 billion   notional forward-starting interest rate swap with a maturity date of December 3, 2029, which requires a mandatory cash redemption by December 3, 2019 at fair value.  
     The change in number and notional amount of derivative instruments from   December 31, 2015   relates to contractual notional amortization and the maturity of interest rate caps in the Company s healthcare portfolio.  The Company had   no   derivative financial instruments that were designated as hedges in qualifying hedging relationships as of   September 30, 2016   and   December 31, 2015  .

The following table presents the effect of derivative instruments in the consolidated statements of operations for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   and   2015   (dollars in thousands): 

The counterparty for the corporate interest rate swap held   $161.2 million   of cash margin as collateral against the derivative contract as of   September 30, 2016  .  The Company s counterparties did not hold any cash margin as collateral against the Company s derivative contracts as of   December 31, 2015  . 
  Risk Management 
  Concentrations of credit risk arise when a number of tenants, operators or issuers related to the Company s investments are engaged in similar business activities or located in the same geographic region to be similarly affected by changes in economic conditions.  The Company monitors its portfolios to identify potential concentrations of credit risks.  With respect to the Company s healthcare portfolio, for the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , Senior Lifestyle Holding Company, LLC was the healthcare operator as it related to   74.4%   of the Company s resident fee income, for each period, and   10.9%   and   10.8%  , respectively, of the Company s total revenue, respectively.  Otherwise, the Company has no other tenant or operator that generates 10% or more of its total revenue.  The Company believes the remainder of its portfolios are reasonably well diversified and do not contain any unusual concentration  s   of credit risks. 
   
           15. 
    Commitments and Contingencies 
     The Company is involved in various litigation matters arising in the ordinary course of its business.  Although the Company is unable to predict with certainty the eventual outcome of any litigation, in the opinion of management, the current legal proceedings are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company s financial position or results of operations. 
  Merger Related Arrangements and Other Costs 
  The Company entered into fee arrangements with service providers and advisors pursuant to which certain fees incurred by the Company in connection with the Mergers will become payable only if the Company consummates the Mergers.  The Company has and will incur other professional fees related to the Mergers.  There can be no assurances that the Company will complete this or any other transaction.  For the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   and since the announcement of the Mergers through   September 30, 2016  , the Company recorded an aggregate of   $3.4 million   and   $10.4 million  , respectively, in transaction costs in the consolidated statements of operations.  To the extent the Mergers are consummated, the Company anticipates incurring a significant amount of additional costs. 
  Guaranty Agreements 
  In connection with certain hotel acquisitions, the Company entered into guaranty agreements with various hotel franchisors, pursuant to which the Company guaranteed the franchisees  obligations, including payments of franchise fees and marketing fees, for the term of the agreements, which expires from 2029 to 2034.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the aggregate amount under these guarantees is   $2.0 million  . 
  In connection with the NRE Spin-off, the   4.635%   senior stock-settlable notes issued by NorthStar Europe and due in December 2016 are senior unsubordinated and unsecured primary obligations of NorthStar Europe and the Company continues to guarantee payments subsequent to the NRE Spin-off.  Subject to certain conditions, NorthStar Europe may elect to settle all or part of the principal amount of the senior notes in its common stock in lieu of cash.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the principal amount outstanding of such senior notes was   $67.2 million  .

16. 
    Variable Interest Entities 
     As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company has identified certain consolidated and unconsolidated VIEs.  Assets of each of the VIEs, other than the Operating Partnership, may only be used to settle obligations of the respective VIE.  Creditors of each of the VIEs have no recourse to the general credit of the Company.  The Company identified several VIEs which were originally consolidated under the voting interest model prior to changes in the consolidation rules under U.S. GAAP (refer to Note 2).   
  Consolidated VIEs 
  The Company s most significant newly identified consolidated VIEs are its Operating Partnership and certain properties that have non-controlling interests.  These entities are VIEs because the non-controlling interests do not have substantive kick-out or participating rights and the Company is the primary beneficiary.  The Operating Partnership consolidates certain properties that have non-controlling interests.  Included in operating real estate, net on the Company s consolidated balance sheets as of   September 30, 2016   is   $6.2 billion   related to such consolidated VIEs.  Included in mortgage and other notes payable on the Company s consolidated balance sheets as of   September 30, 2016   is   $5.7 billion   collateralized by the real estate assets of the related consolidated VIEs.  Included in assets held for sale on the Company s consolidated balance sheets as of   September 30, 2016   is   $2.6 billion   related to such consolidated VIEs.  Included in liabilities related to assets held for sale on the Company s consolidated balance sheets as of   September 30, 2016   is   $1.4 billion   collateralized by the real estate assets of the related consolidated VIEs.  These balances are separate from the assets and liabilities related to the N-Star CDOs.  Included in real estate securities, available for sale on the Company s consolidated balance sheets as of   September 30, 2016   is   $0.3 billion   related to the N-Star CDOs.  Included in CDO bonds payable, at fair value on the Company s consolidated balance sheets as of   September 30, 2016   is   $0.3 billion   collateralized by the real estate securities of the related N-Star CDOs. 
  N-Star CDOs 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company serves as collateral manager and/or special servicer for N-Star CDOs I and IX which are primarily collateralized by CRE securities.  The Company consolidates these entities as the Company has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of these CDOs, and therefore, continues to be the primary beneficiary.   
  The Company is not contractually required to provide financial support to any of the consolidated N-Star CDOs, however, the Company, in its capacity as collateral manager and/or special servicer, may in its sole discretion provide support such as protective and other advances it deems appropriate.  The Company did not provide any other financial support to any of the consolidated N-Star CDOs for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015  .  
  Unconsolidated VIEs 
  N-Star CDOs 
  The Company delegated the collateral management rights for N-Star CDOs IV, VI and VIII and the CapLease CDO on September 30, 2013 and the CSE CDO on December 31, 2013 to a third-party collateral manager/collateral manager delegate who is entitled to a percentage of the senior and subordinate collateral management fees.  The Company continues to receive fees as named collateral manager or collateral manager delegate and retained administrative responsibilities.  The Company evaluated the fees paid to the third-party collateral manager/collateral manager delegate and concluded that such fees represented a variable interest in the deconsolidated loan CDOs and that the third party was functioning as a principal.  The Company determined that the delegation of the Company s collateral management power in the CDOs was a VIE reconsideration event and concluded that these CDOs were still VIEs as the equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest.  The Company then reconsidered if it was the primary beneficiary of such VIEs and determined that it no longer has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of these CDOs, which includes but is not limited to selling collateral, and therefore is no longer the primary beneficiary of such CDOs.  As a result, the Company does not consolidate the assets and liabilities for N-Star CDOs IV, VI and VIII, CSE CDO and the CapLease CDO.  In September 2015, N-Star CDO IV was liquidated. 
  In March 2014, the Company determined it no longer had the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of N-Star CDO V due to the ability of a single party to remove the Company as collateral manager as a result of an existing event of default.  The Company was no longer the primary beneficiary of N-Star CDO V, and as a result, in the first quarter 2014, the Company deconsolidated the assets and liabilities of this CDO. 
  In May 2014, the Company determined it no longer had the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of N-Star CDO III due to the ability of a single party to remove the Company as collateral manager as a result of an

existing event of default.  The Company was no longer the primary beneficiary of N-Star CDO III, and as a result, in the second quarter 2014, the Company deconsolidated the assets and liabilities of this CDO. 
  Similar events of default in the future, if they occur, could cause the Company to deconsolidate its remaining consolidated N-Star CDO financing transactions. 
  Other Unconsolidated VIEs 
  Based on management s analysis, the Company is not the primary beneficiary of the VIEs summarized below and as such, these VIEs are not consolidated into the Company s financial statements as of   September 30, 2016  .  These unconsolidated VIEs are summarized as follows: 
  Real Estate Debt Investments 
  The Company identified certain CRE debt investments with a carrying value of $  173.5 million   as a variable interest in a VIE.  The Company determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of such VIE, and as such, the VIE is not consolidated in the Company s financial statements.  For all other CRE debt investments, the Company determined that these investments are not VIEs and, as such, the Company continues to account for all CRE debt investments as loans. 
  Real Estate Securities 
  The Company identified N-Star CDO bonds, equity and CMBS and other securities (excluding CRE securities in consolidated N-Star CDOs) with a fair value of   $174.0 million   as variable interests in VIEs.  The Company determined that either it was not the controlling class of such securitization or was the controlling class and the Company determined at that time and continues to believe that it does not currently or potentially hold a significant interest in such securitizations and, therefore, is not the primary beneficiary. 
  NorthStar Realty Finance Trusts 
  The Company owns all of the common stock of the Trusts.  The Trusts were formed to issue trust preferred securities.  The Company determined that the holders of the trust preferred securities were the primary beneficiaries of the Trusts.  As a result, the Company did not consolidate the Trusts and has accounted for the investment in the common stock of the Trusts under the equity method.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company s carrying value and maximum exposure to loss related to its investment in the Trusts is   $3.7 million   and is recorded in investments in unconsolidated ventures on the consolidated balance sheets. 
  PE Investments 
  The Company determined all PE Investments are VIEs, with the exception of PE Investment I and II, as the non-controlling interests do not have substantive kick-out or participating rights.  As of   September 30, 2016  , the Company s investment in these entities is   $383.8 million   and the amount of expected future contributions is   $3.8 million  . 
  Summary of Unconsolidated VIEs 
  The following table presents the classification, carrying value and maximum exposure of unconsolidated VIEs as of   September 30, 2016   (dollars in thousands):  

____________________________________________________________ 
           (1) 
    The Company s maximum exposure to loss as of   September 30, 2016   would not exceed the carrying value of its investment.

    Excludes a secured borrowing with a carrying value of   $52.7 million   related to a real estate debt investment. 
     Other than described above as it relates to expected future fundings on PE Investments, the Company is not contractually required to provide financial support to any of its unconsolidated VIEs during the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   however, the Company, in its capacity as collateral manager/collateral manager delegate and/or special servicer of the deconsolidated N-Star CDOs, may in its sole discretion provide support such as protective and other advances it deems appropriate.  As of   September 30, 2016  , there were no explicit arrangements or implicit variable interests that could require the Company to provide financial support to any of its unconsolidated VIEs. 
   
   The Company currently conducts its business through the following   five   segments (excluding the European real estate business which the Company spun off on October 31, 2015, which is no longer a separate operating segment), based on how management reviews and manages its business: 
             
    Real Estate   - The real estate business pursues various types of investments in commercial real estate located throughout the United States that includes healthcare, hotel, net lease and multi-tenant office properties.  In addition, it includes certain healthcare properties located outside of the United States and PE Investments diversified by property type and geography.  In addition, the Company is also invested in manufactured housing communities and multifamily properties, which the Company has recently entered into agreements to sell. 
                
    Healthcare   - The healthcare properties are comprised of a diverse portfolio of medical office buildings, senior housing, skilled nursing and other healthcare properties.  The majority of the healthcare properties are medical office buildings and properties structured under a net lease to healthcare operators.  In addition, the Company owns senior operating facilities, which include healthcare properties that operate through management agreements with independent third-party operators, predominantly through structures permitted by RIDEA that permit the Company, through a TRS, to have direct exposure to resident fee income and incur customary related operating expenses.  In March 2016, the Company sold its   60%   interest in a   $899 million   Senior Housing Portfolio for   $534.5 million  .  The buyer assumed the Company s portion of the   $648.2 million   of related mortgage financing and the Company received approximately   $149.4 million   of proceeds, net of sales costs.  In September 2016, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell a portfolio of medical office buildings within the Griffin-American Portfolio for   $837.9 million   with   $692.2 million   of related mortgage financing expected to be paid off as part of the transaction.  The Company expects to receive   $114.8 million   of net proceeds.  The Company expects the transaction to close in the fourth quarter 2016.  In November 2016, the Company entered into an agreement to sell an interest in its healthcare portfolio for net proceeds of approximately   $340 million  .  There is no assurance these transactions will close on the terms anticipated, if at all. 
                
    Hotel   - The hotel portfolio is a geographically diverse portfolio primarily comprised of extended stay hotels and premium branded select service hotels primarily located in major metropolitan markets with the majority affiliated with top hotel brands. 
                
    Manufactured Housing   - The manufactured housing portfolio consists of communities that lease pad rental sites for placement of factory built homes located throughout the United States.  In addition, the portfolio includes manufactured homes and receivables related to the financing of homes sold to residents.  In May 2016, the Company entered into an agreement to sell its manufactured housing portfolio for   $2.0 billion   with   $1.3 billion   of related mortgage financing expected to be assumed as part of the transaction.  The Company expects to receive   $614.8 million   of net proceeds.  The Company expects the transaction to close in the first quarter 2017.  There is no assurance this transaction will close on the terms anticipated, if at all.  Such assets and related liabilities are classified as held for sale on the Company s consolidated balance sheet. 
                
    Net Lease   - The net lease properties are primarily industrial, office and retail properties typically under net leases to corporate tenants.  In September 2016, the Company redeemed its interests in the Industrial Portfolio for   $169.6 million   of net proceeds. 
                
    Multifamily   - The multifamily portfolio primarily focuses on properties located in suburban markets that are well suited to capture the formation of new households.  To date through November 2016, the Company sold   ten   multifamily properties for   $307 million   with   $210 million   of mortgage financing assumed as part of the transaction.  The Company received   $85 million   of net proceeds.  The Company continues to explore the sale of the remaining   two   properties, including one multifamily property accounted for as an investment in unconsolidated venture.  Such assets and related liabilities are classified as held for sale on the Company s consolidated balance sheet.

Multi-tenant Office   - The Company pursues the acquisition of multi-tenant office properties currently focused on the western United States. 
                
    PE Investments   - The real estate business also includes investments (directly or indirectly in joint ventures) owning PE Investments managed by institutional quality sponsors and diversified by property type and geography.  In February 2016, the Company sold substantially all of its interest in PE Investment II for proceeds of   $184.1 million  .  In September 2016, the Company sold a portfolio of PE Investments for a gross sales price of   $317.6 million   with   $44.7 million   of deferred purchase price assumed as part of the transaction, including   $5.6 million   of deferred purchase price which was the obligation of an unconsolidated joint venture.  The Company received   $33.9 million   of net proceeds and will receive the remaining   $204.7 million   of net proceeds in the fourth quarter 2016.  Refer to Note 9. Related Party Arrangements for further disclosure.   
                
    Commercial Real Estate Debt   - The CRE debt business is focused on originating, acquiring and asset managing senior and subordinate debt investments secured primarily by commercial real estate and includes first mortgage loans, subordinate mortgage and mezzanine loans and participations in such loans and preferred equity interests.  The Company may from time to time take title to collateral in connection with a CRE debt investment as REO which would be included in the CRE debt business.  To date through November 2016, the Company sold or received repayment for   15   debt investments and a REO with a total principal amount of   $388.6 million   and used   $72.1 million   of proceeds to pay down the Company s loan facility in full, resulting in   $313.2 million   of net proceeds. 
                
    Commercial Real Estate Securities   - The CRE securities business is predominately comprised of N-Star CDO bonds and N-Star CDO equity of deconsolidated N-Star CDOs and includes other securities, mostly CMBS meaning each asset is a pool backed by a large number of commercial real estate loans.  The Company also invests in opportunistic CRE securities such as an investment in a  B-piece  CMBS.  In 2016, the Company sold certain CRE securities for   $53.9 million   of net proceeds. 
                
    N-Star CDOs   -     The Company historically originated or acquired CRE debt and securities investments that were predominantly financed through permanent, non-recourse CDOs.  The Company s remaining consolidated CDOs are past the reinvestment period and given the nature of these transactions, these CDOs are amortizing over time as the underlying assets pay down or are sold.  The Company has been winding down its legacy CDO business and investing in a broad and diverse range of CRE assets.  As a result, this distinct business is a significantly smaller portion of its business today than in the past.  As of   September 30, 2016  , only N-Star securities CDOs I and IX continue to be consolidated.  Refer to Note 16 for further disclosure regarding deconsolidated N-Star CDOs.  The Company continues to receive collateral management fees related to administrative responsibilities for deconsolidated N-Star CDO financing transactions, which are recorded in other revenue and included in the N-Star CDOs segment. 
                
    Corporate   - The corporate segment includes NSAM management fees incurred, corporate level interest income and interest expense and general and administrative expenses. 
     The Company primarily generates revenue from rental income from its real estate properties, operating income from healthcare and hotel properties permitted by the RIDEA and net interest income on the CRE debt and securities portfolios.  Additionally, the Company records equity in earnings of unconsolidated ventures, including from PE Investments.  The Company s income is primarily derived through the difference between revenue and the cost at which the Company is able to finance its investments.  The Company may also acquire investments which generate attractive returns without any leverage.

  Introduction 
  We are a diversified commercial real estate company, with 91% of our total assets invested directly or indirectly in real estate.  We generated 92% of our revenue from our real estate portfolio for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  .  We invest in multiple asset classes across commercial real estate, or CRE, that we expect will generate attractive risk-adjusted returns and may take the form of acquiring real estate, originating or acquiring senior or subordinate loans, as well as pursuing opportunistic CRE investments.  We seek to generate stable cash flow for distribution to our stockholders through our diversified portfolio of commercial real estate assets and in turn build long-term franchise value.  However, given recent market conditions, we are currently focused on exploring sales to generate liquidity. 
  We are a Maryland corporation and completed our initial public offering in October 2004.  We conduct our operations so as to continue to qualify as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, for U.S. federal income tax purposes.  We are externally managed and advised by an affiliate of NorthStar Asset Management Group Inc. (NYSE: NSAM), which together with its affiliates is referred to as NSAM.  
  Significant Developments 
  Merger Agreement with NSAM and Colony Capital, Inc. 
  In June 2016, we announced that we entered into a merger agreement with NSAM and Colony Capital, Inc., or Colony, under which the companies will combine in an all-stock merger of equals transaction to create an internally-managed, diversified real estate and investment management platform, or the Mergers.  The transaction has been approved by our and NSAM s respective board of directors, including the unanimous approval by their respective Special Committees and the board of directors of Colony. 
  Under the terms of the merger agreement, as amended, NSAM will redomesticate to Maryland and elect to be treated as a REIT beginning in 2017 and we and Colony, through a series of transactions, will merge with and into the redomesticated NSAM, which will be renamed Colony NorthStar, Inc., or Colony NorthStar.  Our common stockholders will receive 1.0996 shares of Colony NorthStar s common stock for each share of common stock they own.  Holders of preferred stock will receive shares of preferred stock of Colony NorthStar that are substantially similar to the preferred stock held prior to the closing of the transaction.  Upon completion of the transaction, NSAM stockholders will own approximately 32.85%, Colony stockholders will own approximately 33.25% and our stockholders will own approximately 33.90% of the combined company on a fully diluted basis, excluding the effect of certain equity-based awards issuable in connection with the Mergers. 
  In October 2016, we amended the merger agreement and provided for, among other matters, an enhanced governance structure for Colony NorthStar, modified severance terms for NSAM s executive officers and a special cash dividend for NSAM s stockholders now totaling $228 million.  In connection with the amendment to the merger agreement, NSAM entered into a voting agreement with MSD Capital L.P., or MSD, and its affiliates, which together own approximately 10.2% of NSAM s outstanding shares, pursuant to which MSD agreed to vote in favor of the Mergers and related proposals.  In addition, Colony NorthStar, a Maryland subsidiary of NSAM that will be the surviving parent company of the combined company, filed with the SEC an amended registration statement on Form S-4 that includes a joint proxy statement of NorthStar Realty, Colony and NSAM and that also constitutes a prospectus of Colony NorthStar. 
  The transaction is expected to close in January 2017, subject to, among other things, regulatory approvals and the receipt of NorthStar Realty s, Colony s and NSAM s respective stockholder approvals. 
  Sales Initiatives 
  We continue to execute a series of sales initiatives including: (i) sales of certain real estate assets; (ii) sales of certain of our limited partnership interests in real estate private equity funds, or PE Investments; and (iii) sales and/or accelerated repayments of our CRE debt and securities investments.  
  Since the beginning of the fourth quarter 2015 through November 2016, assets sold or committed to sell totaled   $6.6 billion  , including an agreement to sell an interest in our healthcare portfolio, of which net proceeds to us received or expected to be received totaled approximately   $2.5 billion  . There is no assurance this transaction will close on the terms anticipated, if at all.

Summary of Business 
  Our primary business lines are as follows: 
             
    Real Estate   - Our real estate business pursues various types of investments in commercial real estate located throughout the United States that includes healthcare, hotel, net lease and multi-tenant office properties.  In addition, it includes certain healthcare properties located outside of the United States and PE Investments, diversified by property type and geography.  In addition, we are also invested in manufactured housing communities and multifamily properties, which we have recently entered into agreements to sell.  
                
    Healthcare   - Our healthcare properties are comprised of a diverse portfolio of medical office buildings, senior housing, skilled nursing and other healthcare properties.  The majority of our healthcare properties are medical office buildings and properties structured under a net lease to healthcare operators.  In addition, we own senior operating facilities, which include healthcare properties that operate through management agreements with independent third-party operators, predominantly through structures permitted by the REIT Investment Diversification and Empowerment Act of 2007, or RIDEA, that permit us, through a taxable REIT subsidiary, or TRS, to have direct exposure to resident fee income and incur customary related operating expenses.  In March 2016, we sold our 60% interest in a $899 million portfolio of independent living facilities, or Senior Housing Portfolio, for $535 million.  The buyer assumed our portion of the $648 million of related mortgage financing and we received approximately $150 million of proceeds, net of sales costs.  In September 2016, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell a portfolio of medical office buildings within the Griffin-American Healthcare REIT II, Inc. portfolio, or Griffin-American Portfolio, for $838 million with $692 million of related mortgage financing expected to be paid off as part of the transaction.  We expect to receive $115 million of net proceeds.  We expect the transaction to close in the fourth quarter 2016.  In November 2016, we entered into an agreement to sell an interest in our healthcare portfolio for net proceeds of approximately $340 million.  There is no assurance these transactions will close on the terms anticipated, if at all. 
                
    Hotel   - Our hotel portfolio is a geographically diverse portfolio primarily comprised of extended stay hotels and premium branded select service hotels primarily located in major metropolitan markets with the majority affiliated with top hotel brands. 
                
    Manufactured Housing   - Our manufactured housing portfolio consists of communities that lease pad rental sites for placement of factory built homes located throughout the United States.  In addition, the portfolio includes manufactured homes and receivables related to the financing of homes sold to residents.  In May 2016, we entered into an agreement to sell our manufactured housing portfolio for $2.0 billion with $1.3 billion of related mortgage financing expected to be assumed as part of the transaction.  We expect to receive $615 million of net proceeds.  We expect the transaction to close in the first quarter 2017.  There is no assurance this transaction will close on the terms anticipated, if at all.  Such assets and related liabilities are classified as held for sale on our consolidated balance sheet. 
                
    Net Lease   - Our net lease properties are primarily industrial, office and retail properties typically under net leases to corporate tenants.  In September 2016, we redeemed our interests in a net lease industrial real estate portfolio, or Industrial Portfolio, for $170 million of net proceeds.  
                
    Multifamily   - Our multifamily portfolio primarily focuses on properties located in suburban markets that are well suited to capture the formation of new households.  To date through November 2016, we sold ten multifamily properties for $307 million with $210 million of mortgage financing assumed as part of the transaction.  We received $85 million of net proceeds.  We continue to explore the sale of the remaining two properties, including one multifamily property accounted for as an investment in unconsolidated venture.  Such assets and related liabilities are classified as held for sale on our consolidated balance sheet. 
                
    Multi-tenant Office   - We pursue the acquisition of multi-tenant office properties currently focused on the western United States. 
                
    PE Investments   - Our real estate business also includes investments (directly or indirectly in joint ventures) owning PE Investments managed by institutional quality sponsors and diversified by property type and geography.  In February 2016, we sold substantially all of our interest in PE Investment II for proceeds of $184 million.  In September 2016, we sold a portfolio of PE Investments for a gross sales price of $318 million with $45 million of deferred purchase price assumed as part of the transaction, including $6 million of deferred purchase price which was the obligation of an unconsolidated joint venture.  We received $34 million of net proceeds and will receive the remaining $205 million of net proceeds in the fourth quarter 2016.

     Table of Contents  

Commercial Real Estate Debt   - Our CRE debt business is focused on originating, acquiring and asset managing senior and subordinate debt investments secured primarily by commercial real estate and includes first mortgage loans, subordinate mortgage and mezzanine loans and participations in such loans and preferred equity interests.  We may from time to time take title to collateral in connection with a CRE debt investment as real estate owned, or REO, which would be included in our CRE debt business.  To date through November 2016, we sold or received repayment for 15 debt investments and a REO with a total principal amount of $389 million and used $72 million of proceeds to pay down our loan facility in full, resulting in $313 million of net proceeds.  
                
    Commercial Real Estate Securities   - Our CRE securities business is predominately comprised of N-Star CDO bonds and N-Star CDO equity of deconsolidated N-Star CDOs and includes other securities, mostly conduit commercial mortgage-backed securities, or CMBS, meaning each asset is a pool backed by a large number of commercial real estate loans.  We also invest in opportunistic CRE securities such as an investment in a  B-piece  CMBS.  In 2016, we sold certain CRE securities for $54 million of net proceeds. 
     We have the ability to invest in a broad spectrum of commercial real estate assets and seek to provide attractive risk-adjusted returns.  Our ability to invest across the CRE market creates complementary and overlapping sources of investment opportunities based upon common reliance on real estate fundamentals and application of similar portfolio management skills to maximize value and to protect capital.  Additionally, we have pursued opportunistic investments across all our business lines including CRE equity and debt investments.  Examples of opportunistic investments have included PE Investments, strategic joint ventures and repurchasing our CDO bonds at a discount to their principal amount. 
  We have not been actively raising capital due to current market conditions and the pending merger with Colony and NSAM. 
  We predominantly use investment-level financing as part of our strategy to prudently leverage our investments and deliver attractive risk-adjusted returns to our stockholders.  We pursue a variety of financing arrangements such as mortgage notes from the CMBS market, government-sponsored agencies, finance companies, banks and securitization financing transactions.  In addition, we use corporate-level financing such as credit facilities and other term borrowings.  We generally seek to limit our reliance on recourse borrowings.  Borrowing levels for our CRE investments may be dependent upon the nature of the assets and the related financing that is available. 
  The availability of attractive long-term, non-recourse, non mark-to-market, assignable financing through the CMBS and agency financing markets bolstered opportunities to acquire real estate in the past few years.  For longer duration, stable investment cash flow such as those derived from net lease assets, we tend to use fixed rate financing.  For investment cash flow with greater growth potential such as hotels and healthcare under a RIDEA structure, we tend to use floating rate financing which provides prepayment flexibility and may provide a better match between underlying cash flow and potential increases in interest rates.  
  Our financing strategy for debt investments is to obtain match-funded borrowing at rates that provide a positive net spread.  In late 2011, we began using secured term credit facilities provided by major financial institutions to partially finance CRE debt which currently provide for an aggregate of up to $200 million.  Additionally, we have historically demonstrated the ability to securitize our CRE debt investments and expect to continue to pursue similar transactions to finance our newly-originated debt investments that might initially be financed on our credit facilities.  In November 2012 and August 2013, we, and on behalf of NorthStar Real Estate Income Trust, Inc., or NorthStar Income, entered into securitization financing transactions with an aggregate $610 million of principal amount of bonds issued providing permanent, non-recourse, non-mark-to-market financing for newly-originated CRE debt investments of ours and NorthStar Income.  We will continue to seek to use the capital markets to finance any new debt investments.  In January 2015, Securitization 2012-1 with $228 million principal amount of original bonds issued was repaid in full. 
  With respect to corporate-level financing, in August 2014, we entered into a corporate revolving credit facility, or Corporate Revolver, with certain commercial bank lenders, with a total current commitment amount of $250 million for a three-year term.  In September 2014, we entered into a corporate term borrowing with a commercial bank lender with respect to the establishment of term borrowings.  In February 2016, our Corporate Revolver was repaid and we expect our remaining corporate recourse borrowings to be repaid from proceeds from sales initiatives.  Refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources for further discussion. 
  We believe that we maintain a competitive advantage through a combination of deep industry relationships and access to market leading CRE credit underwriting and capital markets expertise which enables us to manage credit risk across our business lines as well as to structure and finance our assets efficiently.  Our ability to invest across the spectrum of commercial real estate investments allows us to take advantage of complementary and overlapping sources of investment opportunities based on a common reliance on CRE fundamentals and application of similar underwriting and asset management skills as we seek to maximize stockholder value and to protect our capital.  However, we are currently focused on exploring sales to generate liquidity.

Real Estate 
  Overview 
  As part of our real estate strategy, we explore a variety of real estate investments, both directly and through joint ventures.  Opportunities to purchase real estate have been bolstered by attractive long-term, non-recourse, non mark-to-market financing available through CMBS and agency financing markets.  Our portfolio is primarily comprised of healthcare, hotel, manufactured housing communities, net lease and multifamily properties.  We also invest in other opportunistic real estate investments such as indirect interests in real estate through PE Investments.  Our hotel and certain healthcare properties acquired operate through RIDEA structures where we participate directly in the operational cash flow of a property.  Our real estate equity investments that operate under the RIDEA structure generate resident and hotel guest related income from short-term residential agreements and incur customary related operating expenses. 
  Recently, we sold or are pursuing the sale of certain real estate assets and are exploring other sales or joint ventures to further monetize certain of our real estate assets.  There is no assurance we will enter into any transactions on favorable terms, or at all.  Refer to the below for further discussion.

Net Lease Properties 
  Our real estate that is net leased to corporate tenants is primarily comprised office and retail properties.  These net lease properties are typically leased to a single tenant who agrees to pay basic rent, plus all taxes, insurance, capital and operating expenses arising from the use of the leased property generally leaving us, as owner, with minimal ongoing operational or expense obligations.  We may also invest in properties that are leased to tenants for which we are responsible for some of the operating expenses and capital costs.  At the end of the lease term, the tenant typically has a right to renew the lease at market rates or to vacate the property with no further ongoing obligation. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   $345 million  , or   1.8%  , of our assets were invested in net lease properties, including one property owned through an unconsolidated joint venture.  In September 2016, we redeemed our interests in our Industrial Portfolio for $170 million of net proceeds.

PE Investments 
  Our PE Investments own limited partnership interests in real estate private equity funds acquired in the secondary market and are managed by institutional-quality sponsors, which we refer to as fund interests.  In February 2016, we sold substantially all of our interest in PE Investment II for proceeds of $184 million.  In September 2016, we sold a portfolio of PE Investments for a gross sales price of $318 million with $45 million of deferred purchase price assumed as part of the transaction, including $6 million of deferred purchase price which was the obligation of an unconsolidated joint venture.  We received $34 million of net proceeds and will receive the remaining $205 million of net proceeds in the fourth quarter 2016.  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   $488 million  , or   2.6%  , of our assets were invested in PE Investments through unconsolidated ventures or direct investments.

  Commercial Real Estate Debt 
  Overview 
  Our CRE debt investment strategy is focused on originating, acquiring and asset managing CRE debt investments, including first mortgage loans, subordinate mortgage and mezzanine loans and participations in such loans and preferred equity interests. 
  We emphasize direct origination of our debt investments as this allows us a greater degree of control over how they are underwritten and structured and it provides us the opportunity to syndicate senior or subordinate interests in the loan to maximize returns, if desired.  Further, it facilitates a more direct relationship with our borrowers which helps us maintain a robust pipeline, provides an opportunity for us to earn origination and other fees and offers us an important advantage when considering any potential future modifications or restructurings. 
  The supply/demand imbalance driven by the large amount of maturing CRE loans could create an opportunity for us.  Even with some increased supply by lenders, demand for debt financing is allowing investors with capital and real estate expertise, such as us, the opportunity to make investments with attractive risk/return profiles.  We are currently focused on monetizing many of our CRE debt investments through sales or accelerated repayments. 
  We believe we have built a franchise with a reputation for providing capital to high-quality real estate owners who want a responsive and flexible balance sheet lender.  Given that we are a lender who generally retains control of the loans we originate, we are able to maintain flexibility in how we structure loans to meet the needs of our borrowers.  Typical CMBS and other capital markets driven lenders generally cannot provide these types of loans due to constraints within their funding structures and because of their requirement to sell the entire loan to third parties and relinquish all control.  Even when we finance our investments through securitizations, we maintain a significant capital investment in our loans.  Our centralized investment organization has enabled senior management to review potential new loans early in the origination process which, unlike many large institutional lenders  
  
   72 

     Table of Contents  

with several levels of approval required to commit to a loan, allows us to respond quickly and provide a high degree of certainty to our borrowers that we would close a loan on terms substantially similar to those initially proposed.  We believe that this level of service has enhanced our reputation in the marketplace.  In addition, we believe the early and active role of senior management in our portfolio management process has been key to maximizing recoveries of invested capital from our investments and our ability to be responsive to changing market conditions.   
  Our Portfolio 
  As of   September 30, 2016  ,   $371 million  , or   2.0%  , of assets were invested in CRE debt, excluding CRE debt financed in consolidated N-Star CDOs, consisting of   20   loans with an average investment size of $19 million and weighted average extended maturity of 5.5 years.  We directly originated approximately 91% of our current portfolio of CRE debt investments (excluding debt investments acquired in connection with Griffin-American).  The following table presents a summary of our CRE debt investments as of   September 30, 2016   (dollars in thousands):

Commercial Real Estate Securities 
  We historically originated or acquired CRE debt and securities investments that were predominately financed through permanent, non-recourse CDOs.  We sponsored nine CDOs, three of which were primarily collateralized by CRE debt and six of which were primarily collateralized by CRE securities.  In addition, we acquired the equity interests of two CRE debt focused CDOs, CSE RE 2006-A CDO, or CSE CDO, and CapLease 2005-1 CDO, or CapLease CDO.  At the time of issuance of the N-Star CDOs, we retained the below investment grade bonds, which are referred to as subordinate bonds, and preferred shares and equity notes, which are referred to as equity interests.  In addition, since the initial issuance of the N-Star CDOs, we repurchased CDO bonds originally issued to third parties at discounts to par.  These repurchased CDO bonds and retained subordinate bonds are herein collectively referred to as N-Star CDO bonds.  We own the equity interests in all of our N-Star CDO financing transactions whether or not we consolidate these transactions on our balance sheet.  Substantially all of our N-Star CDO equity is invested in our CRE debt CDOs.  In fact, our CRE debt CDOs have distributed regular cash flow since their inception.  We do not, however, own undivided interests in any of the assets within our N-Star CDOs and all senior and junior bondholders of the CDOs have economic interests that are senior to our equity interests.  In September 2015, N-Star CDO IV was liquidated and the third-party senior bondholders of N-Star CDO IV were repaid in full. 
  We historically consolidated these CDO financing transactions under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or U.S. GAAP.  Our legacy CDO business is winding down, resulting in liquidation and deconsolidation of certain of our N-Star CDOs.  Repurchased N-Star CDO bonds that are consolidated are not presented as an investment but rather are eliminated in our consolidated financial statements and, as a result, the interest and realization of any discount will generally not be recorded as income in our consolidated statements of operations under U.S. GAAP.  All of our CRE debt CDOs were deconsolidated in 2013 and currently only N-Star securities CDOs I and IX continue to be consolidated.  All N-Star CDOs are past their reinvestment period and given the nature of these transactions, these CDOs are amortizing over time as the underlying assets pay down or are sold.   
  Our CRE securities portfolio is predominately comprised of N-Star CDO bonds and N-Star CDO equity of our deconsolidated N-Star CDOs and includes other securities, mostly conduit CMBS, meaning each asset is a pool backed by a large number of commercial real estate loans.  We have also invested in opportunistic CRE securities such as an investment in a  B-piece  CMBS.  More recently, we are pursuing the sale of certain of our CRE securities.  In 2016, we sold five CRE securities for $54 million of net proceeds.

Sources of Operating Revenues and Cash Flows 
  We primarily generate revenue from rental and other operating income from our real estate properties and net interest income on our CRE debt and securities portfolios.  Additionally, we record equity in earnings of unconsolidated ventures, including from PE Investments.  Our income is primarily derived through the difference between revenue and the cost at which we are able to finance our investments.  We may also acquire investments which generate attractive returns without any leverage. 
  Operations of our hotel portfolio are affected by seasonal patterns resulting from overall economic cycles, geographic locations, weather and customer mix at the hotels.  Generally, we expect our hotel portfolio to have higher revenue, operating income and cash flow in the second and third quarters of each year and lower revenue, operating income and cash flow in the first and fourth quarters of each year. 
  Profitability and Performance Metrics 
  We calculate cash available for distribution, or CAD, and net operating income, or NOI, as metrics to evaluate the profitability and performance of our business (refer to  Non-GAAP Financial Measures  for a description of these metrics). 
  Outlook and Recent Trends 
  The U.S. economy demonstrated improvement in 2015, which prompted the Federal Reserve in December 2015 to raise the Federal Funds Rate for the first time in nine years.  The U.S. economy has continued to show strength throughout 2016 with approximately  
  
   75 

     Table of Contents  

5% unemployment and positive trends in the housing market.  Despite this, concerns still remain regarding low inflation in the United States, a stronger U.S. dollar, oil price instability, slow U.S. GDP and global growth, the U.S. Presidential election and increasing international market volatility.  Many other global central banks have been easing monetary policy to combat low inflation and stagnant growth and the Federal Reserve is signaling that it may further adjust the Federal Funds Rate in 2016, especially in light of certain global events described below. 
  Our business and operations are dependent on the commercial real estate industry generally, which in turn is dependent upon broad economic conditions in the United States, Europe, China and elsewhere.  Recently, concerns over the U.S. mortgage market and sustainability of continued growth in the real estate market in the United States have contributed to increased domestic economic uncertainty and the potential for a recessionary environment.  
  In June 2016, a non-binding referendum was passed in the United Kingdom supporting the exit from the European Union which in turn resulted in considerable instability to global markets and currencies especially European markets, the U.K. s economy and the British Pound Sterling which has continued to devalue.  In addition, dramatic political change in the United Kingdom has resulted including the election of a new Prime Minister in July 2016.  Much uncertainty remains as to the process for a potential March 2017 start to  Brexit  and the long-term impacts to the global, European and British economies.  Sovereign banks have been actively easing monetary policy resulting in sustained low-to-negative, interest rate environments, while several key global economies, including England, Germany and Japan, have recently reached positive interest rate territory in the benchmark 10-year paper.  The Bank of England and other central banks remain poised for further monetary and financial policy action should the U.K. s economy enter a downturn or as a tool to encourage positive economic growth.  Despite the unexpected result of the referendum, markets have generally continued to function properly and in some cases recovered from the initial shock (e.g., U.S. equity markets).  The potential for ongoing volatility and uncertainty resulting from  Brexit  and other geopolitical or financial unrest may have a significant impact on the overall global economic environment. 
  CRE fundamentals remain relatively healthy across U.S. property types.  Investor demand in 2015 for commercial real estate increased transaction activity and prices as rent and vacancy fundamentals improved across most property sectors.  Private capital investment remained aggressive throughout 2015 and, although public markets slowed at the beginning of 2016, continued to remain aggressive throughout 2016, leading to continued appreciation in real estate values.  However, property price appreciation has slowed and there is speculation that certain markets may be entering the late stage of the current real estate cycle and, in some markets, rent growth and capitalization rate compression has started to slow.  One of the factors that may contribute to periodic volatility in the commercial real estate market is the large amount of maturing commercial real estate debt that may have difficulties being refinanced. 
  Approximately $1.4 trillion of commercial real estate debt in the United States is scheduled to mature through 2018.  While there appears to be a supply of available liquidity to satisfy many of these maturities, 2016 private-label CMBS year-to-date is 43% compared to the same period in 2015 and industry experts estimate a projected total origination volume of approximately $65 billion for 2016 versus volume of $95 billion in 2015.  Despite non-traditional lenders significantly increasing loan origination volumes, this trend is potentially one symptom that could point to broader difficulties in the ability of the market to refinance the large amount of maturing real estate debt and may lead to a negative impact on the overall real estate market. 
  The recent volatility in the equity market has and may continue to diminish our capital raising activity.  A return to weak economic conditions in the future, such as those of the credit crisis of 2008, could reduce a tenant s/operator s/resident s/guest s ability to make payments in accordance with the contractual terms and could weaken demand for companies to lease or occupy new space.  To the extent that market rental and occupancy rates weaken, property-level cash flow could be negatively affected, and therefore, reduce our ability to make distributions to stockholders. 
  Our Strategy 
  Our primary business objectives are to invest in commercial real estate property and other real estate assets that we expect will generate attractive risk-adjusted returns and in turn will generate stable cash flow for distribution to our stockholders.  Until recently, our investment activity and uses of available cash liquidity was focused on acquiring real estate, originating or acquiring loans, as well as pursuing opportunistic CRE investments across our businesses.  Opportunistic investments have included investing in real estate private equity funds, strategic joint ventures and repurchasing our N-Star CDO bonds at discounts to par. 
  Availability and cost of capital impacts our profitability and earnings since we would be required to raise new capital to fund a majority of this growth.  Given recent market conditions, we are currently focused on exploring sales to generate liquidity to reduce our corporate recourse borrowings and prudently manage our portfolio so it is well positioned. 
  We have not been actively raising capital due to current market conditions and the pending merger with Colony and NSAM.  Further, we have access to other forms of corporate-level financing.  In August 2014, we entered into a Corporate Revolver with certain commercial bank lenders, with a total current commitment amount of $250 million for a three-year term, subject to certain conditions.  In September 2014, we entered into a corporate term borrowing with a commercial bank lender.  In February 2016,  
  
   76 

     Table of Contents  

our Corporate Revolver was repaid and we expect our remaining corporate recourse borrowings to be repaid from proceeds from sales initiatives. 
  In addition, we have a loan facility of $200 million to finance the origination of CRE first mortgage loans.  In April 2016, our loan facility was repaid.  Additionally, we have historically demonstrated the ability to securitize our CRE debt investments and expect to continue to pursue similar transactions to finance our newly-originated debt investments that might initially be financed on our credit facilities.  In November 2012 and August 2013, we, and on behalf of NorthStar Income, entered into securitization financing transactions with an aggregate $610 million of principal amount of bonds issued to finance debt investments on a permanent, non-recourse, non-mark-to-market basis that were previously financed on credit facilities.  In January 2015, Securitization 2012-1 with $228 million principal amount of original bonds issued was repaid in full. 
   
  Financing Strategy 
  We seek to access a wide range of secured and unsecured debt and public and private equity capital sources to fund our investment activities and asset growth. 
  We predominantly use investment-level financing as part of our strategy to prudently leverage our investments and deliver attractive risk-adjusted returns to our stockholders.  We pursue a variety of financing arrangements such as mortgage notes from the CMBS market, government-sponsored agencies, finance companies, banks and securitization financing transactions.  In addition, we use corporate-level financing such as credit facilities and other term borrowings.  We generally seek to limit our reliance on recourse borrowings.  Borrowing levels for our CRE investments may be dependent upon the nature of the assets and the related financing that is available.   
  The availability of attractive long-term, non-recourse, non mark-to-market assignable financing through the CMBS and agency financing markets bolstered opportunities to acquire real estate in the past few years.  For longer duration, stable investment cash flow such as those derived from net lease assets, we tend to use fixed rate financing.  For investment cash flow with greater growth potential such as hotels and healthcare under a RIDEA structure, we tend to use floating rate financing which provides prepayment flexibility and may provide a better match between underlying cash flow and potential increases in interest rates. 
  Our financing strategy for debt investments is to obtain match-funded borrowing at rates that provide a positive net spread.  In late 2011, we began using secured term credit facilities provided by major financial institutions to partially finance CRE debt, which currently provide for up to $200 million.  Additionally, we have historically demonstrated the ability to securitize our CRE debt investments and expect to continue to pursue similar transactions to finance our newly-originated debt investments that might initially be financed on our credit facilities.  In November 2012 and August 2013, we, and on behalf of NorthStar Income, entered into securitized financing transactions (Securitization 2012-1 and Securitization 2013-1) with an aggregate $610 million of principal amount of bonds issued providing permanent, non-recourse, non-mark-to-market financing for newly-originated CRE debt investments of ours and NorthStar Income.  In January 2015, Securitization 2012-1 with $228 million principal amount of original bonds issued was repaid in full.  We will continue to seek to use the capital markets to finance any new debt investments.  In April 2016, our loan facility was repaid. 
  With respect to corporate-level financing, in August 2014, we entered into a Corporate Revolver with certain commercial bank lenders, with a total current commitment of $250 million.  In September 2014, we entered into a corporate term borrowing with a commercial bank lender with respect to the establishment of term borrowings.  However, given recent market conditions, we are currently focused on exploring sales to generate liquidity.  In February 2016, our Corporate Revolver was repaid and we expect our remaining corporate recourse borrowings to be repaid from proceeds from sales initiatives.  Refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources for further discussion. 
  Historically, we used CDOs to finance CRE debt and securities investments.  Our legacy CDO business is winding down as we invest in a broader, more diverse range of CRE assets.  As a result, such legacy business is a significantly smaller portion of our business today than in the past. 
  Portfolio Management 
  NSAM performs portfolio management services on our behalf.  The comprehensive portfolio management process that generally includes day-to-day oversight by the portfolio management and servicing team, regular management meetings and an exhaustive quarterly credit review process.  These processes are designed to enable management to evaluate and proactively identify asset-specific credit issues and trends on a portfolio-wide basis.  Nevertheless, we cannot be certain that such review will identify all issues within our portfolio due to, among other things, adverse economic conditions or events adversely affecting specific assets; therefore, potential future losses may also stem from investments that are not identified during these credit reviews.  NSAM uses many methods to actively manage our credit risk to preserve our income and capital, which includes our ability to manage our assets in a manner that minimizes credit losses that could decrease income and portfolio value.  For CRE equity and debt investments, frequent re-underwriting and dialogue with borrowers/tenants/operators/partners and regular inspections of our collateral and owned properties have proven to be an effective process for identifying issues early.  With respect to our healthcare properties, we consider the impact of regulatory changes on operator performance and property values.  During the quarterly credit review,  
  
   77 

     Table of Contents  

or more frequently as necessary, investments are put on highly-monitored status and identified for possible asset impairment/loan loss reserves, as appropriate, based upon several factors, including missed or late contractual payments, significant declines in collateral performance and other data which may indicate a potential issue in our ability to recover our invested capital from an investment.  The portfolio management process related to CRE debt and securities underlying our deconsolidated CDOs is limited to monitoring the CDO bonds and equity interests in such CDO financing transactions. 
   
  Critical Accounting Policies 
  Principles of Consolidation 
  Our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NorthStar Realty Finance Corp., NorthStar Realty Finance Limited Partnership, or our Operating Partnership, and their consolidated subsidiaries.  We consolidate variable interest entities, or VIEs, where we are the primary beneficiary and voting interest entities which are generally majority owned or otherwise controlled by us.  All significant intercompany balances are eliminated in consolidation. 
  Variable Interest Entities 
  A VIE is an entity that lacks one or more of the characteristics of a voting interest entity.  A VIE is defined as an entity in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties.  The determination of whether an entity is a VIE includes both a qualitative and quantitative analysis.  We base the qualitative analysis on our review of the design of the entity, its organizational structure including decision-making ability and relevant financial agreements and the quantitative analysis on the forecasted cash flow of the entity.  We reassess the initial evaluation of an entity as a VIE upon the occurrence of certain reconsideration events. 
  A VIE must be consolidated only by its primary beneficiary, which is defined as the party who, along with its affiliates and agents has both the: (i) power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance; and (ii) obligation to absorb the losses of the VIE or the right to receive the benefits from the VIE, which could be significant to the VIE.  We determine whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE by considering qualitative and quantitative factors, including, but not limited to: which activities most significantly impact the VIE s economic performance and which party controls such activities; the amount and characteristics of its investment; the obligation or likelihood for us or other interests to provide financial support; consideration of the VIE s purpose and design, including the risks the VIE was designed to create and pass through to its variable interest holders and the similarity with and significance to our business activities and the other interests.  We reassess the determination of whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE each reporting period.  Significant judgments related to these determinations include estimates about the current and future fair value and performance of investments held by these VIEs and general market conditions. 
  We evaluate our CRE debt and securities, investments in unconsolidated ventures and securitization financing transactions, such as our CDOs and our liabilities to subsidiary trusts issuing preferred securities to determine whether they are a VIE.  We analyze new investments and financings, as well as reconsideration events for existing investments and financings, which vary depending on type of investment or financing. 
  Voting Interest Entities 
  A voting interest entity is an entity in which the total equity investment at risk is sufficient to enable it to finance its activities independently and the equity holders have the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact its economic performance, the obligation to absorb the losses of the entity and the right to receive the residual returns of the entity.  The usual condition for a controlling financial interest in a voting interest entity is ownership of a majority voting interest.  If we have a majority voting interest in a voting interest entity, the entity will generally be consolidated.  We do not consolidate a voting interest entity if there are substantive participating rights by other parties and/or kick-out rights by a single party or through a simple majority vote. 
  We perform on-going reassessments of whether entities previously evaluated under the voting interest framework have become VIEs, based on certain events, and therefore subject to the VIE consolidation framework. 
  Investments in Unconsolidated Ventures 
  A non-controlling, unconsolidated ownership interest in an entity may be accounted for using the equity method, at fair value or the cost method. 
  Under the equity method, the investment is adjusted each period for capital contributions and distributions and its share of the entity s net income (loss).  Capital contributions, distributions and net income (loss) of such entities are recorded in accordance with the terms of the governing documents.  An allocation of net income (loss) may differ from the stated ownership percentage interest in such entity as a result of a preferred return and allocation formula, if any, as described in such governing documents. 
  We may account for an investment in an unconsolidated entity at fair value by electing the fair value option.  We elected the fair value option for PE Investments and certain investments in unconsolidated ventures.  PE Investments are recorded as investments  
  
   78 

     Table of Contents  

in private equity funds, at fair value.  We record the change in fair value for our share of the projected future cash flow of such investments from one period to another in equity in earnings (losses) from unconsolidated ventures in the consolidated statements of operations.  Any change in fair value attributed to market related assumptions is considered unrealized gain (loss). 
  We may account for an investment that does not qualify for equity method accounting or for which the fair value option was not elected using the cost method if we determine the investment in the unconsolidated entity is insignificant.  Under the cost method, equity in earnings is recorded as dividends are received to the extent they are not considered a return of capital, which is recorded as a reduction of cost of the investment. 
  Fair Value Option 
  The fair value option provides an election that allows a company to irrevocably elect to record certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on an instrument-by-instrument basis at initial recognition.  We may elect to apply the fair value option for certain investments due to the nature of the instrument.  Any change in fair value for assets and liabilities for which the election is made is recognized in earnings. 
  Operating Real Estate 
  Operating real estate is carried at historical cost less accumulated depreciation.  Ordinary repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.  Major replacements and improvements which improve or extend the life of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over their useful life.  Operating real estate is depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.   
  We account for purchases of operating real estate that qualify as business combinations using the acquisition method, where the purchase price is allocated to tangible assets such as land, building, tenant and land improvements and other identified intangibles, such as goodwill.  Costs directly related to an acquisition deemed to be a business combination are expensed and included in transaction costs in our consolidated statements of operations.  We evaluate whether REO constitutes a business and whether business combination accounting is appropriate.  Any excess upon taking title to collateral between the carrying value of a loan over the estimated fair value of the property is charged to provision for loan losses. 
  Operating real estate, including REO, which has met the criteria to be classified as held for sale, is separately presented on the consolidated balance sheets.  Such operating real estate is recorded at the lower of its carrying value or its estimated fair value less the cost to sell.  Once a property is determined to be held for sale, depreciation is no longer recorded.  We record a gain (loss) on sale of real estate when title is conveyed to the buyer and we have no substantial economic involvement with the property.  If the sales criteria for the full accrual method are not met, we defer some or all of the gain (loss) recognition by applying the finance, leasing, profit sharing, deposit, installment or cost recovery method, as appropriate, until the sales criteria are met.   
  Real Estate Debt Investments 
  CRE debt investments are generally intended to be held to maturity and, accordingly, are carried at cost, net of unamortized loan fees, premium and discount.  CRE debt investments that are deemed to be impaired are carried at amortized cost less a loan loss reserve, if deemed appropriate, which approximates fair value.  CRE debt investments where we do not have the intent to hold the loan for the foreseeable future or until its expected payoff are classified as held for sale and recorded at the lower of cost or estimated value. 
  We may syndicate a portion of the CRE debt investments that we originate or sell the CRE debt investments individually.  When a transaction meets the criteria for sale accounting, we will derecognize the CRE debt investment sold and recognize gain or loss based on the difference between the sales price and the carrying value of the CRE debt investment sold.  Any related unamortized deferred origination fee, original issue discount, loan origination costs, discount or premium at the time of sale are recognized as an adjustment to the gain (loss) on sale, which is included in interest income on the consolidated statement of operations.  Any fees received at the time of sale or syndication are recognized as part of interest income. 
  Real Estate Securities 
  We classify our CRE securities investments as available for sale on the acquisition date, which are carried at fair value.  We have historically elected to apply the fair value option for our CRE securities investments.  For those CRE securities for which the fair value option was elected, any unrealized gains (losses) from the change in fair value is recorded in unrealized gains (losses) on investments and other in the consolidated statements of operations. 
  We may decide to not elect the fair value option for certain CRE securities due to the nature of the particular instrument.  For those CRE securities for which the fair value option was not elected, any unrealized gain (loss) from the change in fair value is recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income, or OCI, in the consolidated statements of equity, to the extent impairment losses are considered temporary.

Deferred Costs 
  Deferred costs primarily include deferred financing costs and deferred lease costs.  Deferred financing costs represent commitment fees, legal and other third-party costs associated with obtaining financing.  Costs related to revolving credit facilities are recorded in other assets and are amortized to interest expense using the straight-line basis over the term of the facility.  Costs related to other borrowings are recorded net against the carrying value of such borrowings and are amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method.  Unamortized deferred financing costs are expensed when the associated facility is repaid before maturity.  Costs incurred in seeking financing transactions, which do not close, are expensed in the period in which it is determined that the financing will not occur.  Deferred lease costs consist of fees incurred to initiate and renew operating leases, which are amortized on a straight-line basis over the remaining lease term and are recorded to depreciation and amortization in the consolidated statements of operations. 
  Intangible Assets and Intangible Liabilities  
  We record acquired identified intangibles, which includes intangible assets (such as value of the above-market leases, in-place leases, below-market ground leases, goodwill and other intangibles) and intangible liabilities (such as the value of below-market leases), based on estimated fair value.  The value allocated to the identified intangibles are amortized over the remaining lease term.  Above/below-market leases are amortized into rental income, below-market ground leases are amortized into real estate properties-operating expense and in-place leases are amortized into depreciation and amortization expense. 
  Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination and is not amortized.  We analyze goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be fully recoverable.  We first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit, related to such goodwill, is less than the carrying amount as a basis to determine whether the two-step impairment test is necessary.  The first step in the impairment test compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount.  If the carrying amount exceeds fair value, the second step is required to determine the amount of the impairment loss, if any, by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of such goodwill.  The implied fair value of goodwill is derived by performing a hypothetical purchase price allocation for the reporting unit as of the measurement date, allocating the reporting unit s estimated fair value to its net assets and identifiable intangible assets.  The residual amount represents the implied fair value of goodwill.  To the extent this amount is below the carrying value of goodwill, an impairment loss is recorded in the consolidated statements of operations.  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , there were no triggering events that required a test of impairment of goodwill. 
  Fair Value Measurement 
  The fair value of financial instruments is categorized based on the priority of the inputs to the valuation technique and categorized into a three-level fair value hierarchy.  The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3).  If the inputs used to measure the financial instruments fall within different levels of the hierarchy, the categorization is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the instrument. 
  Financial assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets and are categorized based on the inputs to the valuation techniques as follows: 
           Level 1. 
    Quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in an active market. 
              Level 2. 
    Financial assets and liabilities whose values are based on the following: 
              (a) 
    Quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets. 
              (b) 
    Quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in non-active markets. 
              (c) 
    Pricing models whose inputs are observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. 
              (d) 
    Pricing models whose inputs are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. 
              Level 3. 
    Prices or valuation techniques based on inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. 
     Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis 
  Financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.  Management determines the prices are representative of fair value through a review of available data, including observable inputs, recent transactions as well as our knowledge and experience of the market.

     Table of Contents  

With respect to valuation for CRE securities, we generally obtain at least one quote from a pricing service or broker.  Furthermore, we may use internal pricing models to establish arm s length prices.  Generally, the quote from the pricing service is used to determine fair value for the securities.  The quotes are not adjusted.  The pricing service uses market-based measurements based on valuation techniques that reflect market participants  assumptions and maximize the use of relevant observable inputs including prices for similar assets, benchmark yield curves and market corroborated inputs such as contractual terms, discount rates for similar securities and credit (such as credit support and delinquency rates).  We believe such broker quote is generally based on a market transaction of comparable securities. 
  To determine the fair value of CRE securities, we maintain a comprehensive quarterly process that includes a valuation committee comprised of senior members of the investment and accounting teams that is designed to enable management to ensure the prices used are representative of fair value and the instruments are properly classified pursuant to the fair value hierarchy. 
  Initially, a member of the investment team on the valuation committee reviews the prices at quarter end to ensure current market conditions are fairly presented.  The investment team is able to assess these values because they are actively engaged in the market, reviewing bid lists, recent sales and frequently have discussions with various banks and other financial institutions regarding the state of the market.  We then perform a variety of analyses to ensure the quotes are in a range which we believe to be representative of fair value and to validate the quotes obtained and used in determining the ultimate value used in the financial statements.  At the portfolio level, we evaluate the overall change in fair value versus the overall change in the market.  We review significant changes in fair value for individual instruments, both positive and negative, from the prior period.  We perform back testing on any securities sold to validate the quotes used for the prior quarter.  Where multiple quotes are available, we evaluate any large variance between the high and low price.  We obtain any available market data that provides insight into the price through recent or comparable security trades, multiple broker bids and other pertinent information.  This data may be available through the pricing service or based on data directly available to us.  If as part of any of these processes, we are aware of data which we believe better supports the fair value, we challenge the quote provided by either the pricing service or broker.  Any discrepancy identified from our processes are reviewed and resolved.  The valuation committee approves the final prices.  We believe these procedures are designed to enable us to estimate fair value. 
  Once we determine fair value of CRE securities, we review to ensure the instrument is properly classified pursuant to the fair value hierarchy consistent with U.S. GAAP through our understanding of the valuation methodologies used by the pricing service via discussion with representatives of the pricing service and review of any documentation describing its valuation methodology. 
  Generally, when fair value is based on the pricing service or multiple broker quotes, we believe, based on our analysis, such quotes are based on observable inputs and are therefore classified as Level 2.  Where the price is based on either a single broker quote or an internal pricing model, we generally consider such price to be based on less observable data and therefore classify such instruments as Level 3. 
  Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Non-recurring Basis 
  Non-financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value in the consolidated financial statements consist of real estate held for sale or assets for which an impairment has been recorded, such as goodwill.  Such fair value measurements are generally considered to be Level 3 within the valuation hierarchy, where applicable, based on estimated sales price, adjusted for closing costs and expenses, determined by discounted cash flow analysis, direct capitalization analyses or a sales comparison approach if no contracts had been consummated.  The discounted cash flow and direct capitalization analyses include all estimated cash inflows and outflows over a specific holding period and, where applicable, any estimated debt premiums.  This cash flow is comprised of unobservable inputs which included forecasted rental revenues and expenses based upon existing in-place leases, market conditions and expectations for growth.  Capitalization rate and discount rate used in these analyses are based upon observable rates that we believe to be within a reasonable range of current market rates for the respective properties. 
  Valuations are prepared using internally-developed valuation models.  These valuations are reviewed and approved, during each reporting period, by management, as deemed necessary, including personnel from the accounting, finance and operations and the valuations are updated as appropriate.  In addition, we may engage third-party valuation experts to assist with the preparation of certain of its valuations. 
  Revenue Recognition 
  Operating Real Estate 
  Rental and escalation income from operating real estate is derived from leasing of space to various types of tenants and healthcare operators.  Rental revenue recognition commences when the tenant takes possession of the leased space and the leased space is substantially ready for its intended use.  The leases are for fixed terms of varying length and generally provide for annual rentals and expense reimbursements to be paid in monthly installments.  Rental income from leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the respective leases.  The excess of rents recognized over amounts contractually due pursuant to the underlying leases are included in unbilled rent receivable in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets.  We amortize any tenant inducements as a reduction of revenue utilizing the straight-line method over the term of the lease.  Escalation income represents  
  
   81 

     Table of Contents  

revenue from tenant/operator leases which provide for the recovery of all or a portion of the operating expenses and real estate taxes paid by us on behalf of the respective property.  This revenue is accrued in the same period as the expenses are incurred.   
  We generate operating income from healthcare and hotel properties permitted by RIDEA.  Revenue related to healthcare properties includes resident room and care charges and other resident charges.  Revenue related to operating hotel properties primarily consists of room and food and beverage sales.  Revenue is recognized when such services are provided, generally defined as the date upon which a resident or guest occupies a room or uses the healthcare property or hotel services and is recorded in resident fee income for healthcare properties and hotel related income for hotel properties in the consolidated statements of operations. 
  In a situation in which a lease(s) associated with a significant tenant have been, or are expected to be, terminated early, we evaluate the remaining useful life of depreciable or amortizable assets in the asset group related to the lease that will be terminated (i.e., tenant improvements, above- and below-market lease intangibles, in-place lease value and deferred leasing costs).  Based upon consideration of the facts and circumstances surrounding the termination, we may write-off or accelerate the depreciation and amortization associated with the asset group.  Such amounts are included within rental and escalation income for above- and below-market lease intangibles and depreciation and amortization in the consolidated statements of operations. 
  Real Estate Debt Investments 
  Interest income is recognized on an accrual basis and any related premium, discount, origination costs and fees are amortized over the life of the investment using the effective interest method.  The amortization is reflected as an adjustment to interest income in our consolidated statements of operations.  The amortization of a premium or accretion of a discount is discontinued if such loan is reclassified to held for sale. 
  Real Estate Securities 
  Interest income is recognized using the effective interest method with any premium or discount amortized or accreted through earnings based on expected cash flow through the expected maturity date of the security.  Changes to expected cash flow may result in a change to the yield which is then applied retrospectively for high-credit quality securities that cannot be prepaid or otherwise settled in such a way that the holder would not recover substantially all of the investment or prospectively for all other securities to recognize interest income. 
  Credit Losses and Impairment on Investments 
  Operating Real Estate 
  Our real estate portfolio is reviewed on a quarterly basis, or more frequently as necessary, to assess whether there are any indicators that the value of our operating real estate may be impaired or that its carrying value may not be recoverable.  A property s value is considered impaired if management s estimate of the aggregate expected future undiscounted cash flow to be generated by the property is less than the carrying value of the property.  In conducting this review, management considers U.S. and global macroeconomic factors and real estate sector conditions together with investment specific and other factors.  To the extent an impairment has occurred, the loss is measured as the excess of the carrying value of the property over the estimated fair value of the property and recorded in impairment losses in our consolidated statements of operations. 
  An allowance for a doubtful account for a receivable is established based on a periodic review of aged receivables resulting from estimated losses due to the inability of such tenant/operator/resident/guest to make required rent and other payments contractually due.  Additionally, we establish, on a current basis, an allowance for future lessee credit losses on unbilled rent receivable based on an evaluation of the collectability of such amounts. 
  Real Estate Debt Investments 
  Loans are considered impaired when based on current information and events, it is probable that we will not be able to collect principal and interest amounts due according to the contractual terms.  We assess the credit quality of the portfolio and adequacy of loan loss reserves on a quarterly basis or more frequently as necessary.  Significant judgment of management is required in this analysis.  We consider the estimated net recoverable value of the loan as well as other factors, including but not limited to the fair value of any collateral, the amount and the status of any senior debt, the quality and financial condition of the borrower and the competitive situation of the area where the underlying collateral is located.  Because this determination is based on projections of future economic events, which are inherently subjective, the amount ultimately realized may differ materially from the carrying value as of the balance sheet date.  If upon completion of the assessment, the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral is less than the net carrying value of the loan, a loan loss reserve is recorded with a corresponding charge to provision for loan losses.  The loan loss reserve for each loan is maintained at a level that is determined to be adequate by management to absorb probable losses. 
  Income recognition is suspended for a loan at the earlier of the date at which payments become 90-days past due or when, in the opinion of management, a full recovery of income and principal becomes doubtful.  When the ultimate collectability of the principal of an impaired loan is in doubt, all payments are applied to principal under the cost recovery method.  When the ultimate collectability  
  
   82 

     Table of Contents  

of the principal of an impaired loan is not in doubt, contractual interest is recorded as interest income when received, under the cash basis method until an accrual is resumed when the loan becomes contractually current and performance is demonstrated to be resumed.  A loan is written off when it is no longer realizable and/or legally discharged. 
  Investments in Unconsolidated Ventures 
  We review our investments in unconsolidated ventures for which we did not elect the fair value option on a quarterly basis, or more frequently as necessary, to assess whether there are any indicators that the value may be impaired or that its carrying value may not be recoverable.  An investment is considered impaired if the projected net recoverable amount over the expected holding period is less than the carrying value.  In conducting this review, we consider U.S. and global macroeconomic factors, including real estate sector conditions, together with investment specific and other factors.  To the extent an impairment has occurred and is considered to be other than temporary, the loss is measured as the excess of the carrying value of the investment over the estimated fair value and recorded in provision for loss on equity investment in our consolidated statements of operations. 
  Real Estate Securities 
  CRE securities for which the fair value option is elected are not evaluated for other-than-temporary impairment, or OTTI, as any change in fair value is recorded in our consolidated statements of operations.  Realized losses on such securities are reclassified to realized gain (loss) on investments and other as losses occur. 
  CRE securities for which the fair value option is not elected are evaluated for OTTI quarterly.  Impairment of a security is considered to be other-than-temporary when: (i) the holder has the intent to sell the impaired security; (ii) it is more likely than not the holder will be required to sell the security; or (iii) the holder does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost of the security.  When a CRE security has been deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired due to (i) or (ii), the security is written down to its fair value and an OTTI is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations.  In the case of (iii), the security is written down to its fair value and the amount of OTTI is then bifurcated into: (a) the amount related to expected credit losses; and (b) the amount related to fair value adjustments in excess of expected credit losses.  The portion of OTTI related to expected credit losses is recognized in our consolidated statements of operations.  The remaining OTTI related to the valuation adjustment is recognized as a component of accumulated OCI in our consolidated statements of equity.  The portion of OTTI recognized through earnings is accreted back to the amortized cost basis of the security through interest income, while amounts recognized through OCI are amortized over the life of the security with no impact on earnings.  CRE securities which are not high-credit quality are considered to have an OTTI if the security has an unrealized loss and there has been an adverse change in expected cash flow.  The amount of OTTI is then bifurcated as discussed above.

  Recent Accounting Pronouncements 
  In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued an accounting update requiring a company to recognize as revenue the amount of consideration it expects to be entitled to in connection with the transfer of promised goods or services to customers.  The accounting standard update will replace most of the existing revenue recognition guidance currently promulgated by U.S. GAAP.  In July 2015, the FASB decided to delay the effective date of the new revenue standard by one year.  The effective date of the new revenue standard for us will be January 1, 2018.  We are evaluating the impact, if any, of the update on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and financial statement disclosures. 
  In February 2015, the FASB issued updated guidance that changes the rules regarding consolidation.  The pronouncement eliminates specialized guidance for limited partnerships and similar legal entities and removes the indefinite deferral for certain investment funds.  The new guidance is effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted.  We adopted this guidance in the first quarter 2016 and determined our Operating Partnership is considered a VIE.  We are the primary beneficiary of the VIE, the VIE s assets can be used for purposes other than the settlement of the VIE s obligations and our partnership interest is considered a majority voting interest.  As such, this standard resulted in the identification of additional VIEs, however it did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. 
  In January 2016, the FASB issued an accounting update that addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments.  The new guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017.  We are evaluating the impact, if any, that this guidance will have on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and financial statement disclosures. 
  In February 2016, the FASB issued an accounting update that requires lessees to present right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet.  The new guidance is to be applied using a modified retrospective approach at the beginning of the earliest comparative period in the financial statements and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including  
  
   83 

     Table of Contents  

interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption is permitted.  We are evaluating the impact, if any, that this guidance will have on its consolidated financial position, results of operations and financial statement disclosures. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued guidance clarifying that an assessment of whether an embedded contingent put or call option is clearly and closely related to a borrowing requires only an analysis of the four-step decision sequence.  Additionally, entities are not required to separately assess whether the contingency itself is clearly and closely related.  Entities are required to apply the guidance to existing instruments in scope using a modified retrospective transition method as of the period of adoption.  The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those years.  Early adoption is permitted.  We are evaluating the impact, if any, that this guidance will have on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and financial statement disclosures. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued guidance which eliminates the requirement for an investor to retroactively apply the equity method when its increase in ownership interest (or degree of influence) in an investee triggers equity method accounting.  The update requires that the equity method investor add the cost of acquiring the additional interest in the investee to the current basis of the investor s previously held interest and adopt the equity method of accounting as of the date the investment become qualified for equity method accounting.  The update should be applied prospectively upon their effective date to increases in the level of ownership interests or degree of influence that results in the adoption of the equity method.  The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016 and interim periods within those fiscal years.  Early adoption is permitted.  We have concluded that this guidance will not have any impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and financial statement disclosures. 
  In March 2016, the FASB issued guidance which amends several aspects of the accounting for equity-based payment transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statements of cash flows.  The guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017.  We are evaluating the impact, if any, that this guidance will have on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and financial statement disclosures. 
  In June 2016, the FASB issued guidance which changes how entities will measure credit losses for most financial assets and certain other instruments that are not measured at fair value through net income.  Additionally, entities will have to disclose significantly more information, including information used to track credit quality by year of origination, for most financing receivables.  The new guidance is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2019.  Early adoption is permitted.  We are evaluating the impact, if any, that this guidance will have on our consolidated financial position, results of operations and financial statement disclosures. 
  In September 2016, the FASB issued final amendments to clarify how entities should classify certain cash receipts and cash payments in the consolidated statement of cash flows as they may have aspects of more than one class of cash flows.  The guidance is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017.  We are evaluating the impact, if any, that this guidance will have in our consolidated statement of cash flows.

Property and Other Revenues 
  Rental and Escalation Income 
  Rental and escalation income   decreased     $29.5 million  , primarily attributable to the loss of income from sales in 2016 of our Senior Housing Portfolio, certain of our multifamily properties and our Industrial Portfolio ($34.7 million) and lower income from net lease and healthcare properties ($0.7 million), offset by the acquisition of a portfolio of manufactured housing communities ($4.2 million) and higher income from our remaining portfolios of manufactured housing communities ($1.8 million), all in our real estate segment. 
  Hotel Related Income 
  Hotel related income   increased     $1.2 million   primarily related to acquisitions in 2015, offset by a decrease in operations in certain portfolios due to renovations and other, including a portfolio for which we recorded an impairment loss in the third quarter 2016, all in our real estate segment.

Liquidity and Capital Resources 
  We require capital to fund our operating expenses and investment activities.  Our capital sources may include cash flow from operations, net proceeds from asset repayments and sales, borrowings under credit facilities, financings secured by our assets such as mortgage notes, securitization financing transactions, long-term senior and subordinate corporate capital such as revolving credit facilities, senior term loans, senior notes, senior exchangeable notes, trust preferred securities, perpetual preferred stock and common stock.  For instance, we are currently exploring the sale of certain real estate, CRE debt and securities, and since the beginning of the fourth quarter 2015 through November 2016, assets sold or committed to sell totaled $6.6 billion, including an agreement to sell an interest in our healthcare portfolio, to generate liquidity. There is no assurance this transaction will close on the terms anticipated, if at all. 
  In addition, in connection with the NSAM Spin-off, we entered into a revolving credit agreement with NSAM pursuant to which we make available, on an  as available basis,  up to $250 million of financing to NSAM subject to certain conditions (refer to Related Party Arrangements).  The terms of the NSAM revolving credit facility contain various representations, warranties, covenants and conditions, including the condition that our obligation to advance proceeds to NSAM is dependent upon us and our affiliates having at least $100 million of either unrestricted cash and cash equivalents or amounts available under committed lines of credit, after taking into account the amount NSAM seeks to draw under the facility.  In addition, in connection with the NRE Spin-off, we provided NorthStar Europe with an initial capitalization of $250 million.   
  We seek to meet our long-term liquidity requirements, including the repayment of borrowings and our investment funding needs, through existing cash resources, issuance of debt or equity capital, return of capital from investments and the liquidation or refinancing of assets.  Nonetheless, our ability to meet a long-term (beyond one year) liquidity requirement may be subject to obtaining additional debt and equity financing.  Any decision by our lenders and investors to provide us with financing will depend upon a number of factors, such as our compliance with the terms of our existing credit arrangements, our financial performance, industry or market trends, the general availability of and rates applicable to financing transactions, such lenders  and investors  resources and policies concerning the terms under which they make capital commitments and the relative attractiveness of alternative investment or lending opportunities.   
  As a REIT, we are required to distribute at least 90% of our annual REIT taxable income to our stockholders, including taxable income where we do not receive corresponding cash, and we intend to distribute all or substantially all of our REIT taxable income in order to comply with the REIT distribution requirements of the Internal Revenue Code and to avoid federal income tax and the non-deductible excise tax.  On a quarterly basis, our board of directors determines an appropriate common stock dividend based upon numerous factors, including CAD, REIT qualification requirements, availability of existing cash balances, borrowing capacity under existing credit agreements, access to cash in the capital markets and other financing sources, our view of our ability to realize gains in the future through appreciation in the value of our assets, general economic conditions and economic conditions that more specifically impact our business or prospects.  Future dividend levels are subject to adjustment based upon our evaluation of the factors described above, as well as other factors that our board of directors may, from time-to-time, deem relevant to consider when determining an appropriate common stock dividend. 
  We currently believe that our existing sources of funds should be adequate for purposes of meeting our short-term liquidity needs.  Unrestricted cash as of November 4, 2016 was approximately $1.1 billion, which includes $205 million of proceeds to be received in the fourth quarter 2016 related to a sale of a portfolio of PE Investments. 
  Securitization Financing Transactions 
  We have historically demonstrated the ability to securitize our CRE debt investments and expect to continue to pursue similar transactions to finance our newly-originated debt investments that might initially be financed on our credit facilities.  In 2012 and 2013 we, and on behalf of NorthStar Income, entered into two securitization financing transactions with an aggregate $610 million of principal amount of bonds issued providing permanent, non-recourse, non-mark-to-market financing for CRE debt investments of ours and NorthStar Income s.  In January 2015, Securitization 2012-1 with $228 million principal amount of original bonds issued was repaid in full. 
  Corporate Borrowings 
  In August 2014, we entered into our Corporate Revolver with certain commercial bank lenders, with a total current amount of $250 million for a three year term.  Additionally, in September 2014, we entered into a corporate term arrangement with respect to the establishment of term borrowings.  In February 2016, our Corporate Revolver was repaid and we expect our remaining corporate recourse borrowings to be repaid from proceeds from sales initiatives.

Loan Facility 
  With respect to investment-level financing, we maintain a loan facility that provides up to $200 million to finance the origination of first mortgage loans and senior loan participations secured by commercial real estate.  The interest rate and advance rate depend on asset type and characteristic.  In March 2016, the maturity date for the facility was extended for one year with final maturity in March 2018.  In April 2016, our loan facility was repaid. 
  Our loan facility contains representations, warranties, covenants, conditions precedent to funding, events of default and indemnities that are customary for agreements of this type.  We are currently in compliance with all of our financial covenants under our loan facility. 
  Exchangeable Senior Notes 
  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we issued   0.2 million   shares of our common stockholders related to the conversion of exchangeable senior notes.  As of November 4, 2016, we had $29 million in principal amount of exchangeable senior notes outstanding. 
  Cash Flows 
  The following presents a summary of our consolidated statements of cash flows for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   and   2015   (dollars in thousands). 
  The consolidated cash flows for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   represents our cash flow following the NRE Spin-off on October 31, 2015.  The consolidated cash flows for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   includes cash flow attributable to revenues and expenses of NorthStar Europe recorded in discontinued operations. As a result, cash flows for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   may not be comparative to our cash flows reported for the prior period presented. 

Nine Months Ended     September 30, 2016   Compared to   September 30, 2015    
  Net cash provided by operating activities was   $258 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to   $388 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .  The decrease was primarily related to sales and repayments of investments in 2016. 
  Net cash provided by investing activities was $  1.1 billion   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to net cash used in investing activities of   $3.2 billion   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .  The primary investing activities for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   related to proceeds of sales and repayment of real estate, certain loans and securities and PE Investments.  The   nine months ended     September 30, 2015   primarily related to the acquisition of European real estate subsequently spun off as part of the NRE Spin-off. 
  Net cash used in financing activities was   $828 million   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016   compared to net cash provided by financing activities of   $2.9 billion   for the   nine months ended     September 30, 2015  .

Contractual Obligations and Commitments 
  As of September 30, 2016, we continue to be subject to the material contractual obligations and commitments referred to in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended   December 31, 2015  , with the exception of certain borrowings that have been repaid or future funding obligations disclosed in Note 5.  Investments in Private Equity Funds  and Note 8.  Borrowings  in Item 1.  Financial Statements.  
  Merger Related Arrangements and Other Costs 
  We entered into fee arrangements with service providers and advisors pursuant to which certain fees incurred by us in connection with the Mergers will become payable only if we consummate the Mergers.  We have and will incur other professional fees related to the Mergers.  There can be no assurances that we will complete this or any other transaction.  For the   nine months ended     September 30, 2016  , we recorded an aggregate of $10 million in transaction costs in our consolidated statements of operations.  To the extent the Mergers are consummated, we anticipate incurring a significant amount of additional costs. 
   
  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , we had off-balance sheet arrangements with respect to retained interests in certain deconsolidated N-Star CDOs.  Refer to Note 16.  Variable Interest Entities  in Item 1.  Financial Statements  for a discussion of such retained interests in such N-Star CDOs in our consolidated financial statements.  In each case, our exposure to loss is limited to the carrying value of our investment. 
  Additionally, we have certain arrangements which do not meet the definition of off-balance sheet arrangements, but do have some of the characteristics of off-balance sheet arrangements, including certain investments in unconsolidated ventures.  Refer to Note 5.  Investments in Private Equity Funds  and Note 6.  Investments in Unconsolidated Ventures  in Item 1.  Financial Statements  for a discussion of such unconsolidated ventures in our consolidated financial statements.  In each case, our exposure to loss is limited to the carrying value of our investment. 
   
  Related Party Arrangements 
  NorthStar Asset Management Group 
  Management Agreement 
  Upon completion of the NSAM Spin-off, we entered into a management agreement with an affiliate of NSAM for an initial term of   20   years, which automatically renews for additional   20  -year terms each anniversary thereafter unless earlier terminated.  As asset manager, NSAM is responsible for our day-to-day operations, subject to supervision and management of our board of directors.  Through its global network of subsidiaries and branch offices, NSAM performs services and engages in activities relating to, among other things, investments and financing, portfolio management and other administrative services, such as accounting and investor relations, to us and our subsidiaries other than our CRE loan origination business.  The management agreement with NSAM provides for a base management fee and incentive fee.  
  In connection with the NRE Spin-off, NorthStar Europe entered into a management agreement with NSAM with an initial term of   20   years on terms substantially consistent with the terms of our management agreement with NSAM.  Our management agreement with NSAM was amended and restated in connection with the NRE Spin-off to, among other things, adjust the annual base management fee and incentive fee hurdles for the NRE Spin-off.  Upon completion of the Mergers, the management agreement with NSAM will cease to exist. 
  Base Management Fee 
  For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we incurred   $47 million   and   $140 million  , respectively, related to the base management fee.  The base management fee to NSAM could increase subsequent to   September 30, 2016   by an amount equal to   1.5%   per annum of the sum of: 
             
    cumulative net proceeds of all future common equity and preferred equity issued by us; 
                
    equity issued by us in exchange or conversion of exchangeable notes based on the stock price at the date of issuance; 
                
    any other issuances by us of common equity, preferred equity or other forms of equity, including but not limited to limited partnership interests, or LTIP Units, in our Operating Partnership (excluding units issued to us and equity-based compensation, but including issuances related to an acquisition, investment, joint venture or partnership); and  
                
    cumulative CAD in excess of cumulative distributions paid on common stock, LTIP units or other equity awards beginning the first full calendar quarter after the NSAM Spin-off.  
     Additionally, our equity interest in RXR Realty and Aerium is structured so that NSAM is entitled to the portion of distributable cash flow from each investment in excess of the   $10 million   minimum annual base amount. 
  
   97 

     Table of Contents  

Incentive Fee 
  For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we did not incur an incentive fee.  The incentive fee is calculated and payable quarterly in arrears in cash, equal to:  
             
    the product of: (a) 15% and (b) our CAD before such incentive fee, divided by the weighted average shares outstanding for the calendar quarter, of any amount in excess of $0.68 per share and up to $0.78 per share, after giving effect to the Reverse Split and the NRE Spin-off, or the 15% Hurdle; plus  
                
    the product of: (a) 25% and (b) our CAD before such incentive fee, divided by the weighted average shares outstanding for the calendar quarter, of any amount in excess of $0.78 per share, after giving effect to the Reverse Split and the NRE Spin-off, or the 25% Hurdle;  
                
    multiplied by our weighted average shares outstanding for the calendar quarter. 
     In addition, NSAM may also earn an incentive fee from our healthcare investments in connection with NSAM s Healthcare Strategic Partnership (refer to below). 
  Weighted average shares represents the number of shares of our common stock, LTIP Units or other equity-based awards (with some exclusions), outstanding on a daily weighted average basis.  With respect to the base management fee, all equity issuances are allocated on a daily weighted average basis during the fiscal quarter of issuance.  With respect to the incentive fee, such amounts will be appropriately adjusted from time to time to take into account the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction. 
  Additional Management Agreement Terms 
  If we were to spin-off any asset or business in the future, such entity would be managed by NSAM on terms substantially similar to those set forth in the management agreement between us and NSAM.  The management agreement further provides that the aggregate base management fee in place immediately after any future spin-off will not be less than our aggregate base management fee in place immediately prior to such spin-off.  
  Our management agreement with NSAM provides that in the event of a change of control of NSAM or other event that could be deemed an assignment of the management agreement, we will consider such assignment in good faith and not unreasonably withhold, condition or delay our consent.  The management agreement further provides that we anticipate consent would be granted for an assignment or deemed assignment to a party with expertise in commercial real estate and over   $10 billion   of assets under management.  The management agreement also provides that, notwithstanding anything in the agreement to the contrary, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, rules and regulations, in connection with any merger, sale of all or substantially all of the assets, change of control, reorganization, consolidation or any similar transaction of us or NSAM, directly or indirectly, the surviving entity will succeed to the terms of the management agreement. 
  Payment of Costs and Expenses and Expense Allocation 
  We are responsible for all of our direct costs and expenses and reimburse NSAM for costs and expenses incurred by NSAM on our behalf.  In addition, NSAM may allocate indirect costs to us related to employees, occupancy and other general and administrative costs and expenses in accordance with the terms of, and subject to the limitations contained in, our management agreement with NSAM, or the G A Allocation.  Our management agreement with NSAM provides that the amount of the G A Allocation will not exceed the following: (i) 20% of the combined total of: (a) our and NorthStar Europe s, or the NorthStar Listed Companies , general and administrative expenses as reported in their consolidated financial statements excluding (1) equity-based compensation expense, (2) non-recurring items, (3) fees payable to NSAM under the terms of the applicable management agreement and (4) any allocation of expenses to the NorthStar Listed Companies, or NorthStar Listed Companies  G  and (b) NSAM s general and administrative expenses as reported in its consolidated financial statements, excluding equity-based compensation expense and adding back any costs or expenses allocated to any managed company of NSAM; less (ii) the NorthStar Listed Companies  G A.  The G A Allocation may include our allocable share of NSAM s compensation and benefit costs associated with dedicated or partially dedicated personnel who spend all or a portion of their time managing our affairs, based upon the percentage of time devoted by such personnel to our affairs.  The G A Allocation may also include rental and occupancy, technology, office supplies, travel and entertainment and other general and administrative costs and expenses, which may be allocated based on various methodologies, such as weighted average employee count or the percentage of time devoted by personnel to our affairs.  In addition, we will pay directly or reimburse NSAM for an allocable portion of any severance paid pursuant to any employment, consulting or similar service agreements in effect between NSAM and any of its executives, employees or other service providers. 
  In connection with the NRE Spin-off and the related agreements, the NorthStar Listed Companies  obligations to reimburse NSAM for the G A Allocation and any severance are shared among the NorthStar Listed Companies, at NSAM s discretion, and the 20% cap on the G A Allocation, as described above, applies on an aggregate basis to the NorthStar Listed Companies.  NSAM currently determined to allocate these amounts based on assets under management.

For the   three months ended   September 30, 2016, NSAM did not allocate any expenses to us. For the nine months ended   September 30, 2016  , NSAM allocated $  0.4   million to us. 
  In addition, we, together with NorthStar Europe and any company spun-off from us or NorthStar Europe, will pay directly or reimburse NSAM for up to   50%   of any long-term bonus or other compensation that NSAM s compensation committee determines shall be paid and/or settled in the form of equity and/or equity-based compensation to executives, employees and service providers of NSAM during any year.  Subject to this limitation and limitations contained in any applicable management agreement between NSAM and NorthStar Europe or any company spun-off from us or NorthStar Europe, the amount paid by us, NorthStar Europe and any company spun-off from us or NorthStar Europe will be determined by NSAM in its discretion.  At the discretion of NSAM s compensation committee, this compensation may be granted in shares of our restricted stock, restricted stock units, LTIP Units or other forms of equity compensation or stock-based awards; provided that if at any time a sufficient number of shares of our common stock are not available for issuance under our equity compensation plan, such compensation shall be paid in the form of restricted stock units, or RSUs, LTIP Units or other securities that may be settled in cash.  Our equity compensation for each year may be allocated on an individual-by-individual basis at the discretion of the NSAM compensation committee and, as long as the aggregate amount of the equity compensation for such year does not exceed the limits set forth in the management agreement, the proportion of any particular individual s equity compensation may be greater or less than   50%  . 
  In connection with the above obligation, we were responsible for paying approximately   50%   of the 2015 and 2014 long-term bonuses earned under the NorthStar Asset Management Group Inc.  Executive Incentive Bonus Plan, or NSAM Bonus Plan.  Long-term bonuses were paid to executives in the form of equity-based awards of both us and NSAM, subject to performance-based and time-based vesting conditions over the four-year performance period from January 1, 2014 through December 31, 2017.  The long-term bonuses paid in the form of equity-based awards of ours were adjusted for the NRE Spin-off and Reverse Split in the same manner as all other equity-based awards of ours. 
  Investment Opportunities 
  Under the management agreement, we agreed to make available to NSAM for the benefit of NSAM and its managed companies, including us, all investment opportunities that we source.  NSAM agreed to fairly allocate such opportunities among NSAM s managed companies, including us, and NSAM in accordance with an investment allocation policy.  Pursuant to the management agreement, we are entitled to fair and reasonable compensation for our services in connection with any loan origination opportunities sourced by us, which may include first mortgage loans, subordinate mortgage interests, mezzanine loans and preferred equity interests, in each case relating to commercial real estate.  For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we earned   $0.4 million   and   $0.8 million   from NSAM for services in connection with loan origination opportunities. 
  NSAM provides services with regard to such areas as payroll, human resources and employee benefits, financial systems management, treasury and cash management, accounts payable services, telecommunications services, information technology services, property management services, legal and accounting services and various other corporate services to us as it relates to our loan origination business for CRE debt. 
  Credit Agreement 
  In connection with the NSAM Spin-off, we entered into a revolving credit agreement with NSAM pursuant to which we make available to NSAM, on an  as available basis,  up to   $250 million   of financing with a maturity of   June 30, 2019   at LIBOR plus   3.50%  .  The revolving credit facility is unsecured.  The terms of the revolving credit facility contain various representations, warranties, covenants and conditions, including the condition that our obligation to advance proceeds to NSAM is dependent upon us and its affiliates having at least   $100 million   of either unrestricted cash and cash equivalents or amounts available under committed lines of credit, after taking into account the amount NSAM seeks to draw under the facility.  As of   September 30, 2016  , we have not funded any amounts to NSAM in connection with this agreement.  
  Healthcare Strategic Joint Venture 
  In January 2014, NSAM entered into a long-term strategic partnership with James F. Flaherty III, former Chief Executive Officer of HCP, Inc., focused on expanding our healthcare business into a preeminent healthcare platform, or the Healthcare Strategic Partnership.  In connection with the partnership, Mr. Flaherty oversees both our healthcare real estate portfolio and the portfolio of NorthStar Healthcare.  In connection with entering into the partnership, we granted Mr. Flaherty certain RSUs (refer to Note 10.  Equity-Based Compensation  in Item 1.  Financial Statements ).  The Healthcare Strategic Partnership is entitled to incentive fees ranging from   20%   to   25%   above certain hurdles for new and existing healthcare real estate investments held by us.  For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we did not incur any incentive fees related to the Healthcare Strategic Partnership. 
  NSAM Retail Companies 
  We committed to purchase up to $10 million in shares of each of NSAM s Retail Companies  common stock during the period from when each offering was declared effective through the end of their respective offering period, in the event that NSAM Retail Companies  distributions to its stockholders, on a quarterly basis, exceed certain measures of operating performance.

In addition, pursuant to the management agreement with NSAM, we committed up to $10 million to invest as distribution support consistent with past practice in each future public non-traded NSAM Retail Company, up to a total of five new companies per year.  The following table summarizes our total shares purchased of each NSAM Retail Company as part of our current obligation under the distribution support agreement and our remaining obligations as of   September 30, 2016   (dollars in millions):

In March 2016, we invested $2 million of seed capital into NorthStar Capital Fund.  In May 2016, NorthStar Capital Fund was declared effective by the SEC and expects to begin raising capital from third parties in the first half 2017.   
              (4) 
    We currently consolidate the company based on our majority voting interest in the entity.  
              (5) 
    We expect Colony NorthStar to continue the distribution support obligations following the closing of the Mergers. 
     N-Star CDOs 
  We earn certain collateral management fees from the N-Star CDOs primarily for administrative services.  For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we earned   $1 million   and $2 million in fee income, respectively, of which   $0.2 million   and $0.5 million, respectively, were eliminated in consolidation.  
  Additionally, we earn interest income from the N-Star CDO bonds and N-Star CDO equity in deconsolidated N-Star CDOs.  For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016  , we earned $  13   million and $36 million, respectively, of interest income from such investments related to deconsolidated N-Star CDOs.

Island provides certain asset management, property management and other services to us to assist in managing our hotel properties.  Island receives a base management fee of   2.5%   to   3.0%   of the current monthly revenue of our hotel properties it manages for us.  For the   three and nine   months ended   September 30, 2016   we incurred   $5 million   and   $14   million, respectively, of base property management and other fees to Island.

    In February 2016, we sold substantially all of our 70% interest in PE Investment II to the existing owners of the remaining 30% interest, one a third party which purchased approximately 80% of the interest sold and the other NorthStar Income  
     
   100 

     Table of Contents  

which purchased the other approximate 20% of the interest sold.  NorthStar Income paid   $37   million for its respective interest.  As part of the transaction, both buyers assumed the deferred purchase price obligation, on a pro rata basis, of the PE Investment II joint venture. 
             
    In February 2016, we sold a 49% interest in one loan with a total principal amount of $40 million to a third party, at par, with the remaining 51% interest sold to NorthStar Income II, also at par. 
                
    In February 2016, we sold one CRE security with a carrying value of $13 million to NorthStar Income II. 
                
    In March 2016, we sold our 60% interest in the Senior Housing Portfolio to NorthStar Healthcare, which owned the remaining 40% interest, for $535 million.  NorthStar Healthcare assumed our portion of the $648 million of related mortgage financing and we received approximately $150 million of proceeds, net of sales costs. 
                
    In September 2016, we sold a portfolio of PE Investments to NorthStar Income II for a gross sales price of $318 million with $45 million of deferred purchase price assumed as part of the transaction, including $6 million of deferred purchase price which was the obligation of an unconsolidated joint venture. We received $34 million of net proceeds and will receive the remaining $205 million of net proceeds in the fourth quarter 2016.  
                
    In connection with the redemption of our interest in the Industrial Portfolio, the third party equity obtained a preferred loan of $98 million from NorthStar Income II to finance the transaction. 
     The board of directors of each NSAM Retail Company, including all of the independent directors, approved each of the respective transactions, with the exception of the Industrial Portfolio which did not warrant board approval, after considering, among other matters, third-party pricing support. 
   
  Recent Developments 
  Dividends 
  On   November 1, 2016  , we declared a dividend of   $0.40   per share of common stock.  The common stock dividend will be paid on   November 18, 2016   to stockholders of record as of the close of business on   November 14, 2016  .  On   October 27, 2016  , we declared a dividend of   $0.54688   per share of Series A preferred stock,   $0.51563   per share of Series B preferred stock,   $0.55469   per share of Series C preferred stock,   $0.53125   per share of Series D Preferred Stock and   $0.54688   per share of Series E Preferred Stock.  Dividends will be paid on all series of preferred stock on   November 15, 2016   to stockholders of record as of the close of business on   November 7, 2016  . 
  Colony NorthStar Registration Statement 
  In October 2016, we amended the merger agreement and provided for, among other matters, an enhanced governance structure for Colony NorthStar, modified severance terms for NSAM s executive officers and a special cash dividend for NSAM s stockholders now totaling $228 million.  In connection with the amendment to the merger agreement, we entered into a voting agreement with MSD and its affiliates, which together own approximately 10.2% of NSAM s outstanding shares, pursuant to which MSD agreed to vote in favor of the Mergers and related proposals.  In addition, Colony NorthStar, a Maryland subsidiary of NSAM that will be the surviving parent company of the combined company, filed with the SEC an amended registration statement on Form S-4 that includes a joint proxy statement of NorthStar Realty, Colony and NSAM and that also constitutes a prospectus of Colony NorthStar. 
   
  Inflation 
  Virtually all of our assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive in nature.  As a result, interest rates and other factors influence our performance significantly more than inflation does.  A change in interest rates may correlate with inflation rates.  Substantially all of the leases at our manufactured housing communities and multifamily properties allow for monthly or annual rent increases which provide us with the opportunity to achieve increases, where justified by the market, as each lease matures.  Such types of leases generally minimize the risks of inflation on our manufactured housing communities and multifamily properties.  Refer to Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk  for additional details.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures 
  We use CAD and NOI, each a non-GAAP measure, to evaluate our profitability. 
  Cash Available for Distribution 
  We believe that CAD provides investors and management with a meaningful indicator of operating performance.  We also believe that CAD is useful because it adjusts for a variety of items that are consistent with presenting a measure of operating performance (such as transaction costs, N-Star CDO equity interests, depreciation and amortization, equity-based compensation, realized gain (loss) on investments, provision for loan losses, asset impairment, non-recurring bad debt expense and certain interest income and expense items).  We adjust for transaction costs because these costs are not a meaningful indicator of our operating performance.  For instance, these transaction costs include costs such as professional fees associated with new investments or restructuring of investments, which are expenses related to specific transactions.  We adjust for N-Star CDO equity interests to represent the net economic interest generated from the N-Star CDO equity interests.  This adjustment is a component of our ongoing return on such investments, and therefore, is adjusted in CAD as it provides investors and management with a meaningful indicator of our operating performance.  Furthermore, CAD adjusts N-Star CDO bond discounts to record such investments on an effective yield basis over the expected weighted average life of the investment.  N-Star CDO bond discounts relates to repurchased CDO bonds of consolidated CDO financing transactions at a discount to par.  These CDO bonds typically have a low interest rate and the majority of the return is generated from repurchasing the CDO bonds at a discount to expected recovery value.  Because the return generated through the accretion of the discount is a meaningful contributor to our operating performance, such accretion is adjusted in CAD.  The computation for the accretion of the discount under U.S. GAAP and CAD is the same.  However, for CDO financing transactions that are consolidated under U.S. GAAP, the CDO bonds are not presented as an investment but rather are eliminated in our consolidated financial statements.  In addition, we adjust for distributions and adjustments to joint venture partners, which represent the net return generated from our investments allocated to our non-controlling interests.  For our owned hotels, our CAD calculation does not make an adjustment for furniture, fixtures and equipment (FF E) reserves.  CAD may fluctuate from period to period based upon a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the timing and amount of investments, repayments and asset sales, capital raised, use of leverage, changes in the expected yield of investments and the overall conditions in commercial real estate and the economy generally.  Management also believes that quarterly distributions are principally based on operating performance and our board of directors includes CAD as one of several metrics it reviews to determine quarterly distributions to stockholders. 
  We calculate CAD by subtracting from or adding to net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders, non-controlling interests and the following items: depreciation and amortization items including straight-line rental income or expense, amortization of above/below market leases, amortization of deferred financing costs, amortization of discount on financings and other and equity-based compensation; net economic interest generated from N-Star CDO equity interests; accretion of consolidated N-Star CDO bond discounts; net interest income in consolidated N-Star CDOs; unrealized gain (loss) from the change in fair value; realized gain (loss) on investments and other, excluding accelerated amortization related to sales of CDO bonds or other investments; provision for loan losses, net; impairment on depreciable property; non-recurring bad debt expense; acquisition gains or losses; distributions and adjustments related to joint venture partners; transaction costs; foreign currency gains (losses); impairment on goodwill and other intangible assets; and one-time events pursuant to changes in U.S. GAAP and certain other non-recurring items.  
  CAD should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders, determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as an indicator of operating performance.  In addition, our methodology for calculating CAD involves subjective judgment and discretion and may differ from the methodologies used by other comparable companies, including other REITs, when calculating the same or similar supplemental financial measures and may not be comparable with these companies. 
  The following table presents a reconciliation of CAD to net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders for the   three months ended     September 30, 2016   (dollars in thousands):

    Represents an adjustment to exclude depreciation and amortization of $84.9 million (including $0.2 million related to unconsolidated ventures), straight-line rental income of $(7.6) million, amortization of above/below market leases of $1.5 million, amortization of deferred financing costs of $12.7 million, amortization of discount on financings and other of $0.5 million and amortization of equity-based compensation of $5.9 million.  
              (2) 
    For CAD, discounts expected to be realized on N-Star CDO bonds for consolidated CDOs are accreted on an effective yield basis based on expected maturity.  For deconsolidated N-Star CDOs, N-Star CDO bond accretion is already included in net income attributable to common stockholders.   
              (3) 
    Represents an adjustment to exclude a $4.4 million net gain related to the sale of real estate investments, a $(0.4) million loss related to the foreclosure of real estate, $(5.4) million non-cash loss related to securities in our consolidated CDOs, $(1.3) million loss related to the sale of manufactured homes, $0.5 million of other real estate gains and includes a $3.1 million gain related to acceleration of discount and fees.  
              (4) 
    Represents an adjustment to exclude $70.4 million of impairment, $3.6 million of transaction costs and include $2.5 million related to N-Star CDO equity interests.  
     Net Operating Income (NOI) 
  We believe NOI is a useful metric of the operating performance of our real estate portfolio in the aggregate.  Portfolio results and performance metrics represent 100% for all consolidated investments and represent our ownership percentage for unconsolidated joint ventures.  Net operating income represents total property and related revenues, adjusted for: (i) amortization of above/below market rent; (ii) straight line rent; (iii) other items such as adjustments related to joint ventures and non-recurring bad debt expense; and (iv) less property operating expenses.  However, the usefulness of NOI is limited because it excludes general and administrative costs, interest expense, transaction costs, depreciation and amortization expense, realized gains (losses) from the sale of properties and other items under U.S. GAAP and capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of properties, all of which may be significant economic costs.  NOI may fail to capture significant trends in these components of U.S. GAAP net income (loss) which further limits its usefulness. 
  NOI should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss), determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as an indicator of operating performance.  In addition, our methodology for calculating NOI involves subjective judgment and discretion and may differ from the methodologies used by other comparable companies, including other REITs, when calculating the same or similar supplemental financial measures and may not be comparable with these companies.The following table presents a reconciliation of NOI to property and other related revenues less property operating expenses for our property types in our real estate segment for the   three months ended September 30, 2016   (dollars in thousands):

Item 3.  Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 
  We are primarily subject to interest rate risk and credit risk.  These risks are dependent on various factors beyond our control, including monetary and fiscal policies, domestic and international economic conditions and political considerations.  Our market risk sensitive assets, liabilities and related derivative positions are held for investment and not for trading purposes. 
  Interest Rate Risk 
  Changes in interest rates affect our net income, which is the difference between the income earned on our investments and the interest expense incurred in connection with our borrowings and derivatives. 
  Our general financing strategy has focused on the use of  match-funded  structures.  This means that we seek to align the maturities of our liabilities with the maturities on our assets as closely as possible in order to manage the risks of being forced to refinance our liabilities prior to the maturities of our assets.  Substantially all of our investments are financed with non-recourse mortgage notes.  In addition, we seek to match the interest rate on our assets with like-kind borrowings, so fixed-rate investments are financed with fixed-rate borrowings and floating-rate assets are financed with floating-rate borrowings, directly or indirectly, through the use of interest rate swaps, caps and other financial instruments or through a combination of these strategies.  For longer duration, relatively stable investment real estate cash flows such as those derived from net lease assets, we tend to use fixed rate financing.  For real estate cash flows with greater growth potential such as hotels and healthcare under a RIDEA structure, we tend to use floating rate financing which provides prepayment flexibility and may provide a better match between underlying cash flow projections and potential increases in interest rates.   
  Our CRE debt and securities investments bear interest at either a floating or fixed rate.  The interest rate on our floating-rate assets is a fixed spread over an index such as LIBOR and typically reprices every 30 days based on LIBOR in effect at the time.  Given the frequent and periodic repricing of our floating-rate assets, changes in benchmark interest rates are unlikely to materially affect the value of our floating-rate portfolio.  Changes in short-term rates will, however, affect income from these investments.  However, certain of our CRE debt originations have LIBOR floors that are in excess of current LIBOR.  We will not benefit from an increase in LIBOR until it is in excess of the floors. 
  As of   September 30, 2016  , a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in one-month LIBOR or the applicable index applied to our floating-rate assets and liabilities (and related derivatives) would result in a decrease in net income of approximately $  44   million annually, of which $  30   million of the change is attributable to floating rate financing of hotel and healthcare operating real estate and does not reflect the potential increase in cash flow associated with economic growth that may be typical in a rising interest rate environment. 
  A change in interest rates could affect the value of our fixed-rate CRE debt and securities investments and our real estate investments.  For example, increasing interest rates could result in a higher required yield on investments, which could decrease the value on existing fixed-rate investments in order to adjust their yields to current market levels.  In addition, the value of our real estate properties may be influenced by changes in interest rates and credit spreads (as discussed below) because value is typically derived by discounting expected future cash flow generated by the property using interest rates (such as the 10-year U.S. Treasury Note yield) plus a risk premium based on the property type and creditworthiness of the tenants/operators.  A lower risk-free rate generally results in a lower discount rate and, therefore, a higher valuation, and vice versa; however, an increase in the risk-free rate would not impact our net income. 
  A change in the interest rate and credit spread may also impact our net book value as CRE securities are marked-to-market each quarter with any change in fair value reflected in unrealized gains (losses) or OCI.  Generally, as interest rates increase, the value of fixed-rate securities within our CDO financing transaction, such as CMBS, decreases and as interest rates decrease, the value of these securities will increase.  A change in unrealized gains (losses) do not directly affect our operating cash flow or our ability to pay a dividend to stockholders. 
  We use derivative instruments to manage interest rate exposure.  These derivatives are typically in the form of interest rate swap or cap agreements and the primary objective is to minimize interest rate risks associated with our investments and financing activities.  The counterparties of these arrangements are major financial institutions with which we may also have other financial relationships.  We are exposed to credit risk in the event of non-performance by these counterparties and we monitor their financial condition.  For example, in June 2015 we entered into a $2 billion notional 10-year fixed interest rate swap in order to seek to hedge against future refinancing costs of certain of our mortgage borrowings.  This swap is currently materially out of the money and we have posted   $99 million   of margin as of November 7, 2016 for the benefit of our counterparty and may be subject to future margin calls.  If an early termination event occurs now with respect to this swap, which could be triggered by a change of control or similar merger transaction, in addition to losing the margin we have posted we would currently be required to pay approximately   $160 million   to our counterparty.  As of   September 30, 2016  , our counterparties do not hold any cash margin as collateral against our remaining derivative contracts.  As of   September 30, 2016  , none of our derivatives qualify for hedge accounting treatment, therefore, gains (losses) resulting from their fair value measurement at the end of each reporting period are recognized as an increase or decrease in unrealized gain (loss) on investments and other in our consolidated statements of operations.  In addition,  
  
   105 

     Table of Contents  

we are, and may in the future be, subject to additional expense based on the notional amount of the derivative and a specified spread over the applicable LIBOR.  Because the fair value of these instruments can vary significantly between periods, we may experience significant fluctuations in the amount of our unrealized gain (loss) in any given period.  As of   September 30, 2016  , a hypothetical 100 basis point increase (decrease) in the 10-year treasury forward curve applied to our interest rate swap would result in an unrealized gain (loss) of approximately   $172 million  . 
  Credit Spread Risk 
  The value of our fixed and floating-rate investments also changes with market credit spreads.  This means that when market-demanded risk premium, or credit spread, increases, the value of our fixed- and floating-rate assets decrease and vice versa.  Fixed-rate assets are valued based on a market credit spread over the rate payable on fixed rate U.S. Treasury of like maturity.  This means that their value is dependent on the yield demanded on such assets by the market, based on their credit relative to U.S. Treasuries.  Floating-rate CRE debt and securities investments are valued based on a market credit spread over the applicable LIBOR.  Demand for a higher yield on investments results in higher or  wider  spread over the benchmark rate (usually the applicable U.S. Treasury yield) to value these assets.  Under these conditions, the value of our portfolio should decrease.  Conversely, if the spread used to value these assets were to decrease or  tighten,  the value of these assets should increase. 
  Credit Risk 
  We are subject to the credit risk of the tenant/operators of our properties.  We seek to undertake a rigorous credit evaluation of each tenant and healthcare operator prior to acquiring properties.  This analysis includes an extensive due diligence investigation of the tenant/operator s business as well as an assessment of the strategic importance of the underlying real estate to the tenant/operator s core business operations.  Where appropriate, we may seek to augment the tenant/operator s commitment to the facility by structuring various credit enhancement mechanisms into the underlying leases.  These mechanisms could include security deposit requirements or guarantees from entities we deem creditworthy.  In addition, we actively monitor lease coverage at each facility within our healthcare portfolio. 
  Credit risk in our CRE debt and securities investments relates to each individual borrower s ability to make required interest and principal payments on scheduled due dates.  We seek to manage credit risk through a comprehensive credit analysis prior to making an investment, actively monitoring our portfolio and the underlying credit quality, including subordination and diversification of our portfolio.  Our analysis is based on a broad range of real estate, financial, economic and borrower-related factors which we believe are critical to the evaluation of credit risk inherent in a transaction. 
  Our CRE debt investments are collateral dependent, meaning the principal source of repayment is from a sale or refinancing of the collateral securing our debt.  In the event that a borrower cannot repay our debt, we may exercise our remedies under the debt agreements, which may include taking title to collateral.  We describe many of the options available to us in this situation in the  Portfolio Management  section in Part I, Item 1.  Business.  of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended   December 31, 2015  .  To the extent the value of the collateral underlying a CRE debt investment exceeds the carrying value of the investment (including all debt senior to us) and the expense we incur in collecting the debt, we would collect 100% of our investment.  To the extent the carrying value of our CRE debt investment plus all senior debt to our position exceeds the realizable value to our collateral (net of expenses), then we would incur a loss.  CMBS investments are generally junior in right of payment of interest and principal to one or more senior classes but benefit from the support of one or more subordinate classes of securities or other form of credit support within a securitization transaction.

  I, Jonathan A. Langer, certify that: 
    
           1. 
    I have reviewed this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q of NorthStar Realty Finance Corp.; 
              2. 
    Based on my knowledge, this report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading with respect to the  period covered by this report;  
              3. 
    Based on my knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this report, fairly present in all material respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented in this report; 
              4. 
    The registrant s other certifying officer(s) and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) and internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) for the registrant and have: 
              (a) 
    Designed such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision, to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to us by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which this report is being prepared; 
              (b) 
    Designed such internal control over financial reporting, or caused such internal control over financial reporting to be designed under our supervision, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; 
              (c) 
    Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based on such evaluation; and 
              (d) 
    Disclosed in this report any change in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant s most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant s fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant s internal control over financial reporting; and 
              5. 
    The registrant s other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial reporting, to the registrant s auditors and the audit committee of the registrant s board of directors (or persons performing the equivalent functions): 
              (a) 
    All significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and 
              (b) 
    Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant s internal control over financial reporting.
